A timely, relevant and engaging editorial! This article brilliantly puts the case forward for
embracing the SDGs, and for health services (both in UK and internationally) to address
sustainability, integration and climate change. As a health systems integration
specialist/researcher, I see this editorial set to encourage researches to adopt a broader
framework that considers "environmental sustainability as part of the good health and
care."
My only recommendation is to connect Table 1 to the main article in an effective manner.
Currently - See Table 1 - is listed under "Fifthly, hospitals...." Maybe a more

comprehensive table that covers all points will be a useful framework for future work, and
helpful for many ECRs/MCRs, as well as more established researchers.
