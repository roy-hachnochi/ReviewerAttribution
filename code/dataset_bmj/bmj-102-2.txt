This article explores the impact of the 2003 ACGME reform on the quality of care. It is very
well-written and the methodology clearly described. The authors show that the reform had
no significant impact of three outcomes of the quality of care: 30-day mortality from date
of hospital admission, 30-day readmission from date of hospital discharge, and overall
Medicare Part B spending for a given hospitalization. The authors run
difference-in-difference (DD) analyses to explore the presence of trend differences.
Overall, I find the methods and results convincing. The key assumption for a DD strategy is
that the outcome in treatment and control group follow the same time trend in the absence
of the treatment. That assumption is fulfilled with the figures provided by the authors. My
general opinion of this article is very positive.
Please find below a list of suggestions for improvement:
•
As underlined in prior work (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan, 2004),
conventional standard errors often severely understate the standard deviation of the
estimators in DD analyses. The authors clustered their standard errors at the hospital
level, which is a convincing strategy to overcome that issue. However, (as a robustness
check) did you also explore the opportunity to perform a block bootstrapping of standard
errors as suggest in Bertrand et al.?
•
The spending results are not significant, although very close to the 5% threshold.
This could be explained by the fact that the outcome distribution is very skewed, reducing
the performance of the linear regressions. When working on health care spending analyses,
it is common practice to log-transform the dependent variable or to use generalized linear

models (GLM), with log links and gamma distributions. Did you explore the robustness of
your results under both approaches?
•
If I am not wrong, some variables have been used in prior Medicare data research
to capture patients’ performance status (such as for instance oxygen use among the
patients prior to admission). It would be interesting to check whether the proportion of
patients with low performance status was the same in both treatment and control groups,
as those patients are potentially more difficult to handle.
•
Could the authors’ results be explained by the fact that the senior residents had to
put additional efforts after the reform to compensate junior residents’ lack of preparation?
For instance, could the authors explore whether the volume of care provided by the senior
residents increased after the reform?
