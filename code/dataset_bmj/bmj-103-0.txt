This is an excellent, carefully designed and executed study, focused on the very important topic of
identifying the safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy.
1. The authors clearly document the problem:
"In addition to directly protecting pregnant women, vaccine-derived maternal antibodies cross the
placenta21–24 and confer passive immunity to infants during the first months of life.21,22,25,26 Since
infants under six months of age have the highest burden of pediatric influenza-associated morbidity and
mortality27–29 but influenza vaccines are not licensed for use in this group,30 immunization during
pregnancy is an important strategy for protecting young infants from influenza infection.
Although there is now substantial evidence supporting safety of maternal influenza immunization with
respect to birth outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, congenital anomalies),38–43 few studies have assessed
pediatric health outcomes beyond the first six months of life.44–48 The lack of information on
longer-term health outcomes in children following influenza vaccination during pregnancy has been
identified as a potential barrier to achieving higher uptake."
2. The authors describe the excluded subjects:
"We excluded infants whose birth registry record could not be linked to the administrative databases,
those born to women who were not continuously eligible to receive health care in Ontario during
pregnancy, and those records with data quality issues (e.g., duplicates, invalid date of birth). We also
excluded infants whose records were missing information on 2009 pH1N1 influenza vaccination during
pregnancy,"
3. This resulted in substantial numbers of exclusions and a clearer description of the effect of these
exclusions would be helpful in dispelling reservations by readers:
"we restricted the study population to infants with at least two well-baby visits or primary immunization
visits in the first year of life to ensure the child was accessing the health care system. Of 139 087 live
births in the birth registry that were initially eligible, 2170 (1.6%) could not be linked with administrative
databases and 19 511 (14%) were excluded for administrative reasons. Of the 117 406 remaining, 13
096 (11%) were excluded for missing information on 2009 pH1N1 vaccination during pregnancy as were
61 infants (<1%) who died on their date of birth, leaving 104 249 live births in our final study
population (Figure 1). A total of 31 295 children (30%) were born to women vaccinated against 2009
pH1N1 influenza during pregnancy."

4. The authors describe how they needed to construct their outcome measures. However, can the
authors please provide data on the biology of which pediatric systems are affected by influenza? Do
vision, hearing and "complex problems" include developmental problems which would be a key area of
interest to parents and physicians?
"Although a consensus list of standardized case definitions has been developed for monitoring obstetric
and neonatal outcomes following immunization during pregnancy,52–54 no such guidance exists for
evaluation of longer-term pediatric health outcomes. Thus, we selected specific individual pediatric
health outcomes (i.e., immune-related outcomes including infectious and atopic diseases; neoplasms;
sensory disorders) as well as non-specific composite outcomes (i.e., urgent and in-patient health
services utilization; pediatric complex chronic diseases) for evaluation. Infectious disease outcomes
included upper and lower respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, otitis media, and a
composite of these four categories of infections. Sensory disorders included vision and hearing loss
combined."
5. The authors describe their construction of propensity scores. A discussion of the %s of missing data
for individual measures would be helpful (e.g. absence of data on smoking and drug usage during
pregnancy):
"Prior to running the propensity score models, we used multiple imputation to address missing values for
covariates (7% of records had missing information for one or more covariates we intended to include in
the propensity score). The following pre-selected covariates from the birth registry were included in the
propensity score models, which were developed using each of the 10 multiple imputation datasets:
maternal age, parity, maternal smoking, conception season, antenatal care provider, maternal
pre-existing medical comorbidity, obstetrical complications, use of antenatal steroids, maternal
prescription drug use, maternal herbal remedy use, multifetal gestation, neighbourhood income quintile,
rural residence and public health unit."
6. The authors describe needed corrections to the data. Did you apply Bonferroni corrections to other
outcome measures?
"In the unweighted study population, vaccinated women were more likely to be over 30 years of age and
live in the highest neighbourhood income quintile. ... Additional adjustment for maternal propensity to
access health care prior to pregnancy also had negligible impact on these point estimates. Using a
Bonferroni correction to account for multiplicity the association with asthma was no longer statistically
significant (aHR 1.05, 95% CI 0.995 to 1.11); however, the inverse association with gastrointestinal
infections persisted (aIRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.998)."
Overall in excellent study and clarification of the above database issues would be helpful.
