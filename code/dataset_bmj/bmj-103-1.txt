This large population-based study supports earlier findings that influenza vaccination during pregnancy
is not associated with negative health findings. It also adds new knowledge concerning the long-term
health outcomes.The study is well presented and although residual confounding cannot be excluded the
data seems to be solid.
There are a few points that the authors should consider/comment:
- The most important negative health finding is death. Why is not mortality included in this study? There
is at least one prior study addressing mortality in children born to mothers vaccinated with A(H1N1) in
Sweden, up to 4 years after birth (Ludvigsson et al BMJ 2015;351:h5585).
- Which A(H1N1)-vaccine/vaccines were used? If more than one was used - can data be separated for
each vaccine?
- Child day care and adherence to the national child vaccination programme are most likely important
covariates, why are these not included?
- In about 15 000 children (11%) data could not be linked or vaccination data was missing. In what way
could this have had an effect on the results?
