The authors demonstrated in this long-term, population-based, retrospective cohort study
that type 1 diabetic patients with HbA1c levels <6.5% during follow-up showed a similar
risk for retinopathy or nephropathy, but a higher risk for severe hypoglycemia as
compared with those with HbA1c levels 6.5-6.9% during follow-up. The findings are very
interesting and informative. However, the following questions should be addressed.
1. All nonstandard abbreviations in the text must be defined immediately after the first use
of the abbreviation.
2. It should be mentioned in detail how HbA1c AUC was calculated.
3. For easy understanding, HbA1c levels may be expressed using the conventional unit (%)
alone.
4. Please explain the rationale of HbA1c categories in the analysis and why the authors
chose HbA1c categories 7.5-8.6 and >8.6% instead of 7.5-8.4 and >8.5%.
5. The classifications of retinopathy should be described in more detail to avoid confusion.
6. For easy understanding, Fig 1 may be divided into two figures for retinopathy and
nephropathy, respectively.
