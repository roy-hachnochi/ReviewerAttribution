1. Page 2, Lines 6 – 8: Consider changing the wording to: “The associations of
consumption of dairy foods with risk of mortality have been inconsistent across previous
studies.”
2. Page 2, Lines 40 – 45: This statement seems quite a stretch to me. It is based on
statistical significance in an extremely large study with the power to detect “clinically
insignificant” findings. All of the values referred to in the statement are quite close to the

null value. Yet, some of the point estimates for associations of whole milk intake with
CVD- (and total-), but not all-cancer mortality, are both relatively substantial and
statistically significant, but are not commented on.
3. Page 3, Lines 6 – 8: I think that this statement needs to be toned down. For example,
change ‘likely’ to ‘may’.
4. In the Results section, there is too much verbatim repetition of what can be seen in the
tables. For example, on page 10, lines 31 – 38, the HRs and 95% CIs are repeated. All
the HRs are quite close to null, and only one—despite the very modest point estimate in
this large study—is statistically significant. The authors could substitute language such as
“All risk estimates were close to null and not statistically significant, except that those in
the fifth relative to the first quintile were at an estimated statistically significant 6% higher
risk.”
5. On page 10, lines 38 – 54 (and continuing a few lines on page 11), the authors describe
the statistical significance of trends without providing context on the magnitudes of the
estimated strengths of associations. These should be provided; I suggest language such as
that suggested in my comment #4 above.
6. I suggest the following sensitivity analysis: Exclude persons who died within the first,
say, 1, 2, and 3 years of follow up.
