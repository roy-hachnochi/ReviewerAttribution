This study tested the efficacy of amoxicillin in low back pain associated with Modic changes.
While antibiotic treatment is unusual in low back pain, the results of a previous positive
study may encourage health care providers to offer this treatment, in the light of the limited
treatment options. Low back pain with Modic changes is prevalent and difficult to treat,
resulting in an enormous number of potential candidates for antibiotic treatment. In the light
of the growing antibiotic resistance worldwide and predictions that antibiotic resistance may
become a major source of morbidity and mortality, the use of antibiotics for low back pain

may have disastrous consequences on overall population health. This study is therefore very
timely.
Specific comments
Why was lumbar disc herniation an inclusion criterion? Modic changes can cause low back
pain independent of lumbar disc herniation and no rationale is presented why antibiotics
should work on pain associated with lumbar disc herniation. Furthermore, lumbar disc
herniation typically causes radicular pain and not primarily low back pain.
It is unclear whether patients were assessed for radicular pain and, if so, how many patients
in the two groups had radicular pain.
What was the rationale for choosing amoxicillin rather than another antibiotic?
I have a major concern. There is no information on the treatments that patients underwent
during the follow-up phase. If placebo worked less well than amoxicillin, patients in the
placebo group may have had more intensive treatments, theoretically minimizing a
potentially significant difference between the two groups.
