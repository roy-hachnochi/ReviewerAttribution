This is a well-written manuscript on a well-performed trial. The methods and reporting are
adequate and comply with the CONSORT standards. The results, interpretation and
conclusions are credible and well presented.
I have two minor comments on the flowchart only:

- In the boxes ‘x patients evaluated at 1-year follow-up’, you report the number of patients
with major protocol deviations. It is unclear what is meant by ‘end of study before 3
months’?
- The numbers of treatment non-completion in the two groups are n=10 for amoxicillin and
n=8 for placebo. In other boxes, the number of treatment non-completion are also reported.
Here it says n=7 (amoxicillin) and n=8 (placebo). It’s not clear why these numbers are
different.
