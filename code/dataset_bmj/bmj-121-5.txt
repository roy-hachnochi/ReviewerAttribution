The study aims to assess the effects of different oral antithrombotic agents for the
prevention of saphenous vein graft failure in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
graft surgery. Overall, this is an interesting topic, and relevant to clinical practice,
however, please consider the following points:
1) It might be useful to describe the results, by number needed to treat (NNT) to harm. I
feel these are easier to understand and apply in clinical practice.
2) Table 3 – I suggest restructuring the table so that the SUCRA values for each treatment
outcome are in separate columns, on the same rows, rather than all in one column with
repetitions of the row headings
3) Supplementary Figure 1 – What was the breakdown of the number of articles excluded
for the reasons specified?
4) Supplementary Figure 2B - A funnel plot with only 2 studies is not usually
recommended. As a rule of thumb, there should be a minimum of 9-10 studies.
5) You’ve performed a meta-regression by year of publication only. You could do a
meta-regression according to certainty of evidence (risk of bias) score. Alternatively, you
could do a sensitivity analysis excluding those studies with ‘serious’ risk of bias.
6) It would be useful to perform a meta-regression assessing the primary outcome
according to duration of antithrombotic treatment (initiation and follow-up)
7) Other interesting covariates to include in a meta-regression analysis, where you seem
to have sufficient data are age (years), gender (%), diabetes (%), hypertension (%),
dyslipidaemia (%), prior MI (%), dose of Aspirin (mg). A multivariate meta-regression
could then be considered based on the results of the univariate regression.
