BPH is a common condition that affects aging men. As authors point out, there are several
surgical treatments available for it. The authors compare and rank 9 surgical treatments.
The authors are congratulated for undertaking this substantial project. The study is well
done.
A few points to consider.
MAJOR:
1. Did any of the trials included in this network meta-analysis report on length of hospital
stay? This should be considered an endpoint too, if available.
2. Did any of the trials included in this network meta-analysis report on the individual IPSS
scores? This maybe helpful as nocturia is a multifactorial entity and does not always relate to
BPH. Further, certain IPSS questions pertaining to 'urgency' and 'frequency' after treatment
of BPH may reflect permanent detrusor overactivity (from BPH or not) and thus may falsely
inflate IPSS scores, and mask the effectiveness of the treatment. Therefore looking at
individual scores is sometimes helpful.
3. In the sensitivity analysis, the authors should strongly consider including IPSS QoL. This is
probably the most important component of the IPSS score that governs patients' decision to
undergo treatment and postoperative satisfaction.
MINOR:

1. Please clarify this statement in the results "However, only seven methods reported
outcomes for 24-36-month postoperative follow-up, and these were predominantly pairwise
comparisons of bipolar TURP with monopolar TURP."
2. I could not find in the text what was considered a significant p-value? Was it <0.05? If so,
then should the authors consider using correction for multiple corrections such as Bonferroni
etc?
