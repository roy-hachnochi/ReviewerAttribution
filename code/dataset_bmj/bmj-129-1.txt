This article builds on the work of Dr. Stein and Prof. Sridhar on the financialisation of healthcare to
provide an important analysis of the World Bank's newly developed Human Capital Index (HCI). A clear
and thorough explanation of the HCI is provided, including how the Index is calculated and a convincing,
anthropologically informed case is made of the role that the Index performs for the Bank, both internally
and externally. Most significantly, the article makes a strong case concerning what may reasonably be
supposed will be the future uses to which the HCI might be put by the World Bank: not just subsuming
health to economic concerns but reorganising the responsibility of healthcare financing to individuals,
opening the way for individualised debt instruments as the Bank has already suggested in the field of
education. A timely and important contribution to the analysis of the World Bank as a governor of global
health, and to the topic of Health Wealth & Profits, I give my strong commendation for its publication,
without further review.
