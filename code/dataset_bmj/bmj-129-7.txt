There are some improvements and clarifications needed to provide a clearer message from this paper.
Page 1 line 17: In bibliography, the second paper expresses the World Bank is one of the largest and
most influential health funders worldwide. It would be better than “one the world’s most influential
global health institutions”.
Page 4 line 32: It would be good briefly explain the relationship of “Humane Capital Project” and
“Humane Capital Index”.
Page5 line 40: “cascade approach” may have no strong logical relation with humane capital and the
responsibility for healthcare cost. It systematically increases the role of the private sector. This seem like
an organization method of health system.
Page6 line 22: “This makes health policies easer to assess for economists” maybe not the objective of
subsuming healthcare to economics concerns. The component of HCI and HCI can evaluate the
productivity. They are not the tools to evaluate the health system for economists.
Page6 line 24: It should be careful to get the conclusion the HCI will strengthen World Bank’s place in
global health and development. This paper seems no discussion about the World Bank’s influence.
