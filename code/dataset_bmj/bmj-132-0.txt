The paper concerns the serious matter of responding to mental health needs after mass
casualty terror attacks. It highlights that serious problems identified after the 2005
London Bombings still remain.
The paper outlines how the design of a mental health response should take into account
the nature of the terrorist event and associated organisational challenges. The paper is
clear, informative and easy to understand.
The paper references the important finding that survivors of terrorist attacks with
mental health problems were unlikely to be detected via conventional routes such as
primary care, thus necessitating outreach. The learning identified from outreach attempts
after recent terrorist attacks highlights gaps in service provision and uptake.
The paper goes on to make the highly apposite point that Local Trusts should not have to
operate ‘at risk’ in responding to incidents which may involve survivors from across the
U.K. and beyond, and that commissioning arrangements should recognise that incidents
may require a coordinated national response.

The barriers to appropriate and adequate response posed by problems regarding
data-sharing are of note given the current debate regarding the adaptive, acceptable and
meaningful use of patient data. The paper makes the excellent point with reference to
better comparative practice in the US, that In the U.K., work on a health register protocol
for major incidents was initiated in 2012 by Public Health England but has not been
completed. Such a register would improve subsequent outreach attempts using mobile
phone and email contact.
Overall this is a useful and highly informative paper which is of relevance to all potential
stakeholders including patients and their carers.
