To the Editors:
I find this manuscript acceptable as it is although I have added a few minor suggestions.
This is a very important paper as it is probably the best evidence (national
population-based data) to support regionalization of perinatal care which if improved can
save many lives and serious life-long morbidity.
Review BMJ May 2019
Association between early postnatal transfer and birth outside a tertiary hospital with
mortality and severe brain injury: a whole-population study of extremely preterm infants
To the authors:
This population-based study reports the outcomes of the highest risk deliveries by birth in
non-tertiary versus tertiary hospital and shows the important finding that birth of
extremely preterm babies in a non-tertiary centre is associated with an increased risk of
death, and transfer in the first 48 hours is associated with increased risk of severe brain
injury. Level of care at the site of delivery of extremely preterm infants is a major predictor
of risk of both death and severe brain injury. It is important that the study was
population-based because hospital-based studies can lead to biases. Furthermore,
propensity scoring was used which is important to account for baseline difference in
co-variates associated with mortality and severe brain injury. This study confirms data
from the late 20th century before the recent proliferation of NICUs in the UK and many
high-income countries.
Thus, this manuscript reports a very large population-based study that provides new and
important information that is needed to continue to reduce neonatal mortality and major
morbidities in the UK and worldwide. While confirmatory of other studies, this study also
refutes several smaller studies that claim that de-regionalization does not adversely affect
outcomes. The results are likely generalizable to most countries with multiple levels of
neonatal care per region as they reassess their services and attempt to improve them.
This is a very important study. The authors have responded very thoughtfully to all other
the reviewers’ comments.
Some other minor comments are included here:
Introduction

The last sentence of the first paragraph is not explicit enough particularly by a general
readership. A statement such as “and delivery in a hospital with a tertiary neonatal
intensive care unit” could be added to the sentence particularly as BMJ has a broad
readership some of whom may benefit from a clearer message.
The terms tertiary unit and tertiary centre are used interchangeably. It would be best to
clarify what tertiary refers to in relation to the mothers’ care in the first paragraph.
Specifically, does a tertiary unit refer to the neonatal ICU or are the authors referring to
advanced care for the pregnant women? Do the authors mean a delivery hospital with a
tertiary neonatal unit or NICU?
Some causal inferences are made in the Introduction and the rest of the manuscript such
as “The aim of this study was to examine the impact of early postnatal transfer and
ongoing non-tertiary neonatal care on outcomes in extremely preterm infants.” It is best to
avoid terms such as impact and instead try to restrict the language to terms that relate to
associations as addressed in the previous reviews also.
It is unclear why the combined outcome of death/severe brain injury is reported as alive
without brain injury as the readers has to switch for example from reduction of an adverse
outcome in a comparison (e.g. less deaths, no difference in brain injury) to an increase in a
better outcome in the same comparison (e.g. more alive without severe brain injury).
Results
The median gestational age is given with a decimal. It is unclear if the raw data were
collected with precision to the day of gestation and not just to completed weeks. If the raw
data included only competed gestational weeks, the median gestational data decimal can
misrepresent the results.
Discussion
An important limitation that needs to be addressed better is that infants who died in the
delivery room were excluded.
