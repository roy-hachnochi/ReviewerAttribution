This is a valuable article, that should be published, subject to revisions.
Overall, I really like the main methodology used in this piece. Analysing CERF and CFE
outbreak funding in the light of the PEF’s eligibility criteria puts the PEF in the kind of
comparative light in which it needs to be assessed. When the PEF was put together, CERF
and CFE already existed with very similar mandates. The finding that the PEF’s insurance
window would only have been used for two outbreaks funded by CFE & CERF shows hints
at the fact that investor interests may have been written into the pay-out criteria from the
start. This would not be a surprise if we consider that the same re-insurers who
co-designed the PEF also invest in it today.
Essentially Needed Revisions:
To publish the entry, I think the conclusion has to be re-worked. It is currently way too
long, and it introduces many new points. I think the conclusion should summarize the
points made in the main body & provide an outlook to the future/a moment of
unconstrained critical thought rather than introducing long new ideas. Moreover, if the
authors were to move their suggestions they make in the Conclusion up into the main
body they could tie them even more closely to their key findings, that are also presented
there. This would help the text gain greater coherence, which it currently lacks
Recommended Revisions (depending on how important the editor thinks these points are):
Currently, the narrative drift of the article is still somewhat unclear. It lacks coherence.
Rather than pointing out how things don’t fit together, I will here make suggestions of
how to make them fit:
• More should be made of the fact that the Bank has spent USD111.1mn of public sector
money on paying private sector investors, and has paid out only about USD20m on actual
diseases. This fact is usefully stated in the beginning of the “Key Messages” box, but it

does not feature in the article until the end of the conclusion. One way of tying this in with
the argument is to mention it from the start to say that the PEF really has to prove that it
works, as it seems to be quite inefficient so far.
• The authors may want to take another closer look of whether “speedy pay-outs” were an
actual advantage of the PEF when it was made, or whether they are just repeating
marketing discourse by the Bank here. I am saying this because a. the authors write that
themselves that other funds could already pay out in days b. IDA could and has mobilised
money for health emergencies in days c. in major health outbreaks and disasters it is
often not the lack of money but the lack of coordination that is the problem. So the
authors may want to a. relativize the “need for speed” arguments in the introduction and
b. ask themselves what if anything the PEF was needed for? Greater speed or more
money? (they currently present both potential advantages in the introduction, but then do
not refer back to them in the rest of the article).
• The authors currently argue in favour of the PEF’s existence, (calling it “innovative” on
page 3) but want its payout criteria to be adjusted against investor interests. They should
therefore clarify a. why the PEF is justified to exist in the first place b. whether they think
investor interests & adjusted pay-out criteria can actually be balanced.
• You may be able to make Boxes 1 & 2 even more intuitively understandable for the
readers. I leave it up to the editor to make suggestions on how this can be done.
• To make the main table easier to read, why not add a column on “Hypothetical PEF
payout” with a thick right border, and then the PEF criteria in light grey rather than black
ink? After all, that is the result you are trying to convey
• As part of your critique of the cross-border requirement you mention a possible
“perverse incentive, in that countries may need for a virus to spread before getting
financed. This is misleading, as the potential perverse incentive exists throughout the PEF
criteria (number of deaths, number of people affected etc.). It moral hazard that is
inherent to adopting an insurance model, rather than simply establishing a disaster fund
for example. I suggest either dropping the reference to this perverse incentive here, or
drawing out why it is particularly pertinent for cross-border breakouts, or moving it up
into the main body as a general shortcoming of the PEF
• You imply this but do not state it explicitly: The PEF came late to the party, with two
major funds that could be triggered very rapidly existing already (plus IDA money that
can be mobilized in days). Rather than strengthening existing health funds, the Bank
decided to create its own fund, rendering the global health financing landscape even more
convoluted than it already was. So the PEF should have something going for it that the
others do not have and cannot achieve. Judging by your article this something is not its
speed but that it can potentially raise much more money. Now your article points to a
crucial shortcoming: It can only raise much more money if it is paid out relatively rarely.
So are we sure we want a PEF 2.0? Or is the prospect of paying the private sector - which
has a high cost of capital - for public insurance never going to be economical?
Anyways, all in all this is an important and timely piece that I think should only be
“polished around the edges” to be published.
