Manuscript ID BMJ-2019-050524 entitled "Effectiveness of Management Strategies for
Uninvestigated Dyspepsia: Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis." for BMJ.
Authors conducted a network meta-analysis to investigate the effectiveness of
management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia. They showed that “Test and treat of
H. pylori” and prompt endoscopy performed similarly in the aspect of proportion of
symptomatic participants at the end of follow-up, but “test and treat” performed
significantly fewer endoscopies than all other approaches.

This study is a comprehensive analysis for management strategies for uninvestigated
dyspepsia.
“Test and treat of” and prompt endoscopy showed similar symptomatic participants at the
end of follow-up. They also suggested that “test and treat” performed fewer endoscopies
than all other approaches, therefore, it is likely to be of benefit in reducing overall costs.
All studies included in this meta-analysis were performed in areas of low and intermediate
incidence of gastric cancer. Therefore, the results are valuable in the low risk area of
gastric cancer.
However, uninvestigated dyspepsia need to be evaluated in high risk area of gastric
cancer. Patients with early gastric cancer usually have no specific symptoms, they
sometimes present nonspecific dyspepsia or epigastric soreness. Diagnostic yield of
endoscopy in high risk area of gastric cancer is at least 10-fold higher than low risk area
because the incidence is about 10-fold higher in Eastern Asia (Korea, China, Japan)
comparing to Western Europe.
Authors need to discuss management strategy by this geographic difference in gastric
cancer incidence.
(minor comment)
In abstract, authors need to clarify the definition of “test and treat”.
