Dear Dr Feeney,
Thank you for asking me to review "Short-term association between ozone and mortality: a
global study in 469 locations" (BMJ-2019-050789) which was submitted to you on the 21st
of May 2019.
I found this to be an interesting paper to read, and it is evident that the work is of
sufficient importance. The article is generally easy to understand notwithstanding the need
for technical language in some sections. Its findings have considerable implications for
national public health policies surrounding air quality.
What appears to be missing from this paper is how the studies findings impact on
healthcare practice. While I understand that the authors have made recommendations
about air quality standards, I struggle to see how this paper impacts on the delivery of
care or might change the advice that practitioners give patients. What would a doctor
advise a patient to do if they read this article and were concerned about their health? I am
not sure. This may be a consideration in determining whether the BMJ is the right fit for
this paper.
Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance or if you have any questions about
this letter. I would be pleased to review a revised copy of this manuscript if necessary.
Kind Regards,
Gabriel Van Duinen
