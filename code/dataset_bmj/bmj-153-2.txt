Dear Editor,
I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this renowned scientific journal by
analyzing this manuscript.
This is a quasi-experimental longitudinal study of fast-food restaurant sales from April 2015
to April 2018, which aimed to assess whether calorie labeling is associated with a change in
calories purchased per transaction using restaurant sales data, held in the South of the
United States, constituting 104 participating restaurants.
The relevance of this manuscript is due to the fact that several countries are currently
discussing the need and the way to implement nutritional labeling that is effective( examine
the effectiveness of calorie labeling on calorie purchases) to clarify to consumers the risks of
excessive consumption of various ultra-processed products, marketed in Fast-foods
networks, which are usually accompanied by aggressive publicity and reach the children and
youth audience.
The results presented here contribute to clarify one of the points debated that is the issue of
the dissemination of caloric content, which seems not to be so effective to clarify and
educate people. In addition, associating the quality of a product with its calorie amount
alone, seems to strengthen the idea that ingested calories can be expended through physical
activity, which does not educate for a healthy diet and does not contribute to preventing
other diseases, whose taxpayers are excessive consumption of sodium, simple sugars and
trans fats, for example.
The study shows that there was an initial reduction in calorie acquisition, at the beginning of
the modification of the labeling with information of the calories and a resumption of the
consumption habits, since they became accustomed to the labels, which demonstrates the
inefficacy of this method as a form of nutritional education to the consumer.
The strengths and limitations of the study were well presented, clarified.
Considering the quality of the study, the scientific relevance of the topic presented and the
contribution it can provide in the discussion of public policies, I recommend the publication of
this manuscript.
Best Regards,
