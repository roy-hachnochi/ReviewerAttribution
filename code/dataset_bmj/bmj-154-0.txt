The study’s novelty lies in the first time evaluation of this association in France. The
authors have interpreted the results appropriately and the conclusions are supported by
the results. The authors have specified their underlying assumptions and have done a good
job in listing the major limitations of the study. The primary outcomes studied were
prescription efficiency indicators as continuous variables and authors employed ANOVA,
Chi-square and multivariate linear regression (my interpretation – can authors please
confirm this?) for studying the associations between independent and dependent variables.
The primary independent variable evaluated is the amount of payment made by the
pharmaceutical companies to the GPs. The authors categorized these for meaningful
interpretations. The methods for study design and analysis are scientifically sound and are
described in sufficient detail except specifically mentioning the statistical analyses
employed (eg. Authors do not specify if linear regression was used). Overall, publishing
this work will add to the literature on potential health and economic impacts of
pharmaceutical promotions.
One major comment I have is how are the prescription efficiency indicators evaluated to be
better or worse? Is there a reference that specifies this comparison?
Specific comments:
1. Page 7, line 43: “Drug prescriptions per act”: What does this mean? Does it mean
prescriptions prescribed on a single patient visit?
2. Page 8, line 49-50: “on Internet since 2013”: the use of term ‘on Internet’ is not clear.
Can authors clarify what this statement means?
3. Page 10, line 23: “We recruited GPs….” seems incorrect terminology, since it’s a
retrospective study, authors can say, “We included GPs…”
4. Page 10, line 32-33: Its unclear why second matching could not be performed for 6.2%
of all listed GPs?
5. Page 10, line 42-54: The reference for the 11 indicators is missing here.
6. Page 11, line 8-9: “number of acts performed per year”: its not clear what this means?
(Similar to comment#1)
7. Page 12, line 50-51: “they performed 5359…” Is it an average (mean and SD) reported?
Please specify.
8. Figure 2: It’s not clear what is being reported in the figure 2? Is the legend missing for
the figure?
9. In limitations, are any of the drugs evaluated available as over-the-counter (OTC) ie
without prescription in France? Eg Aspirin and PPIs are available without prescription in US
and may other countries. If these are available as OTC, how does this limit the
interpretations for the prescription efficiency indicators using these two drug classes?
10. Page 16, line 55-56: “…suggest a possible gradual association...” what does gradual
mean here?
