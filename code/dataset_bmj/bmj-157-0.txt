The manuscript is of contemporary interest due to the controversial nature of the topic. From
a public health perspective, particularly for older adults, eggs are an important food;
affordable, nutrient dense, relatively long shelf life and simple to prepare multiple ways. The
work presented is elegantly conducted, thoroughly documented and comprehensively
covered, including both primary data analyses and a meta-analysis on the topic. Additional
notable features include an assessment of the prior studies on the basis of geographic area
and food substitution analyses. Important, the unresolved issue of egg intake and T2D was
addressed. Appropriately, a caveat that the results only apply to moderate and not very high
egg intakes was included.
Major point:
With regard to dairy products, a major concern is full fat vs reduced, low and non-fat. In
some cases whole milk (terminology should be changed to full-fat) is reported (Table 1). In
other cases, no reference to the dairy fat content is provided. This is of particular concern
with the substitution analysis for yogurt because no specificity is provided. The authors
should provide analyses for at least full-fat and non-fat yogurt, if not all types.
Minor
Supplementary figure 1, why stop of 2012, seems like a long lag time to the present?
