Thank you for the opportunity to review this article, which outlines a range of barriers,
innovations and strategies relating to the integration of mental health in universal
health coverage, and their wider relevance to addressing the global burden of all
chronic health conditions.
The article provides a timely and valuable overview of the subject, building on the
authors' previous work. It is clearly written, well-structured and will likely be accessible
and of interest to a general readership.
Specific comments:
The fourth paragraph discusses innovations for reengineering primary health care.
These possibilities resemble strategies implemented in England over the last two
decades. For example, the deployment of non-specialised providers or ‘counsellors’
may be considered similar to the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies
service,[1] whilst the staged approach for diagnosis and treatment planning reflects the
stepped-care model described in the NICE guidelines for depression in adults.[2]
Furthermore the reference to digital health innovations including guided self-care
brings to mind websites such as Big White Wall,[3] which are often recommended to
patients in primary care. Yet despite the implementation of these innovations within a
high-income setting, a significant treatment gap remains (over 60% of adults with
common mental disorders surveyed in England in 2014 were not accessing treatment).
This is in the context of one in six adults meeting the criteria for a common mental
disorder.[4] As many of those who read this journal are likely to be British, I wonder if
the authors might be able to broadly address this.
A word appears to be missing in the penultimate line of the final paragraph: “primary
care must…the foundation of the architecture”.
I was unable to find a paragraph on “contributors and sources” as the author guidelines
seem to require.
