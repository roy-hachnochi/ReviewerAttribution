Title: Methods of measuring multimorbidity in community and population studies:
Systematic review and guide
L Stirland et al have written a very long and very interesting paper about how we can
measure multimorbidity.
COMMENTS:
• It is a well-written but very long paper. Some tables must be considered supplementary
material.
• Although the authors include 35 indices, I am not sure about criteria for eligibility. Three
examples:
1. Multidimensional prognostic index (Pilotto et al, Rejuvenation Res 2008; 11: 151-61)
was developed in a cohort of hospitalized patients but it measure one-year mortality.
2. CRONIGAL index (Suárez-Dono et al, Eur J Intern Med 2016; 36: 25-31) also was
developed in a cohort of hospitalized chronic and polypathological patients and measure
mortality after one and two years.
3. PROFUNCTION index (Bernabeu-Wittel. Int J Gerontology 2012; 6: 68-74). It measures
the one-year functional decline in polypathological patients.
