Investing in women’s health: a best buy for sustainable development

1. The paper focuses on important and neglected issues, particularly in the era of the Sustainable
Development Goals and ongoing efforts towards achieving Universal Health Coverage. From this
perspective, it is original and an important contribution to the literature.
2. This manuscript is not a research paper. It should be considered a perspective or commentary piece
instead. Because of the different nature of the paper, most of the aspects reviewers are asked to focus
their evaluation on do not apply (e.g., research question, methods, etc.)
3. While the conceptual framework that is used to structure the paper around includes the key elements
for a discussion on the broader effects of investing in the health of women, the graphic and text do not
address the connections between these broad constructs and/or the directionality of those links.
Basically, the elements are described and discussed as a list, without any arrows in the conceptual
framework and that is problematic. For example, the first sentence of the conclusions section states
that investing in women’s health would redress gender inequities. While I totally agree with this point, it
also works in the opposite direction, i.e., investing in reducing gender gaps would lead to better health
of women. The bi-directionality involved in this and other arguments would be important to emphasize.
4. It is not clear whether the authors have a global focus in mind, or advocate for investing in the health
of women in low and middle-income countries in particular. This is something worth being clear about.
5. While the authors briefly mention the need to expand the focus from reproductive health to
comprehensive women’s health using a life course approach, and refer to the dearth of papers with this
approach in the literature (i.e., lines 51-52, page 4), most of the commentary is narrowly focused on

reproductive health, basically reflecting the prevalent reductionist definition of the health of women.
Unfortunately, there are very few considerations about the health of women beyond reproduction.
Furthermore, the importance of investing in women’s health for women’s sake, i.e., as a right to attain
the best health status possible, not only because of the intergenerational, demographic and societal
benefits, is not emphasized enough. In fact, there are very limited references to the rights of women, a
critical dimension in this discussion.
6. While gender equality (by the way, it should be equity) is discussed and represented in the conceptual
framework, the short paragraph (pp 1-2) about it basically refers to gender-based violence. While this is
a critical issue that needs to be addressed, gender affects the health of women in a myriad other ways
that are not mentioned here. Key areas that are not touched upon are sex and gender as key biological
and social variables that have critical implications on the health of women and the care (or lack thereof)
they receive through the life curse, and health research, professional education, etc.
7. In some sentences, it seems as if the focus on women would be at the expense of attention on men.
For instance, it is also very important to ensure boys and men access to education and health care. A
focus on gender involves men and women, and the wide spectrum between these binary categories.
8. I very much appreciate the references to the critical roles women play as health caregivers both in the
formal health workforce and in the domestic realm. This are contributions that are very rarely addressed
in the literature and high-level policy discussions.
9. Finally, it would be good to make the conclusions section stronger and clearer. Are the authors
proposing investment in women’s health as the ‘accelerator” that’s needed to advance the SDGs? I think
that’s a strong message, but in the current version of the commentary it is not delivered powerfully
enough.
