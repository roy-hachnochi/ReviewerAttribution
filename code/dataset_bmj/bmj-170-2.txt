I think this research article is very interesting and timely. Although I have following comments to make;
1. Investing in women's health in title gives an idea that only grown up girls (Female) are economically
important and no other female age group. Hence I suggest to change tile accordingly to it does not
reflect an age categorization.
2. There is no explicit mention of economic freedom in terms of formal jobs and equal wages which is a
matter of extreme contemporary concern in gender debates.
3. Liteature exist for almost every aspect of the research article, reader can ask why there is need to
write the summary of the existing literature (motivation)!!.
4. women/Female empowerment (strong women/female voice) does constitute a strong indicator to
include in the debate for investing in female/women. Please shed light on that issue as well.
