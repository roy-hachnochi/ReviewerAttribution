This version of the manuscript has improved. I was confused about a few remaining issues:
- From the discussion, I sensed that the authors suspected the primary pathway linking maternal
diabetes with CVD outcomes in offspring was exposure to elevated glucose during pregnancy. I find this
difficult to understand because there are so many possible confounders that could intervene. I am not
sure if the other reviewers feel the same way, but I personally feel a more balanced discussion would
better place this study in context.
- Page 11, lines 25-29 sensitivity analysis for women with more than 1 type of diabetes. It seems
strange for a women to have several types of diabetes. Rather, the reader gets the impression that
these are women who have 1 variant of diabetes but are misclassified due to error. It would make more
sense to clarify this and simply remove these women from the main analysis (or in sensitivity analysis).
If the authors opt to include these women in the main analysis, please clarify what exposure category
these women would have been placed in.
- It would be beneficial to know more about how Poisson regression was used for survival data, but I
understand that this may be beyond the scope of the paper.
