Thank you for the opportunity to review this report by Dr Rekve and colleagues on the topic
of alcohol control policies as a solution for the prevention and control of non-communicable
diseases (NCD).
I found the process of reviewing an analysis report slightly more challenging than a
conventional research article, specifically in this instance, as the “anti-alcohol control” stance
is, from a public health perspective, difficult to argue in favour of – limiting the authors
ability to provide a fully balanced account of both sides of the story. So I apologise in
advance if my comments are not helpful in aiding the editors to rearch a decision or the
authors to improve their manuscript. With that in mind, I do have a few comments on the
article, mostly in areas that I think the authors have perhaps assumed that a reader may be
able to connect the dots as easily as they are when this might not strictly be the case.
It is not entirely clear to me what the text on page 4 discussing current rates of abstention
adds to the proposition. Short of simply stating that there are more past year non-drinkers
than drinkers, it does not feature again as a point for discussion of the topic under
consideration. Noting that low-and-middle income countries (LMIC) are important given
projected population growth and concerning trends in alcohol consumption (clarify whether
this is a proportion of the population drinking and/or average consumption in those who
consume alcohol) would be suffice.
As the article is meant to provide an overview of the topic that is accessible to all readers of
the BMJ, I think it might be helpful that if in addition to noting that existing solutions are
effective with citations to comprehensive reports, statements such as those on page 5, line
42-47 that some countries have implemented such policies and reaped the rewards are
quantified with hard examples (e.g. changes in mortality rates, alcohol-related
hospitalisation, etc pre/post implementation). This means the “casual” reader does not need
to consult external resources to gauge the extent of the issue.
When discussing implementation under “what needs to be done?” one of the most
challenging issues is only briefly given lip-service. Noting that for this to become a reality
requires multiple stakeholders to be on the same page while entirely correct does not give
justice to how large of a challenge this is. I wonder whether giving real-world examples of
where things have worked, or where implementation has encountered issues, might
showcase the true complexity of this.
For those not necessarily au fait with the issues of alcohol industry funding in public health,
it might come as a surprise that their engagement (e.g. funding research) may pose

problems for population wellbeing. Especially when considered alongside earlier comments
for the need to involve multiple stakeholders to achieve the aims of equitable and effective
alcohol control world-wide. A sceptic might use this as an opportunity to dismiss the notion
that available solutions presented are actually viable.
In the conclusion it is noted that countries should renew their alcohol control policies
regularly, is there any evidence that could be used to possibly support this (giving a
minimum frequency would be a bonus)? I’m not debating this is true, more so whether there
are any examples whereby a country with an “ok” policy at one point in time started to lag
behind given lack of active engagement (I guess the example on page 4 regarding the
South-East Asia region might cover this to some extent?) or on how frequently “new threats”
to existing good/best practice have tended to emerge historically or in recent years? This
would emphasise the need to proactively engage with the dynamic issue (i.e. changing every
few decades based on best practice at the time, while better than not changing at all, is not
as good as dynamically responding to immediate threats).
Finally, I appreciate the focus of this manuscript is on arguing that more stringent alcohol
control policies would reduce alcohol intake at a population level and therefore incur benefits
in reducing NCD, however, it is an overstatement to say there is “growing scientific
consensus that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption” (page 3, line 48). At best I
think the conclusion, based on the current evidence base, is that the once prevailing notion
that moderate consumption of alcohol was “good for health” has eroded. But not having an
apparent beneficial effect by no means equates to there being no safe level of consumption.
In fact, the most recent large-scale observational study cited demonstrated that, multiple
disorders considered, there was actually little difference in risk between non-drinkers and
those drinking at levels considered “acceptable” according to most alcohol guidelines
world-wide. Such a statement only serves to highlight what others might conceive as a
biased stance on the issue which is the antithesis of an “Analysis” report in the BMJ. To
clarify, I am certainly not suggesting that this is the case, merely that such polarised “any
alcohol is bad” statements detract somewhat from the legitimacy of important points made
elsewhere in the article. Many will argue that the majority of people consume alcohol without
causing major harm to themselves or others, and it is therefore crucial to make it clear that
practically all of the effective policies suggested in the article would not “meaningfully”
penalise this group.
Minor points
Table 1 might benefit from including some sort of indication of the precision of these
estimates.
The displayable items are generally quite weak. If only presenting quite superficial data you
might wish to do so in a more engaging style (i.e. figures [forest plots, bar charts, waffle
plots, etc] for table 1, and maybe a schematic diagram for the simple text in Box 1). I would
consider adding a figure to highlight that since the WHO Global alcohol strategy in 2010 no
LMIC have reported increases in resources devoted to alcohol policy implementation
