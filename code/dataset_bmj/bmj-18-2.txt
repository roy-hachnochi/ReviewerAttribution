This is a useful study for patients. Given "time to pregnancy" is a very meaningful outcome for patients,
I suggest you add this finding under the "What this study adds" section. I think many patients/ non
scientists will want to know the specifics of that finding as early in the paper as possible. I also wonder
whether you have considered the implications of this finding for clinics pushing genetic testing of
embryos. In Australia, genetic testing of embryos is being increasingly marketed by clinics, including
those answerable to shareholders.
