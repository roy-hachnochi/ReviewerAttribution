Any attempt to draw attention to the negative impact of industry funding on the
independence of patient groups is a step in the right direction.
However, I can already hear the cacophony of outrage from those groups who spend most of
their time trying to rationalize their decision to accept such funding. There are myriad holes
that they can erroneously use to both support their position and undermine detractors.
I do not bemoan their attempt to try to make sense of something so poorly studied,
understood and subject to spin. This manuscript does its very best to make a silk purse out
of a sowâ€™s ear.
From an independent patient perspective, it certainly provides more fodder for debate, but it
is far from a silver bullet to support independent patient groups.
The biggest problem with the study is related to the source material. The approach to and
acceptance of industry funding varies greatly from country-to-country, province-to-province,
election-to-election, group-to-group, individual-to-individual and web site-to-web site.
Ultimately, the signal-to-noise ratio is so low that it is difficult to make any clear conclusions,
which is a shame.

As an independent patient advocate, I would have liked to have seen some guidance on how
to determine the veracity of patient group motives. Or discussion on how to practically study
this going forward would have been helpful.
Finally, as someone at the coalface, how do I get the authentic patient voice
front-and-centre?
