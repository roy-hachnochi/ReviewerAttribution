This interesting articles examines a large original dataset of articles to examine whether females are
more (or less) likely to use terms such as "novel" in describing their research, and whether the use of
these terms is associated with more citations. Overall, the authors find that male authors (papers where
the first OR senior author are male) are more likely than female authors (papers where the first AND last
author are female) to use the term novel, and that papers that use this term generally have more
citations. While the absolute differences may seem small, the relative size of the effect is fairly large,
particularly among more prominent journals (impact factor>10). The topic is a timely one and I think
the paper will find an interested audience in the BMJ. I think the following revisions would be helpful:
1). The baseline (i.e., "male") group is defined as having a lead OR senior author with one male, but as
an additional analysis, it would also be worth examining groups where the first AND senior author are
male.
2). Somewhat related to (1) above, in the case of male/female authorship teams could the authors
examine whether there is any difference (relative to male/male or female/female authorship teams) if
the female is the lead or senior author?
3). The authors show that the use of words like "novel" is associated with an increase in the number of
citations, but this analysis measures the effect across males and females together. It would be helpful
via either an interaction term or subgroup analyses to examine how this effect varies across gender, i.e.
if males use term like "novel," is the effect on citations larger or smaller than when females use the
same terms? I think this analysis is important because a theme of this paper is that females, by using
the term "novel" less, are also receiving fewer citations, but perhaps an alternate explanation is that
females only use it for truly novel work (i.e., males overuse the term), in which case one would expect
to see that when females use the term, there is a particularly large increase in citations compared to
when males use the term.
4). Confounding is always an issue (males may simply be more likely to do novel work), and while the
authors do adjust for a variety of factors, I think it might be helpful to perform an analysis in which the
number of citations is used as an independent variable (instead of an outcome sit is currently used).
While this may be a bit strange, I think it would be helpful since one might presume that the number of
citations could be used as a proxy for novelty.
5). Can the authors examine where the use of words like"novel", etc is occurring (i.e. title, abstract,
both) and (a) examine gender differences in this placement and (b) examine the association between
placement and citations?
6). In using the genderize algorithm to determine gender, the authors imposed a cutoff of 90%, that is
to say, they only included names where the genderize algorithm was 90% confident of the gender.
Could they examine the robustness of their results to alternative cutoffs?
