This analysis article provides a well-written and cogent summary of several important ideas
(reverse/frugal innovation, global learning for health, decolonization). The table, in particular, has a lot
of useful information on some of the best-known examples of "reverse innovation" and is a real boon for
readers who want to quickly get up to speed on this area.
The authors have essentially produced a new and much improved article that I think will now help to
stimulate debate about these important concepts.
