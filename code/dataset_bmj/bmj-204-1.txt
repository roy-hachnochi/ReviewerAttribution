Thanks for the opportunity to review this Analysis article.
The manuscript describes, in a general way, some links between UK zero-carbon transition
and health. The manuscript informs the health community that the UK is committed to a
net-zero approach for 2050. However, the manuscript does not provide novel evidence or
new ideas on how to support the net-zero plan from the health sector.
Her some minor comments:

In general, the net-zero approach support multiple sector actions, and this manuscript
only focus on a few of them.
Would be useful to mention all the sector that are involved in a Net-zero approach, such
as building, industry, waste, aviation/shipping, that have not been mentioned in this
article.
Also, I feel missing on how to involve citizens (beside behavioral intervention), at least in
the section of "making changes happened"
Page 2, Line 54, Power generation- I think it is missing a mention to other relevant
pollutants, such as Black Carbon and their related climate health benefits.
Page 7, line 31 - demonstrating? Or estimating?
Page 7, line 44 - may be mentioning approaches and tools that could help to achieve these
goals, such as health in all policies and health impact assessments.
