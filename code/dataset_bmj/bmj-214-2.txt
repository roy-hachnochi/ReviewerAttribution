This is a new high-quality meta-analysis of randomized trials for blood pressure reduction by
dietary sodium reduction. The authors included 133 trials estimating sodium intake by
24-hour urine collection only. They also analyzed data focusing on intervention duration,
because the effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure in short-term studies may be
different from that in longer-term studies. The paper would serve higher level evidences on
this topic.
1. The effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure reduction was significantly and
independently different among ethnic groups. The authors should discuss about the reason
of this result.
2. The purpose of Appendix 2 is not clear. This is mentioned in a paragraph named
“Association of magnitude of sodium reduction intervention with size of blood pressure
reduction” in the Results section (page 8), but the figure does not show the relationship
between sodium reduction and blood pressure reduction. Is this figure really necessary in
this paper?
3. Appendix 3 is difficult to understand and may not be necessary in this paper. This figure
was not explained in the Results section. The figure shows 5 lines, and a line for Cutler 1997
is not drawn.
4. Similarly, the right figure of Appendix 2 has 6 lines only.
5. The results of funnel plot (Appendix 6 and 7) are not discussed in the Discussion. The
size of font in Appendix 7 is too small.
6. Figure legends should be written in detail on a separate page.
