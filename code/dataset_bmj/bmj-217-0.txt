In this study, the authors examined the association between macronutrient intakes and risk
of mortality using data from the large UK-Biobank cohort. This cohort is an incredible
resource to assess the impact of lifestyles on the risk of premature mortality because of the

large number of participants, the linkage with morbidities database, and the high amount of
events.
Comment 1. Although information in this cohort is exhaustive in relation to lifestyles and
morbidity, information on habitual diet merits some caution. Diet was recorded with a 24h
dietary recall (Oxford WebQ), in 5 different occasion during baseline data collection. The
limitations of 24h dietary recalls to assess habitual diet are well known, since these
questionnaires are based on 1-day self-reported measurement. Although this method can be
useful to estimate average nutrient intake when a sufficient number of participants are
available in the study, it is insufficient to characterize habitual intake (Willett. Nutritional
Epidemiology. Oxford University Press). In addition, population studies with long follow-ups
need repeated measures of diet in order to assess cumulative nutrient intake that accounts
for dietary changes. Since this study had a mean follow-up of 10 years, the analyses done
here have assumed that participants maintained the same diet pattern during all the
follow-up, which seems unrealistic.
The authors are aware of this limitation and present some sensitivity analyses by excluding
participants who reported that diet was unusual the day of the measurement. However, for
the main analyses, they included all participants with at least one diet measurement. As
commented in the validation paper for the Oxford WebQ (Galante et al. British J Nutr 2016),
those who responded only once to the dietary questionnaires were different from those who
responded in several occasions. Therefore, a tradeoff exists in the use of information from
participants with at least one 24h dietary records (not habitual consumption) vs. the use of
information of participants with at least ≥3 dietary records, which would resemble more
appropriately habitual diet but come from a subgroup of population from the general UK
cohort. Did the authors try to examine if the associations found were similar in those
participants with more days of diet measurements? Although this reduce the sample size, it
would allow to better understand the degree of error introduced by the diet measurement
used. In addition, this is an important limitation of the data that should be appropriate
acknowledged.
Comment 2. The authors rely on non-parametric models to examine these associations.
Although this methodology reports benefits in order to understand the associations in a
flexible way, traditional parametric techniques allow quantifying the risk associated to each
level of nutrient intake, and also provide information about existence of linear or non-linear
associations. The use of only non-parametric models avoids readers to know the estimated
risk associated to each level of expose and thus, difficult the interpretation of the results.
Why did the authors refuse to use parametric methodology?
Comment 3. At this point, there is a need to understand the different effects of nutrients
that come from diverse food sources, such as animal protein vs. vegetable protein,
carbohydrates from sugar-sweetened beverages vs. carbohydrates from fruits, or saturated
fat from dairy vs. saturated fat from meat. Since this information is unavailable in this
cohort, these results may not add more information to the effect of nutrients on health to
the already existing literature. In addition, we need to adjust the analyses for the diet
pattern where intakes occur. Did the authors take into account the underlying dietary
pattern of participants in the study? Stratification for BMI and energy level doesn’t seem
enough.
Comment 4. Finally, in the Introduction as well as in the Discussion, the authors seem to
have done a misbalanced presentation of the current scientific evidence. The reviewer could
not find any discussion of the work performed with the Nurses’ Health Study and Health
Professionals Follow-up cohorts, whose researchers have examined exhaustively the effect of
nutrient intake on mortality and CVD, including non-linear associations and also isocaloric
substitutions (eg.: Li Y, Hruby A, Bernstein AM, Ley SH, Wang DD, et al. 2015. Saturated
fats compared with unsaturated fats and sources of carbohydrates in relation to risk of
coronary heart disease: a prospective cohort study. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 66:1538–48. Song,
M., Fung, T.T., Hu, F.B., et al. Association of animal and plant protein intake with all-cause
and cause-specific mortality. JAMA Intern Med 2016;176(10):1453-1463). Although the
amount of scientific literature on this topic is huge, it seems necessary to present some the
best evidence from observational studies that have been published.
