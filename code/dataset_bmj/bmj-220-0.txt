General Comments
The focus of the paper is very important and relevant. Overall, I felt that the paper could have been
significantly strengthened by expanding the text so that key elements receive a fuller focus, the
connections between sections is clearer, more robust and less disjointed; and the flow of argument is
more persuasive. I did a rough word count, and it currently stands at 1186 words not including boxed

text, tables and figures (and the recommended word count is 1800-2000 words for an Analysis article)
– so you have plenty of room to develop themes and arguments.
Whilst the connection between planning and health is summarised on p2, I felt that this could be
helpfully expanded to provide a stronger context for the paper, drawing on the excellent guidance
documents that have already been produced by T&CPA, RTPI etc. (and which at least one of the
authors of this paper has been heavily involved with!).
You state on pp2-3 that you advocate for a whole systems approach to building healthy, equitable
communities. However, you don’t at an point in the paper explore or explain what is understood by
this, despite there being extensive literature examining what it means and requires, in relation to both
the idea of Healthy Settings/Places and particular issues such as obesity. This seems to be an
important omission and detract from the persuasiveness of the paper.
Whilst there are several mentions of ‘place’ (as a heading on p3 and in reference to ‘place-based
policies on p), I felt that your paper would be strengthened and enriched by a fuller focus on and
examination of what is meant by place-based policy and practice. This is a very ‘current’ term and has
obvious connections to your intended focus on whole systems approaches and complexity.
The three paragraphs under ‘Policy Mechanisms’ on p5 do not seem to be very clearly connected to
each other. The second of these does not really explain how the various agencies connect to planning
and health / designing and planning healthy communities – and the mention of ‘whole system
approach’ is not expanded to explain what is meant by this or how the agencies are promoting this
(individually or as a connected system). The mention of WHO Healthy Cities is obviously relevant, but
is so brief that it risks meaning very little to the intended readers, who may well know nothing about
this programme. Additionally, HiAP has a broader history and advocacy base than Healthy Cities and
this should perhaps be mentioned, as it really underpins the rationale for the Planning sector and
profession focusing on health and wellbeing.
I wondered why there is no mention of ‘co-benefits’? This seems highly relevant to the topic and an
important approach in securing health in all policy areas and across different sectors/professions
(including planning). Linked to this, A stronger acknowledgement of the connections between
sustainability and health would seem to be relevant too (you mention the SDGs, but do not
contextualise this in terms of the growing acceptance that the health of people, places and the planet
are essentially interdependent).
Whilst your focus is evidently the built environment, Table 1 refers to the natural environment – and
the interface and connections between the two is evidently of fundamental importance. Could this be
explored in a little more detail? Additionally, and linked to this, I wondered why there was no mention
of biophilic design?
Specific/Textual Comments
P2 Is the paper only relevant to medical professionals?
P2 Is the heading ‘global seminar’ needed (and is the detail under this necessary) – could it not just
be an explanatory sentence under ‘Introduction’? And why are objectives under this heading?
P3, Line 10 Should this be ‘poor’ air quality?
P4 Ensure that the style in consistent, particularly under ‘Design and Planning Principles’: At present,
it mixes active clauses such as ‘enhance…’ and ‘improve…’ with more passive statements ‘provision
of…’ and ‘adaptation to…’.
P5, Line18 To ensure clarity, review wording of sentence “…proposals put forward in regeneration,
housing and even individual uses such as…” and maybe revise to make clearer – uses of what?
P5, Line25-26 To ensure clarity, review wording of “It is a complex and multi-faceted system, and
is…”. What does the ‘It’ refer to and what does the ‘They’ refer to in the next line?
P5, Line 36 I think the comma after ‘spanning’ should be deleted and moved so that it comes before
this word.
P6 Figure 1 is not referred to in the text. I is presumably meant to elucidate the paragraph relating to
government agencies on p5? If so, then why doesn’t it include all the agencies listed (Historic England

and Highways England are missing). Additionally, the inclusion of STPs without any mention of their
evolution into Integrated Care Systems seems a bit out of date (I know both are mentioned in the
conclusion, but there is no mention that one is evolving from the other).
