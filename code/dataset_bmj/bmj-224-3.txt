major: the term protocol is not accurate for describing trial registration details. Using the
term protocol is confusing for readers.
the paper had good results in terms of overal registration rate. The section about delayed
registration seems somewhat to fill more space in results. Reasons: Is based on only 8
responses. It should be more stressed that that is not representative.
same applies to next subsection of delayed registration actors.
major: there is missing discussion about legal framework. ICMJE policy has no teeth. The
autors can simply later registry and publish in non member journal. Paper should discuss in
what countries on Earth is registration even legally required (e.g., US. Better legal research
about legal duty to register in EU (or individual EU countries), UK, Japan, China.

The major results seem to agree with prior studies so the value of re-doing the study seems
not so revolutionary.

MAJOR: Same problem with international difference is on the front of trial results. Trial
registration is of some value but results have much higher value. Discussion of which WHO
registries focus on results is key (only one (or few) have results or even legal mandate to
post results). Seems out of touch to only focus on registration. I am not sure if progress in
medicine will be so much better of with timely registration only.
The value of the paper is in the discussion and the discussion seems incomplete in some
aspects.
