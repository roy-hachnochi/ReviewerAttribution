This is my second review of this manuscript and my initial comments were mainly focussed
around how balanced the findings were reported. The authors appear to have done a good
job of this in the revision and I think all the major limitations are now clearly stated in the

discussion. The key as the authors describe is that the effect is 'modest' but the
intervention is low-cost. Given the current evidence base - this trial appears to add value
and may influence policy, though it is unclear if this would extend outside the UK.
The economic analysis is important it feels although I cannot comment on the methods
used. There were however a couple of points.
1) It was unclear to me why the researchers stratified by area (Bristol vs Non-Bristol) why was this done?
2) Why did only half of the practices agree to participate? The reasons for declining would
be useful information to include in the CONSORT flow diagram- this may give the readers
some insight on whether it is feasible to roll out the intervention in other sites.
3) Table 3 - in the subgroup analysis comparing opioid/IDU and not opioid/IDU, was there
a reference category?
