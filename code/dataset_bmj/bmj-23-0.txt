The systematic review shows clearly that current risk prediction models for hospital
readmission have a long way to go before they become practically useful. The quality and
quantity of relevant data are uneven, and the C-statistics currently achieved are mostly
below 0.8 and hence reflect poor performance.
1. I wonder if the authors might discuss the C-statistic, what it means in practice and how
large it would need to be before the models would be useful. I note they responded to
reviewers "We would hypothesize that the inclusion of these features in some of the

predictive models that we have identified in our systematic review could potentially raise the
C-statistic over the 0.8 threshold to be considered a strong predictive model." This implies
that they view a C-statistic of above 0.8 as useful, but is that really true? I acknowledge the
crude C-statistic classification that says >0.8 is a good model, but this may still reflect a
sensitivity or specificity that is too low to be clinically useful.
2. Related to this, I am unclear how the outputs of these models are to be used. If a patient
is thought to be at high risk of readmission, what exactly is the hospital to do about it? This
also relates to the actionability of the models, i.e. whereabouts in the patient's hospital stay
the information becomes available. Of course the authors may not have much to say about
this, but if they do it would be helpful to hear.
3. The acronym SDoH is introduced and used in the Abstract and main text, but it is entirely
unmemorable and would be better avoided.
4. A tiny point - it should be Cox regression not cox regression.
