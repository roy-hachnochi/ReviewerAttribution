This is not a scientific commentary but an advocacy piece written primarily by individuals without
scientific expertise in the field. The authors mischaracterize the science (of which there is little in the
manuscript) and make claims for which there isn’t scientific support. The fact that there are
significant challenges projected with climate change does not equate to environmental collapse
happening now.
The manuscript completely fails to achieve the scientific standard for a BMJ publication and fails to
achieve the BMJ requirement for commentaries of making "a reasonable case and acknowledges the
opposing view.”
