I believe the authors have made a compelling case why the WHO should declare climate breakdown a
health emergency. The authors highlight and cite recent reports that document the escalating climate
crisis and its negative impacts on people and other species. They also highlight the criteria by which
the WHO can determine an issue to be a "public health emergency of international concern" and make

a strong case why the climate crisis should meet that criteria. The article is timely and will advance
discussion and hopefully action both in the health community and in the WHO itself.
