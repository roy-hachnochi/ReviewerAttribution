The authors of this paper make a very compelling case for the array of health threats that climate
change poses, and I largely agree with their analysis on that front. Two issues receive less attention,
though, and they reflect the tension between what should be done and what is politically practical.
The first is that it is not clear what resources WHO has at its disposal to effectively foster a global
response. Would WHO focus on climate change qua climate change, or would it focus on climate
change as evidenced by increasing rates of malaria, for example? It's akin to the difference between
declaring a PHEIC for Zika and declaring one for Zika-related microcephaly. If WHO makes such a
declaration without the expertise or resources to do much about it, then it threatens to undermine the
efficacy of the declaration itself and PHEICs in general. Furthermore, the recent debates about
declaring a PHEIC for Ebola in the DRC show that WHO's decision making processes around PHEICs
are not operating optimally.
Second, is a PHEIC the most effective tool for calling attention to climate change? The authors
reference WHO's decision to declare a PHEIC for polio in 2014. The authors are correct that it was an
odd declaration to make. More importantly, though, the PHEIC was largely ineffective. It didn't spur
greater attention or resources from the international community, and the declaration itself is largely
remembered for being more symbolic than substantive. If the same fate were to befall a climate
change-related PHEIC, it would potentially set back international efforts to address the problem. Are
there champions for making such a declaration? Is there a sense of what WHO could/would do? Are
there other organizations willing to get on board with such a declaration?
As I mentioned above, I largely agree with the thrust of the authors' argument, but I wonder about
the practical efficacy of pursuing this path.
