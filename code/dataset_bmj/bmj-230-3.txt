1. The article might create greater interest if the authors were to change the title from a question to a
statement – as written in page 3 of the paper.
2. Strictly speaking the climate is not breaking down but it is changing. The result of climate change is
a breakdown of climate critical systems required to sustain life.
3. The line “Everywhere we look our environment is collapsing.” Should be supported by a reference.
4. Line 82 – the word “us” should be removed since not all readers were warned.
5. Line 88 “And we know what the effects will be” is a redundant line since the article should be
written to inform the reader of what the effects will be.
6. The page number associated with references should be in superscript alongside the reference
number i.e . 5 p40
7. Line 104 “It won’t”. Need to provide evidence to support this assertion.
8. Line 123 – need to provide clarification of the “Board”. Is this the WHO Board?
9. Lines 142 and 143 – the page numbers should be in superscript beside the reference.
10. It would be helpful to have a reference within Box 1.
11. Line 191 “It requires little imagination...” is an unscientific observation and might be offensive to
some readers.
12. Line 199 – SIDS should be written out in full first time.
13. :Line 209 – inverted commas are backwards.
14. :Line 211 – Friday for Future needs a reference
Overall it is a well considered article supported by appropriate evidence which should provoke
discussion and debate.
