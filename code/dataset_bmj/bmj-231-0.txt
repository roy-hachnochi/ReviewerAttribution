I thank the authors for a thorough response and revision, including extra analyses and further detail on
tables and figures. I also appreciate the additional acknowledgement in the Discussion that resulting
implications for reducing the gender gap are beyond the scope of this study, that spin may indeed be
disadvantageous for science advancement, and that no conclusions are drawn on the ‘optimal’ degree of
positive framing.

I have one very minor comment on the Methods – on page 8 lines 25 to 32: should there be a close
bracket after “…vary across journals or over time.”? Otherwise, the sentence doesn’t quite make sense.
Thank you again for the chance to review this paper on an interesting and relevant area of research.
