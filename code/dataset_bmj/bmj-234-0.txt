At first, thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript.
The authors have put a great effort in this research. It is a well designed study on a
relevant, actual topic. I will first give some general remarks and then provide my
comments by section.
The study is the first of its kind and provides hard needed evidence of robotic abdominal
wall surgery.
It is a relatively general subject (abdominal wall surgery), but the robotic/laparoscopic
abdominal wall surgery might be too specific for the general readers.
Study design/methods/conclusions are all well performed and described.
The findings of this study are very interesting given the current 'hype' of robotic surgery in
general and robotic abdominal wall surgery in specific.
The vast majority of patients included in this study have a relatively small hernia (75%
<4cm). Wouldn't it be expected to be more advantageous to use the robot on patients with
larger hernias?
There are some small English language issues, but generally it is well written.

Introduction:
page 7 line 35-37: "additional radiographic imaging was obtained on-demand". What were
these criteria? Were there differences in rates between surgeons?
page 8 line 57: What is this assumption based on?
Results:
page 9 line 35: Please define "minorities"
page 9 line 41: "more incisional hernias". Does this mean that all patients with previous
surgery were operated on an incisional hernia? It is mentioned in the eTable, but it is not
stated clearly. Please elaborate on this.
Page 11 line 24: The finding of the number of bowel perforation might very well be based
on coincidence, given the small number of events. I feel that is should not be emphasized
on too much.
