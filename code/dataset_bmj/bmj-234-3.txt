Robotic versus Laparoscopic Ventral Hernia Repair: A Multicenter, Blinded Randomized
Controlled Trial
1. Did all surgeons do both Robotic and laparoscopic hernia repairs? Or was it limited to
those who only did one or the other?
2. Did the surgeons contribute equally to the cases of robotic and laparoscopic?
3. How were the hernia defects measured? CT scan, during operation, pre-operative clinic
visit?
4. Please discuss more about the pain associated with laparoscopic repairs. Do you think
this was related to the trans abdominal sutures vs the fascial closure?
