The authors have been very responsive to my suggestions and comments, as well as the
guidance from the editors. I feel the paper is improved. I have one small comment.
Results, page 7, line 226. I think when referring to Supplementary Tables 2 and 3
(characteristics by fermented soy/natto consumption) the comparison should really be
between Q1 and Q1 of fermented soy/natto. I suggest not comparing with total soy intake.
