Overall, a rigorous systematic review which addresses the intended aims and clearly guides future
research. Methodology is transparent and in keeping with PRISMA reporting guidelines. Reasonable
attempt has been made to include relevant publications.
There are a few areas which I felt required clarification:
1) Why did the review only include papers from 2010 onwards?
2) Page 18, line 34-36: “arguably exaggerated claims regarding equivalence with… clinicians”: Although
many studies were clearly limited, we cannot necessarily infer that claims were therefore “exaggerated”.
3) The fact that 62% did not state that further studies/trials were required has perhaps been
overemphasised – although an important negative finding, we cannot infer that the 62% felt that
existing studies alone are adequate.
Finally, I agree wholeheartedly with the concluding call for further reproducible RCTs, crucially, involving
expert comparison groups, prior to AI algorithm use in a clinical setting.
