This paper addresses an important clinical question. The strengths of the paper are:
*the use of a more effective sham acupuncture (non-penetrating needle) than previous
studies (for the important reasons outlined in the paper),
*the fact that subjects could not guess whether they had active or sham acupuncture.
The weaknesses are:
*the control group did not have any preventive (prophylactic) treatment – a serious
weakness of the study. The authors acknowledge this.
*The high number (20) of acupuncture sessions is not a realistic proposition for any real-life
clinical situation – this is unaffordable for many places in the world. 5 sessions would be
more realistic
*The study period was short
*The average baseline number of attacks was low, making it more difficult to ascertain
whether this was a clinically significant, as well as, statistically significant, effect.
These short-comings need more discussion.
Other comments:
The paper could be shortened in the introduction and results.
Figure 2 needs error bars.
The implication that prophylactic drugs are usually associated with adverse events is not true
- needs rephrasing
Opioids - "delays opioid consumption"- page 6 - opioids should not usually be prescribed for
migraine so this shoube "prevents ..."
