Paragraph beginning on line 47 still needs denominator numbers in order to be interpretable.
I recommend a clear statement of the authors' recommendations. Ie 1. The pilot study should not include an interim evaluation for action at 2 years. We need all the data
to make this decision (indeed, why bother to do a 5 year study if you plan to make a decision on
roll-out at 2 years?)

2. Severe malaria is not an acceptable surrogate for mortality in this trial
This almost comes out in the last point of the key messages section, but falls a bit short of the clear
recommendations or goals that the authors would like to see achieved with their message.
I also found the discussion in the other reviewer's comments about the ethics of the trial, including
informed consent, to be very relevant and important. I wonder if the editors might consider an
accompanying opinion piece to be shared alongside this analysis piece that fleshes out some of those
issues?
