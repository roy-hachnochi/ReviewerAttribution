I appreciate the opportunity to review a revised version of this important manuscript. The authors
have responded and addressed several of the comments/recommendations that I proposed in a
satisfactory way.
The overall structure with section headings is incredibly helpful in setting the stage for the
concern/argument of the authors.
My only lingering concern lies in the strength of the argumentation in the “Interpretation” section.
The structure of this section should be addressed. An opening sentence should express an overall
concern with the decisions of the WHO, as it is both the use of the surrogate marker and the time line
of 2 years that are problematic. As it stands at the moment, the authors launch directly into the
problem of the surrogate marker and then give 3 reasons for their concern of the 2 years of follow up.
Furthermore, the last paragraph regarding the informed consent feels a bit like an added
after-thought, albeit a very important point. It appears to be more appropriate for the section with
the heading “The malaria vaccine pilot studies”. Ending with the paragraph before is much stronger.
I would recommend not using the term “danger signals”; the more common term is “safety signals” (it
is understandable why the authors feel that this is somewhat backwards, however). Perhaps using
“safety concerns” would be more understandable or continue the use of “potential risks” which is how
they have been termed by the regulators/GSK.
In the key messages section, first point: “….which are now being investigated (not tested) in a 4-5
year long pilot implementation studies….”
In the introduction, last paragraph: Would work in that it was not just an increase in morbidity and
mortality from the dengue vaccine, but also from a resurgence of measles and polio in the Phillipines
secondary to a fall in overall vaccine acceptance after the Dengvaxia fiasco.
