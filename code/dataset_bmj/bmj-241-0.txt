The paper has been revised extensively to include a number of new statistical analyses and
a detailed explanation of the methodology used. I have no remaining statistical concerns.

In particular, the authors have now incorporated risk-adjusted rates for the outcomes of
mortality and care ultilization, which include an ‘official set of covariates that have been
used in the risk adjustment model for the CMS’. This goes some way towards accounting
for any changing case-mix severity over the time frame, but it would be useful to have
more details in the paper as to exactly what patient characteristics are included here as
covariates.
In any case, it is interesting to see that the effect of the adjustment is to reduce the size of
the temporal changes found originally with the unadjusted rates, but not to eradicate them
completely.

In addition, interrupted time series analyses have been employed to assess the impact of
the HRRP on time trends. The results from these analyses give useful insight into the
observed effect of the announcement and implementation of the programme.

A number of eTables have also been added which present valuable extra information.
