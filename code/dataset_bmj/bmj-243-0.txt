The authors have submitted an improved manuscript.
The main claim of the paper are that there is no relationship between egg consumption and
cardiovascular disease. I have one suggestion for the authors to improve their manuscript
that relates to how the argue that they can draw this conclusion. Drawing conclusions of no
difference needs to be done with more care.
When drawing conclusions of no difference there are two pieces of information which are
used – whether the relationship is not statistically significant, and whether the confidence
intervals on the effects exclude clinically important effects.
As I am sure the authors are aware, finding a relationship to be not statistically significant
does not prove that it does not exist. The magnitude of the p-values depends on the
amount of evidence as well as the association in the evidence. Whilst it is not explicit, the
wording of the manuscript implies that the authors are using “non-significance” as the
justification for drawing their no association conclusions.
Considering the range of values within the confidence interval for each estimate as
describing effects with which the data are compatible is a more appropriate device to be
able to claim “no relationship” – where the confidence interval does not contain effects of a
magnitude likely to be important then it is fair to draw these conclusions. But you first
need to be able to state what magnitude of effects would matter.
I would ask that the authors review their manuscript are refine how they argue that their
data support their conclusion based on the confidence interval values rather than on
statistical non-significance. As they have a large dataset, the confidence intervals do
appear to be narrow enough to be able to make the claims that they do, so I do not think
this will change the message, but will refine the science in line with common debates about
problems in dichotomising results as statistically significant or not.
