This is an interesting study with reams of data to report. It is generally well written.
However, I have some concerns that I would appreciate being remedied. As a non-Swede I
would like in the text to have some details about the context in which Swedish health care
is delivered. What is the coverage, particularly for mental disorders? How is it paid for?
Co-payments, etc? What is captured in the administrative dat? What is the threshold for
events to be recorded? etc.
Since the events in this study are from inpatient and specialized outpatient services I think
is would be appropriate that the title for the paper reflect that fact e.g. "...: a nationwide
study in Sweden using inpatient and specialized out-patent administrative
data".
I thought the use of the word "chimes" on page 14, line 33 strange while it appears to be a
standard usage in Britain other English speakers internationally would find it strange "This is in agreement..." perhaps.
With suitable revisions I would recommend this manuscript for publication.
