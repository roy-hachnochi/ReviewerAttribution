Thank you for the opportunity to review the revised version of the paper. The authors
have addressed many of my concerns, and the piece is now more coherent and impactful.
I have a few remaining comments, which I list below:
Title: The second part of the title could be streamlined a bit more.
Lines 9-10: How does a revised continuum of care measurement system help us
understand progress and success? And why is this “required?”
For Table 1, it would be useful to get a better sense of variation beyond the range,
perhaps by including the 25th and 75th percentiles for each indicator.
In the first paragraph under Step 2 (lines 110-113), state that Table 2 lists the number of
eligible countries for each indicator, and perhaps highlight the range in the text
(something like: the number of countries for this analysis ranged from 31 countries for
postnatal visit for babies to 138 for drinking water).
Footnote lines 143-144: “And, we used the earliest data point for the 2009-2013 period.
For countries that had more than one survey in the 2009-2013 period, we selected the
survey that was closest to the midpoint of 2011.” Based on these statements, it’s not clear
what data point from the 2009-2013 period was used.
Lines 157-158. “Singling out which countries rise to the top and which are at the bottom is
most productive if there are articulated pathways forward for the low performers.” It

seems like there needs to be a sentence here that explains how documenting coverage
gaps in a comparative perspective (across countries) can help inform priorities.
In the discussion of results for Step 3, I still think the authors need to say something
about the 45 countries that were not included in the ranking exercise. Do we think that
these countries are missing at random (i.e. a mix of both high-performing and
low-performing countries), or are missing countries more likely to be low-performing? If
they’re more likely to be low-performing, than the results you’re showing are biased. I
understand that you’re doing the best you can with available data, but some
acknowledgement about this potential bias (if missing are more likely to be
low-performing) and a brief summary description of these countries using available
indicators would be useful here.
I appreciate the revised text in lines 256-269 describing data gaps. This is very useful to
place the paper in context.
