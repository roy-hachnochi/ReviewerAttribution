The authors have done a good job in revising their manuscript based on the reviewers
comments. The additional information in the supplementary tables is a good addition, along
with the authors recommendation on their potential usefulness is good.
I probably don't fully agree with not using PROBAST, but am happy with the authors
response, and no further work needs to be done on this.
I still think Table 3 is far too long (10 pages!) and would urge you to split this up by type of
index or what their aim is. Contrary to the authors response, this would not increase the
length, as no more information is being requested merely an alternative and easier to read
presentation of this Table. My comment is to improve readability.
Table 1 is not needed - either place into the text or merge into Figure 1 (PRISMA flow
diagram).
