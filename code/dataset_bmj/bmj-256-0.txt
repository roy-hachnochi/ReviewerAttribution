This is a thoroughly analyzed examination of evidence for possible relationships
between preterm birth and complications. The results aren’t particularly surprising,
especially as gestational age is a continuous variable. I’m not entirely sure why
adjustment for shared risk factors is considered a sensitivity analysis, and there are
a limited number of covariates available for adjustment, but I don’t disagree with
the authors’ conclusions.
My major suggestion is that they consider how the selection criteria may have
impacted their results. The data are limited to those with two livebirths, so how
does differential fertility (unintentional or intentional) affect conclusions?
