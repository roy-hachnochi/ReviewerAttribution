This is an interesting study on an important topic area. My comments are aimed at
improving some of the reporting of the results in the paper. Most results are crude
estimates - this is perhaps unusual but the authors do present some adjusted
analyses in the Supp material and show little differences.

eFigure 1: The flow diagram starts with the total number of women with first and
second singleton deliveries and finishes with 302,192 women giving birth (after
exclusions). However, he primary analysis considers only 284,225 women with a
term first birth – this should be reflected in the flow diagram.
The authors fit separate models for each complication with none of the 5
complications as a reference. This seems plausible – the authors then run
additional models when term complications co-occur in order to estimate
associations between having one condition or 2 or more conditions. What were
these additional models fitted? It is assumed that there may be some correlation
between the ‘co-occurrence’ of these complications – how was this handled in the
modelling?
For all models fitted what were the model assumptions and were these assumptions
satisfied.
The impact over time was assessed by looking at three different time periods of the
2nd birth. The three periods are not equally spaced – how were these derived?
Why not look at the effect over time as a continuous function given there is nearly
50 years worth of data.
Table 1 list the demographics of the data. Several other characteristics are used in
the sensitivity analyses. To understand these later analyses better, it might be
beneficial to include the demographics to all these variable used in Table 1.
Table 1 – for the complications where the denominator is not 301,192, it would be
beneficial to tell us what these are – it’s not clear form the % alone. Perhaps list
this next to the complication name.
Table 2 (left side) / Figure 1 contain the same information. Have the authors
considered producing a forest plot that also presents the numerator / denominators
and RR estimates and confidence intervals – similar to those produced in Cochrane
reviews. These can be produced in various software.
Also consider reporting the
absolute risk reduction with CI’s for each complication compared to no complication
The authors report “In the aggregate, having one of these complications led to an
increased relative risk of preterm of 2.3 (2.2-2.5), while having two or more term
complications produced a relative risk of 3.8 (3.3-4.5)”. I gather this is compare to
having no complications. This seemed quite high level – I guess what would be of
more interest is to understand the relationship between the different complications.
E.g. what combinations of complications lead to preterm birth.
The authors report “There was a general trend for these risks to increase over the
three time periods” I prefer if the term ‘trend’ is not used if this isn’t more formally
tested for. Testing for trend is a specific statistical technique – this isn’t done here.
Table 2 (right side) – again the forest plot idea above could be utilised here. The
reference categories used weren’t too obvious here. I guess the confusion to the
current Table 2 is that it is unclear if we should be looking down the columns or
across the rows.
In all supplementary tables, please present all the numerators/denominators when
computing RR – this is important for reproducibility of results.
