This is an interesting and timely analysis of the costly problem of clinical negligence in the
NHS. The authors propose a number of principles for encouraging safety improvements
including commitment to learning, learning from positive deviance and systemic changes.
However, a couple of points might be useful for strengthening this analysis:
• Structural changes: This is most weakly-presented principle in this analysis. A more in
depth discussion about the association between workforce issues and clinical negligence
crisis is needed. Such discussion could also make reference to workforce engagement and
burnout/wellness.
• Providing any examples of interventions/improvement strategies which have successfully
applied one or more of these principles to improve safety and reduce clinical negligence
nationally or internationally would strengthen this analysis.
• The association between clinical negligence claims and patient safety is obvious.
However, is there any robust analysis on whether the content of negligence claims map to
major types of patient safety incidents/avoidable patient harms (e.g. medication, clinical
tests, diagnostic errors etc. nationally or outside UK)?
