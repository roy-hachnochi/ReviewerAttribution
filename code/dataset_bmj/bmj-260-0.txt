The study examined use of habitual fish oil supplements in relation to risk of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and all-cause and CVD mortality in UK Biobank. A modest inverse association
was found (0.86 (95% CI, 0.83-0.90) for all-cause mortality; 0.83 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) for
CVD mortality; and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90-0.97) for incident CVD event). The study is well
conducted and manuscript very clearly written. As acknowledged by the authors, the major
limitation is lack of data on dose and duration of fish oil use. Another limitation is potential
residual confounding by diet, particularly fish intake, although a consistent association was
found in the stratified analysis. The reviewer has a few comments for the authors to
consider:
1. In the introduction, the authors mentioned the findings of REDUCE-IT. However, it should
be noted that that trial used a different formulation of omega-3 fatty acid than the typical
fish oil on market. Moreover, the trial included high-risk patients only (those on statin use
and with elevated triglyceride levels). All these differences may preclude direct comparison
between the current study and REDUCE-IT. It would be good to make a note of this.
2. Given the existing data from numerous observational studies and the recent findings from
VITAL, a large primary prevention trial, more justification is needed for the rationale of the
current study and the added value it contributes to the existing literature.
3. Itâ€™s interesting that the association appeared stronger for CVD mortality than incidence,
implying a potential stronger effect among individuals with established CVD (ie, secondary
prevention). This point may deserve some discussion.

4. A small point: given the small number of participants with >4 times/week for oily fish, the
authors may consider combining it with the 2-4 category.
