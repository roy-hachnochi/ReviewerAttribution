In this prospective study, the authors demonstrate beneficial clinical effects of habitual fish
oil supplementation which was inversely associated with the risk CVD outcomes and
all-cause mortality. These results are based on questionnaires from the UK Biobank, and
included a cohort of 427.678 men and women, aged 40-69 years, enrolled from 2006 to
2010, and followed through 2018. At baseline, 31.2% of the population reported habitual
use of fish oil supplements.

Incident CVD events were collected from hospital admissions and death records. Statistics
are comprehensive, adjusting for potential confounding variables, using 2 models: Model 1
contains age and sex, and in Model 2 additional variables were adjusted. To test the
robustness of the results, several sensitivity analyses were performed. The analyses were
restricted to participants without missing covariate data.
The authors find a hazard ratio similar to that of the recent VITAL study which is the largest
randomized, double blind study on the effect of purified fish oils ever performed. Due to
fewer events with a CI interval of 0.80-1.06, VITAL did not demonstrate a preventive effect
of omega-3 fatty acids, contrary to the present longitudinal study; HR 0.93
(95%CI:0.90-0.97) for incident CVD events. These study results suggest that long-term
exposure to an omega-3 enriched diet is required for a beneficial effect. Far higher doses are
needed for stronger effects, as demonstrated in REDUCE-IT. The discussion is focused.
Strength and limitations are well accounted for. The manuscript is well written. Flow chart
and tables are straightforward. References cover the subject.
