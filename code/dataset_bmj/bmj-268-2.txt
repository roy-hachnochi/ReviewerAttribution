The authors have clarified most of my issues, except the handling of missing data. The missing indicator
approach is not a good way to handle missing data. The authors suggest that multiple imputation may
be unfamiliar, this is not the case, readers of the BMJ are very familiar with multiple imputation - articles
published in the journal frequently use it (and we have published research methods and reporting
articles on the topic too). I again, suggest to the authors to omit the missing indicator approach and
replace this with the multiple imputation approach.
