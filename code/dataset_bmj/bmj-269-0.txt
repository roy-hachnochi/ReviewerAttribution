Important methodological pitfalls are still present in the manuscript despite the indications
given in the previous review.
Here the main points to be clarified to support the results and make them credible:
- Based on which rationale it was decided to provide the food supplement 5 days for week
and not all days? Please better explain. How was breakfast the other days? Was that
information recorded?
- Have the Authors considered possible differences regarding food consumption during the
rest of the day (excluding breakfast of course) as possible bias? Have at least food
questionnaires been collected?
