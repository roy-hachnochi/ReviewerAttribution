Thank you for coming up with this innovative and timely study. I read your paper with
great interest. I also appreciate the amount of work the research process involved.
I have two general comments and a few more detailed ones
1. Study aims- I’m a bit unclear as to the link between the two study aims. Further to this,
there is an imbalance in how much emphasis the two study aims are given in the results
section, with the the secondary aim of the study being commented on with just one

sentence. Have you considered looking at the extent to which the leaders you captured
were involved in drafting the guidelines and whether there is any association between this
and drug overuse being mentioned or not?
2. Outcome measures and Results - I have a bit of difficulty connecting all the outcome
measures. A few comments here. A) I think each outcome measure should be justified in
the context of existing literature. B) it should be made clearer how / why the outcome
measures are interconnected and to what they amount overall. Why are drug company
spending sums mentioned? Have they been cross-checked with the organisations and
payment types? What is the significance of the publicly available information on payments
published by the organisations? To what extent did it overlap - at the individual level with the data extracted from Open Payments. C) The study combines several levels of
analysis - organisations, leaders, drug companies and guidelines. They are all important
but it is at times difficult to move them because they certain statistics are calculated for
some of them and not others, and there is a further distinction at the individual level
(gender). Having different levels of analysis is a common issue in this type of research but
it is important what the links between them are and why they are discussed.
Detailed comments
Page 3, line 35 - It is important to specify further that there has been some international
research on authors of medical practice guidelines (e.g.
https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(19)30417-3/abstrac
t , Indulging some further useful references). These authors are typically members of
medical associations, including people in leadership positions.
Page 4, line 20 - As Supplementary file 1 is not available, I’d like to ask whether the list of
costly disease areas matched the disease categorisation from Open Payments. Has any
validation of the disease area categories been performed?
Page 4, line 22 - it would be useful to have some evidence supporting this statement. It is
possible possible for conflicts of interest to exist and have negative consequences in
disease areas that are on the whole less costly to the healthcare system.
Page 4, line 35 - I’d like to have seen a bit more discussion on the sample selection
process. Has any consideration been given to the nature of the association’s “overarching
bodies”? What is an “overarching body”? To what extent are these bodies equivalent
across the studied organisations?
Page 5, line 39 - What is an implicit mention of drug diagnosis / overuse? What were the
inclusion criteria here?
Page 6, line 50 (and similar instances throughout) - it would be useful to know a bit more
on the zero values being reported. These values constitute a big problem in UK based
research on drug industry payments to healthcare professionals / organisations / patient
organisations as they may mean missing payments or payments in kind without monetary
equivalents being provided. To interpret these the results it is important to be aware what
the zero values mean or might mean.
Table 1 - Why are numbers of payments not provided? Again, this is an important
consideration in the UK context - In the industry run Disclosure UK database payments are
aggregated on a yearly basis for healthcare professionals but not for healthcare
organisations. In the UK context, there are big differences between high- number-low
value payment categories and low number-low value payment categories. I wonder
whether this also applies to the US context. This seems important given that the focus is
on a particular subcategory of patient recipients.

Table 1 - Have the differences between male vs female leaders been examined in relation
to the types of have. It seems odd to have gender included in just one column.
P 10, line 36 - is it possible to contextualise the finding re the number of guidelines
mentioning (or not) drug overuse?
