This paper set out to determine the pre-specified criteria for academic promotion of
biomedical scientists, using a design in which they used public information supplemented
by direct queries from a randomly selected subset of relevant international institutions. A
major focus was to determine use of “traditional” vs” progressive” criteria, a categorization
that in some ways subjective, is reasonably well defined and justified.
The study appeared to be well designed to accomplish their specified goals.
The study is timely and important. As the authors clearly articulate, the approach used by
academic institutions to assess promotion for research accomplishments plays a large role
in both setting institutional culture, and driving behaviors of scientists, including those that
appear to be problematic as relates to best practices as understood today. Assembling data
on status of such criteria in an appropriate sample is a necessary foundation for further
efforts to stimulate changes in a better direction.
Although not surprising, the findings reveal a number of important facts. Among the most
important are that: 1. Traditional criteria – number of peer reviewed publications, external
funding, reputation, order of authorship and publishing in high impact journals are
dominant within the sample of respondants; 2. Progressive criteria that include citations,
data sharing, open access publishing, pre-registration etc are very uncommon in such
criteria.
The authors present a balanced and thoughtful assessment of their findings, their
limitations, and their implications.
Several points for consideration:
1. Might they consider a term other than “progressive” for the second set of criteria, as this
has political and other connotations that might be confusing? Perhaps a term that stresses
criteria that promote reproducibility and impact of research, and “best practices” as
determined by various panels?

2. Perhaps comment a bit on the fact that some biomedical institutions make distinctions
with respect to criteria used (or even titles) for faculty who are primarily
investigators/scientists vs those who conduct substantial clinical and educational work,
sometimes along with research? Of course, the latter may also conduct research about
clinical and educational matters, but assessment of these areas may be somewhat
different. This is important since in most institutions, faculty who dominantly do research
are in the minority, but all faculty are subject to promotion criteria.
3. The paper states that institutions, including Karolinska, stated they had no promotion
criteria/guidelines. If true, this would be quite remarkable, and frankly, hard to
understand. Before publishing, they might try to confirm this in other ways, to increase the
likelihood that the question was properly understood.
Overall, this is a paper that will add to our limited knowledge base in this important area,
and has high likelihood of stimulating important efforts to induce beneficial change.
