The use of the term “progressive” is obviously somewhat value-laden. If this is the term of
art in the field, perhaps the authors should make that clear. If not, would suggest a more
neutral term, such as “modified” or “non-traditional”.
The paper could be greatly improved by de-jargoning the methods section. They might
also clarify the selection criteria for the sample of institutions chosen. Page 8 lines 10-22
are very hard to follow.
Page 8,45: after a few readings, the meaning of the term “institution” became clear –
these are parent institutions of which faculties are part. However, especially for a US
audience, where medical schools are themselves institutions beyond their faculties, making
it clear how “institution” differs from medical faculty may make the discussion clearer.
P. 9: authors admit the subjectivity of their classification of promotion criteria – another
reason to make sure that the labels of the non-traditional criteria are non-judgmental.
P.11: is Google translate now considered sufficiently precise to be used for translation of
technical terms in scientific literature?
P. 12: What was result of email validation exercise?
P 14, 51: The reference here to progressive criteria that are present at every level of
promotion seems to raise a criterion for judging prevalence that was not applied for
traditional criteria.
Figure 2: The figure should note that the presence of a criterion required it to be used at
all levels of promotion and tenure – assuming that is the case.
Tables 3, 4: Seems like with an n of 83, power of these regressions would be quite limited.
This should be noted in limitations section.
