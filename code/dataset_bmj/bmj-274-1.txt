I thank the authors for the opportunity to review the manuscript. The manuscript is
overall well written and summarizes a huge amount of information in a very nice
way.
Please find below my comments, which I think may be helpful

Title and text:
Do not use the term Healthy Life Years when referring to a health expectancy based
on the YLDs (using the GBDs). Better use Health-adjusted Life Expectancy. The
reason for this is that the European Commission (and Eurostat) uses the Healthy Life
Years (HLY) for the Health Expectancy where the morbidity part is defined using the
Global Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI: a self-perceived longstanding limitation
question), see
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Healthy_life_years_stati
stics#Self-perceived_long-standing_limitations_in_usual_activities_due_to_health_p
roblems and https://ec.europa.eu/health/indicators/healthy_life_years/hly_en
Both belong to the family of Disability Free Life Expectancies but the definition of the
morbidity used in the Sullivan method is different. In order to avoid the confusion
among readers, I suggest that the term normally used for the HALE and which is
source of the abbreviation Health-adjusted Life Expectancy.
In fact all references 2, 3, 8, 11 use the term Healthy Life Years with reference to
the Eurostat definition

Under the bullets of the section “What the study adds” a reference to the
Epidemiologic Transition would be appropriate

Under the Heading “Analysis”, the authors refer to the Appendix A.
The Appendix A is very well done, but I suggest to bring the references directly at
the end of the appendix (page 5) instead of page 2248.

When describing the results, I think a table indicating the mortality (ME)
and disability (DE) effect would be very instructive for the reader. You can either do
this using the data or using a theoretical situation

Replace “HALE0 loss” by “HALE0 reduction”
