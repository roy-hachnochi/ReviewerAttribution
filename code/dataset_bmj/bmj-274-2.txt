This paper used data from a large dataset to quantify the contribution of 306
diseases and injuries to HALE0 changes between 1990 and 2013 for the 187
countries in the world 21 regions. The issue is important in understanding how to
improve the healthy life expectation in the world. The approach to data analysis is
sound; however, there are several concerns about the validity of the measures that
must be addressed.
First, as we known, the methods of life table and Sullivan’s method are popular to
calculate HALE0, why choose Nusselder & Looman decomposition method is this
study? It is better to explain the method in detail and its application in this field.
Second, Page 7, Part “mortality and disability effect on HALE0 changes”. Here, the
explanation may be simple. It is better to analyze the effect of mortality and
disability, respectively. In my opinion, this part is also the main analysis result of the
paper. Thus, please show much more detail.
Third, although the author talked about the limitation of this study as “we
decomposed HALE0 changes during 24 years, which possibly overlooked the
differences in causes’ contributions to population health changes across smaller time
intervals”, it is better to show the whole changes of HALE0 of 187 countries during
1990-2000/2001-2013 in Page 5 Results – “changes in HALE0 “, in order to show
HALE0 changes in detail.
Last, there are some specific comments:
1.Page 4,Line 53, “the methods on collecting, processing and producing these data
can be found elsewhere.” Please add one sentence of “for example, ……”, toshow the
process in other study.
2.Page 6, Line 13, “and countries are in Appendix (pp.6-2438)”, where is the
Appendix?
3. I think the figures in this article are not clear.
