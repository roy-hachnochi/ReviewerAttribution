This is a high quality study from Western populations that is carefully and
appropriately analyzed. By the findings of this meta-analysis of prospective cohort
studies, the authors confirmed both the inverse associations between dietary intakes
of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; total and/or ω-3 PUFA) and the positive
associations of the genetic risk alleles score (GRS) with risk of type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2D). The p value for the generated interaction term (dietary fat
intake*GRS) did not reach any level of significance. Age was an effect modifier for
the interaction between dietary intakes ω-3 PUFA and GRS on T2D risk, withω-3
PUFA/ GRS interaction evident for younger but not older participants.
Concerns
A- The main bulk of findings in this meta-analysis are confirmatory to what has been
extensively studied for the associations of dietary intakes of fat and its subtypes
with risk of T2D.
B-The novelty point in this meta-analysis (if the dietary recommendations as regard
the quality of dietary fat for T2D prevention are specific to or should be emphasized
for individuals with higher total T2D GRS, not depending on a single nucleotide
polymorphisms) has been managed simply (just checking the p-value for an
interaction term) in a simple analysis and in a joint meta-analysis method. Do the
authors think that mediation analyses are also feasible?!
C- The tested moderator variables were geographical region, mean age and mean
BMI. How about sex (male versus females)?! Both the dietary fat preferences and
the T2D genetic susceptibility may vary in both sexes; stratified meta-analyses by
sex are recommended.
D- Although the p value for the meta- regression analysis using age as a moderator
was significant. However, the T2D low HR in Q1 of GRS and the high HR in Q4 did
not reach any levels of significance.
What was the reference category in this analysis (Supplemental figure 3 data)?!
What cases and what controls? Do you mean T2D cases/ total population in each
GRS quartile?!

What was the P-for trend across the GRS quartiles?
What age limit defined older and younger cohorts?!
E- The authors counted on references number 26-36 to support their findings of a
limited interaction between genetic and lifestyle factors on risk of chronic diseases
including obesity, diabetes and coronary artery disease, except for younger
individuals. However, no suggested justifications were given for the interactions
between genes and dietary fat quality in young people (with the need to define
young people here).
F- Participants with missing information for the main exposures and outcomes were
not included. How many were they for each? Are there any significant differences
between those who were included and those who were not?!
G- I recommend controlling for magnesium intake in the multivariable-adjusted
models.
H- How come that the HRs (95% CIs) could be 1.08 (0.85-1.00) and 1.05
(0.92-0.99)?! Nevertheless, the authors have described these findings as lower
risks. The values given for the hazard ratios and the corresponding (95%CI) in both
the abstract and the text are not matching those in tables and figures.
I- It will be preferable if a short summary of the participants and cohorts’
characteristics are given in the results section.
J- Minor
