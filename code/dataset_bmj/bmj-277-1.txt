This manuscript looks at access to medicines for developing countries in light of the TRIPS Agreement
and how these countries can make use of the flexibilities in the amended Agreement, specifically the
Article 31bis solution.
My expectation is that few readers, even of an international journal like the BMJ, have any idea about
the intricacies of the TRIPS Agreement. However, that does not mean that these details should not be
of interest to many of them, since access to medicines in low- and middle-income countries is of
global importance. Therefore, in my view the contents of this article are relevant to BMJ readers. The
authors do a good job of summarizing the history of the TRIPS Agreement, but perhaps go into more
detail than is necessary. I think that the article could be trimmed by about 25% without losing its
impact.
My major concern about the manuscript as it now stands is that it does not deal enough with the
current political realities. It does mention bilateral and regional trade agreements in passing but
doesn’t really discuss how developed countries and regions, especially the US and the EU, continue to
put pressure on LMICs to not issue compulsory licenses and how there is ongoing effort to limit TRIPS
flexibilities through clauses new agreements such as the TransPacific Partnership, before it was
modified following the US withdrawal. There is also the recent example of the pressure of the US on
Colombia not to issue compulsory licenses. Without such a discussion the proposal of the authors
regarding the use of Article 31bis comes off as somewhat naïve.
