This paper makes a valuable further contribution to the literature relating to the health consequences of
vegetarian diets and diets with low meat intakes. Unsurprisingly, given their experience in the conduct
and analysis of cohort data and their longstanding interest and involvement in the field, the data have
been appropriately analysed and the findings clearly presented and discussed. Given the widespread
interest in vegetarian diets, these results warrant publication in a high impact journal such as the BMJ.
There would seem to me to be one other factor which might be contributing to the reduced rates of
stroke in meat eaters and which has not been considered. The meat eaters are on average ten years
older than the vegetarians and despite reporting a medical history of high blood pressure much more
frequently, have almost the same systolic blood pressure. This suggests a much higher rate of effective
drug treatment in the older meat eaters. Indeed I suspect drug treatment of raised blood pressure
accounts for a high proportion of the “ longterm treatment for any illness” category. I appreciate that
adjustment for “prior high blood pressure” does not influence the findings. However given the potential
for hypertension /raised blood pressure to influence stroke (arguably to a greater extent than CHD) I
would have thought that the possibility that drug usage might explain or at least contribute to the stroke
outcome data warranted mention in the discussion. I presume that information regarding blood
pressure lowering and lipid modifying drugs was not available.
