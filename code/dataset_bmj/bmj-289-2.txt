This article tells a story of criteria required for New Technology Add-on Payments in the US, which has
an important EBM message that could be relevant for the design of similar schemes in different
countries.
The analysis of data on the studies seems straightforward and appropriate. I just have a couple of
comments.
Most of the statements are backed up by summary statistics based on the studies that the authors
accessed. However, the statement that all technologies except two could feasibly have been studied in a
RCT is given without detail. Can any further justification for this statement be provided?
It isnâ€™t particularly helpful to give a mean of the number of endpoints, given this distribution is unlikely
to be normal. Better just to give the number with 1 or more. The same goes for the number of studies
for each technology.
