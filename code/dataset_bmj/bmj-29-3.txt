I thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting paper. My comments are listed below:
1. Propensity score (PS) matching approach is commonly used approach in observational studies and it
often relies on the assumption that the first stage logistic regression is correctly specified and that the
PS distributions are adequately balanced. Unfortunately, the approach is so commonly used that often
balance diagnostics are either overlooked or not reported in many studies. I believe it is important to
know whether the estimated propensity scores are balanced across the “treated” and the untreated”
group. I suggest the authors to report the balance distribution plot, Rubin’s B-index ratio, Hotelling’s
T-squared test statistics and/or F test statistics to ensure that covariate imbalance is adequately
minimised through PSM.
2. I am surprised to find that comorbidities are not considered in the matching algorithm. Potentially,
patients with more comorbidities are associated with higher mortality, hence increases the likelihood of
receiving palliative care.
3. For those who were hospitalised, I am curious to know whether the average length of stays (both at
ICU and medical wards) differ between those who received palliative care compared to those who did
not, which can have significant health economic implication.
4. In Tables 1 and 2, weighted standardized difference for baseline characteristics was reported? What is
weighted standardized difference? Are they weighted by the propensity score? Is the difference
statistically significant?
