This is a very well written, concise, and accurate statement on the WHO draft guidelines. It very
appropriately calls for guidelines to focus on foods instead of nutrients, given that nutrient can from
from many different food sources (both natural and processed), each with very different effects on the
body. I have several rather minor comments:
1) While LDL cholesterol may be an appropriate risk marker for projecting the effects of statin drugs
on clinical outcomes, diet is much more complex, with foods containing many different nutrients with
different biological effects including varying effects on different cardiovascular risk markers (LDL, HDL
triglycerides, ApoB/ApoA ratio). Further, both observational studies and RCTs that collected
information on both risk markers and clinical outcomes have demonstrated that LDL is very poor at
projecting effects of diet on health outcomes. Yet LDL still continues to drive policy on what people
should eat. Some comment on how LDL may misinform appropriate diets would be warranted.
2) The paper should cite the paper by Mente et al. 2017 (Lancet Diab Endocrin) on the PURE study of
over 100,000 people, which showed that saturated fat is associated with higher LDL, but also with
higher HDL and lower triglycerides and lower ApoB/ApoA ratio. The latter marker reflects the small,
dense LDL particles that are more atherogenic than LDL alone and found to be the strongest risk
marker for MI and stroke (even stronger than LDL). Saturated fat was found to be associated with
LOWER apoB/apoA ratio, while carbohydrates were associated with higher levels. This paper should be
cited since it is the largest in the area up to now.
