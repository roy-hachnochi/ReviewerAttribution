Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. I want to commend the authors
for a well-conducted, well-described and important study.
This is a very large study nested in two mill US pregnancies enrolled in Medicaid. The
primary analysis concerns the use of oral fluconazole in the 1. trimester and the risk of
selected birth defects (muscoskeletal, oral clefts, and conotruncal defects). Animal studies,
case reports and observational studies have been suggestive of a teratogenic effect on
certain malformations. However, issues such as small numbers and multiple testing have
limited definite conclusions. This very large study (in the context of a rare exposure and a
rare outcome), provides support for an increased risk of muscoskeletal defects and limited
risks of oral clefts and conotruncal defects (including Tetralogy of Falot).
My comments:
1) The manuscript does not comply with BMJ submission requirements
(https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/article-types).
2) The study cohort construction is described in the Methods with eTab2 showing the
exclusion criteria. However, eTab2 is not referenced in the Results, which it should be.
3) In eTab2, please also provide the number of excluded pregnancies in each step.
4) How many pregnancies were not included from not fulfilling the demand for at least 3
mo. of follow-up for mother and infant?
5) What is the average duration of enrolment in Medicaid of the study cohort participants?
6) Main Outcome Measure: Why only include birth defects in the first 3.mo of life? Is it
possible that some are diagnosed later in infancy? Is there a possibility of ascertainment
bias?
7) Maternal ages of 12-55 years of age seems wide. A stratified main analysis in the very
young, very old pregnancies and everybody else would be interesting.
8) It is unclear to me what look-back period at baseline covariates are ascertained in.
Hopefully, this is the same for all study participants. This should be described in the
Covariates subsection.

9) How is the PS score model specified? Main effects only or with interactions?
10) The authors use PS stratification, modelling the propensity of redeeming an oral
fluconazole prescription in the 1. trimester vs topicals. However, the manuscript contains
extensive analyses of alternative exposures, e.g. dose-responses, late pregnancy use etc.
with the primary analysis PS. Thus, in these important sensitivity analyses, covariate
balance is not assured. This is not well-described in manuscript.
11) Please conduct a primary analysis in PS strata (e.g. 3 strata not 50).
12) Table 1: Obesity/overweight prevalence seems very low â€“ 4.2%?
13) I am still not entirely convinced that some unmeasured confounding is not a possibility.
The active comparator and PS strata approach does reduce confounding in many of the
birth defect analyses. This suggest to me that additional covariates might decrease the
effect even further. Perhaps do some simple modelling of how strong and prevalent a
confounder needs to be to change the main outcome measures significantly.
14) Could risky life style be confounder? What about socio-economic factors such as level
of education and level of income?
15) Is it possible to conduct a small sibling controlled sensitivity analysis of siblings where
oral fluconazole was only used in one pregnancy?
16) The conclusion of recommending cautious prescribing is a little vague and safe. Will
this change clinical practice? With the mounting evidence supporting teratogenicity, maybe
a stronger conclusion is warranted?
17) The authors provide an impressive number of pages of supplementary materials.
However, much of this is not referenced in the manuscript? The reader needs some kind of
guidance in digesting these 50 pages.
