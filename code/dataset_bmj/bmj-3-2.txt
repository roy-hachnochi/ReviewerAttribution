Thank you for the opportunity to review the manuscript entitled: “Oral Fluconazole Use in
the First Trimester and Risk of Congenital Malformations”. Although the issue is not new,
this work filled in the gaps of previous works, especially selecting topical azoles as
reference group to reduce potential confounding factors. The study also has other
strengths, including large sample size, stratification analysis based on dose, different
reference group and the use of propensity score (PS).
I have only a few comments with regard to the current version of the manuscript.
1. more description of propensity score (PS) stratification is warranted. Like which
variables were used for construct PS.
2. Since age of delivery is very strong predictor of malformations, I would suggest a
sensitive analysis in which only age of delivery between 18-35 years old were included,
which in order to control for the confounding of age.
3. Showing a relative risk using forest plot is impressive, but I suggest that combing
relative risk with Table 2 because we can only see absolute risk in Table 2, from the topic
of this paper, clearly relative risk is more important.
4. Could the indication for being on oral fluconazole still be a possible confounder as these
women (high dose) may have failed to respond to local antifungal agents due to
immunosupression and how this could be implicated in birth defects. Please discuss.
