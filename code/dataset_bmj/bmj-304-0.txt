This manuscript is a meta-analysis of “preventable harm” from 68 studies that
present overall patient harm and identify those they deem to be “preventable.” Such
a meta-analysis is quite important to patients and hospitals alike as decreasing
preventable patient harm should be goal of any health care provider.
The authors of this paper found that the pooled prevalence for patient harm was 6%
with a total of 52% of incidents of patient harm being preventable. Approximately
25% of such incidents related to medication management and 24% related to
therapeutic mismanagement. Again, this shows the importance of implementing
quality assurance programs related to appropriate medication management.
It is unclear to me if any of said preventable medication issues had occurred in the
present of medication management quality assurance programs in place. In order to
understand how to “fix” such a problem, it seems important to understand the
context from which it comes. As such appears that this data would need benefit from
being disaggregated and separated out types of medication errors and quality
control initiatives in place. Based on the study design it would be impossible to do
so, yet doing such studies (likely necessary at individual hospitals or providers
rather than via meta-analysis) would likely yield more important results for patients.
Similarly, the theme of therapeutic mismanagement seems quite broad. The authors
define it as “incidents caused by suboptimal healthcare management such as
inappropriate treatment and delegation, delay or failure in tracking or monitoring,
wrong referral, or wrong use of healthcare resource.” The authors note that overall
this produced 24% of preventable patient harm. This category is quite large and
inclusive and I am personally unsure if all of the events identified by the authors of
the 68 studies (some of which do not appear to fully include this category) have
similar definitions or include all harm created by such mismanagement. In fact, the
authors of this article themselves show that the differing analyses and
meta-analyses report things quite differently.
As the study focuses on studies from the United States and Canada, I question
whether or not said findings are applicable to other studies.
Overall as a patient I find this manuscript quite difficult to review for multiple
reasons. Sixty-six percent of the studies included in this meta-analysis were
retrospective chart analysis, which BMJ 2004;328:199 discusses as missing the most
serious adverse events and including approximately 1/3 lower events than
prospective or cross-sectional methods used in that study.
Not only does that study make me question the meta-analysis but so too do my
experiences as a patient. Having looked at my own medical charts as well as being
aware of my own medical care, I can unequivocally state that I have had multiple
mild (and in one case moderate) harm from undocumented / incorrectly documented
medication administration as well from what would be considered errors in non-drug
therapeutic management and diagnosis. I may or may not have had other types of
listed errors.

Further, Journal of General Internal Medicine 2005;20(9):830-36 notes that upon
calling patients after hospital admission, 8% of patients were self-able to identify
adverse events. This same study notes that based on their calls, “eleven (55%) of
20 adverse events and 4 (31%) of 13 near misses were documented in the medical
record, but none were found in the hospital incident reporting system.” This
suggests a far larger of events are occurring than are captured in the
documentation. That study concludes “Inpatients can identify adverse events
affecting their care. Many patient-identified events are not captured by the hospital
incident reporting system or recorded in the medical record. Engaging hospitalized
patients as partners in identifying medical errors and injuries is a potentially
promising approach for enhancing patient safety.”
This leads me to the following questions:
- What effect might such lack of adverse event documentation in medical charting
have on the overall results of this study and how might authors take it into effect?
- What would happen if patients reviewed their own hospital charts both during their
hospital stay (or at discharge) and retrospectively years later (after any possible
later adverse events occurred) and looked for both charting errors and adverse
effects that were either documented or undocumented (and compared this to what
was found via chart review).
- When and where is chart review an appropriate method for determining adverse
events? Does this differ by country as legal or other issues may affect what is or is
not charted.
As a result of these questions I must question the validity of any study completed
based on a retrospective chart review. It would be unfair to fully criticize the authors
of this study for analyzing multiple studies that I believe had their own bias. That
said, the authors of this study do clearly cite various studies that critique the use of
chart review and I wonder why the authors do not appear to discuss said issues.
