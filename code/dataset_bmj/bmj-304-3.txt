This is an interesting study it states that about 1 in 20 exposed to medical care is
preventable despite this, preventable harm remains a neglected outcome in the
international patient safety literature compared to overall patient harm.
Im of teh view that attention in many locations the focus is on preventable harm.
The IPAs PAct for Patient safety recognizes preventable error see

Comparison of published adverse event rates is problematic. Results from
international studies conducted over a 30-year period present the burden of adverse
events at one point in time and may not reflect current practices or quality and
patient-safety improvements in that healthcare system. In addition to differences in
setting, these studies differed by eligible population, threshold for causation by
healthcare management, extent of documentation reviewed and the timing and
location of events relative to the index admission. For example, some studies
included paediatric and all obstetric patients and had no length-of-stay eligibility
criteria,1 ,9 ,13 some had a lower threshold for causation,3 while others did not
include events that were discovered before, or after, the index admission.1 ,9 ,19
When our data were recalculated by applying different adverse event criteria, the
INAES prevalence varied from 8.6% to 17.0% (representing a 30% decrease to a
40% increase when compared with the main result of 12.2%). This highlights the
challenges inherent in measuring and comparing adverse events. Current variation
in methodology and definitions, as well as setting and year, make it difficult to
assess whether there are intrinsic differences in adverse event occurrence between
healthcare systems.44

Review Conclusion
While preventable harm is clearly on the patient safety agenda in many jurisdictions,
there are many caveats age, where service provided when comparing performance
between states and within enterprises, every patient has the right to safety and
quality it is my view that this study's strength ( if it has not already been identified
in literature ) is the current lack of focus on Primary Care( Family Doctor's) settings
and Psychiatric patients. I'm aware of stringent regulatory protocols for community
pharmacists in Ireland and UK medication errors.
