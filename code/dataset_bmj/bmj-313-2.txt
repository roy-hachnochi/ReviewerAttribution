This is an important and timely overview of concerning trends in pharmaceutical pricing. I
believe that the topic of "unfair" pricing is well covered, as the essay offers both a digestible
understanding of key underlying economic principles for non-economists and specific
medication/case examples to illustrate and back up their arguments. Sound inferences were
drawn upon from existing literature and evidence.
I have a few minor comments:
1. PAGE 2, LINE 38: Consider adding a brief explanation or example of "standard
assumptions" for a non-economics/broader audience.
2. P. 3, LINE 23: typo- "bringing drugs to market"
3. P. 4, LINE 14: Can non-U.S. data be cited here as well? It's well known that the U.S. is an
extreme example when it comes to pharmaceutical pricing, so some global context would be
useful. For example, how does this look in countries with universal public coverage/a
single-payer system? Or perhaps evidence from emerging markets where universal health
coverage reforms are underway.
4. P. 7, LINE 33: This may be beyond the scope of this paper, but perhaps it could be
worthwhile to mention evidence on the amount spent by pharmaceutical companies on
marketing or share buy-backs, which may be documented as R&D costs.
5. Additional commas throughout several sentences in the manuscript would make it a bit
easier to read. For example, on page 10 line 50 "question, because...".
I recommend this analysis for publication.
