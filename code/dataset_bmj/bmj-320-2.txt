The manuscript has improved a lot. Although, I have not received a rebuttal letter showing where
exactly the authors have responded to the reviewers’ comments, but reading the revised manuscript
carefully showed that the authors have answered and clarified most of the inquiries related to the
methodology.
However, the authors have not replied to my previous comment
“The tested moderator variables were geographical region and mean age, BMI and fat intake. How about
sex (male versus females)?! Both the dietary fat preferences and the T2D genetic susceptibility may
vary in both sexes; are there any interactions with sex?
Thank you very much;
