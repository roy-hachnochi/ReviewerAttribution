The authors address the most questions except for one key question. They did
not address (or directly address) the question whether the studied association
was due to ultra-processes (factor A) or the specified foods (factor B), although
they conducted a sensitive analysis by adding the results of non-ultra-processed
form. In fact, the majority of the “significant” results were marginal for the
individual types of ultra-processed form (Appendix 8 a), there almost was no
significant association if the number of tests were adjusted for. The key point of
this study is to address whether the ultra-processes are associated with increased
risk of CVDs. In my opinion, to answer this question, it needs to compared the
CVD risks among groups classified by different ultra-processes (by factor A only)
(e.g., quartiles by percentage of ultra-processed foods, or per each 10%
increases in the percentage of ultra-processed foods) after controlled the intake
specified types of foods. It’s hard to understand why such analyses cannot be
done. A large number of studies have established that higher consumption of
sugary products, meat (particular red meat), salty snacks, and beverages is
associated with a higher CVD risk. It is reasonable to assume that the total
consumption of these types of foods would be associated with a higher CVD risk
even in their non-ultra-processed form in the study population. The greater
intake of these four types of foods may (at least partly) contribute to the positive
associations between ultra-processed foods and the CVD risks. It’s hard to
understand there is solid evidence to support their conclusion if the key
confounder is not adjusted for in this study.
