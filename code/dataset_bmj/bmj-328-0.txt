As a previous sufferer of stress-related illness I found this paper interesting and
reassuring. My illness was some years ago, I have not developed CVD, and this paper
suggests my past stress is unlikely to give me an increased risk level. I received very little
in the way of care or treatment for my stress illness, other than removing me from the
cause and occasional blood pressure checks. I would hope that anyone involved in treating
or caring for a victim of severe stress would be alerted to the increased risk of CVD and be
vigilant in monitoring the signs. I think this paper would be of interest to a large number of
people.
I found the article comprehensive and informative and I have been unable to identify any
areas where I wished for more information.
Patients with stress disorders might find it difficult to distinguish between imagined and
real symptoms, so increased vigilance from healthcare professionals could be required. For
example, I often had feelings of palpitations or felt my heart rate was raised. I also
imagined my blood pressure must have been raised. However, none of these were

observed on the occasions I had health checks, leading me to doubt if I would have been
able to differentiate these from real physical symptoms if I had experienced any.
The outcomes described in the paper are relevant to patients and clinicians and could form
the basis of discussions between them to highlight the increased risk of CVD. This would
have to be done sympathetically in order to avoid raising the patients stress levels further.
There is no evidence of patient involvement in this study, which has been produced from
large volumes of patient data. Perhaps the authors could have recruited some patients and
clinicians to discuss the findings and assess their impact on stressed patients and how
clinicians were able to reassure them or put a monitoring plan in place.
