The current manuscript includes details of a population-based cohort study in Sweden
exploring the link between PTSD and other similar psychiatric disorders and the
development of CVD. Using novel sibling-controlled and population-matched designs the
authors were able to provide information on a large number of participants (ca. 130,000
patients with the disorder, 170,000 full siblings, and 1.4 million unexposed members of the
general population). The authors report finding that there was a consistent, increased
association between having a disorder and a future CVD event, which was generally robust
to all sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, there was a signal suggesting that this association
was stronger in the 1st year post diagnosis compared to after 1 year post diagnosis.
Overall, this is a well-structured study which extends the current literature exploring PTSD
(mostly) and CVD. The study design and samples size are considerable strengths. That
being said there are several areas where some further reflection by the authors may
enhance the manuscript.
It would seem that the authors are trying to explore the relationship between PTSD and
related disorders and CVD. However, they are using the term psychiatric reactions to
severe stress, which is rather nebulous. For example, one could argue that certain forms of
depressive disorders may appear in response to severe stress, which would also fall under
the realm of ‘psychiatric reactions to severe stress’ (of note, there is an abundance of
literature linking depression to CVD). As such, I would suggest that the authors rework
their title and be consistent in their wording throughout the manuscript (may be PTSD and
similar stress-related disorders?).
Non-effected siblings were matched at the point of diagnosis for the effected sibling. If the
non-effected sibling demonstrated a PTSD or similar diagnosis during follow-up how was
this handled analytically? Was some kind of censoring included? This may have a notable
effect on the course of associations. Of note, due to the 1:10 matching for the general
population I don’t think this is as much of an issue in those analyses, where any effects are
likely to be washed out by the magnitude of the general population.

Table 1 only reports psychiatric comorbidity (i.e., the development of a non-PTSD or
related disorder) in the effected cohort only. I am assuming that the siblings and the
general population both developed these disorders as well. It would be good to report
these in the table. I am also assuming that if the other 2 cohorts had one of these
disorders then this was included in the analyses, though I am now not 100% sure that this
is correct. As a side-bar this should probably be ‘other psychiatric disorders’ rather than
comorbidity to cover all 3 populations.
In the second paragraph on page 14 the authors speculate that the association between a
stressful event (and not disorder) and CVD events (which has been shown in a number of
previous studies) might be mediated by severe emotional reactions. However, the data
they have make it hard to make this assertion. To be able to study this they would have
needed to have 2 groups of individuals who experienced stressful events and then
compared those who developed a PTSD or similar disorder vs. those that didn’t. I
understand where the authors are going with this, but there is some tempering of this
assumption which is needed in this paragraph.
At the end of the 2nd paragraph on page 15 the authors argue that because their analyses
show similar patterns with acute CVD events as well as non-acute events that this
‘diminishes the possible impact of surveillance bias or reverse causality.’ I’m not sure why
this would be the case, especially for surveillance bias. Furthermore, the fact that heart
failure had one of the largest HRs within the first year would strongly suggest reverse
causation (HF is unlikely to be caused in a 6 month window) but this is not offset by the
findings from the acute events (NB. the HRs for the acute events of MI, hemorrhagic
stroke, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy were all lower than would be expected compared
other events). I think most people will appreciate the limitation, without diminishing the
importance of the findings, if that sentence was removed.
Minor comments.
The authors use the term gender to describe their population. However, gender is a
complex psychosocial construct made up of a number different facets. If this is truly what
the authors studied then they should provide details of their conceptualisation of gender
and the measures they used to assess it. Alternatively, if they used sex, which is an
anatomical/physiological construct usually represented as a binary man/woman variable,
then they should adjust their terminology within the manuscript.
There are some inconsistencies in the tables with the use of decimal places which should
be corrected.
Figure 2, the forest plots, should be on the same scale so has to help comparisons.
