1 OVERVIEW
==========
Title: "Comparative effectiveness of biologics in rheumatoid
arthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis including
re-analysed individual patient data"
In this report from the German health technology assessment institute
(IQWiG), the authors systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed 38 RCTs
on biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) use in
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after methotrexate (MTX) failure. Among
these, 2 studies involved direct bDMARDs comparison. The remaining 36
were comparison of bDMARDs+MTX and placebo+MTX, contributing indirect
comparison information via the common comparators of placebo+MTX (see
Figure 2).
To standardize the results from RCTs spanning 1997-2011 (by start
date), the authors requested the study sponsor entities to re-analyze
individual-level data. Specifically, the re-analysis focused on a
(sub)population of adult (>= 18 years) RA patients being treated with
bDMARDs+MTX failure. The typical efficacy outcome definitions changed
over time, the outcome analyses were standardized with clinical
disease activity index (CDAI) remission and low disease activity.
Based mostly on indirect comparisons in network meta-analysis, the
authors compared 8 bDMARDs (anakinra, infliximab, adalimumab,
etanercept, certolizumab pegol, golimumab, abatacept, and tocilizumab)
for various efficacy and safety outcomes. They found that anakinra was
significantly lower proportion of CDAI remission and/or CDAI low
disease activity to all other bDMARDs except for etanercept, which did
have similar point estimate to others. The authors also report that
certolizumab pegol had statistically significantly higher proportions
of serious adverse events and/or infections compared to all other
bDMARDs. No other (mostly indirect) comparisons yielded statistically
significant results for these outcome although infliximab did have RR
estimates consistently greater than 1.0 (favorable direction) for CDAI
remission and CDAI low disease activity against all other bDMARDs
(only statistically significant against anakinra).
This large-scale network meta-analysis study is a useful contribution
overall, particularly because of the re-analysis efforts that went
beyond what had been reported in each study. I have some minor points
for clarification.

3 INTRODUCTION
==============
- "Treatment options for RA include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic
drugs (DMARDs) .": Neither NSAIDs nor corticosteroids are viable
treatment choices in the absence of DMARDs. So stating them in
parallel like this is inappropriate. For this sentence, please cite
the latest ACR [singh2015AmericanCollege2016] and EULAR
[smolenEULARRecommendationsManagement2017] recommendations and
mention the cornerstone role DMARDs play in the up-to-date practice.

4 METHODS
=========
- I could not tell whether the author acquired individual-level data
and re-analyzed data themselves or asked the sponsor companies to
conduct the requested re-analyses using in-house individual-level
data (authors do not have access to individual-level data). Please
clarify what the authors did vs what the sponsors did.

4.1 Search strategy and study selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- marketing authorization holders (MAH): Please explain which
regulatory agencies were considered for this. Are these companies
that received authorization by EMA? Also the abbreviation should be
avoided if possible.
- "two types of reanalyses for the studies included were requested
from the study sponsors": Did IQWiG have some authority to enforce
this or was this provided by the study sponsors on voluntary
basis. What was the response rate?
- Did the authors require a common definition of RA for this study?
Did all the study included use the 1987
[arnettAmericanRheumatismAssociation1988] criteria based RA? Did any
of them focus on early arthritis?

4.2 Data extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- public commenting procedure: Please provide some description (when?
duration? language(s)?).
- "DAS includes inflammatory parameters that may be influenced more by
some biologics than by others": I believe the authors are talking
about tocilizumab's (more) direct influence on inflammatory
markers. Some more detail with citations may be useful here.

4.3 Data synthesis and statistical analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- "assumptions of similarity, homogeneity, and consistency":

References would be helpful here. As the readership is expected to
be wide for this paper, briefly explaining when indirect comparisons
via a common comparators is valid and how validity can be violated
(here or in the Discussion) .

5 RESULTS
=========
5.1 Study characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- A brief mention of the year range of the studies (provided in sTable
3) may give a better sense of how the practice changed during that
period if the space permits.
- Can the authors mention briefly how many studies went through
eligibility re-definition (subpopulation re-analysis) and why?

6 Discussion
============
6.1 Principal findings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- "DAS28 remission criteria": I believe more than 20 swollen joints
are permitted at 2.6 if other elements remain at their minimum
values (although unlikely).
- "The choice of a specific biologic should therefore be based on
relevant patient characteristics (if possible)": Somewhat more
concrete discussion or a pointer may be helpful
here. [singh2015AmericanCollege2016] has some comments based on
comorbidities.

6.2 Strengths and limitations of this study
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- "severely ill patients": Something along the line of "RA patients
with high disease activity" might be better suited here.
