Thank-you for allowing me to review this manuscript by Janke and colleagues. The paper is
an NMA of biologic therapy for RA after MTX failure. The study is unique in that it had
access to and used IPD. Overall the methods are appropriate and the NMA conducted using
standard approaches.
Major comments:
1) Impact of IPD: One of the main novel aspects is the access to individual patient data.
However, the IPD here is not used in an IPD-NMA (which would have been potentially very
interesting, and what I had thought when initially reading the title of the paper), but rather
to re-analyze the study data, then include the summary effects from each trial in the NMA.
While this did allow for the inclusion of CDAI outcomes, the overall impact of having IPD,
from a clinical perspective, is somewhat marginal. At the end of the day, the pair-wise
comparisons between biologics are still very uncertain, similar to other published NMAs. I
think the manuscript could also be improved by clarifying, for each analyses, how often the
IPD (vs. published data) was used
2) Recency of search: The search was conducted in 2017 and excludes several newer
biologics/tsDMARDs, and several head-to-head trials of existing biologics that would
strengthen the network. The authors discuss this, but it remains an important limitation.
Minor comments:
1) Please clarify how the quality appraisal system used relates to more commonly known
approaches (e.g. GRADE)
2) How were adaptive designs handled? Many of these trials use an ‘early escape’ design,
where patients in the placebo arm with an inadequate response cross over to active
treatment
3) I think the language used when describing CDAI as the optimal outcome is a bit strong;
other definitions of remission are still valid, and appropriate to use.
4) Page 8, lines 22-23: clarify what is meant by ‘if the estimates from an indirect
comparison were confirmed by the estimates from a direct comparison…’
5) In the discussion, please clarify what you mean by ‘did not report results on tests for the
assumptions of the NMA’ (page 14, line 19)
