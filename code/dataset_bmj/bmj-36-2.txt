Dear editor and authors,
Thank you for the opportunity to read this manuscript that has the potential to contribute to
the rapidly evolving evidence on the epidemiology and outcomes of CoV-2.
I think that, overall, your manuscript is original and would be of important to general
readers. However, there are a number of areas within the manuscript that need further
thinking, clarification and/or editing to meet the BMJ’s exacting standards and to provide its
readers with scientifically reliable and original evidence. Below are my questions, comments
and suggestions for your consideration, presented sequentially and by manuscript section.
I remain at your disposal, should you require any clarification.
Sincerely,
Dr. Elizabeth Rolland-Harris
Methods
In your methods, could you please include some information on the hospital setting where
these cases were encountered? This is fairly standard practice (Jang et al., 2004,
doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2003.09.004; Wang et al., 2004; doi:10.3201/eid1005.030640; Huang et
al., 2020, doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5)

In your lab methods, could you specify the target genes and reaction mixtures, as this level
of detail has been presented in other manuscripts that are similar to yours (e.g., Huang et
al., 2020, doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5 ; Wang et al., 2020,
doi:10.1001/jama.2020.1585)
In your lab methods, did medium loads require confirmation by retesting? If yes, please
specify; if no, why not/what alternate protocol was in place?
Were your statistical analyses adjusted for multiple comparisons? Please clarify.
Unsure what BMJ limits are on tables, but would argue that the definitions and clinical
thresholds for complications (Page 10, lines 151-171) would be more succinct and efficiently
presented in tabular format.

Results
You present a large number of laboratory parametres in your text. Given the large volume, I
would encourage you to report only on the parametres that are significantly different
between the two groups or that are clinically surprising, and refer your reader to the table
that captures the rest.
Lines 215-218 are unclear. Please edit (it may be easier to present close contact vs HCW
results separately)
Line 221-222 is unclear (“Moreover, less fatal 222 cases (37.4%) had their first visit to
hospital within 3 days than recovered cases (60.0%).) Perhaps change to “Moreover, fatal
cases were less likely to visit the hospital within 3 days than cases that subsequently
recovered (37.4% vs 60.0%).”
Line 223, when describing signs/symptoms in fatal cases - I think that it would be important
to preface this with a statement that states that fever and cough were the most prevalent
symptoms in both subgroups, and that the proportion of individuals reporting these
symptoms were very similar. Then, it would be fine to discuss the other (more prevalent)
signs/symptoms in the fatal cases.
Re: Laboratory parameters of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with different clinical outcomes
– when were these measured? If measured post-admission, were they measured at the
same timepoints for fatal and non-fatal cases? I.e., are we sure that these reported
differences are true clinical differences versus differences due to measurement at different
time points? Or are all cases classified as “ever developing” any of these clinical outcomes
during the hospitalization? Please clarify.
Lines 261-263, do not start paragraph with “though” as the sentence does offer the
counterargument that should follow a “though” statement.
Lines 261-263, you state that the lack of statistical difference in cTnI levels is likely because
of two outliers. Did you remove these from your analysis to see whether this was actually
the case? (sensitivity analysis) – it is easy enough to do; you should do it so that you can
make a statement of fact, rather than present a supposition.
Lines 268-269, I would suggest that you change the sentence structure to be clearer. For
example, instead of stating “The median prothrombin time (PT) but not activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT) was significantly longer in fatal cases than in recovered cases”,
perhaps present it like this: “The median prothrombin time (PT) was significantly longer in
fatal cases than in recovered cases; no significant difference was noted for activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT).”

Line 278 – “Of patients with available data” – please specify the n. It is also unclear whether
lab results in general were available for the whole cohort. If not, this should be stated from
the outset, so that the reader knows that some of these values may be biased (e.g., some
values could be underestimates as more severe cases were tested less thoroughly as a result
of clinical resources being preferentially allocated to supportive measures).
Line 280-281 – “While majority (97.2%) of fatal cases had undetectable levels of interleukin
(IL)-1β.” – incomplete sentence
How was mortality reported for the fatal cases? Was CoV-2 the underlying/contributing COD
with other conditions being reported as the immediate COD? If yes, what types/proportions
of immediate CODs were reported? (this is also a circuitous way to ask what proportion of
cases were due to cardiac complications, renal complications, ARDS, septic shock, etc.)
Table 1 – “Signs and Symptoms” at onset? At admission? Clinically confirmed? Please
specify.
Table 4 includes treatments – presumably individuals could receive >1 treatment? It would
be helpful to know how many individuals in both subgroups received 1+ of the more
aggressive treatments.
Tables 3 and 4 include SUBSTANTIAL missing values. I do not think that presenting findings
on less than a quarter of cases (e.g., Table 3) is epidemiologically sound, especially when
there is no subsequent discussion of the underlying bias that this may introduce nor any
effort to mitigate it. (I discuss this further below).

Discussion
At the start of your discussion (lines 333-336), it is important to reiterate what your main
findings were, but there is no need to present values again (i.e., these sentences [“Overall
fatality rate of confirmed COVID-19 is 2.3%, with 2.8% for males versus 1.7% for females.
And the risk of death rises with age, the highest fatality rate is for people aged 80 and older,
at 14.8%.”] should be presented like this: “The overall fatality rate for confirmed COVID-19
cases was found to be (significantly?) higher in males than in females, with the risk of death
rising with age for both sexes. The highest fatality rate was in individuals aged 80 and
above.”)
Lines 352-353 – not sure what this statement means; please clarify: “and also because
these patients may have early awareness of disease.”
Lines 355-356 – “Delay in health-care seeking might contribute to high level of mortality” –
do you have a reference to support this supposition?
In your discussion of your study limitations, do you not acknowledge that some of your
findings may be biased as a result of missing information, For example, when presenting the
prevalence of different complications (Table 4), you are missing information for as many as
103 cases (50/70 fatal cases, 53/67 recovered cases). The same was true for Table 3, where
you only had information on approximately a quarter of all cases. How do you think that
these missing data may bias your results? Is this bias differential or non-differential?
Much of the content of the discussion merely repeats results, without providing any
compare/contrast with existing evidence. I encourage you to consult the BMJ’s very clear
guidance on what the discussion should include:
• Statement of principal findings
• Strengths and weaknesses of the study
• Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies, discussing important differences in
results

• Meaning of the study: possible explanations and implications for clinicians and
policymakers
• Unanswered questions and future research
• Please ensure that the discussion section of your article comprises no more than a page
and a half.

I would encourage you to edit your discussion to reflect these requirements.

Editorial comments
Month names should be fully spelled out in the body of the text (i.e., February, not “Feb”).
Other abbreviations (e.g., “min” for minute) should also be spelled out in the body of the
text.
Spell out acronyms the first time they are used (e.g., ARDS).
Need to be consistent with use of symbols versus text for “less than,” “greater than,” etc. If
symbols are systematically used, the spacing between the text, symbol and values should
also be consistent.
BMJ submissions normally include “key messages/What this paper adds” sections. None were
submitted.
