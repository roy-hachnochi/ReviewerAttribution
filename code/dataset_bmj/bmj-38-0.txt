Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this manuscript. This is a very
interesting article that investigates the adherence to the 2018 physical activity guidelines
and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: prospective cohort study of pooled data from
0.48 million US adults. I believe that this article is important in the physical activity field
especially because of new findings regarding the 2018 physical activity guidelines in US
adults. In regard to the existing literature, this article adds new insight, but I do have
major concerns specific to this manuscript, especially concerning the results and discussion
section. As a matter of fact, the data deserve to be better exploited and discussed in this
manuscript, which would require reworking the discussion section. Moreover, the message
that the authors are trying to share is unclear and deserves to be reworked in order to be
useful to clinicians, researchers and US adults. In its current state, the design of this study
seems to be appropriate and adequate to answer authors’ questions but cannot be
recommended for publication. However, this manuscript deserves to be improved by the
authors, especially the discussion section. You will find my comments below.
- Title: could you please specify the exact number of US adults instead of 0.48 million US
adults.
- Abstract (participants) line 16: could you please specify the age range of your
population?
- Abstract (results) line 43: please change “confidence interval” to “95% CI”
- Abstract (conclusion): In accordance with the physical activity guidelines, more physical
activity provides greater health benefits. This may be important to add this perspective at
the end of your abstract (conclusion)
- Keywords: please add the term, “guidelines”

- Introduction (first paragraph) line 16: Could you please specify the percentage of
healthcare expenditure in US in regard to the healthcare systems worldwide.
- Introduction (second paragraph) line 38-39: because you used the term “limited
evidence”, this seems to assume that there is evidence available in the literature. Please
add references.
- Introduction (second paragraph) line 46: Please change “results inconsistent” to
“inconsistent results”
- Introduction (second paragraph) line 46-48: Please specify in which countries some
studies demonstrated a significant reduction in all-cause mortality by meeting the
recommended PA levels, while others did not.
- Introduction (second paragraph) line 50: Please rewrite the sentence line 50
“Furthermore, only few studies […] attributed to physical inactivity”. Indeed, “only few
studies is not justified when you refer to four different articles publish recently.
- Methods (study population, second paragraph) line 35: You indicate that among the
529,363 participants, 49,507 were excluded. This should be discussed in the article or at
least clarified in the limitations since this represents about 10% of your population.
- Methods (study population, second paragraph) line 37: In accordance with the 2018
physical activity guidelines, pregnant women should accumulate at least 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity physical activity each week to achieve clinically meaningful health
benefits and reductions in pregnancy complications. Please clarify why being pregnant was
an exclusion criterion.
- Methods (study population, second paragraph) line 39: Please clarify the reason of
missing data on aerobic PA and muscle-strengthening activity.
- Methods (study exposure, first paragraph) line 53-58: Because leisure time aerobic PA
was defined using self-reported responses, this is a limitation which deserves to be better
explained in the limitation section.
- Methods (study exposure, first paragraph) line 60: Please clarify and reference why you
chose “10 minutes”.
- Methods (study exposure, first paragraph) line 60: Please clarify the METs equivalent in
regard to the aerobic PA categorization. This will help the reader to better understand your
data and will increase the reach of your findings.
- Methods (study outcome: mortality) line 46: Could you please add the reference of your
“probabilistic record matching method”. If it is the reference number 11 do not take my
comment into consideration.
- Methods (study outcome: mortality) line 56: Please add the reference in regard to the
Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases.
- Methods (statistical analyse) line 42: Please, if you have a reference, add one after “each
of 18 waves (1997-2014).
- Results (population characteristics) line 18: The Percentage of US adults engaged in both
sufficient aerobic PA and sufficient muscle-strengthening activity deserves to be more
discussed in the discussion section.
- Results (population characteristics) line 18-22: Please add a Figure (supplemental
material for example) about the distribution of US adults engaged or not engaged in PA
with age distribution.
- Results (PA adherence and all-cause and cause-specific mortality) Tables and Figures:
Please add the results of your statistical analysis (p-value) in your tables and figures
- Results (PA adherence and all-cause and cause-specific mortality): Please specify which
modality has the most impact in the following sentence: “In addition, participants who
adhered […] who were non-adherent”. Please add specific p-value
- Results (PA adherence and all-cause and cause-specific mortality): Please add p-value for
each covariate because “we found significant interactions” is not precise enough. Maybe it
will be useful to add a table.
- Results (Subgroup analyses): This section needs to be more exploited. Please add your
statistical analysis results (p-value).

- Discussion: Overall, the data deserve to be better exploited and discussed in this
manuscript, which would require reworking the discussion section.
- Discussion (first paragraph): “We found that adults who engaged in both […]
cause-specific mortality”. In the absence of p-value it is difficult to agree with “had reduced
risk”. This paragraph needs to be reinforced.
- Discussion (first paragraph) line 5-10: In accordance to Figure 1, the effects are less
when it is alone than together. Could you please add p-value and % of the effect of one
modality compared to another?
- Discussion (first paragraph) line 16-18: Indeed, this study provides evidence to support
the levels of PA recommended in the 2018 guidelines for greater survival, but these
findings need to be interpreted in a context of limitations since the Table 1 indicates that
more than 260,000 US adults were classified in “neither”.
- Discussion (compared with other studies) line 24-31: This is very contradictory with your
introduction. Please clarify.
- Discussion (compared with other studies): This section needs to be rewritten because you
do not discuss your results. Indeed, I do not understand the relevance of presenting three
studies without discussing your results. Your results are very interesting for the reader and
deserve to be better exploited and discussed. Please consider this comment.
- Discussion (compared with other studies) second paragraph: This paragraph must be
renamed “Clinical perspective”
- Discussion (compared with other studies) second paragraph, line 35: Could you please
add reference after “… sufficient levels of PA”
- Discussion (compared with other studies) second paragraph, line 35: Could you please
add reference after “… thereby reducing future mortality risk”
- Discussion (compared with other studies) second paragraph, line 46-54: Need to be
reinforced in regard to the literature and the PA guidelines. How do your results reinforce
this?
- Discussion (compared with other studies) second paragraph, line 56-58: Could you please
specify “regular PA based on their abilities” and please can you discuss your results.
- Discussion (strengths and limitations of study) line 7: Please add the exact number.
- Discussion (strengths and limitations of study) line 12: Please add a reference after “…
consistent methodology”
- Discussion (strengths and limitations of study) line 14-22: Why is having self-reported
data a limit and why is not having accelerometer data a limit? Please discussed this in the
limitation section.
- Discussion (strengths and limitations of study) line 28-33: Could you please develop this
limitation.
- Discussion (strengths and limitations of study): Overall, this study needs to be
interpreted in a context of limitations given its scope for US adults. This should be
addressed in the discussion.
- Discussion (Conclusion): Because this study needs to be interpreted in a context of
limitations, I do not agree with the following sentence “Our findings provide evidence in
support of the recommendations of the 2018 PA guideline to increase life expectancy of US
adults”. Please consider removing the sentence.
- What is already known on this topic: This sentence is not consistent with your discussion.
Please consider rewritting this sentence.
- What this study adds: This following sentence “Our findings support that the PA levels […]
provide significant survival benefits” needs to be reinforced in the results section with the
addition of p-values because you used the term of “significant”.
