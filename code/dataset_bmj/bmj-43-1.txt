Its an interesting perspective and certainly one that is quite useful.
There are a few aspects that require either rephrasing or clarification in terms the claims
made using the paper. For example, the authors claim there ADNEX is better than CA125
and yet the study has been performed in 17 centres with moderate sample size. If the
authors claim is that this study adds to the understanding of how we review the distinction
between benign and malignant tumours using ADNEX vs CA 125, perhaps it needs to be
said that this is also requires further investigation using more sites. As CA125 is considered
as a gold standard in most healthcare systems globally, one needs to be able to showcase
the relevance of ADNEX in a much bigger sample size to obtain statistical significance and
generalisability. For example, Whipps Cross centre in UK is one centre that is not as large
as some of the bigger centres for this cohort of patients. If the authors intention is for
ADNEX to be used globally, then this step becomes quite important.
The paper also stipulates the following;
"Model predictions are based on
information obtained at the inclusion scan and hence are blinded to the outcome. " The
information obtained from the inclusion scan would need to be standardised and accepted
by the Oncology/Gynae community, was this the case by all clinicians within the 17 centres
?
The paper also claims that patients were not involved within the study design, definition of
outcomes with the exception of the a focus group within the university. ADNEX appears to
be a useful model in the clinical context, therefore, it is imperative to have both user and
patient buy-in. The fact that this wasnt considered is a limitation in the study and if the

aim is to introduce this method to globally or atleast within Europe, patient public
involvement is key. In the UK, patient public involvement is vital for this type of model to
be introduced and certainly NICE/NIHR/NHS would want to see the reasons for excluding
them.
I also noted the word "discriminate" being used often, perhaps, it would be better to use
the term, 'determine' instead when trying to distinguish between benign and malignant
tumours.
"ADNEX with CA125 was the best ultrasound-based model for discrimination between
benign and malignant adnexal masses in all patients presenting with an adnexal mass."
This phrase, in line with my comments above perhaps require re-phrasing.
Was there any data collected to showcase that the site level services are able to
accommodate ADNEX as a clinical tool to be used in the future? This would be a very useful
facet to have.
I would recommend this paper to be published as it is useful and quite an important one
for this cohort of patients who otherwise would rely on a method that is quite prone to
errors. The concept of this study is very much a strength and the research question is
appropriate to showcase an answer to a 'real world' problem. However, some areas of the
paper will require re-phrasing and a limitations section would be useful which clearly
highlights the drawbacks of the study conducted to ensure readers understand the model
and its current applicability. This section would also provide the authors to think about how
they'd introduce this model to clinical practice and perhaps continue researching this
further to ensure it's use is maximised appropriately.
