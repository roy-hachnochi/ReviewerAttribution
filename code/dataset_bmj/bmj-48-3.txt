This is a timely article. The coronavirus pandemic has underlined the importance of mitigation strategies
as management tools. Unfortunately the best part of the paper (commencing at page 11) appears to be
in the appendix which seems a great pity since it is a valuable resource and I wonder if BMJ would allow
its inclusion in the body of publication. If not I would suggest at least combining and expanding Box 2
and 3 such that the mitigation strategy proposed is shown as being in direct response to a potential
impact.
Perhaps some important social/health impacts have been missed - I am not sure what is happening
currently in Scotland but based on the Australian experience the following impacts:
1.Before home isolation is recommended there was already reduced opportunities to exercise due to
suspension of sports programs and closure of sporting facilities. This compounded with the impact of
home isolation must impact exercise patterns.
2.Individuals may be less likely to seek medical help for emerging health issues if this requires physically
presenting at a GP facility.
3.Population screening programs may be suspended with consequent missed diagnoses.
There are some recommendations which could be included, apologies if I missed them in the table, e.g.
schools might be kept open with selected core teaching staff for the children of all workers who cannot
work from home (this has happened in Australia); limits on online gambling; local council involvement in
neighbourhood support programs; social messaging (beyond simple ‘advice’), for example, with
encouragement for daily walks or in-home exercise; and on-line or telephone consults with GPs. In
Australia the government introduced additional Medicare items for on-line consults.
There appears to be a word missing on page 6 second paragraph so "rapid scoping" should be “rapid
scoping review”
