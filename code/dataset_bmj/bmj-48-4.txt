The article is relevant and adds to the growing body of literature on the topic. The table is particularly
useful and is not referenced sufficiently in the text. My key issue is that the authors are making a

number of generalist statements that are not supported by any literature or data. I would be keen for
the authors to go back and review the literature to identify whether there is evidence to support what
they are postulating as outcomes of this COVID-19 pandemic. For some of the statements, there is
literature available from SARS and also from 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. While acknowledging that
this is a rapid review, it also needs to have evidence to support what is being proposed.
