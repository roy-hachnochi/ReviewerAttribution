Overall:
Excellent and interesting, commendable blend of work and pragmatism. Methodology aside are you
producing some sort of compendium of recommendations on various topics that you plan to keep up to
date?
Specifics (+ pros, - cons):
+ registering on PROSPERO
+ use of AGREE II
+ v. interesting comparision with MERS/SARS, particularly the point that the excuse of 'we've got to get
this out early, will get better methods later' doesn't seem to hold up
+ no 'Only in English' criteria
- 14 March cut-off, any plans to run an update search immediately prior to publication? It's obviously
such a fast moving world right now. NICE have produced some guidance in the last couple weeks that I
am aware of
- why did you choose to restrict to care of patients in terms of topic? It seems that system level
decisions (e.g. prioritisation rules, diagnostics) are more pertinent given the lack of specific treatment
options available
- any more detail on what 'an extensive grey literature search' means? A lot of Googling? Often the case
in my experience and often very appropriate
- I see you note that recommendations were often non-specific, turning to hospital or regional level
guidelines (while a large piece of work) may be a solution for finding more specific recommendations as
healthcare professionals actually try and enact the generic guidance
- formatting of Table 3 a bit messy ( couple of double .., variable use of . at end of statement in cells
etc)
- I don't think AGREE II results are meant to be reported as out of 600%, if you are really keen on using
%, would suggest at least dividing by 6 to make the numbers less odd looking
- Table 4, feels like it should be either steroids or antimicrobials but not both. Also would be good to
have at least one or two words on what each of the references in the evidence base column are (e.g.
RCT (unlikely), non-randomised cohort, consensus statement)
- Table 5 should say Spain not Spanish
