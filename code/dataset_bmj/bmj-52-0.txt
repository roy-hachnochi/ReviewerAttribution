The authors have provided some detailed responses to reviewer/editorial comments. Some of the
understanding of this paper and indeed the 'science' behind the approach relies on previous research
carried out by the authors - I think this has now been adequately addressed.

However, I do still have a slight niggling issue (as did most reviewers) about the diagnostic test
accuracy measures presented. The most common measures (sensitivity/specificity) and others were not
reported in this paper (even though they were listed in the initial draft). The authors in their response
suggested this was an oversight and referred to a protocol (Ref 9). The protocol is however vague and
mentions only 'diagnostic test accuracy measures' will be used. The same authors also conducted a
review and meta-analysis on this topic (Ref 5). In this review Sens/Spec was a measure of choice - this
does raise some signals around selective reporting. Perhaps the saving grace is that the authors do
present the TP, FP, FN and TN values so in theory, readers could compute these metrics. Does the
presentation of these results tell a different story though? To remove and suspicion, it might be worth
including them given they are relatively simple to compute.
Methods - when using backward selection is not more common to uses a retention p-value of <0.1
rather than <0.05. I'm not suggesting repeat the analysis (as this can be seen as arbitrary) - but would
it have made any difference?
Appendix 2/3 - what are the denominator values?
The authors use pre-defined rules for PLRs and NLRs. This authors comments on the point estimates
which is fine, but you may also want to comment on the uncertainty (i.e. confidence intervals). As an
example, while 'raised calcium' did not reach a PLR of 5, the confidence interval includes this value.
I think Table 5 is referred to before 4 in the text.
