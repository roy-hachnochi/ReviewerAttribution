Good paper. The science is great - can't fault it (though it's not really my field).
But the language is a bit hard to follow. I suspect written in haste with limited
attention to who will be reading it and their points of departure. Even the concept
of 'viral load' wasn't in many people's vocabulary till recently. Can you re-draft and
give it a stronger sense of audience? Speak to the GP on the Clapham omnibus
type thing? And bear in mind all the journalists who are in headless chicken mode
right now - I've just put the phone down to one from a leading right-wing
broadsheet who had gleaned an extraordinary message from a BMJ Analysis piece
I'd written recently (not clearly enough for him, is my point).
