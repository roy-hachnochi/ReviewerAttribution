<strong>Introduction</strong>
This study uses immediately-accessible mortality and population data from a single small
town in Italy to estimate the excess mortality due to COVID-19 in March 2020, and
presents some stark findings about the impact of the virus on the town. Although a simple
descriptive study, it shows clearly and simply the consequences of this disease. It is a
well-conducted and simple study of importance to public health planners and should be
published as soon as possible. I have made some recommendations for improved
estimation of uncertainty, application of the estimates to a broader national/global
perspective, and a stronger conclusion. Thank you for the opportunity to read this paper.
<strong>Major comments</strong>
<em>Effect of evacuation on population</em>: I have experience analyzing mortality in
small towns after major events, and one of the key lessons I gained from my own
experience (in rural Japan after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami) is that
population of small towns can change very rapidly after a major event. Is it possible that
the population of Nembro changed significantly during February, perhaps immediately
before the lockdown was implemented? It would be helpful if the authors were to discuss
this possibility, both in their population estimates and in the discussion. I assume there is
some media reporting on this that they are aware of, and if so could they do a sensitivity
analysis to capture the potential effect of this change? Although it is tempting to avoid this
discussion because it further inflates the numbers, it is important to take into account the
possibility that the observed deaths occurred in an even smaller risk pool.
<em>Mortality ascertainment</em>: A question arises about the definition of coronavirus
death. Countries like UK are considering all corona virus positive deaths as Covid-19
related deaths regardless of the immediate cause of the death. To simplify this, a
coronavirus positive person who died of heart attack is also considered a Covid-19 death.
Thus, the number of deaths that is attributed to Covid-19 could be a result of
ascertainment bias, a bias which is likely to happen in an epidemic. Could the authors
clarify how COVID-19 mortality is ascertained in Italy, and how certain we can be that the
non-COVID deaths really are due to other causes?

<em>Measurement of uncertainty</em>: The number of deaths in this study is small –
approximately 10 per month in the pre-COVID period – and this naturally leads to large
uncertainty in estimates of rates. In particular figure 2 would look quite different if
uncertainty is taken into account. It is not difficult to calculate confidence intervals for the
number of events in a Poisson process, and to report 95% confidence intervals. Also, and
relatedly, it would be useful to smooth figure 2 slightly. I recommend the authors calculate
3 month average mortality rates, using the pooled number of deaths and person-years of
risk (so that there are approximately 30 deaths in each 3 month period, with

correspondingly narrower 95% Cis). These could be presented as bars and grey areas on
the figure. This would enable comparison of more stable figures alongside the stark
changes in the bar chart itself.
<em>Measurement of increased mortality risk</em>: Alongside this, I think it should be
quite easy to do a simple calculation of incident rate ratios for each 3 month period relative
to a baseline, with 95% confidence intervals, using for example a simple Poisson
regression. This would help to show that the mortality rate is consistently stable in the
period leading up to the epidemic.
<em>Calculation of numerical comparators</em>: The results are striking, but the Italian
epidemic is not finished yet and if anything the paper underestimates the impact of the
epidemic. I would like to see some comparators prepared (along with uncertainty
estimates) so that we can understand just how bad the impact of this virus will be. IN
particular:
• Extension to April/May: we know that mortality is delayed from infection by a couple of
weeks, and the epidemic only really began in Italy in early March, so it is reasonable to
suppose that elevated mortality will continue into April and May. I think the authors should
do some back of the envelope calculations of the potential increased mortality in April (at
least) and May (if possible) based on some rough calculations of the number of cases, and
make a basic projection of the total mortality burden in Nembro (with uncertainty).
• Annual increase: Based on the average mortality rate in 2019 and the population, the
authors should be able to estimate the excess deaths that will be observed in 2020 and the
proportion of these that will be due to COVID-19 (with uncertainty!) Just basic eyeballing
of Figure 2 suggests that there will be twice as many deaths in 2020 as 2019. That should
be reported!
• National or regional extrapolation: Based on an estimate of a rate (with uncertainty) of
excess mortality, and given that we know the number of recorded deaths of COVID-19 in
both Nembro and nationally, it should be possible to obtain a crude estimate of the number
of excess deaths to be expected nationally, and the proportion due to COVID-19 or
preventable mortality from other causes. It should be possible to then make some broad
statements about the expected impact globally, assuming similar patterns in most
developed countries
<em>A punchier conclusion</em>: Given the impact of this pandemic, and the absolutely
shocking way in which western governments have failed to deal with it, the conclusion of
this article is extremely weak. Instead of finishing with a statement about the value of the
metric they have used, I think the authors should finish with a strong final paragraph about
the implications of their findings for floundering western governments, and also what it
tells us in hindsight about the early statements from various political authorities, from
President Trump to Prime Minister Johnson and various mayors (such as Cuomo in New
York and Khan in London). Given the devastation that this disease has wrought on small
towns throughout Italy and Iran, and the likely enormous death toll in other western
countries, it would be remiss of the authors not to use this opportunity to point out how
incredibly stupid the early response has been. If the editors or authors are not comfortable
with editorializing within a research article, then a strongly-worded accompanying
comment should be considered. It is an absolute scandal that this kind of death has been
allowed to occur in any rich country, and as public health researchers we should be making
that point loud and clear in our research articles. I hope the authors will consider adding a
paragraph to this effect in their conclusions.
<em>Discussion of the limitations of studies in small towns</em>: Nembro is a small
town and the average monthly mortality rate is low, leading naturally to concerns about
both unique local conditions and the possibility of over-estimation of mortality increases
due to the small size. The authors should add more information on this in the discussion,
along perhaps with some mitigating factors – is Nembro representative of an Italian town,
are there any local assessments of the likelihood of its health system being overwhelmed

by any public health emergencies, and how does it compare with other towns and cities in
the region? Do the authors think the same findings could be expected in a larger Italian
town, or in a mega-city?

<strong>Minor comments</strong>
<em>Remove or edit figure 1</em>: I don’t think Figure 1 adds much to the paper, and it
definitely exaggerates the magnitude of change in the town. Consider modifying it by
either extending the y-axis, shifting to a log-scale, or remove it altogether (or put as a
supplementary figure).
<em>Remove or edit figure 3</em>: I don’t think figure 3 adds much either, and I think
it is better moved to a supplement or dropped. In any case I recommend using different
colours to Figure 2, to ensure no confusion between sex categories and covid/non-covid
categories (but please don’t use blue and pink!)
<em>Remove early age groups from figure 5</em>: I think it is better to just present the
later age groups in Figure 4, since the early age groups are just empty space, and their
inclusion makes all the other graphs hard to read.
<em>What are the other causes?</em>: I am interested in the breakdown of major
causes of death in the years before 2020 and in March 2020. What were the major causes
of excess mortality? Although not immediately useful, this information might help future
researchers to investigate epidemic preparedness plans. For example, is suicide an
increased cause in March 2020?
