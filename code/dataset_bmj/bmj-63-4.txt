This paper provides an informative and convincing argument, in favour of using all-cause
mortality as a reported metric for COVID-19. Furthermore, it is written in a style that is
accessible to a variety of audiences. To facilitate involvement of patients/carers in this
study, perhaps the author could have consulted patient organizations for feedback on these
measures.

Although this paper is not directly relevant to patients and/or carers, if all-cause mortality
is incorporated by healthcare organizations responsible for the dissemination of COVID-19
related data, this would provide the public (including patients and carers) with a better
understanding of the pandemic burden. In turn, this may encourage better cooperation
with public health measures such as social distancing and/or quarantines to combat the
crisis. If available, this paper would benefit from the inclusion of examples where all-cause
mortality has been used in other pandemics and/or health crises.
