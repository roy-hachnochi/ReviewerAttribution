- With regard to the best way of assessing actual sodium consumption (lines 103-143):
Presumably, mean sodium content of 3-7 24-hr urine collections will reflect sodium intake
most accurately of all currently available alternatives. Clearly, such an approach has its

limits in clinic and in large study populations. Now the question rises how we should move
on forwards. I think it would be most helpful for the readers to give a brief consideration
to this question. What would the authors recommend? Are there alternative approaches
available?
- Lines 112-121. Could provide the authors references to the literature?
- In their discussion of the DASH-trial (line 156-162), TOHP trail and others (185-193), in
which sodium diets were compared, unanticipated changes in other nutrients relevant for
the studied outcome measures should be acknowledged briefly in my opinion. Also,
discussion of how the adherence to the sodium diets was assessed should be discussed
here, I think.
- In the discussion of the U- or J-shaped curve found in observational studies, the authors
correctly state that ‘more long-term observational follow-up studies with multiple 24-hour
urinary excretion measures could help’ (line 289). A reference to support this is lacking.
The author may want to cite the study of Olde Engberink et al in Circulation
2017;136(10):917-926. This study showed not only that the use of subsequent 24-hour
urine samples resulted in different estimations of an individual's sodium intake as
compared with single 24-hour urine samples (while population averages remained
similar), but also that the shape of the association depended on the number of samples
used.
Minor comments:
- Line 82. I was a bit confused by the statement that ‘salt binds to water’. What do the
authors mean?
- Line 87. About the minimal need of sodium: could the authors provide an amount?
- Line 125-126. The study of Lerchl et al seems to be wrongly cited. This study showed
that 92% of the sodium intake over a period of both 105 and 205 days could be retrieved
in the 24-hour urine collections during both respective periods. The point of this study was
that only one 24-hour urine sample, which is widely used now and considered to be
golden standard, could not accurately retrieve the actually consumed sodium.
- Line 138. Reference 17, which discusses an animal study. Although not very much
human studies are available, I would think that referring to human studies is much more
convincing for the point the authors want to make.
- Line 203-206. I am missing the point the authors want to make here. Consider
rephrasing.
- Line 251. The authors may want to briefly explain references 40 and 41.
