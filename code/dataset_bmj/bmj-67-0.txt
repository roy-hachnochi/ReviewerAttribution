1.Is Reference #1 the one to which the conclusion in line 46 "With the global epidemic..." is
attributed?
2.In my opinion, a comment or two addressing how to achieve some of the suggested changes in the
healthcare and culinary/food distribution system as well as advise to the individual clinician regarding
what they can do as a change agent would enhance this article.
3. Table 2- On page 10 and 11 in the second column the lowermost cell in p10 and uppermost cell on
P11 are not associated with any cells on the first column
4. Reference #19 does not have a year noted.
5. Overall a very interesting article, well organized and supported by the Figure and 2 tables. While
the potential interventions and the conditions/actions necessary for success are nicely outlined, more
specific tactics on how to accomplish them would be helpful and less likely to be consider a theoretical
template. Another consideration for the authors to ponder is the question that sometimes clinicians
ask WIIFM? What's In It For me? Also a brief comment recognizing the disparate healthcare financing
systems throughout the world and how to modify the approach to get buy in from the decision makers

would be a welcomed addition. Particularly for vulnerable groups such as elderly, minorities, low
income, etc, how to assure compliance? Telehealth? Other technologies?
