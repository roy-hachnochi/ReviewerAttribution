The authors have replied to all reviewers' comments. They have done an excellent job and the
manuscript is clear and accurate. There are two very minor points that can be addressed as part of the
final editorial process but have no impact on the adequacy of the science or the reporting. These are:
a) For Tables S3, S4, & S5 - please change label to read:
'Data are mean (standard deviation) or percentages.'
and
b) Figures S5 to S8 - please provide grids to enhance comparability. Similar to the ones given in Figure
2.
I am happy to support publication of the current version of this manuscript in the BMJ.
