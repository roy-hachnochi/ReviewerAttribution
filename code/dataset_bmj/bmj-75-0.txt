This article is important to add to the pool of COVID-19 information and would be of benefit for other
specifically researchers, especially those that are conducting systematic reviews to inform
decision-making.
The research question is clearly defined and answered, although it is a cross-sectional study.
Considering the circumstances, feasibility and urgency, a cross-sectional study design is adequate. The
participants were representative and the study was ethical, but the Methods section needs some revision
(based on STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies):

- does not specify whether an eligibility criterion was HCPs caring for COVID-19 patients. This is
established in the results section.
- consider adding the time when the RT-PCR was performed
- how was data on PPE and on performing AGPs collected?
- sample size, statistical methods, dealing with biases are not addressed
The results answer the research question, but consider adding when the RT-PCRs were performed. In
addition, consider stratifying table 2 based on 1) ward (ICU vs Regular vs no COVID-19 area); and 2)
exposure to AGPs (AGPs vs non-AGPs). Consider clarifying that there is overlap between the different
strata.
The interpretation and conclusion look good. I suggest avoiding definitive sentences and the adjective
‘adequate’ i.e. ‘Our results show that HCPs with adequate training and PPEs were successfully protected
from SARS-CoV-2 infection’. The references are up to date and there is no supplemental data provided.
Additional comments:
I am concerned with line 28 p.4. ‘the risk of infection among them was therefore very high’. Reconsider
this definitive sentence, to be more ‘probabilistic’. In fact, the risk of transmission from AGPs among
HCWs managing COVID-19 patients is still being studied.
Typo in table 2. ‘APGs’.
