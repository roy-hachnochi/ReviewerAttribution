This is an important study, which has major implications for infection control in pandemics.
Introduction: You do not provide even a brief overview of the literature. Please comment on how your
procedures compare to these key reviews. (I am sending pdfs. directly to the editor so the editor can
decide if they should be forwarded to you so you don't have to get them from your library).

did you choose the 77 uninvolved HCPs and 80 recovered COVID-19 patients? You did not
up a list of all eligibles and did not select randomly so please state that now. Age and
are key in survivability from COVID and especially for ICU patients. Please compare ages,
and days from first symptoms for these patients to all COVID patients admitted to

Symptoms: How did you measure fever, cough, and dyspnea? What were the results?
Interventions: You do not describe the procedures for putting on PPE and taking off and hand washing,
which are crucial. Please describe them in detail and if you used pictures to train staff please add those.
Please construct a table with as much detail as Table 1 in Thomas RE 2016 cited above.
Key studies like this need replication. Please describe your PPE and handwashing procedures in enough
detail they can be reproduced by other researchers.
Please use the WHO My 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene descriptive plan
• before touching a patient,
• before clean/aseptic procedures,
• after body fluid exposure/risk,
• after touching a patient, and.
• after touching patient surroundings.
Please describe precautions used for all medical staff to prevent them being infected with COVID when
not in patient contact. Did they take off their PPE after each patient? What techniques did they use? (this
is crucial) Were they observed doing it? How were they protected in other areas e.g. meals, transport to
and from their residencies, did they have individual rooms, did they wear masks on buses and in
common areas in their residencies off duty?
When your study is replicated if the results of other researchers differ it is important to know why so we
need to know exactly what you did and how you observed and what you did not please.
Measures: You made these imprecise statements. Please clarify them.
"serological tests were performed with reasonable accuracy.
"The sensitivities of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at day 8 and day 15 since onset were up to 98.2% and
100% respectively."

We are all keen to know more about your excellent study with super results. Well done!
