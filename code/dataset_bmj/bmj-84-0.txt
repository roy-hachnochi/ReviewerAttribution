This is a very interesting article that sets out to discover where data goes when it is input
into various health related apps.
The topic is very relevant and important to everyone with a smartphone or computer,
particularly as many of us are still too relaxed about adding personal information to these
apps, especially if they have the potential to make our lives a little easier.
The article is well written and accessible to a lay audience. The authors have managed to
avoid much of the technical jargon that surrounds the subject, making it considerably easier
to read than many texts on this subject.
They have included a consumer organisation as PPI involvement and, while I would query
whether that is true PPI, it makes sense in this instance, as it is a technical subject and they
are well placed to assist with dissemination.
Initially, I was disappointed that so few apps were tested; however, given the web of
connections between those chosen, I think it would be difficult to suitably examine a larger
number within one project and then present the results so clearly. The Figures at the end
showing all the data sharing connections are a fabulous way to demonstrate the results to a
lay audience. I think this study raises the profile of data sharing risks very eloquently.
