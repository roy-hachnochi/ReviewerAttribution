This is a timely, well written and reasoned article. Gambling is increasing being
conceptualised within public health and wider harm frameworks. In many respects, as the
authors indicate, gambling policy in the UK is markedly at variance with developments in a
number of other jurisdictions. The article provides a sound overview of these
developments, drawing on relevant publications and the auhors' own recent research. In
my view this article provides a sound, well-reasoned presentation of an important topic
that will be of interest ro readers in the UK and internationally.
The reviewer has a long-time interest in gambling and gambling-related harm and
involvement in research, policy and public health and clinical practice.
