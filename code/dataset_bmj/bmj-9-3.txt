• This manuscript is very long and has many references and attachments.
• It has been difficult to read as it seems to be written by statisticians with a lot of
statistical jargon.
• Articles in theBMJ generally seem to be easy to read and ones that can be applied
practically by clinicians and nurses.
• Currently many early warning scoring systems are embedded within Electronic Patient
Systems(EPR) and it is difficult for clinicians and nurses to see what parameters have been
included.
• It would not be easy for medical and nursing staff who work in hospitals or GP practices
to read and apply the findings of this manuscript to their work.
Therefore due to the above reasons, this manuscript would not be suitable for publication
in theBMJ and would be more suited for another journal which is statistical in nature.
If the manuscript is considered for another journal the following should be included:
1. Reference to the following article
Smith, GB, Prytherch, D, Meredith, P, Schmidt, PE & Featherstone, PI 2013, 'The ability of
the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) to discriminate patients at risk of early cardiac
arrest, unanticipated intensive care unit admission, and death', Resuscitation, vol. 84, no.
4, pp. 465-470.
2. Review and discuss the work done by the Royal College of Physicians:
https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/national-early-warning-score-news-2
3. Include a thorough review of early warning scores used in each electronic patient system
implemented by NHS organisation throughout the United Kingdom. Make a
recommendation of which early warning scoring is considered best for patient care.
4. 93 Articles have been selected for detailed review, it would be beneficial to grade these
in terms of which ones are beneficial and which ones are least beneficial. In this way the
user can proceed directly to a reference that is of greater benefit.
