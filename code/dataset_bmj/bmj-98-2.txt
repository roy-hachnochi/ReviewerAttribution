1.) The causal inference that reverse causation is resulting in the observed findings may be
further strengthened by examining physical activity in the 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, etc.
intervals in which dementia incident cases could be identified. One would anticipate that as
physical activity is measure more proximal to possible onset of dementia that the
association between physical activity and dementia would be more pronounced.
2.) Further discussion should surround possible limitations particularly about unmeasured
confounders such as depression, medication use, etc. which were not measured in the
present study.
3.) While cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke were all included as control outcomes
it is not clear how these were adjusted for as possible confounders in the primary analysis.
4.) The authors could clarify how the cumulative amount of physical activity may be
associated with the onset of dementia. The total amount of exercise that is being measured
in the <10 years and >10 years should also be accounted for in the present analysis.
