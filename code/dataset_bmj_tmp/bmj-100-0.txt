based on the HUNT Study.
For all articles
• Is the article important? YES
• Will it help our readers to make better decisions and, if so, how? YES by facilitating design
of interventions.
• Will the article add enough to existing knowledge? YES – it builds on earlier findings
• Does the article read well and make sense? YES – but note my suggested improvements.
Does it have a clear message? YES
For research articles
• Originality — does the work add enough to what is already in the published literature? If
so, what does it add? Please cite relevant references to support your comments on
originality.
• Importance of the work to general readers — does this work matter to clinicians,
researchers, policymakers, educators, or patients? YES all of these.
-Will it help our readers to make better decisions and, if so, how? Is a general medical
journal the right place for it? YES
• Scientific reliability: GOOD - but note my comment re 95% CIs
• Research question — clearly defined and appropriately answered? YES
• Overall design of study — appropriate and adequate to answer the research question? YES

criteria described? How representative were they of patients whom this evidence might
affect? All OK
• Methods — adequately described? YES Main outcome measure clear? YES
- Was the study ethical (this may go beyond simply whether the study was approved by an
ethics committee or IRB)? YES
• Results — answer the research question? Credible? Well presented? YES to all.

• Interpretation and conclusions — warranted by and sufficiently derived from/focused on
the data? Discussed in the light of previous evidence? Message clear? YES

p.6 line 10 'The study population was divided into GRS quantiles where the highest and
lowest quantiles are graphed with corresponding confidence intervals'.
Need to clarify that GRS cut off values of the upper and lower quintiles (ie of the highest and
lowest 20%) of GRS are used to identify groups referred to throughout as the upper and
lower quantiles of GRS. These groups are contrasted with respect to their mean BMI in
statistical models.
p.6 line 28: 'allowing for random effects of time'
'again allowing for random effects of age' not clear what these means. Please clarify.
Page 8 line 8: mean BMI
'For men aged 20-29 years, the most genetically predisposed had 1.12 (95% CI 0.89 to
1.34) kg/m2 higher mean BMI than the least genetically predisposed in the 1960s compared
to 2.29 (95% CI 1.76 to 2.83) kg/m2 in the 2000s'.
Should point out that where the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap there is an
implication of a statistically significant difference.
p.8 line 37:
'Figure 3: Predicted BMI by lower and upper genetic risk score quantiles by age group and
time point for 32,631 men and 36,649 women'. ?Predictions from a statistical model.??
p.9 line 39
'A non-participation study for HUNT3 with self-reported height and weight lifted INCREASED
the possibility that BMI was slightly overestimated'.???? need to clarify
