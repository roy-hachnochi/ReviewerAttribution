Review of “Quantifying the impact of genes on BMI during the obesity epidemic – a
longitudinal study based on the HUNT Study”
This is a substantively interesting evaluation of gene*birth cohort interactions using a novel
and apparently appropriate data source. Although previous studies have suggested that
genetic variants known to predict BMI had larger effects after the onset of the obesity
epidemic than before, this is the most convincing result to date, with the largest sample size
and range of years of assessments and ages. My suggestions are primarily about
presentation:
Only results for Q1 and Q5 are presented, making me wonder if the association is
really monotonic across levels of the genetic risk score. It would be helpful to choose a
primary model and show all of the quantiles for that model, without imposing a linearity
assumption.
Although the plots are certainly helpful, they obscure a lot of information about the
model that merits formal reporting. The Mixed model results are never shown, rather
selected predicted values are plotted. All the coefficients from the model should be available
in the appendix at least to sanity check and clarify interpretation.
It is difficult to understand what models were actually estimated. For example, how
was age specified? The methods seem to imply that age was categorized, but the figures
are inconsistent with such a specification (and such a specification would almost certainly be
incorrect). This is essential to interpret the results. Please provide the exact equations in
the appendix, so the model can be evaluated transparently.
The result for middle aged women in earlier periods is quite surprising. Has this
previously been documented for Norway?
Selective survival to date of genetic assessment is a major concern. The qualitative
observation that “BMI trajectories ..did not deviate substantially” is not convincing that this
is not a problem. Can you present a model for the probability that someone provided
genetic information based on their previous values of BMI and the differences in BMI across
periods?
One interpretation of the results is that the genetic influence is on a ratio rather
than absolute scale, i.e., they should be interpreted as increasing BMI by a percentage
rather than by an absolute number of points. This does not diminish the importance of the
result, given the priority to absolute effects for public health implications, but it is important
to describe if this is the case. Can you assess whether the effects of the genetic risk score
are constant across periods when expressed in percents? For example, if you take the
natural log of BMI as the outcome and exponentiate the linear regression coefficients, is
there a birth cohort*GRS or period*GRS interaction?
Similarly, it would be helpful to think about how the GRS relates to the prevalence
of obesity across periods.
As noted, the percent of variance in BMI explained by known genetic variants is
much smaller than expected based on previous heritability estimates. The results here relate
to interpretation of heritability estimates, which seems one of the most important

implications of this line of work. G by E interactions are implicitly incorporated into
heritability estimates from, for example, twin studies. If you conceptualize birth cohort (or
period/year of assessment) as a broad indicator of environment, what percent of variance in
BMI is explained by genetic variants (the GRS) and what percent by genetic variants*birth
cohort (or period) interactions (controlling for a main effect of birth cohort)?
The figure showing the sample at each wave has a lot of potential but is ultimately
confusing. The boxes are not mutually exclusive, so add up to a total larger than the total
participating in each wave. We cannot distinguish individuals with and without genetic
information. The figure would also likely be more informative if it included the birth cohorts
of participants.
Throughout, there are small errors in English that make it slightly awkward to
understand the manuscript. I recommend having another proofreader.
