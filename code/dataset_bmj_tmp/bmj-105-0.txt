Statistical Review
I appreciate the authors’ explanation of the analysis of replacing red meat with other food types.
you.

Thank

I think that it is important to draw readers’ attention to many assumptions and much weaker strength of
this replacement food analysis compared to the simple analysis of changes in red meat intake. For
reasons explained below, I propose that this analysis should be completely removed from the paper as I
believe it is likely to be misleading, and currently is over-interpreted. As this appears to be one of the
objectives of this paper, this will be a major change.
The analysis of the red meat changes is based on identifying cohort members who we know did change
their intake and observing their mortality. This change analysis is the main strength of this paper.
However, the replacement analysis is a statistical modelling exercise utilising data across the whole
cohort, without ever identifying whether there is a single individual in the cohort who actually replaced
red meat with any of the other food types. From the authors’ explanation I understand that the analysis
has estimated the change in mortality with unit change in each of the different food types (for example,
an increase in mortality of x% with a unit increase in red meat, a decrease in mortality of y% with a unit
increase in fish) and then has summed the two coefficients to predict what would happen if you made
both changes together. There does not actually need to be any individual in the cohort to have made
that combination of changes to obtain that estimate.
I understand that this analysis is actually assuming that the changes in mortality with each food type are
independent. Whilst the uncertainty is the estimate is taking account of shared variance (reflecting the
correlation of changes in consumption of different food types across the cohorts) it is assuming, for

example, that the change of mortality with different changes in fish consumption would be the same
regardless of the changes in consumption of all other food types, including red meat.
Understanding how replacement of one food type with another would actually impact on mortality would
require investigation of interaction terms between each combination, for which these data are unlikely to
have statistical power (it will depend on the exact numbers of participants who did actually substitute on
food with another). And the reality is most likely that individuals reducing red meat are likely to replace
it with a selection of different food types, and not a single food type, so such a simple analysis would be
impossible.
I fear that inclusion of the current replacement analysis is creating an illusion of understanding the
actual impact of replacement when all the dataset can provide are independent estimates of how
mortality changes with independent changes in each food type. For example, quoting from the abstract
“A reduction in one serving/day of red meat accompanied by an increase in an alternative food choice
was associated with a lower risk of death”. This is wrong as the model fitted has estimated how a
change in the alternative impacts on risk of death REGARDLESS of whether it accompanies a reduction in
red meat intake.
I therefore cannot see what this analysis is adding over a table which summarises the change in
mortality predicted with unit change of each of the food types (i.e. the main effects). These currently
are not reported in the paper at all, although they are the key parameters included in the model from
which these estimates are obtained. I would therefore urge the authors to abandon the reporting of
this replacement analysis, potentially replacing it with reports of the impact of changes in other food
types. Interpretation of the “replacement” question can only be speculative.
There is much about this study which is strong and well reported, so I would strongly request that the
authors’ consider this request.
