The research paper is well justified in the introduction, along with justification for
researching the frequency of sexual activity, very thorough.
I think the research is lacking one piece of data that could highly influence the outcome
measures – the sexuality of the individuals. For example, a large percentage of gay men
are known to be more sexually active than their straight counterparts. However, given the
data sources it is entirely plausible that the sexuality of the participants may not have been
recorded.
The outcome measures reported perfectly encapsulate the aims of the study, and are
relevant to the wider population. I don’t feel any other measures would have been
pertinent.
Part of the ‘results’ section leaves out potentially vital information – why were median
values reported rather than means, and why was a logistic regression used to analyse the

data? One assumes the data was non-parametric but with such large datasets this seems
unlikely.
There was no public/patient involvement in this study, but due to the nature of the study I
do not think this would be relevant.
Overall, I feel this was an excellent study that has greatly added to existing literature,
especially given the size of the data sets used. The authors take lengths to relate the
findings back to the original reasons for doing the research (“Men and women in better
physical and mental health
report having sex more frequently, as do those who are fully employed and those with
higher
earnings.”) even though these outcomes are not part of the original study aims.
I hope the findings of this research are used in future health promotion work.
