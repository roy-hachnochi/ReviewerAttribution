This is a very interesting and well conducted cross-sectional, population based study
assessing changes over time in the frequency of sex in Britain.
Overall the study is clearly presented and statistical analyses are appropriate.
The study is significant since there is a gap in the literature of sexual frequency trends.
These results give a comprehensive sociological overview of the sexual health in Britain.
Minor comments:
1- Quality of sex may be more important than frequency at an individual perspective. Since
sexual satisfaction has not been addressed authors should mention this in the limitations.
2- Self-reported health and disability is less accurate than objective measurement with
scores.
3- Decreased libido and other diseases that may potentially affect sexual intercourses were
not investigated (premature ejaculation, hypogonadism, Peyronie's Disease).
4- The use of pro erectile medications was not reported.
