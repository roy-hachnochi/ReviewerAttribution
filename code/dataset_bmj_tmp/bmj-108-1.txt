Are the study's aims and the issue and questions that the paper addresses relevant and
important to you as a patient? Do you think it would be relevant to other patients like you?
What about carers?
The question of whether or not to have surgery for stress incontinence and if deciding yes,
which surgery, is important to women and their carers. Any information that could be fed
into an evidence-based decision aid would be welcome.
Are there any areas that you find relevant as a patient or carer that are missing or should be
highlighted?
None
Would the treatment, intervention studied, or guidance given work in practice? Is it feasible?
What challenges might patients face that should be considered?
Not applicable for a systematic review
Are the outcomes that are being measured in the study or described in the paper the same
as the outcomes that are important to patients? Are there others that should have been
considered?
If this had been an RTC itself, improvement in community involvement may have been a
secondary outcome welcomed by those with stress incontinence, but it is a systematic
review. That data would have been impossible to find.
Do you have any suggestions that might help the author(s) strengthen their paper to make it
more useful for doctors to share and discuss with patients?
Key for patients is that the evidence is not yet strong enough for comparison of surgical
interventions. It's out of scope for this paper to discuss communication of uncertainty to
patients by surgeons.
If and how the level of patient involvement in the research described could have been
improved. Authors are now required to state if and how they involved patients in setting the
research agenda and the design and implementation of the study and include this
information in a box within the manuscript. If there was no patient involvement we would
welcome your ideas on how this could have been done. We hope this will help authors think
of the best ways to include patients in their future research and further progressive patient
involvement in the research enterprise.
Delighted to see that two patient experts were included in study design, execution and
analysis.
