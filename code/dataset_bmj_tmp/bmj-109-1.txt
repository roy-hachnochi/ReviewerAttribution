In this manuscript, Ma et al examined associations of habitual glucosamine use and risk of
CVD in the UK Biobank. By involving 466,039 participants, the authors found that habitual
use of glucosamine supplement was associated with significantly reduced risks of CVD
events. This is a very interesting analysis, nicely conducted and clearly written. I only have
some minor comments.
1. This is an observational study and the authro used "reduced risk of CVD". I would
suggest to change reduced to lower risk of CVD, as reduce indicates causality.
2. How did the author test interactions for smoking given that smoking had three
categories?
Also, given that no interaction for stroke was found, there is pausibility that the interaction
for smoking is due to chance. I would suggest downplay this finding by not mentioning it in
the abstract.
3. Did the author test the interaction between genetic scores and glucosamine use?
4. The author mentioned that "we could not exclude the possibility of residual confounding
or unmeasured biological and social factors". What social factors? A healthy lifestyle might
be an important confounder between glucosamine use and risk of CVD, and the author
might want to specify it.
