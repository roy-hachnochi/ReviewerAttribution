This is a through examination of the data - the methods in the revision are much
clearer, particularly around the propensity score matching. The results have
been verified in two independent cohorts which is credible. I have no further stats
comments.
There is a lot of material in this paper (Tables/Figures) particularly with the
analysis of two cohorts analysed in two different way - i.e. the 'primary analysis'
and the 'propensity score' approach - I think the authors would need to work with
editors to determine which material should go into the main paper. Table 2/5 I
think are the most important - but these could easily be combined to show the
results to both cohorts in one table.
A couple of minors:

Methods - stats section. Say that you will report numbers 'and percentages' for
count data. In the results I then think it needs to be clearer in the Tables when n
(%) are reported.
