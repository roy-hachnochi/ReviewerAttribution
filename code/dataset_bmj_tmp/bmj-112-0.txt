Dear editor,
Thank you for the possibility to review this article.
“Crafting National Strategies to Achieve Health Equity—A Bold Approach for the SDG Era” is an analysis
article that is highlighting and discusses a particularly important and relevant subject; how can national
equity strategies be used to actively reduce inequities within and between populations. Inequities and
the work to reduce inequities within and between countries is a cornerstone of the 2030 Agenda and the
Sustainable Development Goals, and the article is discussing these issues within the overarching
framework of the 2030 Agenda. The article will clearly stimulate debate on this important issue.
Overall it is a well-written and thought-provoking manuscript, however I believe the manuscript could be
considerable strengthened if the below is considered:
Major issues:
- The seven principles to guide programs of actions (page 5-6) is the foundation of this article and
summarize core principles of work to reduce inequity. However, maybe the principles could be
strengthened? Suggestions.
o Could the principles have headings? Short summaries? This would make it easier to easier to
remember them and discuss them. E.g first one could be called “Participatory governance”, second one
“Maximize health equity”, etc.
o Could examples be given where the different principles have been used in effective ways? One
example for each principle? Just some lines per principle or maybe in a text box?
o Principle two, this principle is combining two issues in one (although clearly closely linked), first one
“Action plans must address deep structural determinants, such as systemic discrimination, political
exclusion, and control over resources” and the second one more related to that research and data
disaggregation. Could maybe the issues related to more of monitoring and evaluation be taken out from
principle two, three and four and merged into a new one just focusing on monitoring, evaluation and the
need for more and better research related to equity?
o Principle five “Equity strategies must be action-oriented, with specific policies and programs developed
and fully implemented, accompanied by targets and timelines. Governments must enact legislation,
increase budgets”. It is difficult to clearly see the difference between this principle and principle two.
o Principle six. Could the example of NCPI reporting from the AIDS response be used an example? The
National Commitments and Policy Instrument (NCPI) has been used to monitor AIDS-related laws and
policies for over 10 years. The NCPI provides self-reported national HIV laws and policies, combing civil
society and government engagement and reporting. (see Torres et al, Monitoring HIV-Related Laws and
Policies: Lessons for AIDS and Global Health in Agenda 2030. AIDS Behav. 2017 Jul;21(Suppl 1):51-61.)

- Key messages: Could another point be added on the importance of continued and strengthened
monitoring and evaluation of inequity be added?
- Table “Equity trends for RMNCH interventions” , very good summary and illustrative table.
o However, the table only included LIC and MIC. The issue if inequity is universal, and the SDGS clearly
spells out that we have to be universal. Could another table showing similar trends for HIC be added? (I
understand that it will be difficult to find similar statistics for HIC, but could e.g. difference in average
life expectancy between lowest and highest wealth-quintile be used?) A minimum would be to add this
caveat to the table.
o WHO Health Equity Monitor, what are the data sources? DHS and/or MICS? Can this be added?
o Coverage of RMNCH interventions, what interventions? Can it be added in a footnote or appendix?
o How was the ordering of the six first countries in the table done? (where they all had “never” for years
to close the gap?
Minor remarks:

Page 3, line 22-24, “One study found that in a one-quarter of countries surveyed, the poorest 40% are
doing worse than before on Millennium Development Goal (MDG) health outcomes.” Without knowing
how many countries that were surveyed in the study, the statement does not tell much. This information
is later described in the actual article, but would be good to also tell here.
Page 4, line 31-33 “When lower-income populations do not reap the benefits of rising GDP, they feel
alienated, as their health status also declines”. I am not sure that the health status declines in absolute
terms for most of the lower-income populations, the health status is not increasing as fast as for other
segments of the population.
Page 7, line 9, “Outcome data are needed not only for the health system, but also for multiple sectors.”
Would change to “Outcome and impact data…”

Page 7, line 16, ref 37, is there a more robust reference than a blog?
Page 7, line 16-20, could the work to include disaggregated data in GBD be mentioned?
Abbreviations, e.g. UHC on page 4, line 49, introduced without explaining their meaning (coming later
on page 5).
