This study uses aggregated data on Medicare spending to study pharmaceutical spending patterns from
2011 to 2015, documenting considerable spending growth - roughly 20% of which can be attributed to
increases in spending on existing medications, rather than novel formulations. The authors motivate this
work by noting the growing financial burden of pharmaceutical spending on payers and patients. The
results from this study mirror other findings and popular news media reporting on the topic of rising
drug prices.
I would appreciate more detail on why the authors chose to exam spending on these particular drugs
(the WHO’s Model List of Essential Medicines) within the Medicare population, though I suspect this may
have been motivated by the existence of public data. As I understand it, this collection of drugs includes
those deemed essential or the basic health needs of a population – not limited to elderly individuals in a
high-income country. The imperfect applicability to the Medicare population is apparent in the number
drugs appearing on the WHO MLEM, but not in the Medicare claims (24%, but >50% after sample
restrictions). I see no mention of the types of drugs excluded and/or why the remaining drugs are still
the most relevant ones to examine. The authors might instead consider developing a market basket of
drugs based either on spending (i.e., the 100 highest-spending drugs at the start of the study period) or
use (i.e., the 100 most frequently used drugs).
The authors report increasing spending on prescription drugs by Medicare beneficiaries, but they do not
discuss the changing nature of their sample. I believe the publicly available aggregate data includes only
Medicare beneficiaries with fee-for-service (FFS), excluding those who choose to receive coverage
through Medicare Advantage (MA) plan. In 2011, roughly 12% of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in
an MA plan, compared to 17% in 2015. Multiple studies have demonstrated selection of healthier

Medicare beneficiaries into MA plans, suggesting that the average health of the authors’ sample is
deteriorating over time, as sicker individuals remain in FFS.
The decomposition of spending trends into price changes versus utilization changes seemed to me the
most significant contribution of this paper. However, I am quite unclear on the exact methodology used
by the authors to construct a “volume and cost index”. Please consider including detailed methodology
(with equations) in an appendix. I expect something along the lines of constructing a utilization index by
repricing everything to the 2011 mean. By comparing this to the raw spending numbers, one can
decompose price changes versus utilization changes (I did something similar here). Additionally, this
section of results could use further unpacking, including a table or figure.
While the authors are careful to use non-causal language when they discuss associations between
spending and the number of manufacturers, I would like to see explicit acknowledgment that this is a
highly endogenous outcome and the results presented here cannot be used to conclude that
consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry resulted in higher spending or prices (though this would
certainly be the theoretical prediction).
Other items:
•
The authors report (pg. 7, ln 121-122) excluding drug formulations with decreased total
spending from 2011-2015, but do not explain the rationale for this sample restriction.
•
The authors use ‘cost’ and ‘spending’ somewhat interchangeably throughout the paper. I don’t
know if this is intentional, but it may throw off the reader.
•
Table 1 and Figure 2 contain overlapping content and could potentially be combined. Some
categories with identical headings (e.g., ‘Per-Beneficiary OOP Spending’) do not have identical values. If
these numbers are correct, please clarify labeling.
•
Given that annual per-beneficiary OOP spending grew only 75 cents, I might caution against
concluding that medications have become increasingly inaccessible to patients and/or finding a data
sources that better reflects this trend.
