After reading the paper, it seems that the paper is interesting and touching upon a nice topic for
contemporary debate in the US health care system. Nevertheless, I have following comments;
1. I think, the objecitves decribed in the abstract does not correspond to the study as such. Where a
reader is unable to see a comprehensive debate or discussion about potential modifiers, and drivers.
This need emphasis to make objective of the study aligned with analyses.
2. why the prices of drugs are in 2015 US dollars?
3. Any particular reason of focusing only age group of 65 years. please elaborate.
4. As the study seems to have national coverage? what is not yet understandable is whether the drug
prices cost are at manufacturer level or at whole sale/retail (pharmcy level). If at pharmacy level how
you averaged the costs?
5. What is the explanation of faster increase in drug cost than inflation? please elaborate.
6. Abstract and conclusion need more emphasis in terms of clarity and avoid repetition.
