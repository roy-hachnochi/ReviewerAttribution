Dear colleagues - this paper presents are systematic review and critical appraisal of early
warning scores. The paper focuses on a review and comparison of the development
methodology. This means amongst other things that scoring models that have not
published their methodology are excluded from the review even if they have added
significantly to the literature and the development of the field.
I am afraid but I believe that the paper is a comprehensive review of methodology but is at
risk of adding very little substance to existing reviews or indeed clinical practice. The
distinction between scores and more complex algorithms is in this context probably less
helpful. And in the end the effect of any tool has to be judged by its clinical utility and
real-world impact on patient outcomes.
I therefore regret to say that I am not convinced that the present review will add
significantly to the knowledge of the specific readership of the BMJ at policy, strategic or
clinical level.
