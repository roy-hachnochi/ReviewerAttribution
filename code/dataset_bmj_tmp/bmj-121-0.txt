This interesting article describes the potential role of research in contributing to the implementation of
national non-communicable disease programmes. The authors present examples of how
implementation research expertise is being used in a small range of low and high income countries. I
think the focus of the paper is on low income countries but this is not entirely clear to me.
The paper represents an example of the rapidly emerging view that aligning implementation and
research activities has the potential to optimise the implementation process. This approach, which
builds on the principles of 'participatory' or 'embedded' research, has been popular in non-health
sectors for decades and is rapidly gaining credibility in the health sectors. It reflects the extent to
which implementation is now (at last) recognised to be a complex socio-technical process which
benefits from the social science approaches commonly used by implementation researchers.
The authors describe how researchers can add value, most notably by helping managers and clinicians
to frame implementation challenges as empirical questions which can then become the subject of
applied formative research. They also highlight some of the challenges associated with practitioners
and researcher trying to find common purpose. Several of these challenges seem to me to benefit
more from the application of established published evidence than from the creation of new knowledge
using empirical research. I am not sure that the potential role played researchers in both mobilising
and creating knowledge has been appropriately drawn out.
The article neatly summarises what we already know about how implementation researchers can work
with implementation practitioners. It does not present any new insights into this emerging field and
this might well be appropriate for a BMJ Analysis paper. However, I am not convinced that the article
will be of great interest to most BMJ readers and I wonder if it would might be better placed in a
specialist implementation journal such as BMJ Quality and Safety or Implementation Science.
