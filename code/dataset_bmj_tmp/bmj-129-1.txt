This is a well performed and thoughtfully executed meta analysis addressing the question
of whether initiating anti-retroviral therapy with four ART drugs rather than 3 drugs has a
salutary impact on HIV biologic and safety outcomes. This is an important question to
resolve. Even though current guidelines suggest that 3 drugs are sufficient to balance
safety and efficacy outcomes in HIV care, there has not previously been a consolidated
attempt to integrate the relevant literature in one analysis, as done here. One can assert
on first principles that four drugs carries additional costs, toxicity and adherence
challenges vs. three, but that is not the same as proving it is so based on an integrative
analysis of the existing randomized controlled trials data.
Thus, I feel that the authors have identified an important question of relevance certainly to
the HIV treatment and care community. But it is also a question that should also be of
interest to the general medical community. I say this because, as a former HIV practitioner
myself, I have often fielded the exact same question from my general med colleagues and
have been somewhat ashamed not to have a thoughtful answer beyond quoting current
guidelines and theorizing on the basis of first principles. Which is another way of saying
that most of us know that 2 drugs are better than 1 and that 3 are better than 2. So
wouldn’t 4 be better than 3? It is an eminently logical and reasonable question to ask, and
as Feng et al have shown, the answer is ‘no’.
Their analysis rests ultimately on 12 studies including a total of 4,251 participants. Overall
they found no differences in terms of the proportion achieving undetectable viral load (RR
0.99!), or changes in CD4 count (a negligible delta of +3.8 cells/mcl, with wide confidence
intervals that straddled 0 delta). A less easily measured outcome, due to its rarity, was
death, for which there was also no difference. The authors considered study quality and
heterogeneity, had a defensible search strategy and an analysis with robust and logical
pre-specified aims, and conducted thoughtful sensitivity analyses and cumulative meta
analysis.
For two of the endpoints, also with wide confidence intervals that straddled a zero delta,
there was some suggestion of an effect. These were an increase in AIDS defining
conditions, and an increase in serious adverse events. In both cases, the RR was only
slightly increased for the four-drug regimen, so the finding should be interpreted with great
caution. But it also stands that these two outcomes are the most vulnerable to subjective
evaluation. Thus, I was curious which of the studies had contributed to these
meta-analyses. For the AIDS defining condition outcome, this rested on three trials, of
which two (Joly and Kirk) had been flagged by Feng’s team as having potential issues
related to blinding or concealment of allocation, i.e., suggesting that they could have been
more vulnerable to ascertainment bias. My thoughts on the SAE outcome were similar, but
here the direction of bias was in the reverse. Four of the five suggested that 4 drugs had
more serious side effects than 3 – a conclusion that seems almost inevitable given that all
drugs have side effects, and logically more drugs will incur more side effects. The outlier
reaching the opposite conclusion was the study by Joly, which was also one of the three
that drove the rise in AIDS defining conditions and was one of the studies for which
ascertainment bias was flagged as being of potential concern in Feng’s analysis.

Is it possible that 4 drug regimens could incur a higher risk of AIDS defining conditions? It
seems counter-intuitive, but one can imagine some scenarios where this might be the
case. For example, some drugs have bone marrow toxicity and could delay the recovery of
CD4 cells or reduce their final set point. Also, adherence would presumably be more
problematic for a 4 than 3-drug regimen, so the complexity of the fourth agent might
paradoxically render the overall regimen less effective than one would predict in an ideal
world.
But those are quite hypothetical concerns and are hard to reconcile with the VL and CD4
data, which ultimately are the mechanism by which ART works. And for these, there was
no hint of any difference at all across the 12 trials. Lacking a plausible biological basis for
why AIDS defining conditions might be increased absent a mediating change in VL or CD4
responses, I’m more inclined to discount this finding as a false signal. Conversely, my
inclination is to accept that 4-drug ART carries an increased risk of SAEs, even though the
confidence intervals straddled no difference. It is important to note that the sample size
for this endpoint was relatively small and only included 5 of the 12 trials.
Thus, overall, I came away persuaded that there is in fact no benefit to 4 drug vs. 3 drug
ART regimens for patients newly initiating ART. The potential harms in terms of AIDS
defining conditions are plausibly due to chance and a lack of precision. By contrast, the
increase in side effects, toxicity, cost, and adherence concerns are almost inevitable. To
me, this feels like a rather definitive answer to a pragmatic question.
Some minor issues that I would hope the authors could address:
1.
Since you are targeting this to a gen med audience, you should perhaps be more
emphatic in describing that your paper ONLY applies to new ART initiations and assumes a
low risk of transmitted resistance to ART. For long standing patients with drug resistance
issues, 4 drugs are often inescapable.
2.
Throughout the paper, the authors have provided 95% confidence intervals and
P-values for the same statistics. I see no value to the p-values and would strongly
recommend that they be dropped entirely from the manuscript. To my mind, they add
nothing at all. The only possible exception would be the Q statistic, but this is not an
important part of the overall analysis, and its ultimate role was to suggest that there was
substantial heterogeneity in the trials. Which is not surprising.
3.
In the text, the authors have presented the RR as 4 drugs vs. 3 drugs in all cases.
But as a reader, I quickly lost sight of that, and as I read through the paper found myself
occasionally confused as to the direction of comparison. It would be helpful to restate this
in the narrative to make sure that there is no room for confusion, particularly as you move
into the safety analyses.
4.
Similarly, in the forest plot figure, the figures do not label which regimen
corresponds to which treatment regimen (e.g., 'favors 3 drugs' vs. 'favors 4 drugs').
Please add this to the legends so that there is no confusion.
5.
In light of the issues around ascertainment bias that surrounded two of the studies
that influenced the AIDS conditions and SAE analyses, I think it would be helpful to expand
on this issue in the narrative and how the inclusion/exclusion of these studies would have
impacted your final pooled RRs.
6.
Similarly, in the cumulative meta-analysis figure, you show that the inclusion of
the paper by Joly reduced the pooled RR from the previous 4 studies. This is effectively a
sensitivity analysis. And since Joly’s methodology raised red flags, that too would be worth
expanding on in your discussion.
