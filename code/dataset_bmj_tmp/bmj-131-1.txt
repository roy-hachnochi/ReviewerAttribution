The paper examines the effect of education on cardiovascular disease in the UK. The
effects are identified using mendelian randomization that is based on genetic markers. The
paper makes a useful contribution to the existing empirical literature. But there are also
issues that have to be addressed in the revised version, as detailed in the comments for
the author(s).
Comments to the author(s)
1. The empirical context of the study should be motivated in the revised introduction.
2. Are the data using the UK biobank nationally representative or not? This issue should be
stated explicitly in the section on data.
3. The paper should discuss more about the differences in the point estimates. Why the
quantitative size of the IV estimate is substantially higher than the corresponding OLS
estimate? What this pattern reveals about the contribution of unobservables and the
omitted-variable bias in OLS estimation?

4. The IV estimation using mendelian randomization based on generic markers identifies
the LATE (Local Average Treatment Effect) for compliers, which is (generally) not the same
parameter that is identified using OLS estimation. Is it possible to state useful facts about
the compliers in IV estimation? This is an important issue, because the compliers may
differ substantially from the average population in the UK biobank data. What is the
external validity of the IV estimates that are presented in the paper? Is it appropriate to
guide policy setting based on the IV estimates alone?
5. Is it possible to estimate the IV models using different polygenic scores for education in
order to assess the sensitivity of the IV estimates. Different polygenic scores may operate
through different biological mechanisms and thus may have different LATEs that may be
relevant for policy conclusions (see also point 4 above).
6. The models are adjusted for covariates (page 9). Is birth distance from London a
predetermined variable or not? It is a well-established fact that migration is highly
selective.
7. The revised version would benefit of mentioning that there are earlier empirical studies
on the effect of years of education on health using mendelian randomization to identify
causal effects (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2017.06.015).
8. The empirical analysis does not consider the potential heterogeneity in the estimated
effects. The relationships can differ significantly e.g. by gender/age. The average effects
that are presented in the paper tend to mask substantial heterogeneity in the responses
that are relevant for optimal policy design.
9. The concluding section of the paper should discuss more about the practical policy
lessons that can be drawn from the estimation results.
