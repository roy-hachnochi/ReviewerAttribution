Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this interesting paper. I have
three general comments on the paper, which are listed below:
Although the title of this paper specifically focuses on “Sexual and
Reproductive Health and Rights”, however, the conclusion drawn from evidence from
both SRHR and NCD interventions. Therefore, it is better reflect this in the title.
It is important to acknowledge that the majority of evidence are from high
income or middle settings with an established health system and that they might not
applicable for low resource settings with a weak health system.
I have some disagreements with the authors regarding the definitions used
for technical and, in particular, allocative efficiency. ‘Technical efficiency’ refers to
relation between resource inputs and health outcome/output, i.e., maximising
improvement in outcome obtained from a set of resources. However, when we
compare efficiency of alternative interventions (for example in case of
cost-effectiveness analysis), then we refer to ‘productive or economic efficiency’
which is about minimising of cost for a given outcome or maximising outcome for a
given cost. Allocative efficiency is about allocation decisions at a broader context,
i.e., maximising the health outcome of the population with least costly mix of health
interventions. The definition provided by the authors (“ allocative efficiency is
achieved if a self-care intervention generates better outcomes for the same or
acceptably higher costs than its provider-initiated alternative...”) is actually
‘productive efficiency’.
