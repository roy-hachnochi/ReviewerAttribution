Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting and well-written manuscript.
MAJOR CHANGES
- Whilst there is a role for self-care interventions, one concern is cost-shifting - away
from health providers to users. This is touched on briefly in the document but could
benefit from greater depth in discussion. There are also concerns about surveillance
systems ability to track cases if tests are self-tests, and also linkage to care are
other major concerns that should be discussed more.
- A clearer distinction is needed between self-sampling and self-testing - these
technologies/strategies have their own inherent challenges and advantages and
should not be mixed up in the document. Giving a clear sentence of how they fit into
your definition of "self-care interventions" would also be helpful.
MINOR ESSENTIAL CHANGES
- Page 3, line 30 - could you be more specific which STIs was cost-effective per case
detected? What setting?
- The section on "Considerations for costs and efficiency" could benefit from
reordering of the paragraphs - I found it a bit difficult to follow the flow of logic.
Better use of topic sentences might be helpful.
- Page 4, line 23 - could you expand on how the evidence is limited and which
specific findings were mixed? Otherwise the sentence is too broad. Can you add
where you would like to see more research for this?
- Page 4, line 52 - this sentence is not clear to me. financial cost borne by users or
providers? Facility based HIV testing is often provided at no financial cost to users
(i.e. subsidised by government agencies or other donors). The next sentence in the
paragraph is also confusing and am not sure how it relates to your first sentence may need to be rephrased.
- Page 5, line 54 - could you clarify what subsequent couple communication means?
- Page 6, line 37 - expand why making emergency contraception over-the-counter
'was more decisive'
- Page 6, line 46 - you give examples of asthma and diabetes - but I am not sure of
its relevance to your paper which is about sexual and reproductive health
- You use both STD and STI in your manuscript - pick one and use consistently
throughout.
- Table 1 is useful. Mostly you give the settings of where the study was conducted
but there are a few where you did not. Please review and add at least the country
setting to give context.
