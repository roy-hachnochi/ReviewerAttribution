I must admit, I am usually very critical but I liked this article quite a bit!
I suggest that the article describes an issue that is indeed relevant to all of us,
patients and care providers alike, and also for policy experts in health. As a patient
advocate in HIV, I was particularly happy to see references to good practices from
the HIV field. The paper addresses the global policy level, and so it is not particularly
detailed in terms of practical interventions. Having said that, it addresses the
challenges in sufficient debt to generate an informed debate.
I suggest (p2, 30-33) to consider settings where talking about sex is taboo, or
culturally challenging or impossible. It may make sense to consider specific
interventions or strategies for settings where any discussion around reproductive
health may be extremely difficult.
For self-diagnosis interventions (p.3, 35-37), I suggest to consider the impact and
potential of machine learning and AI algorithms and services like Google Health or
Apple Health. These are, at this stage, commercial initiatives, however, this should
not exclude the possibility to advocate for the handing of these databases as a
common good.
While the article seems to come from a human rights based approach, the emphasis
on the (now very fashionable) economic arguments on p5, 41 and further seem to
be out of place.

Indeed, the HIV field has experimented with cash for HIV prevention (p.6, 44-45),
but these experiments were not very successful in case of people who use drugs.
This can be an important confounder. Substance use and poverty, and
communicable diseases have an intimately close relationship all over the globe unfortunately.
The paper proposes a welcome paradigm change in healthcare (p.7, 49 and below).
The question remains how this can be implemented in practice, and also whose job it
should be to implement.
A very good beginning to an exciting conversation I believe.
