This analysis piece argues that suboptimal performance of PMTCT programs in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) is related to suboptimal male involvement in the cascade of ANC and post-natal care. While
the idea to improve male partner involvement in PMTCT programs itself is not novel, the authors
provide a useful summary of the literature, and important suggestions for how to increase male
involvement going forward.
Nevertheless, the analysis can be improved by addressing the following issues:
Introduction:
1)
The argument hinges on the assumption that increasing male involvement will improve all
steps of the PMTCT cascade, but there was only one sentence in the introduction describing this
literature, with only 2 references covering all the following domains: increasing in HIV testing, ART
initiation and adherence, HIV communication and prevention, decreases in new infant HIV infections,
and increases in HIV-free infant survival. I suggest that they bolster their review of the beneficial
impacts of male involvement in PMTCT by providing a little more specificity in the introduction when
the concept is first introduced.
2)
Additionally, more nuance can be provided as to the type of “male involvement” referred to in
the introduction. For instance, there is likely a difference between a partner agreeing that their
pregnant partner should go to ANC clinic, versus accompanying them to visits, encouraging testing
and uptake of ART and actively supporting ART adherence. This point is alluded to later when they
describe “varying definitions of male involvement” but should be brought up early so that the reader
knows what is meant by “male involvement” from the outset.
Challenges in studying male partner involvement in PMTCT
3)
In the section on “low background involvement of males in antenatal care”, the authors focus
on ANC clinic attendance only, but not the involvement of males in other steps in the PMTCT cascade.
4)
In the section on “Varied socio-cultural contexts, including gender roles and power dynamics”,
it is not clear whether the authors are referring to differences in socio-cultural issues between
settings, or on socio-cultural issues that may be relevant to many settings. The arguments can be
clarified here.

5)
Section on “varying definitions of male involvement”, when the authors discuss “the ideal
level of male partner involvement”, is there any evidence on what that ideal level is, and whether it is
different according to the different steps along the cascade of care?
6)
In the section on “Male partner involvement strategies as a component of bundled
interventions:” The first sentence (page 7, line 20) is not clear as written, and should be reworded.
7)
Line 37 on page 7: What type of “male partner involvement” increased as per discussion on
varying definition of male partner involvement”?
8)
Section on “unintended effects”: Have some or all of the unintended effects described in this
section been demonstrated in studies, or are these more hypothetical concerns?
Available evidence from individual studies:
9)
It would be helpful if the authors describe what type of male involvement was included in
each of the interventions presented. This is done in some but not all of the studies discussed.
What changes do national HIV/PMCTC programs need to institute?
10)
While the authors make some important and helpful recommendations here, since this is the
heart of the analysis, I believe this section can be further expanded and enriched with more detailed
recommendations.
Conclusion:
11)
I think an expanded discussion of next steps in research can be helpful here or in the
previous section (perhaps expanding some of the ideas listed in Box 1).
