This is a very important study regarding the risk of breast cancer in transwomen. I have
just a few comments.
1. It would helpful to know if any of these breast cancers found in this cohort have been
previously published. If so, it would be nice to link the cases to the published case reports.
2. Can we please have some more detail about the gender affirming hormone regimens
used? This is important to know. Are there any levels that they can share in the tables?
One might assume that higher estradiol levels would increase risk
3. The conclusions about no need for an "intensified breast cancer screening" regimen is
very vague. They should state more explicitly (if the authors agree) that following breast
cancer screening guidelines that are recommended for cisgender women may be
appropriate for now until there is more evidence to change this practice.
4. How were these breast cancers detected?
5. How does the risk of breast cancer compare to findings in other cohorts of transwomen?
