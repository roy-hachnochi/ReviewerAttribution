In this paper, Crump et al. sought to evaluate the relationship between preterm birth and
later CKD risk. Using a national birth registry, they evaluated a large cohort of over 4
million births in Sweden from 1973-2014. CKD diagnosis was ascertained using billing
codes, and although only a small number of persons were identified as having CKD
(n=4305; 0.1%), those with a history of preterm birth had 2-3x increased odds for being
so diagnosed.
This work has many strengths.
The topic is timely. As noted by the authors, as premature infants survive in greater
numbers and with fewer short-term comorbidities, there has been increasing interest in the
long-term outcomes for these infants.
The work is carefully executed. Data collection for prematurity was remarkably complete:
only 0.2% of singleton births were missing gestational age. Statistical analysis is
straightforward and robust. The paper itself is well-written and the logic flows smoothly
throughout.
Some of the findings are truly novel. For instance, I am unaware of any previous data
demonstrating increased CKD risk for infants born at 37-38 wga. The sibling analysis (to
evaluate potential familial/environmental factors contributing to CKD risk) is also
noteworthy for both its novelty and improvement over existing works.
That said, there are several opportunities for improvement, enumerated below.
1.
The authors correctly state that theirs would be the first population-based study of
preterm birth and CKD. However, there are a number of other studies that evaluate the
association between birth weight and subsequent CKD risk. This existing data is probably
not adequately acknowledged in the current manuscript. While many premature infants
are low birth weight, these groups may have different risk factors for developing CKD.
Including this in the discussion would better situate the value of the authors’ findings
within the existing literature.
2.
The primary outcome is assessed using administrative data (ICD codes), which are
known to capture CKD poorly (see, for instance, Vlasschaert M AJKD 2011; 57:29-43;
Ronksley PE NDT 2011, 27:1826-31; Stevens LA JASN 2005, 16:2439-48; etc.). The

overall prevalence of CKD – just 0.1% - seems unrealistically low, even in a relatively
young population. This limits the utility of these data in informing policy. This limitation is
mentioned briefly by the authors, but the implications of this upon data interpretation
should be discussed more fully. Are there population-level data on the true frequency of
CKD in Sweden that could be cited to place this in context?
3.
While the finding that infants born even at 37-38 weeks gestation have increased
odds for developing CKD is novel, it is uncertain what this represents. In the discussion,
the authors hypothesize that this may be due to endothelial/vascular changes, but I
suspect it is due to residual confounding. Infants are born preterm for various reasons
(see Goldenberg RL Lancet 2008; 371:75-84), and it is likely that the reasons for delivery
for infants born at 37-38 weeks differ systematically from those born at 39-40 weeks in a
number of ways. To me, this is one of the most important findings in the paper, and
discussing it in a careful manner will improve the quality of the paper significantly. In the
discussion of this issue, the authors may also wish to cite data showing inferior outcomes
for 37-38 wga vs. 39-40 wga infants in other areas (for instance, Tita A NEJM 2009;
360:111-120).
4.
The relationship between age and risk for CKD diagnosis (highlighted in Figure 1)
is interesting. However, I have to think these results are driven by recent improvements
in NICU care leading to improved survival for the smallest, sickest infants. Pulmonary
surfactant was only introduced in the 1980s; the outlook for premature infants with RDS
born prior to that era was grim. The lungs and kidneys both develop in late gestation, and
pulmonary/renal maturity correlate well.
5.
The authors note that there were no specific ICD codes for CKD prior to 1987.
How would patients with CKD have been coded prior to that time? Should alternative
codes be considered for patients prior to that point?
6.
Left unexplored is the severity of CKD among those diagnosed. Among the
patients with CKD, how many had ESRD?
7.
One of the advantages of this study is its use of population-level data. In my
opinion, the authors should therefore try to be as inclusive as possible in their analyses, so
that the numbers truly reflect that of the population. In light of this, why were only
singleton births included?
8.
The fact that this study was conducted in a relatively monoethnic society may be
an advantage of this work that should be highlighted specifically. Previous studies in more
ethnically diverse populations may be more difficult to interpret, given the known
associations between race, social determinants of health, and nephron number.
9.
Neonatal AKI is mentioned in both the introduction and discussion. Why? It is
true that there is an association between AKI and subsequent CKD, and it likely that some
of the preterm infants experienced AKI – but since the present study does not evaluate
AKI, its inclusion here seems tangential. If the authors do wish to discuss this, I think the
most authoritative estimate on the incidence of AKI comes from the AWAKEN group (Jetton
JG, Lancet Child & Adolescent Health 2017; 1:184-94.)
10.
As noted in the discussion, there may be a role for screening patients born
prematurely for CKD. However, given the low prevalence of CKD identified here, these
data may not provide the best support for such a policy. Instead, the authors may wish to
highlight other potential uses of their data, such as demonstrating another potential benefit
to health policies that reduce the rates of preterm delivery. A number of such strategies
have been described (see Shapiro-Mendoza CK MMWR 2016; 65: 826-30). The best way
to mitigate the long-term risks of premature birth is probably to prevent it in the first
place.

The tables are very numerically dense. It may be useful to include a column with
a forest-plot type visual representation of the OR, so that readers can more easily assess
the most significant relationships at a glance.
