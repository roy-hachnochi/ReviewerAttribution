Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the revised version of the paper.
I find that the authors have dealt satisfactorily with my comments to the original
manuscript.
One small comment for the new version: In table 1 age and follow up time is now
relevantly described with median and IQR - but formally IQR is the distance between the
25 and 75 percentile, that is one figure - the given figures must be the 25 and 75
percentiles themselves.
Best regards
