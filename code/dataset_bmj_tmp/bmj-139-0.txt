The study of Amit Kaura et al, tries to explore the association of troponin levels and
mortality risk in retrospective data collected through the NIHR.
Several issues arise when studying the manuscript.
• The methodology of the follow-up, which is very critical for the study (this is the central
point) is not clear at all. How did the researchers contact the patients? How many patients
were lost to follow up?
• From the total of 257948 patients 52,1% had ICD codes. Does this mean that all analysis
(i.e. ACS vs non-ACS) was done using the 134517 patients?
• A flow chart of the study would be very useful
• The authors use different troponin assays as one. Only in the supplementary figure 2 the
different association of every troponin assay with mortality is visible, however the authors do
not comment on that, although troponin is the fundamental topic of the manuscript.

From all the above I strongly suggest that the manuscript of Amit Kaura et al in the present
form does not meet the quality standards for publication.
