The present study has evaluated the prognostic value of troponin levels in all comers in the
ER, setting using a retrospective database with follow up for all cause mortality. The study
demonstrated a non linear, yet positive association between troponin levels and mortality
after stratification for ACS and revascularization status. The authors conclude that troponins
are important indicator of mortality risk.
The authors also explored how this association varies by age, demonstrating a similar
increase in absolute risk associated with higher troponin levels, but variable HR due to the
differences in baseline risk across ages. Importantly, in the abstract the authors highlight as
a primary objective this evaluation of age and troponin, yet the manuscript is mostly focused
on the other aspects of the association between troponin and death.
There are several issues with the manuscript, mostly related to the origin of the dataset, and
which are quite well mentioned in the limitations, still, this needs to be taken into
consideration to define the acceptance of the manuscript. My key points are:
1. Both title and abstract do not present an adequate summary of the study. With the
present title and abstract I was under the impression this manuscript would be about
troponin in “an unselected group of patients”, not suspected ischemia / chest pain individuals
in the ER. Nowhere in the title or abstract it is noted that these patients are in the ER. I was
expecting a manuscript on chronic patients including CKD, HF, etc. Please adjust title and
abstract to be a clear definition of what the study aims.
2. The authors have two objectives, evaluate the role of troponin across the age levels, a
novel interesting aspect, and value of mild / minimal troponin elevations. The second is more
well stablished and not so novel. Interestingly, the authors spend more time in discussing /
presenting results related to the second, not the first objective.
3. Despite the large sample size, the study is limited by the fact that the clinical information
provided is minimal, as this is based on lab and codes only. Thus, although the study is able
to demonstrate the association between troponin and mortality, the adjustment for
confounding is somewhat limited, and the true clinical value / incremental value of troponin
is unclear. Whether this findings add anything to the clinical picture cannot be fully
appreciated by the current analysis.
4. Paragraph starting on line 10 of page 16 is not part of the results. The authors are
speculating / commenting on their findings. This would be more appropriate in the
discussion.
5. The authors discuss differences between those managed invasively vs. non-invasively, but
not discussion on ST vs. non-ST elevation MI is presented, and this should interact with the
differences between strategies. Do the authors have data that allows separation between ST
vs nonST MI? If available I would consider this in the results. If not, I would still consider the
point in the discussion and limitations.
6. Also a limiting factor is the lack of clinical information on patient presentation to the ER.
7. Conclusion is rather long and extends quite a bit beyond the actual finding of the
manuscript.
Overall, despite the limitations I think the large sample size and proposed stratification of
the analysis increase the interest in the manuscript, and I think most of the issues raised
above can be addressed by authors upon revision.
