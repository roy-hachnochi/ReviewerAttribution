I thank the authors again for their revision and clear response. I think we are very close
now, but I would suggest one further revision to address the points below. I thank the
authors in advance for addressing these, and I am confident they will do a good job.
1) In the abstract, need to make it clear whether the summary hazard ratios are adjusted
for confounding factors (other risk factors)
2) In the data extraction of the Methods section, please define what is meant by ‘maximally
adjusted’ – the authors refer to the reported HR that adjusted for the most confounders, but
the reader might think that this rather refers to HRs that adjusted for a pre-defined set of
confounders that would the authors considered to be the maximum.
3) Explain that by ‘crude estimate’ the authors mean unadjusted estimates
4) STATA should be Stata
5) In the assessment of heterogeneity section of the methods, start by saying “IN EACH
META-ANALYSIS, heterogeneity was evaluated by using …”

6) Methods says: “A p-value of <0.10 indicates the presence of publication bias” – rather
replace this with “A p-value of <0.10 was taken as statistical evidence of the the presence of
small study effects (potential publication bias)”
7) Results: “Figure 1 shows the SHRs and their corresponding …” – please make it clear here
and indeed everywhere that the SHRs are Summary ADJUSTED Hazard Ratios
8) In the results, the authors often refer to statistical significance. I would prefer them to
say that there was no strong evidence of association, and also refer to whether the width of
the 95% CI is wide. In other words, don’t infer that there is no association when actually it
may be a low power issue. So, just be cautious about using statistical significance to guide
statements about no associations.
9) No results are embedded within the results text – the tables are referred to, but I think
providing summary results in brackets for a few key variables would make the reading
clearer and flow better.
10) Most important point: I think the quality of evidence should come early on in the results.
Then, when the authors provide their SHRs, they can make an accompanying statement
about the quality of evidence behind it?
11) The previous two points are already done superbly well in the abstract, e.g. “The quality
of evidence was rated high for an inverse association with incidence of T2D for an increased
intake of whole grains (SHR for an increment of 30 g/d (95%-CI): 0.87 (0.82-0.93)) and …”
– I would suggest the authors write similarly in the actual results.
At the moment the results are quite disjointed, and hard to piece together the SHRs with the
quality angle. Starting with quality and the focusing the start of the SHRs to be on those
with high quality evidence would really help.
I hope this helps the authors and the BMJ going forward
Best wishes, Richard Riley
