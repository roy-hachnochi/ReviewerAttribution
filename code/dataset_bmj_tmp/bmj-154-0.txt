Manuscript ID BMJ-2018-048338 Reviewer Comments – Michael F. Jacobson
I believe that this is a very useful and clearly written contribution to the global discussions
on using taxes to reduce the prevalence of obesity. Most of those discussions have
focused on sugar drinks; this paper suggests the value of also addressing other high-sugar
foods. The paper should stimulate both further research and proposals by policy makers.
Table 1: increase in cake consumption after 20% tax is attributed to strong substitution
effect toward other foods. Could that also be explained, in part, by flaws in the
methodology? A brief explication would be useful. I don’t see the supporting cross-PE
data shown in an appendix. If convenient, that could be useful though not essential.
Sugar snacks provide twice as many calories as SSBs in the UK, but the estimated effect of
a 20% tax on energy, weight gain, etc. is an order of magnitude greater for sugar snacks
than SSBs. That apparent discrepancy deserves explanation in the Discussion—especially
because so much more evidence supports an effect of SSBs on obesity than sugar-rich
foods.
The paper assumes a 1:1 correlation between energy intake and weight change. That’s a
huge and questionable assumption. It deserves to be acknowledged in the Abstract (see
my suggested wording on the manuscript) and Results and explained further in the
Discussion. The Limitations paragraph could also emphasize that the model is only a
construct and needs to be proven or disproven by real-life experience.

I recommend publication after those comments are addressed.
Discussion: It would be worth commenting on the applicability of the findings to other
countries. Does the sugar snack:SSB ratio found in the UK apply to other countries?
Perhaps give examples. I suspect that that ratio is very different in North and South
America.
