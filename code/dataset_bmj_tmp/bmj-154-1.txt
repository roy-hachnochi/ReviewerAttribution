This is a simulation study aiming to estimate the potential impact of a price increase of
20% in high-sugar snacks on energy purchase, weight change, and change in BMI and
obesity prevalence in the UK. The topic is of great significance to inform public health
related policies. However, there are a few important issues remained to be addressed in
the manuscript.
Major comments:
1. The product level household expenditure data were taken from Kantar Worldpanel
(KW)l. For readers not familiar with KW, it is important to provide more information on it.
Also, any validation studies on product level household expenditure data collected by KW?

2. The data from KW only included purchases brought home. Are there existing data
estimating the proportion of foods and beverages (particularly for high-sugar snack foods)
and associated energy purchase consumed out of homes vs. those brought home? This
information would be important to evaluate and facilitate the interpretation of the study
findings.
3. A major limitation of the study is the lack of information on age and sex of each
household member. Further, as reported in Appendix 1, 30-40% of the households
included in the study have 1.7-1.8 children per household on average. The authors
estimated the magnitude of weight loss and associated changes in BMI and
overweight/obesity prevalence using data in adults aged ≥16 years from the NDNS. This
could introduce bias considering the unneglectable difference in weight and BMI between
adults and children. Can the authors incorporate the information on % of households with
children and the number of children/household into the simulation? At least, a sensitivity
analysis restricted to households without children is needed.
4. The authors conducted many statistical tests by subgroups. The issue of multiple
comparison needs to be addressed carefully.
5. Given the implementation of price and/or tax increase for sugar sweetened beverages in
several countries, it’d be helpful to summarize the current literature of the observed impact
of such a policy on changes in energy purchase, weight, and BMI, if available.
6. It is also important to consider that when people reduce the purchase level of one food
group (e.g. high-sugar snacks in this study), they may substitute it with other food groups,
which could also be unhealthy (e.g., high-fat foods or snacks). Even the 20% price
increase in high-sugar snacks did result in changes in purchase level, the potential impact
of the substitution with other (unhealthy) food groups on the actual energy purchase and
associated changes in weight and BMI are undetermined. This issue remains to be
addressed and discussed at least.
Minor comments:
1. The last sentence in the Introduction: the sentence seems incomplete – estimate the
potential impact of a price increase on high-sugar snacks on what outcomes?
2. The “index shopper” first appears in line 36 on page 4 but its definition or explanation
doesn’t appear until its second appearance in line 46 on page 4. I suggest the authors
move the definition in the parentheses up to line 36.
3. In equation 1, provide notations for j and n.
4. In Table 2, the * superscript sign was used but no footnote was provided.
