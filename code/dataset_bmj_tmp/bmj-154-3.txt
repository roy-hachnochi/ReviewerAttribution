This is an extremely interesting paper in a really critical area of public health policy both
within the UK and internationally. The evidence in support of sugar taxes is ever increasing
and this study bring both a new angle on this issue by looking at high sugar snacks as well
as a valuable nuance to the arguments by comparing the effects of taxes across different
specific policy options.
That said, I do not think the paper is without its problems. In particular, I think it needs to
be clearer about exactly which policy questions it is setting out to answer and which it is

not. For example, the abstract talks exclusively about taxing high-sugar snacks until
midway through the Results section when it suddenly brings in a comparison to taxes on
SSBs. Is the ambition of the paper to estimate the impact of a tax increase on high-sugar
snacks, or is it to explicitly estimate whether policy makers would be better to tax
high-sugar snacks or SSBs? It is also unclear to what extent the stratification of the model
and presentation of disaggregated results by both BMI and income groups is motivated by
the fact that there is good evidence that these groups respond differently to price changes
and therefore this stratification gives us a better estimate of the population level impact of
the policy, or whether the inequality impacts are important in and of themselves. The
paper at present rather hedges its bets on this question and I'd suggest that either the
argument for examining inequalities in outcomes across these groups needs to be made
more clearly as being of particular policy interest from the outset, or rowed back somewhat
from the results.
I also think that the description of the modelling methods is quite opaque in its present
form and requires quite a lot of further refinement in order to make it suitable for a general
medical audience. I appreciate that it is difficult to compress complex modelling
approaches into a few paragraphs that are both comprehensible to a lay audience and
comprehensive. Perhaps it might be worth considering putting some of the more technical
detail into an appendix for the interested reader?
Specific comments:
Abstract - the 'Participants' section is a rather awkward combination of methods and
participants/data sources at present
Abstract - the 'Results' section uses 'magnitude' when I think you probably mean 'order of
magnitude'
Introduction - the section on obesity rates in the nations of the UK, rather than the UK as a
whole, is not particularly motivated by anything else in the paper - I suggest either tying
this in to a broader point about inequalities both within and between nations, or presenting
figures for the whole UK only.
Introduction - the second paragraph introduces the comparison with SSBs without any
prior introduction of the policy context around SSBs. I suggest a slight reordering of things
to correct this might help understanding for those not familiar with the UK policy context.
Methods - the 1st paragraph justifies the choice of a 20% price increase on the basis that
SSB studies have examined the same or similar policies. This is a fair argument, but I
wonder if the study may have greater impact if the policy modelled was more closely tied
to what was feasible or plausible in the UK. The various policies in existence around the
world that are set out in the introduction are all taxes or levies based on volume of sugar
or volume of product, not on price per se (so a cheap high-sugar product would increase in
price by more than an expensive lower-sugar product, whereas a flat price increase would
have the opposite effect).
Methods - the phrase 'the dataset includes...' in the second paragraph gives a slightly
strange list of outlets which makes it feel as though a specific outlet type is excluded from
the analysis - if so then I suggest being explicit about this and if not then there is no need
to list all of the various outlet types that might sell high-sugar snacks (do many butchers
sell cakes?).
Methods - it is not clear what the definition 'foods at ambient temperatures to be
consumed on the go without utensils' is applied to. Is this a necessary or sufficient
definition in the data? This definition could equally apply to things such as crisps or fruit
which are not high-sugar snacks. I presume these are not included in the analysis, but the
description does not make this clear.
Methods - the issue of 25% missingness is acknowledged later in the paper, but I'm not
completely convinced that a complete case analysis as presented here is the most
appropriate approach. Income data is highly unlikely to be missing at random, and income
and BMI are extremely likely to be correlated, as Appendix 1A suggests. I would like to see
the authors take a more robust approach to this issue.

Methods - the description in paragraph 4 of the AIDS approach is ambiguous as to whether
the study uses the same approach as described in Smith et al. (which is itself an adapted
AIDS approach), or whether it uses an adapted version of the Smith et al. approach. I
presume the former, but the wording could be cleared up slightly.
Methods - throughout the methods section, the question of whether the analysis is being
conducted at the level of households, individuals, but only considering the main purchaser,
or individuals, considering all individuals but assigning all individuals within a household
the characteristics of the main purchaser. This ambiguity makes it extremely difficult to
parse the mapping between the Kantar results and the NDNS modelling, as it's not clear
exactly what assumptions are being made.
Methods - Equation 1 is very hard to interpret - I think the left hand side should probably
be the absolute or relative change in EP, not the total EP. n is undefined (and I'm not clear
why it is required when we know the number of food groups is 13) and j and k are entirely
undefined. I'm further unsure if it is helpful to introduce an equation and then immediately
say that the actual calculations are performed using 'a chained version' of this equation but
present no further details of the actual calculation performed.
Methods - the description of the uncertainty analysis is quite sparse. It isn't clear if the
covariance of the PED estimates is considered (I can't see why it shouldn't be, but it isn't
mentioned) and it's not clear if the only uncertainty being considered is the uncertainty
around the PEDs, or if uncertainty around the baseline purchasing or energy intake are
also considered. If they are not then this needs to be clearly acknowledged as a limitation,
as the resulting CIs will be too narrow as they only reflect a partial treatment of the
uncertainty. It's further not clear how the apparent two-step Monte Carlo sampling was
handled. I'm not sure if it is correct that only 100 simulations were run in the first step and
1000 in the second - that would seem unusual to me. I'm also unclear what the phrases
'using best estimates and variance of change' mean.
Methods - no source is given for the figure of 7715kcal per kg of weight loss and it isn't
entirely clear to me what this figure represents. Does it mean that for every 7715kcal
reduction in annual energy intake you estimate a 1kg weight loss? Is it appropriate to
assume this relationship is linear?
Methods - Equation 2 is also quite confusing - W(t) is presumably weight after one year,
and could maybe be more clearly expressed as such. The symbol for theta in the equation
and the legend is different and the legend refers to '1 pound' of body weight loss, whereas
the rest of the paper is in kg.
Methods - the description of the NDNS is slightly ambiguous whether it refers to just the
years 2012 and 2016 or all years inbetween as well.
Methods - the need to map to the NDNS at all isn't very well motivated at present in the
text. Please be more clear about exactly what problems this mapping is solving and also
what potential problems it introduces. How different would the results be if they were
based only on the Kantar data?
Results - Since the results discuss the aggregated results across the whole population, I
suggest adding a 'population' row to Table 1 showing these figures. The same might be
helpful in Table 2 as well.
Results - in the description of Figure 1, it is suggested that 'chocolate and confectionary
was most strongly associated with a decrease in energy purchase in the group classified as
'not overweight' yet the results for obese look pretty similar to the not overweight group.
Results - the following sentence says that the impact of price increases in the overweight
group chows no clear pattern, which may be true, but it reflects a slightly
confusing switch from describing patters in products over groups to patterns in products
within groups.
Results - It could be more explicitly stated that the results in Figure 2 are from
independent analyses of the two policies. There also appears to be some missing figures
from the text in this section
Results - in discussing Table 2 the assumption that change in energy purchased is
proportional to changes in actual energy consumption. I would have thought the
assumption was actually that they were equal, since the absolute change in energy
purchased is used to calculate the change in weight.

Discussion - the first short paragraph discusses the effects of a price increase in snacks
only, while the next paragraph discusses the effects of a combined snacks and SSB price
increase. I suggest delineating these more clearly.
Discussion - in relation to the impact on health inequalities, while the largest effects in
obese households is in low income groups, the opposite is true in overweight households,
so the net effect on health inequalities is harder to assess without further analysis.
Discussion - the penultimate paragraph mentions supermarket purchases explicitly as if
only they are included in the data, which is at odds with the description in the methods
section.
Discussion - I'd suggest the conclusion could be a little punchier perhaps - making
reference to the apparent conclusion that if policy makers want to tackle obesity then
sugar taxes are effective and that focusing attention on high-sugar snacks as well as or
instead of SSBs might be a more fruitful approach. It might be nice to consider whether
this finding would be generalisable to other contexts - would the authors recommend that
policy makers in other countries favour snack taxes over SSB taxes, or is there something
specific about the UK which is driving this differential effect?
