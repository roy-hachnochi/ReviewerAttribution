General comments:
Thank you for the opportunity to review this article. This manuscript is very well-written.
The study is a well-coordinated collaborative project which enabled the harmonized
analyses using objective measures of physical activity and sedentary time with large
sample size. Since the current guidelines are informed primarily by studies using self-repot
physical activity data, this paper provides crucial data for the advancement of public health
recommendations.
Major comments:
-Did the authors set any inclusion/exclusion criteria for the participants in each study? Two
studies (WAT2D and FHS) did not include chronic disease conditions as a covariate (Table
1). To minimize the risk of reverse causality, it would be better to perform a sensitivity
analysis with Model C excluding the two studies and show the robustness of the current
results. Also when comparing the magnitude of the association with those of self-report
studies, it is of note that these studies either excluded participants with pre-existing CVD
(Ref 39: Lear et al., 2017) or adjusted for history of cancer and heart disease (Ref 46:
Arem et al., 2015); thus Model C would be a fair comparator?
-To further advance understanding and examine the “flip side” of PA-sedentary coin, a
combined analysis examining a joint association of physical activity and sedentary time
with mortality would give additional value to this paper (cf. Ekelund et al., 2016 Lancet).
Minor comments:
-In Methods, Page 9, the cutpoints for accelerometer data were originally developed and
validated in younger adults (refs 13, 24, and 25), although older individuals constitute the
majority of participants in the current analysis. It might be possible that the cutpoints
affected the low numbers of participants undertaking bouted MVPA and VPA. Could you
comment on the potential influence of the cutpoint selection on the results?
-In Supplementary Table 2, please add the range (min & max) of age in each study.
