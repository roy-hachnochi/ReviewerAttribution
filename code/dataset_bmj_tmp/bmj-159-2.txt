Thank you for the opportunity to review the manuscript entitled ‘nutrition and cancer’.
This is a narrative review of associations between lifestyle factors and the risk of common
cancers or those of the digestive tract. This is a topic of great interest to the broad
readership of the journal, and the manuscript is well written.

Comment 1: I am uncertain about the manuscript length, currently at more than twice
what is recommended for this article type. The manuscript title and introduction suggest
this work considers dietary factors in cancer incidence, however smoking and viral or
bacterial agents are often discussed. A focus solely on dietary factors as the title of the
article suggests could appreciably reduce the current manuscript length.
Comment 2: The reader is given no concept of the relative burden of each cancer type,
why these cancer sites were chosen, and if they represent the majority of the total cases.
It may be useful to provide context to the reader by first considering foods or nutrients
and total cancer mortality, where the data are available, before then considering site
specific cancers with their relative burden clearly identified.
Comment 3: A similar comment applies to how foods and nutrients are discussed, is the
first food or nutrient mentioned for each cancer site that with the greatest influence on
cancer occurrence? It may help the reader if you provide additional measures of effect size
where available. It is sometimes uncertain if evidence comes from Cochrane reviews,
other systematic reviews and meta analyses, prospective observational studies, or other.
Comment 4: Please consider providing an additional box on the type and amount of
evidence necessary to produce convincing or probable evidence as used by the WCRF and
IARC. This may then simply the text on page 16-18.
Comment 5: The way forward (sub heading on page 18) is an opportunity for the authors
to address issues within nutrition epidemiology (identified in box 3) by providing clear
guidelines for future original articles, methods of data synthesis, or the delivery of
evidence based dietary advice. Given the current scrutiny of nutrition epidemiology and
evidence based dietary messages, some thought should be given to this topic.
Specific points:
Comment 6: (Paragraph on page 10, starting on line 228) consider separating out fibre
from fruits and vegetables. Within this paragraph you also discuss whole grains, it may be
more appropriate to have a subheading on ‘fibre and whole grains’ and another on ‘fruit
and vegetables’
Comment 7: (Box 1: Are fruit and vegetables important?) You should clarify the heading
to be specific to cancer incidence, or acknowledge that fruit and vegetables play a role
beyond cancer incidence in the prevention and management of other non communicable
diseases.
Comment 8: (Page 2 line 41-42) ‘relatively few dietary factors have been clearly shown to
be important’ consider an acknowledgement that we don’t eat these dietary factors in
isolation, and that dietary patterns such as plant based may be more informative, should
the evidence base be developed.
