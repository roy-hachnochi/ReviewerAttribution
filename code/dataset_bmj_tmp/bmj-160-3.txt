The paper has been revised to take account of my previous statistical concerns. The use of
cumulative average dietary fat intake to represent long-term intake has been adequately
addressed, and further information has now been included about the choice of 2%
replacement of energy.
In addition, the change to Table 1 (now showing data at the midpoint of follow-up) is
valuable, and additional sensitivity analyses have been included.
