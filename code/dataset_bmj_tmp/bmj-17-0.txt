An important paper reinforcing the renal benefits observed in RCT's to observational data.
Some comments:
eGFR is a major predictor for the occurence of renal outcomes. Propose including in the
main analysis only those with propensity matching which included eGFR, and consider
subanalysis matching also for UACR.
The introduction is written chronologically, introducing the EMPA-REG study in detail and
then commenting on the other CVOT's. However, since this is a renal outcome study, I
think more focus should be given to the CREDENCE study in which its renal endpoint was
the primary.
History of CKD was based on ICD10. Reviewing data in S12-13 this is clearly an
underestimation, since there appear to be over 3% with eGFR<60. Propose defining CKD
by eGFR + albuminuria (where available).
The CV trial of this cohort should be mentioned.
