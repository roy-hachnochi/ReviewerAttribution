This is a reasonably good manuscript that adds to the literature that SGLT2 inhibitors are
renoprotective. This has been shown in clinical trials, some real world evidence and now a
large registry based study. While not particularly novel in and of itself, this might help
alleviate some of the 'clinical inertia' that has been seen with real-world prescription of
these medications, and solely because of that reason might merit publication in BMJ. I have
some comments that need to be addressed before
Comments
1. Why do the authors only compare to DPP-1 inhibitors. According to recent ADA
guidelines SGLT2i are recommended as first or second line agents. They should compare to
other antidiabetic agents as well. A useful comparison may be against GLP1 agonists or
even insulin
2. A subgroup analysis of high vs. low risk of renal progression (i.e. by UACR>30 vs
UACR<30 and by eGFR<60 vs >60) is needed. The authors do a sensitivity analysis by
CKD diagnosis (ICD codes) but it is well known that the sensitivity and specificity of ICD
codes is quite poor
3. Additionally a subgroup analysis for SGLT2i type is needed. THe reviewer understands
that canagliflozin prescriptions are quite limited but the numbers should allow for .a
comparison between empa and dapa
4. The study as generalizability concerns. There is no ethnic diversity (understandably) and
this should be considered as a limitation.

5. An additional limitation should be use of ICD codes for defining covariates and outcomes
might not be completely valid and accurate.
