Summary: This is a systematic review of studies reported the development and validation
of 30 day readmission risk prediction models since 2015. It is probably more appropriate
for BMJ Open than BMJ. The presentation is overall valuable and informative, however a
few considerations might improve the manuscript.

1) “condition-specific hospital readmission” implies that patients are being readmitted for a
specific condition. Many of these studies, however, modelled all-cause readmission within a
subgroup of hospitalized patients, e.g., patients with CHF. The authors should restate this
as “readmission among patients with specific conditions” and distinguish between all-cause
readmission and readmission for a specific condition.
2) The C-statistics reported should be qualified as based on the derivation sample or
validation sample throughout the text and tables. Either both should be reported or just
the validation sample C-statistic.
3) The last sentence of the Results section on page 14 is unclear. “Broader” implies benefit
beyond the institution of the study. I suggest rephrasing this.
4) There could be more clarity about which studies were retrospective and which were
prospective. Likewise which used internal validation and which used external validation.
Most of the studies in Table 1 do not specify any of these features. These could be
indicated with footnotes or in the legend.
5) All abbreviations in Tables should be defined, like “exc” in Table 3
