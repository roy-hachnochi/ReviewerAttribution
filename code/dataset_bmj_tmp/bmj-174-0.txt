Dear Authors,
Thank you for the opportunity to review your manuscript entitled: “Pregnancy duration and endometrial
cancer risk: a nationwide cohort study”. This is a niece piece of work assessing the association between
pregnancy duration and endometrial cancer risk in a cohort of Danish women.
However, I have a number of comments with regard to the current version of the manuscript.
Main body:
In the Methods section:
On page 4, line 19 to 22, it writes: “Information of induced abortions on all women in Denmark,
including the date of the procedure and the week of gestation, is mandatorily reported to the National
Registry of Induced Abortions”. However, it does not say when this mandatory reporting was instituted
in Denmark. In addition, it is not clear whether induced abortion before 1973 was a legal procedure in
the country, and if not, how it was reported. Please could you clarify?
On page 4, line 52 to 59, it is not clear when the National Patient Registry started holding information
about spontaneous abortions resulting in clinical contact.
On page 5, line 13 to 18, it writes: “Information on cancer stage (grouped using FIGO classification
(15)) and cancer subtype (by previously used grouping of subtype histology (16)) was also retrieved
from the Danish Cancer Registry”. Since the FIGO classification of endometrial cancer has been revised
over time (the revised classification that authors refer to here was published in 2009), it is not clear if
the same FIGO classification has been used for endometrial cancer staging throughout the study period.
On page 5, line 38, it writes: “Each woman was followed from January 1, 1978, or from her 12th
birthday, whichever came later”. Could the authors explain the rationale for starting the follow up of
women at this date or age?
On page 5, line 42 to 47, it writes: “We censored on cancer prior to start of follow-up, first diagnosis of
any other cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), time of hysterectomy (incl.
hystero-oophorectomy), and time of bilateral oophorectomy”. What is the rationale for excluding
non-melanoma skin cancer?
On page 6, line 9 to 16, variables accounted for in the adjusted analyzes are listed. However, it is not
clear if hormonal contraception, a potential confounder, was properly considered.
On page 6, line 29 to 31, it writes: “In additional analyses, RRs were assumed to be the same for all
pregnancies subsequent to the first”. Is there any evidence to support this assumption? It will be good
to carry out sensitivity analyzes, where the RRs are not the same for subsequent pregnancies.
On page 6, line 40, it writes: “we allowed the relative risks to vary by these factors”. In the analyses,
how did the authors allow the relative risk to vary by these factors?
Overall, it is not clear if and how spontaneous abortion was accounted for in the analyses.

In the results section:
In the last paragraph of page 8 (line 47 to 59), the authors describe how they explored the potential
confounding effect of obesity and oral contraceptive use. First, this should be described in the Methods
section. Second, it would have been better to explore the effect of obesity, by adding the BMI (normal,
overweight, obese) into the adjusted analyses. It is not clear how women were classified as clinically
obese, and whether this classification changed over the time. On the other hand, I wonder if the use of
different birth cohorts as a proxy for different life-time exposures to oral contraceptive use is appropriate
in this study. Could the authors look for another way to measure this variable?
On the first paragraph of page 9 (lines 16 to 21), it is not clear how information on spontaneous abortion
was included in the analyses. This analysis is important to show that an early gestational effect may be
involved in the protective role of pregnancy against endometrial cancer. Please clarify.
In the Discussion section:
The authors challenge the current mechanisms associated with the risk of endometrial cancer, and based
on their findings, they hypothesize that an early gestational effect could be the most likely mechanism
responsible for the protective effect of pregnancy on endometrial cancer risk.
However, the explanation for this early gestational effect (a swift increase of the progesterone-estrogen
ratio in the first weeks following conception) does not seem convincing, since the levels of progesterone
increase steadily throughout pregnancy, and remain higher than those of estrogen until pregnancy
termination. Could other factors like the rapid increase of β-hCG during the firsts weeks of pregnancy
explain this effect?
The limitations of the study and its methodology should also be further discussed.
Thank you.
