I would like to commend the authors on performing an excellent study addressing an important question
on the risk factors of endometrial cancer and a well written manuscript.
This study looks at all women in Denmark born between 1935 and 2002 and their subsequent risk of
endometrial cancer in relation to number and type of pregnancies. Potential confounders are adjusted for
and an in-depth description of results is provided in both the manuscript and the supplemental material.
My comments are as follows:
1. As the authors are trying to capture as many pregnancies as possible and the follow up ends on Dec
31, 2014 I find the years of incision criteria to be too broad and would recommend only including women
who would be at least 20 years old by Dec 31, 2014.
2. This dataset has the advantage of having information on histologic subtype. As stated in the
manuscript there are 2 very distinct types of endometrial cancer (type I and type II). One is influenced
by hormonal factors and the other is not. The table addressing this (S2) should be moved from the
supplemental material to the manuscript. Further, I would recommend emphasizing the lack of
significant impact on type II endometrial cancer in the results and conclusions.
3. Spontaneous abortions constitute up to a third of all pregnancies. Although the authors mention that
information on SA is available (lines 52-60) they do not account for it in their analysis or explain why
this information was not included. This could be a potential confounder especially as the authors
conclude that "the reduction of endometrial cancer risk associated with pregnancy is most likely
explained by a biological process within the first weeks" and should be accounted for or an explanation
should be provided as to why it is not.
