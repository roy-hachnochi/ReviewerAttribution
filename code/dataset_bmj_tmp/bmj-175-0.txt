This is a thorough review and thanks for addressing my comments. I have a few minors:
1) The Table numbers need checking, I think you only have two main tables but the manuscript text
suggests there are 3. As an example, Table 2 in the text I think is Table 1
2) I don't think some of the numbers in the manuscript text always correspond to the numbers in the
relevant Tables. This was particularly evident in the severity of preventable harm section on page 13
Lines 15-19 but there was at least one other place this occurred.
This is an advisory point only, but typically with regression, I prefer the reference category to be the one
with the largest number of studies.
