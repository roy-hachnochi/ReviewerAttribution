In this manuscript, the authors explain clearly the multiple ways HIV in the parents or caregivers may
affect the health of exposed children, and the importance of understanding association between these
exposures and health outcomes.
This necessitates a new way to monitor these children, as compared to what is currently done, with two
major challenges which are (1) the resources given by low and middle income countries to this problem,
which may not be considered everywhere as a priority, and (2) the problem of HEU status “disclosure”.
I have 3 minor remarks :
1)
P5 lines 23-24 : the authors underline that conceiving while on ARV is expanding because of
PreP access, however, this is confusing to me.
The vast majority of women conceiving while on ART are HIV-infected women, women on PreP are a
small number, that will probably increase in years to come. Please clarify by adding
in the HEU paragraph (for example p4, after lines 55) that because of Option B+ a very large
number of HIV-infected women will conceive while on ARV;
and distinctly say later that a new population of children (the HUA) for now a very small
number, but maybe in the near future a more important population, may be exposed to ARV at
conception.
2)
Paragraph “routine monitoring of children”
One of the major obstacles to long-term follow-up of HEU children, is that most of them are not aware of
the HIV status of their parents, and therefore do not know their own “HEU” status.
This is developed in length later by the authors in the paragraph “the way forward” but should be
explained earlier in the text, as it is the major limitation to information collection on these children, even
in high income countries.
3)
P7, lines 26 : the unique identifiers, in order to tackle this problem of “HEU disclosure” would
need to link the mother to the child also.
