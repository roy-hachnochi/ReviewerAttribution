Statistical Review
In this study the authors have used meta-epidemiological methods to investigate how
different types of blinding in randomised clinical trials impact on study findings. They have

used existing systematic reviews obtained from the Cochrane Library, identified
meta-analyses which mixed together trials which did and did not use blinding, and then used
advanced state-of-the-art meta-analytical models to investigate the differences in study
findings according to blinding status. They contacted authors to clarify the blinding status
in trials where necessary, and used study findings extracted from the original Cochrane
meta-analyses. By combining comparisons across many different reviews they are able to
investigate whether blinding has an impact, and investigate whether the impact is consistent
across studies and clinical comparisons. They categorised blinding according to the aspect
of the trial that was blind (patient, patient care, outcome assessment) and the type of
outcome. They adjusted for other aspects of study design (such as concealed
randomisation) known to introduce bias. The authors should be congratulated on completing
this important study. The authors’ key finding is that a clear effect of blinding is not
detectable in these trials.
The study is well executed and generally well reported. My suggestions are for the authors
to reconsider the explanation of their methods and findings. Part of this is because many
readers would struggle to understand the meta-epidemiological approach with the level of
detail currently included, and the analysis model as currently explained; part because the
interpretation of the analyses does not appear to take notice of key aspects of heterogeneity
in their findings.
1) First, it is helpful to consider the way in which not blinding, should it be important, could
influence trial results. The model that the authors have fitted to the data allows for three
different ways in which this could occur:
a) The simplest consideration is that lack of blinding would increase the estimates of
treatment effects, leading to overestimation of the benefits of new or experimental
interventions. This is based on the idea that any bias would always act in the same
direction, favouring experimental over control, which would lead to relative odds ratios
acting in the same direction. Key to this is appropriate coding of the two interventions in
each comparison as “experimental” and “control” which the authors carefully address in their
manuscript, and appear to have used a reasonable method to define.
b) However, the first complication is that the bias might act in different directions for
different clinical scenarios. This would lead to lack of blinding overestimating the benefits of
new or experimental interventions compared to control for some clinical questions, but
underestimating benefits for others.
c) The second level of complication is that the bias might act in different directions in
different trials for the same clinical scenario. This means that some unblinded trials would
overestimate the treatment effect whereas others would underestimate the treatment effect
for the same clinical question.
In the model that the authors have used, the first type of bias would be detected by
observing a relative odds ratio different from 1, the second and third increase heterogeneity,
either between meta-analyses or within meta-analyses. These are estimated by the
heterogeneity of the ROR statistics between comparisons and within comparisons.
The authors need to explain the model and these issues more clearly in their manuscript,
and give guides to a reader as to how they should interpret the ROR and the heterogeneity
statistics. For example, it might help a reader if values of the ROR and the heterogeneity
statistics are reported for other aspects of study design for purposes of comparison (e.g. as
from reference 12).
2) Given that the authors have fitted a model that includes all three potential effects, the
interpretation in the paper appears to reflect exclusively on testing the first mechanism, that
not blinding would always introduce a bias that acts consistently in the same direction. My
observation is that, whilst their estimates of an overall average bias suggests that it may not
exist, they have estimated increases in both sorts of heterogeneity in the models, and that
these increases appear large in comparison to estimates made in previous studies using the
same model.

Could the authors reflect on what the impact of these increase in heterogeneity are? It is
hard for a reader to gauge what magnitude of increase could lead to important bias in the
form in which they are currently presented. Could the authors find alternative ways to
present these to help understand the magnitude of bias they could reflect? If it is large,
then the conclusions of the paper need revision.
3) Could the authors reflect on the limitations of the model which has been fitted? For
example, my understanding is that the model is unidimensional and only allows for increases
(and not decreases) in heterogeneity with non-blinding.
