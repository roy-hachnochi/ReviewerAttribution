This paper aims to introduce the concept of network science into understanding the
important and influenceable parties involved with NCDs in LMICs. However, the paper fails
to demonstrate the usefulness or provide an example of how this is applicable to NCDs. It
is neither an education piece, where a clinical reader may learn a new approach, nor a
demonstration. I have not seen the linked paper that the authors refer to, by Breda et al,
so perhaps this is already covered in that. However, even if it is. This paper needs to
continuously link how social network analysis can lead to better outcomes (or at least
better care) for NCDs.

1)
The term “Network analysis” is insufficiently descriptive for anyone to deduce
what type of approach is being used as there are so many different approaches to using
network analyses (from computer networking, network meta-analysis, etc.). For the title,
perhaps refer to it as network decision analysis or the like?
2)
2) think you can delete all the text after the first sentence of the first paragraph
and go straight into the second paragraph. Everyone knows NCDs are a problem in LMICs.
3)
You should use a diagram to illustrate a network.
4)
There is no link beyond paragraph 5 that links this paper to NCDs.
5)
Why no discussion of the precision (or rather imprecision of supposed links)?
6)
How can links be validated? No one is going to admit they are a weak link unless
they don’t want to be a strong link.
7)
There are common effect measures for networks in social networks such as the C
value. Perhaps a box explaining and demonstrating them?
