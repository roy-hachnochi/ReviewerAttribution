I thank the authors for re-analysing the data as recommended in the previous review. This
has improved the quality of the manuscript; however, the presentation of the new results is
somewhat inaccurate. Specifically, the statements of the form “X is associated with Y cancer”
used throughout the manuscript and other sentences in the statistical section: “We
investigated the prospective associations between sugary drinks consumption, … and overall,
breast, …cancer”; “The assumption of linearity, …between sugary drinks, … and cancer”
sound vague and inaccurate.
I recommend that the authors explain briefly in the statistical section why they are
estimating subdistribution hazard ratios (sHRs) and how to interpret these in the current
context. Some authors recommend to present both sHRs and cause-specific HRs to give a
complete picture, since sHRs are recommended more for prognostic modelling rather than
epidemiological research.
Did the authors account for the extra variation in the estimation of parameters of the
competing risk models introduced by the use of estimated usual daily intake as covariates?
