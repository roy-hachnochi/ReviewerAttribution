VJohn Øvretveit,
1importance and relevance of the topic
For improvement and implementation researchers and implementers this is a much needed analysis
…to a general readership
…but here I am not sure – Unfortunately I think clinician doctors reading BMJ would not read it, but
some managers and QI staff and policy-assisting staff that read BMJ might and should. Some clinical
researchers and more HSR researchers scanning BMJ also might and should read it.
It may be more appropriate to BMJ quality and safety but I regret to say their reviewers might be
prejudiced against this type of paper, in my experience.
2whether the article covers the topic well
Yes – very well and fair and useful
and in some depth
…as well as can be expected under the limitations of BMJ
whether the authors make their case well
Yes – very well
