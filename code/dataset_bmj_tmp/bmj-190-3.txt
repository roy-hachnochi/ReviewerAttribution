The topic of the paper is of significant relevance as health and care systems around the world are
seeking to accelerate scaling / spread of high impact innovations. The NHS Long Term Plan, for
example, highlights that everything prioritised in the plan is already happening somewhere in the NHS
but has not yet spread. The three lenses are informative, with the boxed examples and table
providing both practical examples and a good level of detail. The article is also made accessible by all
technical phrases being explained in brackets.
The current description of 'Implementation Science' in the main article seems limited (eg: not
referring to mapping barriers/ enablers etc) compared to the description of the other two lenses and
the quote starting line 11 refers to 'quality improvement' which some consider to be distinct from
implementation science. It may therefore be helpful to review this section to consider whether further
detail could/ should be provided? It may also be helpful in the conclusions/ key messages - if relevant
- to draw out a brief/ specific message for practitioners working on spread. For example, should those
leading spread programmes draw on the three approaches when developing their strategies?
