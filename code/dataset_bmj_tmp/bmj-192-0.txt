Frankly I think the information is valuable, but more valuable for people in their 50s who
may become carers in the future. If you learn that your chances of NOT getting dementia
in future would improve if you followed guidelines for exercise and nutrition, would you do
it? Not all of us are disciplined. But if as a carer you learn this you would have a lot of
incentive to follow the programs in order to avoid such a fate as dementia.
I think this study has much value because the authors were able to capture data from so
many people over such a long period of time: 25 years and 7899 people !
I do find the authors' outcomes relevant to future carers and doctors. I don't see how the
carers or patients involvement could be improved. And I have no suggestions for additional
outcomes.
Would knowing and tracking where the patients lived be of value? For instance, I was a
child in the midwest U.S. and I have a damaged retina from a virus that spread through
the US midwest in the early 1950s. Are there any regional patterns for dementia?
Or are there any patterns when you search by employment?

Do greater incidences of dementia occur in certain diseases (e.g. Parkinson's)?If so, can
these be listed in order of occurrences?
I hope my comments have been of some value.
