The role for fibrates in the clinical management of patients with combined hyperlipidaemia is
an unresolved issue, so the topic of this paper is of some interest. However in Britain
fibrates are usually only combined with a statin under the guidance of a lipid clinic , so it is
quite a specialist topic and may not be of broader clinical interest.
Propsensity score matching is a technique that may need some more explanation for the non
statistician.
In the summary it states that fewer patients died though the p value was 0.109 which does
not reach conventional statistical significance or am I missing something?
Aside from the lack of cardiovascular outcome benefit for fenofibrate in the randomised
trials, the other reasons that fibrates are regarded as a specialist option are the potential
increase in myalgia/myositis and an increase in serum creatinine.
There does not seem to be any mention of myalgia/myositis. Serum creatinine was reported
as identical (1mg/dL = 88umol/L) in both groups which is surprising, because in my
experience fenofibrate therapy almost always raises creatinine by 10-15%. Is this result on
treatment or pre-treatment?
For a British Journal I would expect SI units to be used.
