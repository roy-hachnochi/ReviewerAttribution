1 Summary
=========

This paper joins a growing literature on the role of the public sector
in drug development. The paper is differentiated from previous writing
on the topic by focusing on more recent drug approvals than did
previous research (NMEs approved 2008 to 2017), bringing in broader
information on the approval pathways (which in turn can be used to
proxy for clinical or technical characteristics), and most importantly
providing indicators of the public sector role from sources other than
the Orange Book patent data used in previous analyses.

2 Specific questions/comments
=============================
1. Page 5, line 50: Some argue that companies investment is key. The
footnote just links to the PhRMA website, not specifics. I'd like
to see a specific quote here.
2. Page 5, lines 38-43: "For some medications, their discovery and
development occur largely within the corporate sector, but this is
uncommon." Do the authors mean "entirely" or "completely" here?
(Also the sentence is a bit awkward as written.)
3. Merck Index: I'd like to hear more about why the Merck index has
patents not listed in the Orange Book. Are these patents likely to
be relevant, e.g. for the pricing debates listed later on? My
instinct is that these are likely peripheral, but I'd like to know
more to assess what we are getting here.
4. Page 9, Patent Assignee Analysis: What do the authors do in cases
where there are multiple assignees? Also on assignees (line 30-32)
"wherever possible we identified start up firms .." The authors
explain how this is done later on in the paper, but I might say a
bit here too or note something like "as explained in more detail
below ..."
5. Page 9, line 3: Is the actual information coming from applications
or grants? If assignee information, it must be grants, right, since
applications are technically unassigned?
6. Drug monographs: I'd like to see some validation for
AdisInsight. What is the methodology here? How do we know if these
histories are reliable?
7. Drug Development Histories: Page 11 - the description of the
methodology here is vague; please say more, ideally so someone
could replicate the approach (or something like it)

3 Analyses
==========
Since the key contribution in this article over previous work is the
inclusion of non-Orange Book sources of patent data and other
indicators of public sector role, I suggest doing the analysis in a
way that emphasizes the value-added. This is all in the appendices,

but a simple graph may make it easier to see. What about a line graph
with public sector share by approval year, separately based on
A. Line 1: Orange Book patents only
B. Line 2: A + Plus Merck Index
C. Line 3: B + Plus development histories
D. Line 4: C + Plus AdisInsight spinoffs
This will also allow for testing of whether there is a qualitative
meaningful change in the share over time.

4 Policy implications
=====================
Page 5, line 31: Authors say publicly funded research played a "major"
role. This seems incorrect based on results presented: it is still is
a minority role. Whether it is large or not depends on one's priors,
of course.
In general, most of the policy implications could have been written
based on prior evidence. I'd suggest tying the discussion more firmly
to the value added from the new data sources, as I've emphasized
throughout this review.
