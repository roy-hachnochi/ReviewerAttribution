The paper is considerably improved on revision, with a much clearer message. I have a few
minor comments.
1. The dataset consisted of people receiving OAT between 01/01/1996 and 30/11/2017.
Given that the paper's main message relates to recent changes in the patterns of opioid use
and mortality due to fentanyl, would it be worthwhile extending the dataset to include more
recent data, if they are available?
2. Mortality risk is calculated in groups of time since starting treatment, with the latest group
>12 weeks. It seems odd that this group is open-ended - is there an upper limit for the time
since starting treatment?
3. Section 3.4 of the Results has a focus on the statistical significance of differences between
rates which is now deprecated by the BMJ. Please rephrase this section in terms of clinically
important differences, and avoid reference to significance where possible.

4. Table 1 refers to "mental health" as OUD-related comorbidity. This should surely be
"mental ill health". Also the acronym OUD has survived the revision, as it has in a couple of
places in the Supplementary material.
5. The SMR scale in Figure 1 is nonlinear but not the expected log scale. The gap between 10
and 20 is much greater than between 90 and 100, but if it were logged the distance from 1
to 10 should match that from 10 to 100, which it clearly does not. It looks like a square root
scale instead. I recommend the use of a log scale, perhaps a log2 scale with numbers in
powers of 2 in the sequence:, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 etc.
6. Similarly in Figure 2 it is entirely unclear whether and how the SMR scale is transformed,
as it only has two numbers. Please improve it in line with Figure 1, and ensure the scale
includes 1.
7. Figure 3 would be better in colour (at least in the PDF).
8, The first line of section A2.1: word missing?
9. Section A2.3.1: the word 'identity" should be "identify".
