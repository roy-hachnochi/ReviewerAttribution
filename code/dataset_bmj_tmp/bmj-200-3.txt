The original article titled “Increased risk of prostate cancer for infertile men: nationwide
population-based register study” presented analysis of a large population-based study on a
topic of high clinical importance. The findings are interesting: it could be a step forward in
resolving the controversy whether male subfertility is associated with an increased risk of
prostate cancer.
The population was large, taken from a national data-base covering long period of time.
Effort was made to keep the methodology correct. However, the following aspects on the
basic principles of this study questions and answers need addressing:
1. The objective of this study was “to investigate whether the risk of prostate cancer in men
who became fathers through IVF or ICSI….differed in terms of incidence, age at onset, and
where applicable, in severity, from men who achieved fatherhood naturally.” However, the
conclusion of the study was more generalised- “Men with fertility issues (whether treated or
not), in particular those needing ICSI for fatherhood (whether successful or not), are at high
risk for early onset prostate cancer”. Therefore, the study question and the answer
(conclusion) were different.
2. The study included only whose who became father either by IVF/ICSI treatment or
naturally. But concluded as “those needing ICSI for fatherhood”. ‘Men needing ICSI for
fatherhood’ and ‘fathers who required ICSI’ are not the same population.
3. Although IVF treatment has also been found to be a significant risk for prostate cancer,
the conclusion of the study highlighted ICSI only- was it an attempt of establishing a

plausible link with male infertility? In fact, there was more cases of early-onset prostate
cancer following IVF (50%), than with ICSI (46.3%).
4. The study findings are based on an analysis of a huge database only, with no credible
scientific explanation for the association between ICSI and prostate cancer or male infertility
and prostate cancer. Since the study could not answer whether IVF/ICSI process itself
regardless of the treatment outcomes, or infertile men with or without IVF/ICSI treatment
were at increased risk of prostate cancer, generalisability or wider applicability of the data
became limited.
5. The design of this study led to a type of ‘selective reporting’ that generates further
questions: do men who fail to father from ICSI treatment or those infertile men who do not
undergo IVF/ICSI also require early screening or monitoring for prostate cancer? Unless
these questions are answered and an absolute risk is stated, this study may cause panic
among those undergoing ICSI treatment.
6. Although the odd-ratio is significant, an estimation of the absolute risk becomes
necessary, not only for counselling patients prior to ICSI treatment, but for taking the
decision whether a revision of the policy of prostate cancer screening programme, as the
authors suggested, is necessary.
Table 1 showed the incidence of prostate cancer as 0.3% after natural conception and 0.4%
following IVF and ICSI, this means 1 extra case of prostate cancer per 1000 treated.
Whether this magnitude of risk is worth changing the screening programme is another
matter for discussion. And if we believe that the cancer risk is inherent to (?male) infertility
itself, regardless of IVF or ICSI treatment, screening may need to be extended to all infertile
men.
7. In ‘What this study adds’ section, it is stated: “Current study suggests that infertility can
be regarded as a forerunner of prostate cancer”. Actually, no such conclusion can be drawn
based on this particular study, as it investigated on only those who had success through
IVF/ICSI process. This section also claims “that infertile men have 30-60% increased risk for
prostate cancer as compared to men conceiving naturally” - this is something the study did
not investigated.
