While this paper addresses a pertinent topic, it is unclear what specific methodology was followed to
elicit the 4 specific focus areas.
In terms of the suggested 'tractable' changes, it seems the authors literally suggest any solution one
could think of that is required to achieve UHC, from government financing, to public financial
management, to innovatively enticing the private sector to invest in innovations, to getting every
single sector involved.
Therefore, I failed to see a logic flow and coherent argument, and the paper failed to adequately
address the challenge of a scarce resource environment: if pressed, what should G20 Ministers focus
on first, and why? How do they decide?
In addition, HSS in LMICs and G20 countries is discussed all at once, further confusing the argument.
Lastly, who is the audience, and how do the authors think that their specific advice will change the
course of action, beyond what is already published in this space?
