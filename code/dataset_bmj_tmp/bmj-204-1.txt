Thanks for giving me the opportunity to review this manuscript. The manuscript is written
by five experts who are well versed in global health policy challenges. However, I struggled
to understand the key points or the story line for this paper. I understand the
context/backdrop for the paper
1. NCDs are a major contributor of mortality for low and middle income countries
2. Historically, development assistance for health (DAH) has focussed on infectious disease
and maternal/child health.
3. SDGs attempt to focus attention on NCD
Within this backdrop, the paper attempts to answer: What does the increased focus on
NCDs mean for DAH. The key conclusions of this analysis were:
1. The definition of NCD is sometimes not clear. for example, should mental health be
included
2. The perception is that NCD risk factors are behavioral and thus outside the health
system.
3. Countries are not meeting their DAH commitments
4. Countries are not investing in health systems strengthening
5. There is a mismatch between aid dollars and unmeet need across countries
I found that the above points were not novel or were no specific enough for NCDs. I would
urge the authors to focus on this second half of the manuscript and make more precise
policy recommendations that focus on the NCD challenge. What are five things an
international aid agency should do if they want to combat NCDs in low-middle income
countries?
