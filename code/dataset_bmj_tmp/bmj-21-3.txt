Sample size: No rationale for the effect size (why 13%?), what is this based on? No citations to where
the estimates for the sample size calculation have come from, neither in the paper nor the protocol.
13% is also twice as large as the effect size reported in the Introduction in the Chinese RCT. Can the
authors provide the missing information. Also can the authors clarify the significance level used in the
calculation? If 0.01 as specified in the paper, then I am unable to reproduce the numbers, if 0.05 (as
specified in the protocol), then I can. I presume the 0.01 in the paper (page 8) is a typo.
Table 1: Would be useful to include the minimization factors in this table.
Table 2, p values should be removed.
Table 4: Can the authors confirm all these outcomes were pre-specified? From a look at the trial registry
and the protocol, it appears not. E.g., the maternal complications, prematurity. For clarity it would be
easier if all the secondary outcomes were reported in the same table (for the ITT analysis).
I couldn’t see the results from the QOL?
I’m not sure I agree with the conclusion, based on the findings of this trial. ’Currently, there is no
indication supporting the wide use of a freeze-all strategy in the broad population of IVF patients.
Present evidence suggests that the freeze-all strategy should be adapted as part of individualised patient
care only in women with PCOS or those at increased risk of OHSS and not in the general IVF population.’
There is also no discussion on costs-effectiveness (a pre-specified outcome). (Note from Dr. Loder: if
you plan to publish a separate CE analysis, it is fine to simply state that this will be reported in a
separate paper.)
