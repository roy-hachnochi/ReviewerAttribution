The authors have responded adequately to my concerns.
My only remaining issue is in the introduction, which sets the tone for the manuscript. I
think that characterizing the risks of ICP monitor insertion as "catastrophic" creates a bias
for the manuscript from the outset. In reality, the risks are low and acceptable in the
clinical context. Furthermore, if ICP is not elevated, then the ICP monitor or ventricular
catheter are removed early. The risk of infection, therefore, should occur primarily in
those patients who require prolonged presence of a ventricular catheter.
Considering how well balance and objective the manuscript itself is, I find this particular
characterization of ICP monitoring quite out of place. The paper does not need this
exaggeration to make its point.
