Thank you for inviting me to review this interesting manuscript.

Originality: There have been a lot of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on this subject
but the authors do point out key ways in which this one is different, including new large
trials such as the VITAL study.
• Importance of work to general readers: The work doesn’t really allude to how clinicians
should change their practice so I am not sure how relevant it is to them. It is more of a
general public health paper with relevance to population health rather than clinical work.
Although clinicians should promote public health messages to patients it is not as much of
their remit as say for public health providers/policy makers. It is tricky as the study didn’t
highlight any particular dose/duration of supplementation that is most effective and could
be communicated to doctors, although this could be due to the fact sub-analysis wasn’t
conducted specifically for cancer mortality (perhaps due to relatively small number of
studies).
• Scientific reliability: I have no concerns about scientific reliability, it seems scientifically
sound, but I would recommend a general check by a statistician.
• Research Question: The authors clearly state that they are updating a meta-analysis on
the association between vitamin D supplementation and mortality. They don’t define here
what they mean by mortality but they do mention this in the methods.
• Overall design of study: It is good that the review follows recommended methods (e.g.
PRISMA).
• Participants studied: There are clear selection criteria showing what types of participants
were excluded and included.
• Methods: The methods are well described and comply with reporting standards
(PRISMA). The authors have made good effort to undertake thorough electronic and hand
searches, as well as giving assessment of study quality, sensitivity analyses and
assessment of publication bias. However, the PROSPERO number seems to be wrong- see
https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=112655 It brings up
a protocol for an aspirin study and I can't find the correct protocol on PROSPERO using the
search function.
• Results: The results are clear and well presented. I am not familiar with TSA so I cannot
comment on the reliability of this. Results appear to be credible, I can’t see any immediate
problems with the forest plots (e.g. studies appear independent)- however the editor might
want to consider getting a statistician’s view to be extra sure. The number of events in
some of the individual studies are very low (probably as most of these studies had
mortality as a secondary outcome so were not statistically powered to assess it) but the
overall n for the pooled estimates are good.
• Interpretation and conclusions: The messages here correctly match the results. However,
the authors could add a sentence to say that they saw a reduction in cancer specific
mortality as this is an important findings.
Specific comments:
Line 19-20 I am not sure is this is really ‘known’- perhaps only with respect to
observational studies. Perhaps the line could read: ‘Low vitamin D status, in observational
studies, is associated with higher mortality…’.
Line 38- Can you say here what RR was calculated (e.g. RR of death in vitamin D
supplemented group vs. control group).
Line 44 The RR for cardiovascular mortality, and for non-cancer non-cardiovascular
mortality could be put here also.
Line 82 The selection criteria part is difficult to read. It is bullet points interspersed with
explanations. I would recommend moving the part ‘The primary outcome….. to study were
accepted’ to the end of the paragraph. It would then flow better. I would also put the part
‘If other interventions were given… in all groups’ into brackets.
Line 97 I would say ‘reference lists’ instead of reference
L129 Were the subgroup analyses decided upon in advance of starting the
searches/analysis (i.e. were they a priori?)- if so then you can state this here. If they were
post-hoc then state this here also.

L168 It would be better to say non statistically significant associations rather than
nonsignificant associations if this is what you mean (i.e. are you talking about statistical
significance here?). Can the meta-regression graphs be given a p value?
L192 You could be more tentative here as you can’t be certain about this, it would be
better to say ‘likely reached’ rather than ‘reached’.
L198 Etable 4 suggests this is 16% rather than 14%? i.e. RR=0.84
L203 It might be better to say ‘Mortality is the most important clinical outcome’.
L205 I would add the caveat here that vitamin D supplementation may not be justified, at
least in terms of preventing all-cause mortality. It is wrong to just say ‘not justified’ as
from your results it is justified for reducing cancer mortality.
L207 I would just say ‘cancer’, not ‘special diseases (cancer)’, as you haven’t evidence for
it being beneficial for anything other than cancer here.
