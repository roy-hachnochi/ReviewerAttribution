Many thanks for your invitation to review the paper. Comments are as followed:
Dr. He and authors do a lot of work to analysis the Efficacy and Safety of First-line
Treatments for Advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC. The preliminary results indicate that: the
first-line use of osimertinib is superior to other treatments due to its combination of the best
PFS and OS with the second-best safety benefits for patients with overall EGFR-mutated
NSCLC. It is a plenty of work, authors use Network-meta-analysis to comprehensively
analyze the usage of TKIs and chemo in first line treatment for EGFRm NSCLC patients.
Figures and tables are particular elaborate. Paper is well written. However, there are some
issued to be clarified.
1. Basing on the current evidence, authors present these results: EGFR-TKIs are the
standard therapy for sensitive EGFRm NSCLC patients. NCCN guidelines recommend the
Osimertinib as the first line preferred treatment. Gefitinib plus pemetrexed-based
chemotherapy showed the best ORR. Figures are very beautiful. However, they are difficult
to read, a more visual figure is needed to present the results.
2. Table 1: Baseline characteristics of trials included in the network meta-analysis. It will be
better to add the PFS and OS information into table 1. In addition, the elements in Group
Gef+PbCT are different. The chemotherapy in NEJ009 study include the carboplatin, JMIT
2016 study only use the pemetrexed, this might result in discrepancy.
3. It will be better to take the racial differences into consideration. A subgroup analysis may
be added into the study.
4. More details of AEs (adverse events) are needed. AEs caused by chemotherapy/TKIs are
different. It might be better to present the most AEs in trails. This could be added into
Tables.
5. Summary, authors do a lot of work, which might have an impact on the treatment choice.
However, it would be better to list details above.
