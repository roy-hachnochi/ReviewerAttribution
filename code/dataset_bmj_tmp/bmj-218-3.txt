I appreciate the effort of the authors of performing a network meta-analysis to identify the
best treatment option for patients with EGFR mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
The methods applied seem technically correct.
However, my real doubt is about the clinical relevance of this kind of analysis. Does this
really add solid information to the indirect comparisons among studies, or is it only a well
performed technical exercise?
In my opinion, this is even a higher risk for the subgroup analysis according to the type of
EGFR mutation. The authors suggest potentially different treatments according to the type of
mutation. Probably the risk of imprecision in the comparison is even higher in these
subgroup analyses.
As a matter of fact, there will be no direct comparison among many of the treatments, and
this could be regarded as a good reason to look with interest at this kind of analysis.
However, I am not convinced that this is a high-level evidence to support clinical decisions.
In other words: if the journal believes this kind of analysis is worth of publication, I have not
found major technical defects in this paper. My concern is upstream.
Minor comment: I would avoid the term "trend" to describe non-statistically significant
differences.
