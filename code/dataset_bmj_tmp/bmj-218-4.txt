Stats Report for BMJ – Efficacy and Safety of First-line Treatments for Advanced
EGFR-mutated NSCLC: a systematic review and network meta-analysis
The manuscript presents results from 19 trials evaluating several interventions used as
first-line treatment for advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC relying on a network meta-analysis
to draw conclusions about comparable efficacy and safety across these interventions. The
findings are novel and potentially relevant but there are several issues that need addressing
to make sure that these are: a) accurate and b) placed in context given the sparsity of data
in this area.
• Major issue is one of data sparseness. The number of comparisons made and estimates
obtained is way beyond the number of comparisons in the original studies. This has
implications regarding the reliance on prior distributions and assumptions of transitivity and
consistency of the network used to obtain these estimates. This needs to be highlighted in
the Discussion section as a critical limitation.
• Critical to know the AEs for each of the drugs, this is part of the same aspect of the
evaluation. Please provide in your manuscript a description of the AE typically observed and
particularly if these differ by type of intervention.
• With regards to the reporting of the model used, more clarity is required about the priors
used. It is unclear how given the low number of studies included, a non-informative prior will
allow the model to converge. If possible, sensitivity analyses using alternative priors would
allow evaluation of the robustness of your findings.
• Related to the above, the reporting of the MCMC methods used is not adequate. In
particular: the differences between three chains, the burn-in, the number of iterations (after
burn in) and the way ‘convergence’ was assessed needs to be reported better and
separately.
• The statement that ‘Transitivity has been ensured’ is not scientific. This is impossible to
ascertain. At best you can say that, ‘to minimise issues arising from potential lack of
transitivity, …’. As part of this, please carry out an evaluation of important study and patient
characteristics was done once data were collected to assess network transitivity and report
this as well (including which characteristics were evaluated).
• The assumption made for the FLAURA study, analysis of the erlotinib and gefitinib arm, is a
strong one which needs evaluating as part of a sensitivity analysis to check what effect this
has on the results. The simplest option would be to remove this trial in a sensitivity analysis
but alternatives could also be explored.
• For the pairwise meta-analysis, the approach of model selection based on heterogeneity
creates a biased estimate. This is definitely NOT recommended. Please review this and
adjust appropriately. The model selection should be based on previous assumptions of
comparability/equivalence of interventions/outcomes and should be done before evaluation

of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses based on alternative models could be an alternative
(and reported as supplementary material).
• Related to the above, as you have used a Fixed-effect approach for your Bayesian NMA
then I would suggest that a FE model for the pairwise comparisons would also be applicable.
If you decide to switch to a RE for the pairwise comparisons, this would also impact on
potentially switching to a RE for the Bayesian NMA model. Regardless of your choice, this
will need to be justified in the manuscript and commented on in the Discussion (Limitations).
• Although you have assessed local inconsistency (pairwise comparisons estimates vs
Bayesian NMA estimates) please also assess and report the global inconsistency of your
network. See: Dias S, Welton NJ, Sutton AJ, et al. NICE DSU Technical Support Document 4:
Inconsistency in Networks of Evidence Based on Randomised Controlled Trials. 2011; for
reference. Regarding this, to deliver a proper comparison between NMA and pairwise
comparisons, the same statistical approach (Bayesian or Frequentist) should be applied.
Credible Intervals are not directly comparable with Confidence Intervals. This should at least
need to be included in the Discussion section.
• The funnel plots provided are of no use given the number of trials included in each
comparison, please delete them and explain why these were not used in your Limitation
section.
