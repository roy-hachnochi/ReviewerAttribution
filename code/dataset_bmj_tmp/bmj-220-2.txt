This paper evaluated the impact of health reform on the rational use of antibiotics in China
and identified the effective elements in curbing antibiotic overuse. It is well analyzed and
written. However, the authors only included three policies compared with the complex,
systematic and comprehensive health reform plan. The included health reform policies
need to be further justified. The detailed comments are as follow:
1) The primary aim fo the national essential medicine system and the zero markup drug
policy is not to reduce antibiotic overuse. They are different from national antimicrobial
stewardship campaign. The authors should justify why you only include the three health
reform policies. For example, why the authors did not involve outpatient IV antibiotic use
ban?
2) How can the authors attribute the reduction of antibiotic use to antimicrobial
stewardship? It could be both antimicrobial stewardship and the national essential
medicine system and the zero markup drug policy.
Line 54-58, please cite the most updated data and the direct sources of the references.
Line 57-58. "current problems of irrational use of antibiotics are mainly in primary care and
rural settings". Is there any reference or evidence to support this?
Line 33-37, in the absence of required medical equipment, general practitioners at primary
care facilities are difficult to make swift and right decision in diagnosis, especially for those
with multiple conditions. Any evidence to support this?
