Dear editor,

The authors are to be commended for their enormous work of compilation and analysis.
However, the enormity of this work is a weakness in that the complexity of the assessment
of each question asked necessarily precludes the need for brevity. For example, when
these data will be reviewed by experts to write guidelines, for each intervention they will
necessarily have to weigh-up their described benefits on PPC against their adverse effects.
And, due to the huge volume of data analyzed, these adverse effects are not subject to
quantitative analysis in the paper. Aware of this, the authors discuss at length in their
discussion the question of the adverse effects of PEEP, but the same problem exists for
other interventions. I am thinking in particular of epidural analgesia, for which the benefits
must be balanced against neurological and hemodynamic risks but also against the risks of
itching, motor block, etc.... But this is also true, to varying degrees, for each of the
therapeutic interventions analyzed.
In fact, two subjects - protective ventilation and epidural analgesia - are so complex and
so extensively studied that they each should be the subject of a separate systematic
review. There are excellent ones in the medical literature and their inconsistency with this
article is disturbing (see below on pages 18 and 19).
Despite this, it is a well written work, rather easy to read and whose statistical
methodology (trial sequential analysis) sheds a raw light on the real level of evidence
provided by the current state of the literature
In more details:
Page 15, Line 32 – 37 : “This mortality effect persists for years, with post-operative
mortality data at 1 year and 5 years showing significant differences: 45.9% mortality with
PPC vs 8.7% without PPC at 1 year; and 71.4% vs 41.1% at 5 years.9” What the quoted
reference describes is that the difference in mortality associated with post-operative
complications persists over the years and that these complications have not simply
hastened an inevitable outcome and that this excess mortality occurs in a period ranging
from 27 to 180 days according to the type of surgery. The authors should clarify this point
so that the average reader would not imagine some kind of "magic effect" of respiratory
complications that would last for years.
Page 18, Line 42: The quoted reference (40 -46) do not refer to randomized trials
Page 18 -19, Line54 – 8: The PROVILHO study comparing high PEEP versus low PEEP is
analyzed along with study comparing low tidal volume and PPEP versus high tidal volume
(fig 6.3 appendix 2). This is a source of statistical heterogeneity and also a source of
confusion for clinicians because the research question asked by the PROVILHO study is not
the same as the one asked by the other studies.
Page 19, Line 28 – 38: The authors found only 7 studies comparing epidural analgesia and
morphine use (2222 patients), yet Pöpping's meta-analysis found 58 studies on the
incidence of pneumonia, 59 on respiratory failure and 14 on atelectasis [1].
