My opinion for BMJ
1. ESRD actually need active case findings. Because the symptoms and signs of chronic kidney
disease can be under-recognition, the patients might seek medical attention when they
reached stage 4 or 5.
Although the screening and diagnostic procedures of chronic kidney disase can be done easily
by blood pressure measurement, urinalysis and measured serum creatinine, but the dialysis
treatment is sophisticated, especially hemodialysis.
2. Hemodialysis machine and analyzer are manufactured by few pharmaceutical companies for
a long period of time. This bring the situation of limited players in this field. New R&D is very
limited, this bring the situation worse. These companies can manipulated the market, cost of
any new technologies introducing by them keep going up. The community of healthcare
professionals-related to hemodialysis also be inevitable manipulated by these companies,
leading to only perception that hemodialysis always the best therapy. And this also lead to
business model for hemodialysis center running by these companies or local providers, making
financial benefits for HCP-related hemodialysis.
3. Hemodialysis need good water treatment for preparation of dialysis fluid. This
pre-treatment system to make the wide-range of quality of raw water suitable for next step,
Reverse osmosis machine, finally to make dialysis fluid, is costly. And a large amount of raw
water must be sufficient to run a big hemodialysis center. In some geographic area might
encounter the problems of sufficient and good water supply.
4. All of these mentioned above, lead the patients and the government/ healthcare authority
perceived that hemodialysis is expensive. And because not like in cancer therapy, this therapy
make ESRD patients survive longer, especially in young and no comorbidities. So no one would
like to pay for this. The patents and their families will go to the supportive care. Compare with
cancer therapy, patient-advocacy group for moving the policy set up late compare to cancer
patients, so the movement from patients’side come late. This occurred because the
patients’mindset perceive that it is too expensive and cannot prolonged life with good quality.
5. I agrre to give more attention to new pharmaceutical company or any other researchers to
develop affordable machines and other accessories. And also give more attention to peritoneal
dialysis.
