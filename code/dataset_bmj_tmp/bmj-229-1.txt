Li and colleagues extended follow-up period of the Shandong Intervention Trial to 22.3 years
and found that H. pylori treatment and vitamin and garlic supplementation each significantly
reduced gastric cancer mortality. This report provides important information for readers.
1) In methods, endoscopies conducted during the extended period II for specific patients
with dysplasia only (page 8). How to perform scheduled endoscopy? Frequent endoscopy
may be related to detection of earlier stage of gastric cancer.
2) As the authors stated in limitation, medications, especially for H. pylori treatment, and
changes in lifestyle during extended period II affected the present results.
3) In this study, 32 cases with gastric cancer were H. pylori-seronegative, and among them,
18 cases died due to gastric cancer. Were these cases non-cardiac or cardiac cancer which is
not related to H. pylori infection? Generally, cases with presence of severe gastric atrophy
and H. pylori seronegative, which reveal past history of H. pylori infection are highest risk of
gastric cancer. It is very interesting whether vitamin or garlic supplementation reduce
gastric cancer mortality in such cases.
