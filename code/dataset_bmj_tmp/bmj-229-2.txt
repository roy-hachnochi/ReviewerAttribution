The authors have now completed an analysis of the trial which was conducted to determine
the effects of Helicobacter pylori treatment, vitamin, and garlic supplementation, on gastric
cancer incidence and mortality. In this high incidence population, this trial is important in
demonstrating evidence of the protective effects of H pylori eradication and a nutrition
intervention. In contrast to the previous results of this study (at 15 years out), this paper
also demonstrates the importance of long follow-up of participants! This analysis is timely, in
the wake of the extended follow-up analysis of the NIT study. The paper is well written, the
analysis sound, and my comments are minor.
- I am not familiar with this region, but I wonder if rates of both gastric cardia, and
non-cardia cancers are very high? I appreciate the constraints of a sub-group analysis in
this, relatively small, study, but it would be interesting to see the trends separately for
cardia and non-cardia.
- Considering the factorial design, did you also mutually adjust for each intervention? I
realize you undertook a 2-way interaction but this gets to a different point and where the
effects are sometimes marginal, I would be curious.
Minor edits:
Please include gastric cancer rates for this region in your Introduction
Please include in the Introduction reference to the fact that this population were, at the time,
mal-/under-nourished to emphasize the point to those unfamiliar with the region
Please add a note to the Discussion - while SIT “cannot distinguish ESCC from EAC” I think it
would be relatively safe to assume there is essentially no EAC in this region??
Table 1: please cite the original papers
Figures 2 and 3 would benefit from clear titles above each row
