Dear Author and Editor.
Thank you for the possibility to review this manuscript.
I will respond to the questions asked by the BMJ in my role as a patient representative and
a professional working with patient involvement in research. I do not comment on
statistical analysis but rely on the validity.
The results of the study is highly relevant and important for people with type 1 diabetes
and carers as it confirms what is already known and recommended. The study serves well
as a confirmatory study on the aim of evaluate if lower HbA1c reduce the risk of
retinopathy and nephropathy. But it does not add any new information for patients or
carers. General recommendations may differ but treatments are individualized and always
weigh in the balance of hypoglycemia and risk of developing complications.
The team also focuses on different recommendations in different countries but it does not
discuss if there are any other factors influencing recommendations beyond risk of ret. and
nephron which may very well be the case. Therefore it is unclear if the results of this study
are enough to change general recommendations that differ from these findings.
I recommend that ‘hypoglycemia’ is described both in numbers (blood glucose level) and
what it does to the body as patients may encounter hypoglycemia at different blood
glucose levels.
Also quality of life (QoL) should be defined by clear measures and the association between
level of HbA1c and QoL. Data is missing to support the recommendation clearly (page 3,
line 28-30).
I recommend for register studies that aims at informing patients that the target group are
involved in describing current standard procedures (how recommendations are used and
individualized today) and what measures are relevant and important to patients. In this
case it may have been to direct descriptions and prioritize relevant QoL measures in order
to draw the full picture for patients.
I also recommend study teams to consult patients in the interpretation of conclusions and
recommendations so that recommendations become useful and manageable to doctors and
patients.
To enhance consistency and avoid confusion between terms please use the same term for
the same stage of disease complication throughout the full article. The manuscript uses
three different terms for - what I think is - the same stage of retinopathy: any retinopathy
/ simplex retinopathy/ mild retinopathy.
I look forward to reading your final publication.
Kind regards.
• Are the questions the paper addresses relevant and important to patients and/or carers?
Yes, the questions of HbA1c as a risk factor for complications is of high interest and
importance.
