The questions posed are relevant to patients and their carers as I suspect few are aware of
the increased risk of life-threatening infections. As someone who suffered a prolonged period
of stress, I found the results interesting, although I did not personally experience any severe
psychiatric reaction.
There is no indication of the effects of lifestyle, smoking, drug or alcohol use. These might
play a greater role in the lives of stress sufferers than in the general population. It is
impossible to estimate how much these factors contribute to the raised risk level so I am
unsure how relevant the increased risk figures are without lifestyle data.
I would also have liked to see an indication of risk levels for those who have suffered milder
stress-related disorders.
There is no advice to those at risk, such as steps they could take to reduce their risk or signs
to look out for, or suggestion of further work to produce some. I accept that this study
aimed only to verify the link between stress-related disorders and serious infections, but
when the results reach the wider public those questions are bound to be asked.
The authors could have benefited from some patient involvement in the design of the study,
to help them understand what patients would like to see come out of the study, or indicate
what sort of advice they would like to receive from their doctors if they were at increased
risk.
