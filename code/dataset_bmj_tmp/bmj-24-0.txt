Li et al. described patients with laboratory-confirmed infection 2019-nCoV in Zhejiang
province. None of these patients have exposure to Huanan Seafood Market but all
have exposure to infected patients. Furthermore, these patients either have
long-term residence in Wuhan or short-term trip to Wuhan. This paper provided more
information about the clinical features of 2019-nCoV infected patients. However,
several important limitations should be addressed for this paper. 1)Human
transmission was inferred from the study by lack of exposure to the Huanan Seafood
Market from all patients, but lack of exposure history to the Market is not sufficient
for proving person-to-person transmission, especially under the condition that all the
patients have been to Wuhan and that the source for 2019-nCoV was still not clear.
2) The authors did not provide clear definition of second-generation and how all these
patients enrolled in the study were identified as second-generation. 3) The definition

of incubation period was not clearly provided. The authors mentioned in Result
section patients who had short term trip to Wuhan were included to calculate the
incubation period, but the numbers provided in the table were for all patients enrolled
in the study.4) Tables were not informative as no important comparison was made
(also no p values). Other points are addressed as follows:
Major
1. Abstract, Line 64: How was the time point for infection exposure identified for
patients who either have long-term residence in Wuhan or short-term trip to Wuhan?
This should be clarified.
2. Methods: The word “course” was ambiguous. Does this mean length of
hospitalization or the time since illness onset? Please clarify.
3. Methods: The authors included 62 cases in this study, but mentioned “a large
number of patients showed up” so they just collected “most but not all” patients. Is
there a justification for choosing these 62 cases? Are they the earliest cases? Or
please indicate a time period for collecting cases.
4. Methods-Statistical analysis: In the research conducted by Huang et al, the
median time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission was 10·5 days. This number
was calculated among those with ICU admission. However, among 62 patients
enrolled in this study, only one patient was admitted to ICU. Nearly all of the patients
are still in hospitalization when the authors submitted the paper. This means patients
will gradually move from duration time <10d to duration time >10d. The duration of
hospitalization cannot reflect the disease severity and is not a good classification
variable at this specific time point.
5. Methods-Statistical analysis: It is not reasonable to make comparisons between all
the patients enrolled in the study and patients with course longer than 10 days, as
the latter ones were part of patients included in the study. The authors should make
comparisons between those with and without course longer than 10 days.
6. Methods-Statistical analysis: The authors only gave brief description of different
characteristics. Statistical analysis should be performed with statistics calculated and
p values listed in each table.
7. Results-Lines 155-156: Why only patients who had short term trip to Wuhan were
included to calculate the incubation period? How was the time point for infection
exposure identified? In lines 171-172, the incubation period was calculated for all
the 62 patients. These were inconsistent through the article.
8. Discussion: “According to our data, none of the infection cases in Zhejiang had
ever been exposed to the Huanan seafood marker, all the patients were infected by
human transmission.” This sentence should be revised. Without exposure to Huanan
Seafood Market is not the sufficient conditions of human to human transmission as
the source of infection is still not clear.
9. Discussion: Chen et al. published their data on 99 cases of 2019-nCoV patients on
Jan 30, 2020 in the Lancet. Clinical characteristics from these patients should also be
discussed, apart from the 41 patients in Huang et al.’s cohort.
10. Conclusion: Line 254 “The 2019-nCoV could be easily transmitted from human to
human.” This sentence should be revised. A study focusing on clinical features of
admitted patients shall not reveal the transmission status. Please refer to the
epidemiological study published by Li et al on January 30th in New England Journal
Medicine.

11. Table 1-3: No comparison was made with only the descriptive values listed.
These tables are not informative.
12. Table 4: Information listed in the table can be found in Table 1-3. Descriptive
comparison between results from this study and that from Dr. Cao should be
addressed only in discussion section but not in a separate table.
13. Moderate linguistic (English) corrections are desirable. Present version has some
punctuation, grammatical and typological sentence framing issues which should be
taken care of by the authors.
Minor
1. Line 50: Grammar mistake: “covered”, “are located in”, “parts”.
2. Line 52: please be specific about the date.
3. Line 63: “Few” patients, not “rare”. Do you mean shortness of breath at illness
onset, or during hospital treatment? Same for line 176 and 182.
4. Line 67: “secondary infection” should be replaced with “second-generation”?
5. Line 79: “most” is better than “nearly all”, because only 66% had been exposed to
the market in this cohort.
6. Line 86: This number has already surpassed the sum for SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV, please update. Same for line 202.
7. Line 88-89: “the clinical investigation of patients was still limited in the literature”.
Please clarify what is “limited in the literature”. Do you mean “number of published
studies is limited”?
8. Line 97-98: Should be reference #9. Please specify what are defined as imported
case?
9. Line 100: What are “these people”? Please specify.
10. Line 109: What is the definition for suspected case? Does travel or contact history
count as a mandatory criterion for suspected case? Should be “especially” (line 110).
11. Line 125: For laboratory confirmation, what samples did you use for RT-PCR?
Nasopharyngeal swabs or BALF?
12. Line 128: Please specify what is “and so on”? Any tests for other common
respiratory pathogens?
13. Line 128: Most patients, without the “of”.
14. Line 129: What is “Lopina veletonavir”? I assume it is “Lopinavir/Ritonavir”.
15. Line 132: Please provide dosage for corticosteroid therapy and IVIG.
16. Line 134: What is the unit of CRP?
17. Line 136: Please clarify the definition of “2019-nCoV clearance”.
18. Line 156, Line 166: Please avoid the word “select”.
19. Line 164: Is 1.6% the percentage for COPD or diabetes? Same for line 168.
20. Line 165, Line 169: What is the meaning of “associated with” familial clusters?
Did the authors mean relatives of the 21 patients were also reported to be infected
by 2019-nCoV? Were the relatives included in this cohort?
21. Line 177: “… course over 10 days. We found” should be revised to ““… course
over 10 days, we found”.
22. Line 185: “The D-dimer level was higher (median D-dimer level 0.2 mg/L [IQR
0.2-0.5]).” Higher than what? No comparison was made.
23. Line 193: “patient transferred” should be revised to “patient was transferred”.
24. Line 194: By antiviral, is it lopinavir or oseltamivir?
25. Line 197: “One patient has”. Singular form.
26. Line 206: Suggest adding “early” before “2019-nCoV cases in Wuhan”. Chen et
al. has reported clinical features for another 99 cases in Wuhan (the Lancet) who had
similar features.
27. Line 211-212: Please clarify “air prevention”. Do you mean “airborne
transmission precaution”?
28. Line 217 “developed to”→”developed”

29. Line 218 “admitted”→”were admitted”
30. Line 219: “Fewer” patients.
31. Line 230: Please clarify “not much”. Addressing the difference in antiviral
therapy, patients in Huang et al. paper did not use lopinavir and many were given
empirical oseltamivir.
32. Line 236 “Given that most infections in Zhejiang were secondary-generation
infections, ……” This sentence contradicted with the Line 207-209, where you stated
all patients were infected by human transmission. Please clarify.
