The authors have responded to reviewers comments adequately and I would be happy to
support publication of the manuscript. Having said that, there are three minor points that
the authors might want to consider as I think will aid with some of the clarity in the
results.
1) Figure(s) 2 - please provide within each subfigure a label to identify which exposure
marker is being used for the comparison. This is done in the Figure Legends but given the
number of subfigures, it would be much easier for a reader to keep track on each individual
plot.
2) Figure(s) 3 - The points representing each one of the studies are misleading as, I
believe, these are not what are being used to generate the splines. In a simple view, there
is a perception that all dots are 'in the middle" suggesting generally that there is no
association. The issue with this is that these dots are averages and do not take into
consideration the differences within each study (which is the real strength in this paper).
Please could you either delete these dots or think of alternative ways to represent this
information which would not confuse readers?
3) The use of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale might attract criticism as ROBINS-I is now seen
as a better (certainly newer) option. Please could you consider mentioning this in your
Limitations section? The ROBINS-I page in Cochrane even suggests that the N-O score is
an alternative so this might be used as reference.
