The authors have made extensive revisions and created a more readable paper which
addresses the majority of the reviewer comments. However, I do have some concerns
about the revised paper and these are detailed below (points 3 and 6 in particular are
major concerns re interpretation of the results):
1.
The response to reviewer 4’s query re publication bias and more formal
evaluation/investigation of this is a little weak. The funnel plots should be augmented with
a formal test as appropriate.

2.
The authors state that measures using different scales were converted to a single
scale. If this was done, then further details must be given to support this process.
3.
The authors state that they used change from baseline when available and
otherwise end data. How is this possible? Or likely to lead to any useful overall summary?
The figures suggest that a variety of different summaries are combined without
consideration of how the output can be validly interpreted (eg. Figure 3: median changes
from baseline, geometric means and medians combined with means). The cited reference
(48) does not appear to lend any support to this approach.
4.
etc.)

I did not understand the relevance of the numbering within figures 1-5 (30.1.1

5.
The values in table 2 for diagnosis of diabetes (RR 1.60 (0.22, 11.77)) do not
match those in figure 2 (1.52 (0.19, 12.05)).

6.
Despite the authors being clear that subgrouping results need to be interpreted
with caution, that there were no significant differences between subgroups and that the
result for >2.4 g/d LCn3 was based on few trials, they give this as a recommendation in
the conclusions, policy implications, what this study adds and the abstract. This ‘finding’
needs to be toned down and/or full results given in the main body of the paper (effect size
with ci, results of comparisons with other doses, formal dose analysis). The current
presentation also seems at odds to their response to reviewer 3 re adjustment for multiple
comparisons (ie. this part of the presentation does appear to be based on statistical
significance with no reference to actual effect size, hence adjustment would be necessary).
Furthermore, the cut-point of 2.4 in the analyses does not appear justified and additional
tables 2-6 show that the actual categorisations were 2.4-4.4 and above 4.4. The only
significant difference attributable to raised LCn3 in these tables appears to be for >4.4,
associated confidence intervals are generally wide and not at odds with the point estimates
in the lower categories.
