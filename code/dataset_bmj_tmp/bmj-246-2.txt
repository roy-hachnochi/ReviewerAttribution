Introduction
• Overall, the introduction is well-written and effectively situates and motivates the study.
• However, the authors should provide more details regarding their primary outcome of
executive functioning and better establish the justification and background on nutrition
and specifically executive functioning. The current introduction is focusing particularly on
links with brain structure and processes, with not enough attention on the links with
children’s cognitive development skills/executive functioning.
Methods
• Please provide more details about the context of Guinea-Bissau (social/economic
climate, policy, prior interventions), as relevant to understanding the context of
implementation for this intervention
• It’s not entirely clear how “the supplements were prepared and served as a supervised
breakfast five days/week by trained teams of villagers” (pg. 10, line 42) – please clarify
and confirm that there was no social/behavior change/educational component employed
• Please briefly mention details about training/supervision of the personnel involved in
delivering the intervention
• Please provide more details in the manuscript itself about the validity and reliability of
the Spin the Pots task.
• Please specify the plausible range of scores for children’s executive functioning (# of
stickers found)

• Please clarify how this score was age standardized? Does “child age group” (pg. 12, line
26) refer to the broad younger versus older age groups? Standardized to the baseline
value across all intervention(s) and control group?
• For the NIRS-DCS, how was this subsample selected? How similar/different is this group
compared to those not selected for NIRS-DCS assessment?
• Is there a better/clearer way to state “per age group arm” (pg. 13, line 17)
• Are the regression models accounting for the clustered nature of the data/study design?
Results
• This is not specific to just the Results section, but there is a lot of interchanging between
terms for the primary child outcome (i.e., cognition and executive function). As mentioned
above, please define the construct from the outset of the manuscript, and use consistently
throughout.
Discussion
• Please update the statistic of number of children under-5 at risk of poor ECD (250
million; Lu, Black & Richter, 2016 – Lancet Global Health)
• Pg. 20, line 3 – “The effect size was similar to previous report…” Please state the effect
size of the NEWSUP intervention.
• Please expand on possible explanations for differences found between child age cohorts
(younger <4 vs older aged children)
• How do these data compare with similar interventions or interventions intended to
target similar outcomes, and how can these data inform future intervention work?
• Consider any implications of the findings in the context of Guinea-Bissau; and for
implementing at a larger scale (e.g., delivery agents, training, and monitoring) and
sustainability.
