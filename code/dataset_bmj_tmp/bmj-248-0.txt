This is a network meta-analysis of different anti-thrombotic therapies in CABG patients.
I have several concerns:
1. The authors pool RCTs performed in the last three decades. Surgical technique and
secondary prevention strategies, as well as the preoperative profile of the patients has
substantially changed in the last 30 years. As an example, the use of statins has changed
the natural history of GSV grafts. There is a threshold of methodological and clinical
heterogeneity above which the meta-analytic approach should not be used. This seems
one of those cases.
2. The different studies have very different imaging follow-up protocols and completeness
of follow-up. This is an extremely important (and probably fatal) source of heterogeneity.
3. I question the use of OR for time to event outcomes, in particular when the different
studies have different follow-up times. The use of IRR seems more appropriate.
4. When looking at the NMA network it is evident that multiple comparisons are based on
very few trials (and even only 1 study in more than one case). The solidity of these
comparisons is questionable and, again, this is a scenario where a NMA should not be
performed.
