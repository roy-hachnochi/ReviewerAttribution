Overall:
Solo at al have conducted an interesting network meta-analysis on the effects of
antithrombotic agents for prevention of SVGF in patients undergoing CABG. This is
generally a well written paper, with an interesting focus. The BMJ is also for the generalist
and sometimes the authors use advanced network MA terms, without explaination. I have
commented on it, were I think it would help the general reader.
I do not have an advanced level expertise in the statistical side of nMA, so I would advise
to involve a statistician with deep knowledge in the area.
Here are my comments, which I hope the authors can address:
Major comment
P8-L17
Could the authors comment on the pros and cons with regards to the frequentist nMA
approach they have chosen vs the bayesian nMA and in the discussion comment on the
possible impact on the result.
P10-L5-6
The authors report impressive effect sizes in OR, alongside OR an absolute effect size
should be reported to provide the reader background information.
P12-L38
It would be appreciated if the authors could describe intransitivity for the reader or at
least a reference.
P12-L10
The authors describe that evidence certainty was downgraded to low or very-low for
most.....
Could the authors describe this in more detail, as I see it over 2/3 of the trials for the
primary outcome are downgraded to very-low, please comment more on the implications
in the discussion.
P13-L56
There seems to be a minor problem with this sentences “There weakness of our study”
Furthermore, could this “weakness” be explained in greater detail. The authors could
spend more time on weakness and limitations.
P14-L21
Could reference 48 be described in further detail, and put in context with the current
study finding. The same goes for ref 49, and 50 preferably with effect sizes.
P14-L29
This is an area with very few data, are there any observational studies addressing this
question ?, then please comment on them or describe that there were not any to find.
P16-L3
“design-by-treatment interaction model” explain this further or at least a reference.
P16-L14
“time ....... potentially affect treatment estimates” please explain this in further detail
how, and why this impact would the estimates
P16-L21

“Legacy effect” please explain this term.
P17-L3
The conclusion is reads more as a perspective section than a conclusion on the studies
result.
Please describe the actual results in more detail (this can be added, nothing in the
conclusions needs to be deleted)
P29-L5
Table 1
I think it is confusing that ROB and n is in the same column, please split.
Please ad a column with the effect size of the respective trials.
P56-L19
Figure 2
Please explain the result with the placebo group, and the implications.
P58
Figure 3
A lot of the comparisons are based on only 1 or 2 trials. Could the authors please explain
the possible pit falls of this in the discussion.
Minor comments
P5-L19
There is no reference on the statement regarding SVGs as the most commonly used grafts
P15-L5
“double odds” please describe with numerical value.

I think this is an important paper, but the authors needs to address the above concerns.
