This is an interesting paper and authors examined the impact of the introduction of MUP
on household alcohol purchases in Scotland in May, 2018. The study has addressed an
important research question what the immediate effects of MUP on alcohol prices, amount
of purchasing and alcohol expenditure in Scotland. I have some comments which may
help to improve this paper.
1. Introduction section -- authors could briefly talk about mean prices of on- and off-trade
beverages in Scotland using previous published data, and indicating that the introduction
of 50 pence MUP may have little impact on on-trade alcohol sales. I can see this point has
been mentioned in the study limitations, I recommend to move it to the introduction
section.
2. Method section -- it’d be good to provide some detailed descriptive statistics on both
Scotland and England household panels, which may help to prove that the two household
panels share the same household characteristics, (age of the shopper, number of adults in
household, education level, socioeconomic status) and England data can be used as an
idea control group in this analysis.
3. Which year of data did you use to split purchasing quintiles and income quintiles? I
assume you used data before 2018? As the time change and the policy came into effect, it
will affect household alcohol purchasing and income over time.
4. Please specify whether there was any other major policy intervention, events or
practice may affect alcohol consumption or purchasing in British that may confound the
MUP. Even, I can see that using control group could help to offset other events.
5. Results – It would be good to have a table that summarize the mean alcohol price,
volume purchased and expenditure value among different beverages, household income
and purchasing quintiles before and after the intervention.
6. I found it’s hard to interpret the results in Tables 1 and 2. The CITS models normally
give two results, one is immediate effect and the effect of trend change. It looks like they
had some converging trend after the MUP introduction. Authors need to provide more
results in Tables 1 and 2 and enclose the full model outputs in the supporting document.
7. Page 7, line 47. Authors claimed that 9.5 grams reduction in alcohol purchasing per
individual per household per week in text. However, it shows the effect by per adults per
household in figures. Page 9, line 9, I couldn’t find the results of “non-significant increased
weekly expenditure of 61 pence ..” in Figure 7.
8. Very wide 95% CIs were found in the figures and results, which mean a large price and
purchasing variations in households. Authors need to do the validation test to check the
validity of the CITS models. I saw that authors said there was no autocorrelations were
found. I understand that the MUP had immediate impact on alcohol prices. But I also
wonder was there any lag effect on alcohol purchasing given the price change?
9. I also wonder how the purchasing prevalence changed before and after the
intervention. Authors might be worth to exclude those who had no alcohol purchasing in
the last 6 months to see the effects on drinkers only.
10. Please provide full-term for NHS in the introduction.
