The authors argue that the World Bank’s Human Capital Index (HCI), launched in 2018, is not helpful for
guiding healthcare policy. Discussion around what indicators we should use for decision making in
healthcare policy is important. The indicators we use will drive investment and thus they can be very
influential. The authors argue that HCI is not suitable because of its potential implication for equity, who
is responsible for financing g healthcare, and mechanisms that lead to further patient debt. The piece is
written well and is engaging.
The manuscript is missing the standfirst. If the first paragraph (prior to section 1) is intended to be the
standfirst, it reads more as an abstract. It should be shorter and to the point.
The aim of the first section of the papers is to define human capital and describe the historical
background of the concept. The definition is a bit buried in the text; it is in the last sentence of the
section, in a paragraph that is otherwise about the term being a political concept. Defining the term
earlier will help a non-economist reader, which the BMJ will have.
I believe the title of the paper is based on HCI going back to ideas described in this section (in addition
to the movie reference), and ignoring recently developed tools that consider e.g., equity. The
implications of this should be tied together in the paper’s conclusion if this is a central theme. Otherwise,
it is not clear why the historical background is important for the argument.
Page 2, line 31 “the HCI tries to do something quite remarkable”. Is it the authors’ belief that they
achieve this to some extent? The tone seems to imply that their answer is no, it does not, but the

question is not explicitly addressed. Answering the question does not seem very important to the
authors’ argument, which implies even if it does achieve its intention, HCI is not very useful for policy.
Framing the argument in this way can be done more explicitly.
Page 4, line 59. The authors mention the Bank’s definition of human capital excludes those who may
move abroad as part of their argument concerning equity. I am not sure this aspect is related to equity.
Though, this issue does deserve further discussion. The HCI is expressed by country and can easily be
converted to GDP shortcomings (page 3, line 39). Presumably, if we invest according to HCI, we may
have some leakage (from population movement) that is not captured by HCI, and that leakage is likely
dependent to some extent on the countries’ HCI value. That could be a problem for the HCI achieving
what it aims to achieve-if its aim is to increase specific countries’ productivity. The implications of
overcoming this methodological issue may have problematic moral implications for how one would use
the HCI.
A number of examples would be stronger if the authors provide additional explanation instead of
requiring the reader to delve more deeply into the works they cite. For example, page 3, line 33, what
does the author mean by “make sense of ongoing changes in the global…”; make sense is quite vague
here; make sense in what way?
Page 5, line 49. It is not clear what “this” refers to. Further, it is not clear that indebting patients is your
third issue until reading the conclusion. The two prior paragraphs number the issues. This one does not
and I interpreted potentially indebting patients as a consequence of issue 2.
It is worth noting that if indeed investing according to HCI potentially affects financial risk protection
negatively, then it would not follow the principals of Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable
Development Goals. Is this the authors’ view?
What is the concluding recommendation then? Should the HCI exist but only to promote more spending
on health (a strength) and not be used for decisions within health budgets (due to its weaknesses)?
Page 4, line 29. The authors write only the acronym for the Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation.
Also, it is not clear why IHME is specifically mentioned as opposed to other estimates?
The images/tables are not referred to in the text.
Endnontes or footnotes seem to be mixed in with the bibliography; for example, item 18 in the
bibliography.
Some of the citations seem incomplete (e.g., 28 and 29) or have additional text (e.g., 16, 17, and 33) in
the bibliography.
