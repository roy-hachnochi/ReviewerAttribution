This is an interesting paper providing a conceptual tool, the SEED, for helping the decision
makers to adapt global indications on "Best Buys" and "Wasted Buys" in NCD prevention
to local conditions. It includes that authors call "second order" considerations that could
change dramatically the socially appropriate decisions on preventive programs. The article
reflects a deep knowledge of HTA and its practical difficulties. It recommends to include
mental health in the list of NCDs to be considered (excluded in the WHO original list),
given its relevance and burden of disease. OK.
Minor suggestions:
Page 3 line 41. The international criteria should be taken into account not only at national
level, also at regional level.
Page 4 lines 8-10. I would delete the reference to the specific case of India; in my opinion
it does not add value to the argument but it could distract the reader from the main story
line. If you decide to keep it in the text, you better move the last sentence in the
paragraph ("Despite the evidence... policy") to line 7, after "WHO' s list".
Appendix A decision chart could be omitted as its information is also in Appendix B.
