Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript, which I read with great interest.
This a large population-based study on the impact of gestational diabetes on CVD risk using data from
Danish national health registries. The authors did not involve patients in the design of the study, which
is to be expected as this is an observational study; however, I think it would be valuable to disseminate
the results to relevant patient groups.
