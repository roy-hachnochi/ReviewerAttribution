Fancourt D and Steptoe A: The art of life and death: 14-year follow-up analyses of the
association between arts engagement and mortality in the English Longitudinal Study of
Ageing
In this study the authors evaluated self-reported engagement in art (theater, museums,
concerts, etc) in midlife and mortality risk ~ 14 years later of total of N=6710 participants
from the English Longitudinal Study on Aging (ELSA). The authors report that even
infrequent art engagement (once or twice a year) significantly reduced mortality by 15%
when compared to never engagers, not to mention 35% mortality reduction among
frequent art engagers.
With increasing number of aging population, there is an increased interest in identifying
possibly modifiable risk factors of morbidity and mortality.
This study follows in the footsteps of previous publications by the authors using ELSA data
in evaluating cultural engagement and risk for depression, dementia, cognitive function.
The paper is very well and clearly written, and statistical methods are sound. I especially
appreciated the very detailed statistical analysis taking into account socioeconomic status
(income, employment, marital status, education, wealth), social variables (living alone,
friends, alcohol), physical activity and cognitive function, and not to mention medical
diseases, since they are all associated with cultural engagement and mortality. Other
strengths include large sample size, detailed information available from all participants.
The main question is, what are we actually measuring with cultural engagement, physical
fitness? Cognitive fitness? Presence or absence of depression? Authors already have shown
that cultural engagement decreases depression and cognitive decline/dementia which all
increased mortality risk. So, is there a mediating effect? The study is long (at least 14-year
follow-up), which would allow authors to look at mediating effect of incidence
cardiovascular disease, incidence of cancer, incidence of depression, incidence of dementia
in late life mortality risk (these are just some examples).
Another weakness is the fact that there is only information available regarding baseline
cultural engagement, thus we cannot account for change in behavior on the risk of
mortality.
Specific comments:
Introduction: 2nd sentence: "â€¦they combine multiple psychological, social and behavioural
factors" - would suggest also adding physical activity factor.
Results: Table 1: Would suggest revising it or add table 2 and look at same demographics
but stratify by cultural engagement activity.

Discussion: page 16 would be careful to state at it could be protective, since no causality,
baseline data only, and 60% unexplained.
