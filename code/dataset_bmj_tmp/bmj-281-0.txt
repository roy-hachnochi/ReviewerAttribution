I want to thank the authors for providing detailed responses to my comments and for
changing their paper. I have a few more suggestions for your consideration.
1. I still think that the term "independent" is misleading, as discussed before. I strongly
suggest to at least remove it from the title of the paper.
2. In your conclusion, I suggest that you state that NAFLD is not associated with your
outcomes in your study (not that it appears).

3. I believe that you did not use multivariate models (i.e., models with multiple outcome
levels or repeated measures) but a multivariable model. Also, on page 12, it should read
multivariable-adjusted (not multivariate).
4. It should read Cox proportional hazards (i.e., plural) models.
5. Please make sure that the people you list in the acknowledgment know that you list
them (I just had an issue about that).
6. Can you please confirm that no ethical vote was needed for this study? I instead believe
that the collection of data took place within another IRB approval. If yes, these should be
noted.
7. Data should be plural (Figure legends.... ). Please also check footnotes of the Tables.
8. When you refer to prevalence, you should give a time frame (i.e., life-time, one-year)
