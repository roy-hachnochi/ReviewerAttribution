This study is a multi-national study of the association between ambient ground-level ozone
pollution and mortality. While there have been many smaller-scale studies of this
association in different countries, this study will have high impact in its field as the use of
the same methods to estimate these associations across so many cities and countries

allows a clearer picture of similarities and differences in these associations. Further, the
large sample size provided by this study allows for the investigation of a number of
patterns like non-linearity that it would be difficult to study with a smaller study
population. The statistical methods applied are all appropriate, and the main developers of
these statistical methods are co-authors on this paper, adding confidence that they are
appropriately applied. The supplemental material is well-used to provide important
additional information and results to help in assessing the main manuscript.
Major comments:
- The supplemental text notes that in some cities ozone was only available during the
warm season. However, it is unclear if these cities were excluded from the analysis or if
they were included, but using only warm-season data. Please clarify this point somewhere.
The supplement notes that cities were excluded if they had “a high percentage of missing
values”, but it’s unclear if this also applied in cases where data was missing by design (not
collected during certain seasons) rather than spuriously.
- It would be helpful to provide the city-specific estimates from the first level of modeling
in a large table in the supplement. This would be a useful resource for, for example,
researchers doing health impacts assessments of specific cities.
- The lagged analysis shown in eFigure 1 shows some evidence that the initial positive
association between ozone and mortality is offset to some degree by a later negative
association. It may be worthwhile to also calculate and present excess mortality impacts
based on this longer-term period, in addition to those currently presented, which seem to
be based on the immediate two-day associations.
- Given that many studies have presented ozone-mortality associations per 10 ppb
increase, rather than 10 ug/m3, it may be useful to include in the supplement the main
country-specific estimates for a 10 ppb increase. Further, on page 10, lines 22–25, please
clarify that all the stated associations from earlier studies were converted to the
association per 10 ug/m3, not per 10 ppb, increase in ozone if needed to allow for
comparison with the estimates from this study.
Minor comments:
- For multi-page tables in the supplement (eTable 1, for example), it would be helpful to
include the column headers on each page of the multi-page table.
- eTable 1 has some asterisks for column names that don’t seem to link to a footnote
anywhere.
- The first footnote in Table 2 does not seem to link to anyplace in the table. Should there
be an asterisk at the end of the header for the first column?
