This is a very well written and interesting paper on an important and timely topic. The
methods, analysis, and results are clearly described. A few suggestions for authors to
consider:
1. It appears from Table 1 that there were more transaction on a per year basis
post-labeling than in the previous two years. Were more restaurants open on an average
that year than in the previous two? Figure 1 shows more restaurants had no sales in
per-labeling than in post. It would be helpful for the authors to discuss those findings.
Include the average number of restaurants open and included in the two periods in Table 1?
2. In the discussion the authors write that reformulation did not likely contribute to the shift
in calorie purchases observed. It would be helpful to add some discussion based on previous
studies about the role reformulation can play and if one year is adequate time to expect the
reformulation to kick in.
3. In the results and discussion the authors talk about the differential drop in calories for
entrees, sides, and beverages post menu labeling. The authors should discuss literature that
addresses menu labeling and purchases behaviors of different types of items (entrees, sides,
beverages).
4. Finally, could the authors comment on change in sales of high and low calorie items within
entrees, sides, and beverages post-menu labeling?
