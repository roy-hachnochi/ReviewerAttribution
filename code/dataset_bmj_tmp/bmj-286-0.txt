This is a well thought-out and focused analysis piece. The authors’ points are supported by
data presented. I think these are important concerns that have been raised. Taking a
decision to roll out RTS,S before adequate data is available post-booster could create a
situation of having to walk back that decision later, a scenario that is infinitely more
complicated. In addition, an interim analysis at 2 years will certainly show a higher efficacy
than if the entire observation period is considered. However, there are some potential
limitations to the way the data is presented
A few comments:
Related to mortality:
1. What were the factors that led to implementation of other vaccines with a sex difference
in mortality? How does this inform RTS,S plans? Under what conditions would the increased
risk of mortality in female children be acceptable? I assume this will consider overall
reduction in mortality even if the effect is not equally distributed between male and female
children?
2. Regarding mortality differences, I can see from the table that for the 6-12 week group
(M0-20), mortality in the RTS,S arm is similar between males and females but lower in
females than males in the control group. However, for older kids, mortality is clearly higher
in the female RTS,S group than the males, while controls are similar between sexes. I
would also argue that the mortality differences between males and females in the M21-SE
group appears to be more due to lower mortality in the female controls than higher
mortality in the RTS,S. I suggest that a risk ratio of M:F within arms/age groups would be
informative and help interpret these differences similar to the Klein paper referenced.
3. The main problem seems to be in the M0-20, 5-17 month group when you compare
mortality in males and females. This would suggest that the interim analysis at 2 years
should capture this main problem, at least with respect to mortality.
4. Given that the CM and meningitis imbalance seems to be concentrated before the
booster (according to Mendoza), perhaps the interim analysis is expected to be able to
confirm or refute these important safety concerns.
5. The authors should 2 -4 above and possibly temper their assertions/concerns
6. I still agree that the full set of mortality data post-booster should be considered before a
decision is taken, but the compromise of an interim decision doesn’t seem so irresponsible
in light of 3,4. The full mortality data is important for deciding whether there is any positive
effect of RTS,S on mortality overall, something that is in question based on the Phase III
trials. Are we going to use a vaccine that reduces all episodes of malaria but increases CM
which has a higher case fatality rate particularly if this means no mortality benefit of the
vaccine? But that is a question to be tackled in another paper…
Other comments:
7. Does the pilot implementation include a plan to specifically measure meningitis cases?

8. Booster dose is mentioned at 18 months after the last does, 20 months after initiation
and at 2 years of age. Suggest using one definition for clarity.
9. The figures on meningitis are not interpretable without denominators
