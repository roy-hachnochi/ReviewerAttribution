Thank you for the opportunity to review this excellent manuscript. It is a well thought
piece and adds importantly to the literature by targeting the integration of mental
health with physical health care in primary care systems.
While I certainly agree with the use of community outreach to address mental health
care needs, I think it is important to emphasize that mental disorders must be
addressed as medical problems, first and foremost, and that community outreach can
perform a supportive/implementing role (as with HIV PEPFAR programs). I suggest
emphasizing the need for thorough medical work-up in the initial evaluation stage, as
would be the standard of care in HICs -- e.g., thyroid function tests for mood disorders,
RPR, B12, and HIV testing for cognitive difficulties, evaluation for anemia with fatigue
symptoms, etc. I think bringing these patients into the "medical fold" at the outset for
initial, thorough, diagnostics is critical for their outcomes medically and in regards to
stigma (in fact, we can cannot even give them a full mental health assessment [axis
III] without this information). Their (mental and physical) medical care plan could then
be supported and partially implemented by community outreach.
