The authors have further improved the report of their well designed and conducted trial.
They have adequately addressed the questions of the (large number of) reviewers and the
editors comments.
I recommend publication of this relevant and important publication. Undoubtedly this
publication will attract a lot of attention and will be open for discussion including the
interpretation of its findings.
I congratulate the authors with this fine piece of work
