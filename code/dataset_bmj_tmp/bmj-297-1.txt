1. The issues raised in this paper would be of interest to patients, but the conclusions that
essentially "more study is needed" mean that the paper would be of more interest to
researchers and research funders than to patients. Also, I think patients would have
difficulty understanding the statistics as presented.
2. The paper compares diagnostic criteria in 1987 vs 2016 but never says what they were.
Patients certainly wouldn't know, and some clinicians might not be familiar with the older
criteria.
3. The paper says early on "This raises obvious questions in relation to value-for-money
and the efficient use of finite healthcare budgets." As a patient, I'm more interested in
possible side effects than I am about health care budgets. Although this is discussed later,
it would be good to mention it here.
4. "Thus, changing clinical guidelines can result in dramatic increases in the
number of people who become eligible for statins." This should follow directly the
statement about elegibility increasing to 61%, before mention of NNT.
5. The manuscript needs some more careful copy editing, as there are some inclarities.
For example, "The results reported here." Does "here" refer to the various studies or to
this paper?
6. I find it confusing when manuscript goes back and forth from decimals to percentages.
Maybe that's just me.
7. "According to the risk reductions reported in our overview." I don't find those and I'm
not sure what the "overview" is.
