Byrne et al. make points that have in most cases have been made before, these deserve
to be made again, enlisting slightly different data and perspectives as here: Guidelines
have gone from advocating for statin treatment in a small minority of older patients, to
advocating for treatment in a majority. Statin impact in women and elderly may differ
from that in middle aged men. Any absolute benefit from statins to the patient, in many
primary prevention settings and subgroups, may be at best small. In the lower risk
categories, many people may need to be treated, at high cost, to prevent one serious
cardiovascular event, and the reality of potential offsetting harms is not well reckoned.
The discussion omits mention of critical factors I would personally have included, such as
sources of bias that are widespread and expected to distort outcomes favorably relative to
the “real-world” patients they are meant to represent, via characteristic of trial samples
and published studies. However, these factors would serve only to amplify the concerns
expressed.
The article reads rather like an opinion piece. That said, I would view this as a relevant
and useful addition to the statin debate.
