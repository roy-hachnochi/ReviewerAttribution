This study assesses the relationship between congenital malformations and the prescription
of oral fluconazole during the first trimester in a national cohort of pregnant women
enrolled with Medicaid.
The general methodological approach seems sound, with an appropriate choice of two
reference groups. The results are presented well (albeit with a surfeit of supplementary
tables/figures) with absolute risks, risk differences and relative risks reported.
There are just a few queries regarding the study cohort and the propensity analysis:

1. How representative a cohort are these women? How different are their characteristics
from pregnant women not enrolled with Medicaid and with what confidence can the study
results be generalised?
2. It would be useful to include a flowchart in the main paper detailing the
exclusions/inclusions of the sample cohort (this information is currently provided in eTable
2).
3. A number of covariates are listed. Exactly how were they selected? What was the extent
of missing data on the covariates?
4. The use of propensity score fine stratification weights appears suitable for the main
analysis of the study data, but it would useful for the general reader to have a more
detailed description of this method, and how it was adapted for the sensitivity analyses.
