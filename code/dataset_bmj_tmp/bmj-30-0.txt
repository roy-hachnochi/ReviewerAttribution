Thank you for your important contribution, giving an update on progression to type 2
diabetes 10 years after the important publication by Bellamy and coworkers. Despite the
undoubted potential and importance of this work, I have some major suggestions to
improve the accuracy and scientific value of the paper.
Major remarks
1. Please add the numbers for T2DM cases among GDM exposed and non-exposed in
Figures 2-4 (such as given in Figure 2 by Bellamy et al. 2009).
2. Consider also to add the follow-up time in Figures 2-4 (e.g. with the following columns;
Study ID, follow-up time, T2DM/GDM, T2DM/control)
3. Table 2:

a. Please add how many studies that are included in each category
b. Please add RR to the table.
c. Consider adding mean follow-up time within each ethnic group to the table.
d. “Studies with follow-up of (years)”: Are these numbers based on studies with actual
incidence of T2DM, or are also studies that screened patients after 5 years etc included
here? Please clarify.
4. With cumulative incidence/prevalence at specific time points (such as 1/5/10/25 years
after delivery) it is difficult to say much about timing, since they could have developed
T2DM several years before the screening. Please consider or discuss whether exploration of
timing should be based solely on studies reporting incidence (with person-years)
5. Is figure 4 restricted to those with actual incidence data? Please clarify in the
manuscript.
6. Figure 4: in addition to adding a column with mean follow-up time (as suggested in
comment 2), consider ordering the studies from shortest to longest follow-up time within
each time category (so that a potential trend is easier to spot)
7. I would expect that the relative risk of T2DM would increase and not decrease across
time, while in Figure 4 it is opposite (1-5: RR 17.06, 5-10 11.24, >10 8.09). Please discuss
these findings. Also, discuss why they seem to differ from the findings in Table 2 (where
5-10 years seem to have the highest RR).
8. If I remember correctly, ADA added HbA1c ≥ 6.5% in 2009 and WHO in 2011 to their
T2DM diagnosis criteria, while HbA1c is not mentioned in the legend of table 1. You
probably have studies using both versions of the criteria (before and after adding HbA1c).
Hence, I would prefer that you list the actual criteria used by each study (eg FPG, 1-hrPG,
2-hrPG for GDM and T2DM instead of ADA/WHO/NICE etc), to ease interpretation for the
reader. Listing the actual criteria may help in comparing T2DM progression within similar
criteria (such as ADA, WHO, CDA etc for T2DM). If you choose to keep ADA/WHO etc you
should add the year of revision of the criteria into the table (eg. WHO 1999 or WHO 2013
for GDM)
9. I’m not sure that I agree with the exclusion of studies without a healthy control group.
Including studies that follow-up GDM women would allow for a more precise estimate of
progression within the GDM exposed? Please consider to include these studies, or discuss
why you chose not to.
10. Page 8, last paragraph: you write “with the cut-off level of fasting plasma glucose for
T2DM being lowered from 7.8 to 7.0 mmol” please add the year for this change after this
sentence. Please elaborate on how many studies this applies to in the manuscript.
11. Please mention whether you asked the remaining three studies to provide the needed
numbers? If not, please do so.
12. 10 were not available in full-text: did you ask the authors to send you the
manuscripts?
13. Table 1: Row starting with Daly et al. 2018 – I did not think NICE had their own T2DM
guidelines, but that UK supports the WHO 2011 criteria (which includes HbA1c)? Please
verify this.
14. Page 8, second paragraph: you write “number of recent included studies” do you mean
recently published studies? Please rephrase accordingly.
15. It would be interesting to see a subgroup analysis on study designs (as described in
page 5, Study Characteristics section.
16. Page 15: you write “…however they assessed older studies, as well as with short-term
follow up”. Seems slightly redundant. Consider turning it around to what your study adds;
e.g however this review provides several recently published studies with longer follow-up.
