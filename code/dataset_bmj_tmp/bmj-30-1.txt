This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies investigating
progression to Type 2 diabetes after GDM including studies between January 2000 to
December 2019. A similar and well cited comparable systematic review and metaanalysis
was published in 2009 (Bellamy L, Casas J, Hingorani AD, Williams D. Type 2 diabetes
mellitus after gestational diabetes : a systematic review and meta-analysis. Lancet.
2009;373(9677):1773–9. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60731-5).
Main comments
1. The overall methodology is appropriate
2. The 95%CI overlap between this metaanalysis and the Bellamy metaanalysis
3. Table 2 looking at proportion with T2DM over time within GDM and control group shows
no statistics and yet is commented upon in the abstract “In populations of women with
previous GDM, the cumulative incidence of T2DM was higher in a mixed ethnicity or a
predominantly nonwhite population, compared to a white population (16.3% & 15.6% vs
9.4% respectively).” That there is an ethnic difference is not surprising
4. There is no comparison by type of screening (eg 1 step vs 2 step) or by criteria used
5. The findings are not new, although they use more recent data than earlier reviews
