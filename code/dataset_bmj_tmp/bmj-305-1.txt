Overall Comments on Rekve et al, August 2019, Niamh Fitzgerald.
Many thanks for the opportunity to review this important and timely paper, analysing the
current state of alcohol policy internationally, and noting the increasing need for effective
strategies to curb premature mortality and harms. My comments are fairly minor, and
intended to further strengthen the paper as the authors see fit. Overall, I find it a
compelling paper, making an important case for policy action in an underdeveloped field.
The paper is named/framed as focusing on NCDs, but also notes that alcohol is implicated in
accidents, violence, social problems and discord, as well as infectious diseases (HIV,
tuberculosis). It could make more of the harms that are not NCD-related.
A key implication of the paper is that communication of scientific evidence to policymakers,
in a context free of the influence of the alcohol industry, would lead to better regulation and
legislation – including ‘implementation’ and ‘monitoring’. I felt this came across as an
oversimplification of the task facing public health. Whilst policy processes can (and in my
view should) be protected from direct industry involvement, policymaking is inherently
value-driven, dependent on policymaker beliefs, attitudes and experiences, takes place at
multiple levels of governance, and can never be completely free of the influence of
stakeholders including those with vested interests (see Cairney, and Russell et al. –
references below 1,2). Even with clear and strong protections in place to minimise industry
influence, public health advocates must still convince policymakers to implement promising
policies and monitor their effectiveness. That will likely require more than just evidence of
effectiveness of the policy, but effective arguments to decision makers and those who
influence them. Such arguments will need to focus on fairness, feasibility, and consideration
of potential (positive or negative) unintended consequences of policies in different contexts,
as well as the need for or effectiveness of the policies in addressing specific harms.
Comments on specific sections:

1. P4, line 3: “While the European region is home to both the greatest share of alcohol
consumption and highest relative burden with regards all deaths (in %) attributable to
alcohol consumption vis-à-vis other risk factors, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
and especially Africa experience the highest per capita rates of alcohol-related harm (Table
1).”
I found this difficult to understand as a standalone sentence - consider rewording this so that
the message is clear even without referring to the figures in the table. Also, should ‘harm’
change to ‘deaths’ or ‘mortality’ here as the Table refers to death, not other harms. Also,
it’s not ‘especially’ Africa – Africa is the only region that experiences higher deaths per capita
than Europe in the Table provided? E.g. “whilst the European region experiences the highest
proportion of all deaths due to alcohol, Africa experiences a relatively higher number of
alcohol-related deaths per capita”.
2. Page 4, line 53: “A 29% increase in alcohol consumption in the South-East Asia Region
since 2010 is strong grounds for policy action to curb such a dramatic change in trajectory.”
It’s unclear whether this statement is arguing for policy action aimed at curbing consumption
increases in SE Asia or whether the recommended policy action is to prevent similar
increases occurring in future in Africa (or both).
3. Page 5/6 - The argument for the three ‘best buys’ is potentially undermined by reference
to two other policies which may be impractical or ineffective, particularly in LMICs. Recent
evidence suggests that lower drink drive limits may be ineffective without adequate
enforcement, and in many LMICs there is inadequate/no infrastructure (such as roadside
testing devices or police resources) to implement drink-drive limits. Furthermore, the
evidence base for brief psychosocial interventions looks increasingly weak, given doubts
about self-reported outcomes (3), poor understanding of what intervention types are
effective (4), and little/no efficacy evidence from LMICs, including Africa (5) (refs below).
4. Page 5, line 42: “While some countries have been successful in implementing
evidence-based, cost-effective and high-impact policies and have documented positive
impacts on health, leading the way for concerted action”
It would be helpful if the citation for this sentence directed the reader (wishing to emulate
such success) straight to such countries, rather than to an international review. If no new
citation can be added, can the countries be named in the text?
5. Page 7, line 8. The fifth example of implementation (v) – refers to treatment coverage –
normally a term used to describe the proportion of individuals with alcohol dependence in a
population who have access to treatment? But the paragraph on best buys refers to delivery
of brief psychosocial interventions as the fifth ‘cost effective’ option – which are described as
being for hazardous and harmful drinkers. Of course these concepts are linked but they are
different – these two parts should be synchronized or the differences and implications
explained.
6. Page 9, Line 9: I found the order of the ‘Implement, Monitor, Protect’ interesting. Whilst
policies that are already implemented require protection from industry influence to avoid
them being rolled back, it seems to me that ‘Protect’ should come first, to contribute to a
policy environment in which the likelihood of the ‘Implement’ and ‘Monitor’ steps is
maximised. I also wondered if it would be worth mentioning the reputational risks for
policymakers of engagement with industry actors as well as the risks to public health.
7. What should ‘protection’ from industry influence look like in practice? What is effective
protection? Bearing in mind also that realistically, policymakers will still need/want to
engage with industry on economic and employment issues, so perhaps providing some
guidance on distinguishing what is and isn’t appropriate would be helpful here.

8. Page 11, Line 13: “There is an urgent need to synthesize and translate existing knowledge
into an action package to support countries’ efforts to prevent and reduce harmful use of
alcohol.”
This key message does not really relate to the body of text in the paper – it would be
valuable to include more about what the gap is, and how it could be filled. Are there not
many action packages already available e.g. the WHO SAFER initiative (6), Health First (7,8)
etc.
Typos:
P4, line 29 – delete ‘exist’ or edit.
P4, line 34 – national and local, not just national? Local can undermine or boost national
action.
P5, line 27 – ‘bare’ should be ‘bear’
