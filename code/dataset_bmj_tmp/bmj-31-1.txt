In this study, investigators examined temporal trends in the association of AF and death across there
different epochs (1972-1985, 1986-2000, 2001-2015) by studying participants of the Framingham Heart
Study. Throughout all epochs, AF is associated with greater risk of death. Further, authors find that the
difference in restricted mean survival time between participants with AF vs without AF decreases over
epochs by 26%, though there was no temporal trend in HR for death associated with new-onset AF
across epochs. This is a well-conducted and important study with rigorous methodology to examine the
question at hand.
Major comments:
- The findings appear somewhat disparate, in that absolute difference in RMST between AF and no AF at
10 years decreases over epochs, yet relative hazard of AF for death shows no temporal trend. Authors
should comment further on this discrepancy and how to best reconcile the two.
- The major threat to validity is lead time bias – since ECG is used more widely in contemporary era, this
may have resulted in diagnosis of “less sick” individuals earlier in the disease course, hence better
survival. This is acknowledged by the authors in the discussion, though I wonder whether this can be
further explored. For example, did the incidence of AF concomitantly increase across epochs, and
account for differences in outcomes associated with AF?
- One important confounder may include the development of interim myocardial infarction or heart
failure proximal to the development of AF. Did authors account for these as potential confounders in the
association with mortality (different from prevalent disease at baseline prior to the development of AF
many years later)?
- Do Cox models meet proportionality of hazards assumption?
