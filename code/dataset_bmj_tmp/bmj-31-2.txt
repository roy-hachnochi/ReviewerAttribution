Vinter et al.
This is an important study that adds to the current body of literature on atrial fibrillation, showing that
the gains made over time in other groups has not been afforded to those with AF, in the prospectively
followed cohort of the Framingham Heart Study.

Major comments:
It is unclear whether the study included spouses and related offspring. If so, how were shared
environmental factors accounted for methodologically and analytically?
AF may occur as a primary condition without other CV conditions such as myocardial infarction or heart
failure. However, AF may also occur as a complication of acute myocardial infarction or heart failure,
pulmonary embolism, etc. Was this considered. If not, it would be useful for the authors to conduct a
stratified analysis of primary AF vs. secondary AF as the exposure of interest.
Over time, fewer AF cases had prevalent heart failure or myocardial infarction. Can the authors provide
information on the setting of AF diagnosis in the 3 epochs? That is, in-hospital vs. ambulatory?
Another potential limitation might be that the details of the new AF episode, may not be readily
available. For example, the duration of AF, need for electrical or chemical cardioversion, etc.

Minor comments:
Table 2 – please add labels to the top of the table indicating that these are hazard ratios and clearly
show the referent group
Table 3 – same comment as above
Figure 1 – should show what the line of unity represents and should stand alone – i.e., provide the
reference category
