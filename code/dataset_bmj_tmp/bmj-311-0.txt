Thanks for the opportunity. This is a well-conducted RCT, with robust methodology. Little
followup losses. Great control of bias. No major concerns, it merits publication.
1. Introduction: concise, delivers the important info
2. Methods:
a) Participants: it is not clear how the researchers defined, priorly, the exact site of tendon
injury, as they opted to exclude insertion/musculotendinous junction injuries;
b) It may be of value to include some details of post-intervention "standard care";
c) Sample size: as stated in the "Trials" paper ( reference 14): "A total number of 214
patients (107 per arm) will provide 90% power to detect a standardised difference of 0.5 in
the LSI measured at 24 weeks post treatment, with 5% (two-sided) significance and
allowing 20% losses to follow-up". It is not clear how an increase in the sample size ( from
214 to 230) resulted in a 10% of power loss. Why the authors decided to assume a 10%
power loss during the study?
d) Intervention details: " a technical failure in PRP delivery": can the authors provide the
details for failure in the the delivery?
4. Extra: a)Were the patients uniformly distributed among the recruitment centres? b) Any
issues with the 16 ultrasound-guided biopsies?

5. Discussion: a) maybe the authors can highlight the external validity of the study - I can
feel this research piece as a "more" pragmatic-driven multicenter RCT, which I believe to be
good. b) The perfection of the statistical methodology is also remarkable.
