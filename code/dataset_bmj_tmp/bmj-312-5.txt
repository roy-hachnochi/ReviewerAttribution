Overall impression: As the authors state, a major contribution of this study is that it is the
first systematic review of a complex but important topic. They do a nice job summarizing the
available data while also acknowledging some of the major limitations. In doing so, they
raise some important questions, offer potential implications and establish a clear need for
further research.
Intro: This section is well-written and clearly defines the terms, what is known on the
subject, the goals of the paper, and why this review is necessary.
Results: How were the studies in different languages reviewed (translated or reviewed by
native speakers)? How many languages were included and were discrepancies all resolved in
the same manner (by consensus between investigators)?
Is there any way to weight high-quality studies heavier than low-quality studies in the
analysis? If so, would this alter the discussion in any kind of meaningful way?
The section titled “Relationship between industry funding and organizational positions” is
also nicely organized and flows well. The second paragraph addressing legislative change to
increase the industry’s role is interesting but has a very small sample size (11). This seems
like an interesting area for future research but could be potentially biased given the small n.
In the fourth paragraph of this section, the authors state, “110/147 (75%) of patient groups
that sided with pharmaceutical companies and opposed the proposal received industry
funding (33).” Was this statistically significant in the original paper? What percent of the
total of each group (industry vs non-industry funded groups) did these numbers represent?
i.e. if the majority of patient groups surveyed had received funding then this percentage
(and its significance) could be misleading.
Discussion: Very strong overall. It is both a strength and a weakness that this paper
compares studies across so many different countries with drastically different
laws/regulatory policies. Ideally, this degree of inclusion would make the results more
generalizable but it’s also difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from the reported
outcomes when they vary so greatly between studies and countries. That said, I think the
authors do a really nice job acknowledging this and don't overstate their conclusions.
