Thank you for the opportunity to review this revised manuscript.
In this new version, the study authors address a key weakness in the previous draft and
acknowledge that in recent years, there has been increasing attention to the development of
patient advocacy educational programs, codes and guidelines, referencing EUPATI, WECAN,
and EFPIA. (lines 114-118 and references 3-6). This is a helpful addition and sets the
landscape more clearly.
In the first draft the authors stated that “no patients were involved in planning and
conducting this review”. It is a positive step that the authors now disclose that “Two of the
study authors (PM and BM) have been involved for many years with women’s health and
consumer groups and maintain strong community engagement,” and that the first draft has
since been reviewed and commented on by the representative of a Canadian patient group.
Although I would personally have preferred to have seen one of the umbrella organisations
consulted over the study design and planning, it is clearly unrealistic to do so at this stage. I
hope that the authors will consider this approach for future studies.
It is puzzling that the number of studies reviewed in this paper has been reduced from 27 to
26 studies. On closer examination it appears that the Leto di Priolo study referred to in the
earlier draft has been taken out. The authors give as their reason for excluding it that there

were "no outcomes of interest". The conclusion of the Leto di Priolo study that “‘Despite
ongoing concerns about the openness and transparency of relations between pharmaceutical
companies and patient groups, there is scope for these two sectors to work together on
issues of common interest,” seems to me both interesting and relevant to the scope of the
review, it is therefore disappointing that it has been excluded at this stage.
I do not personally agree with all of the findings in this review article but this second draft
has certainly benefited from the remarks made by myself and previous reviewers and the
authors have clearly done their best to address the key points. Publication of this review
article would facilitate healthy discussion with patient organisations and industry
representatives.
