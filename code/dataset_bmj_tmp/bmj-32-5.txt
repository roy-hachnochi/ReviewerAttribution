Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this article. This is well written,well
structured and clear largest ever RCT on polypharmacy.
I suggest a few minor revisions in order to increase clarity.
-What this study adds:
L66-68 Patient safety and treatment burden are not the outcomes evaluated in this study
as primary outcomes. You need to evaluate another trial for assessing these outcomes. It
is not appropriate to report the drug-related patient safety as the conclusions of this study.
-Abstract:
L74 Why did you define polypharmacy as more than eight medical substances? In
general, there are many studies that define polypharmacy as more than 5, please specify
the reason.
-Discussion:
P20 L22 This study is a Pragmatic RCT and has a risk of selection bias. In that case, using
the results of the per protocol to demonstrate the usefulness of the study should be
avoided, as it can lead to overestimation of the results.
P20 L39 It is not known whether strictly drug-related patient safety has improved.
・Although this study shows that the number of drugs has decreased, it is not known
whether Potentially Inappropriate Medications(PIMs) are decreasing. Polypharmacy
interventions often involve PIMs, and what were the prevalence and changes in PIMs in this
study?
・About harm of intervention, how was the impact on outpatient clinic time and
introduction costs for using CMR?
