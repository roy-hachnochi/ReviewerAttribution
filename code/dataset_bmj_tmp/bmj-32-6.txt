I have thoroughly reviewed the manuscript of Rieckert et al.- ID BMJ-2019-054179.
Polypharmacy may be regarded as the first iatrogenic epidemic and as such, has
increasingly negative health and economic consequences globally. In today’s atmosphere
of defensive medicine and guideline-based prescribing, a large part of “doing no harm” in
the geriatric population must focus on de-prescribing. Fears and unwillingness of the family
doctor to discontinue medications is a major barrier to routine deprescribing.
In this respect, this manuscript Rieckert et al. represents an important step on our way to
encourage family doctors to deprescribe. The PRIMA-eDS electronic decision support tool
for polypharmacy is a well designed, multinational European project presenting a new
comprehensive medication review that may encourage depresribing of inappropriate
medications. I completely agree with the authors that the fact that control GPs were aware
of the purpose of the trial represents some kind of a bias that incorrectly reduce the extent
of success of deprescribing in the CMR group.
One strength of the study is that, as the authors claim, it is probably "the largest ever trial"
attempting to reduce polypharmacy. Paradoxically, facing the huge amount of time and

resources, good planning, appropriate randomization and statistics, the advantage of being
a multicenter study with many GPs and a very large sample of patients - I could not avoid
some feeling of disappointment facing the results. As the authors claim, significant
deprescrining has been "achieved without detriment to patient outcomes" proving the
safety of rational deprescribing – an important encouragement to the busy GP who has to
operate in a defensive medicine atmosphere, and a good reason in itself to recommend
publication in your journal. However (again as the authors honestly conclude) "no
significant health benefits were found". From my humble experience, rational
deprescribing of many medications may be associated in many older people with improved
clinical outcomes lasting more than 3 years (general satisfaction, physical, cognitive &
mental status etc.), as compared to older people who continue all medications based on all
guidelines (ref. 1, 2).
Irrespective to my recommendation to publish this manuscript, I wish the researchers can
still use their very large patient samples to assess clinical outcomes several moths/year
after the intervention.
My recommendation : ACCEPT
