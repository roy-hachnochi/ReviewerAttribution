Thank you for the chance to review this extremely interesting and high quality manuscript.
The authors have presented clear and convincing analyses that show associations between
commuting by bicycle and injury risk. Better understanding the health costs and benefits of
active commute modes, and of cycling in particular, is of extremely high public health value.
This paper will surely be useful to transportation planners who are working to create
healthier transportation systems in cities all over the world. The paper is well-written and the
graphics/tables are easy to understand. I do have one major comment and several minor
comments.
Major comment
Because authors have approximate address information, it would be great to see an analysis
showing risk of injury among cyclists according to the availability/quality of cycling
infrastructure. While the authors could not be sure of the routes taken by commuters, they
could test for associations between area-level infrastructure characteristics and injury rates.
The literature cited in their discussion section points to measures of cycling infrastructure
they could include in such an analysis. This addition would go far in supporting their
conclusions that safer cycling infrastructure could reduce injury risk.
Minor comments
1) The switch between active and passive voice can become distracting in places. I suggest
editing for consistent use of active voice.
2) Outcomes: The division between primary and secondary outcomes was not entirely clear
to me. Secondary outcomes included injuries for which there was not a hospitalization? A
clear statement summarizing the logic behind the ICD codes comprising the primary and
secondary outcomes would be helpful so that casual readers don’t come away thinking that
some body parts were covered by primary outcomes and other body parts were covered by
secondary outcomes.
3) Pg 5 lines 8-14 – could authors say more about this? Why are these code different and
stored separately?
4) Pg 6 lines 16-27 – could the authors discuss the concerns about dispersion in a more
substantive way? Or cut down some of this section, for example “We used negative binomial
regression models with constant dispersion (α estimated by maximum likelihood), robust
standard errors, and identical adjustment to the above Cox models because these models
performed better than x y z models as measured by [a range of tests for over-dispersion].” I
expect that most readers won’t appreciate the authors’ efforts to prevent over-dispersion as
these efforts are currently described.

5) Pg 9 line 32 --- I’m not sure what the basis is for this statement. Excess compared to
what? Always? Even if we made dramatic changes in transportation infrastructure? I suggest
cutting this defeatist claim unless the authors can clarify the assertion and/or provide a
citation showing why cycling is inherently less safe than other modes.
6) Pg 10 lines 11-15 – some of this reads as (interesting) new information that should first
be reported in the results section.
