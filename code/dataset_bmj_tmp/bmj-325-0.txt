This national survey in Mainland China showed a weighted prevalence of diabetes and
prediabetes of 12.75% and 35.22%, with considerable variations in the prevalence
according to population age, ethnicity, and geographic location. As compared with data
derived in several previous surveys in China, the prevalence of diabetes continues to
increase, whereas the rate of awareness also has increased among the patients, possibly
suggesting that some government’s programs aiming at preventing and managing NCD
may have initiated their impacts. The impressive ethnic and location differences in the
prevalence may suggest variable distributions of genetic, lifestyle, and socioeconomical
factors determining diabetes risk, which are expected to be explored in futures studies.
Some unique risk factor profiles are expected to be identifiable and hopefully can be
generalizable to the whole population for diabetes prevention.
While the work is nicely done, there are several major concerns:
1. The authors compared the observed prevalence of diabetes with those estimated in
three previous surveys (2007, 2010, and 2013), and found that the current estimate was
the highest. What are the data sources for this comparison? The 2010 survey (PMID:
20335585) used WHO criteria, whereas the 2013 (PMID: 24002281) and the current
surveys both used ADA criteria. The authors showed in Figure 2 that all estimates were
based on the WHO criteria. Was any additional procedure performed to derive comparable
data? If yes, the details need to be reported; and if no, the “highest prevalence” needs to
cautiously reported.
2. The conclusion that “The increase in prevalence was not mainly attributed to aging and
obesity but might be related to genetic susceptibility, prenatal nutrition, urbanization and
regional variations” is clearly overstated. The work did not provide any direct evidence that
these factors are the major contributors to the observed increase in diabetes prevalence
beyond aging and obesity. While it is plausible that urbanization related transitions in risk
factors can lead to increased diabetes incidence and therefore increased prevalence, there
are other questions:

1) How genetic susceptibility will lead to increase in diabetes prevalence? Will people living
in recent years be more genetically susceptible to diabetes than those living in 2007 or
earlier?
2) There was a sharp increase in diabetes prevalence after the age of 50 y. In the Abstract
and in several places of the manuscript it was implicated that these population groups were
born around 60s and the substantially increased diabetes prevalence among them can be
attributed to the famine occurring at 60s. These are not prudent. Whether prenatal
exposure to famine are causal determinants of cardiometabolic disease remain
controversial (PMID: 28492964; PMID: 28338900).
In contrast to diabetes prevalence, the prevalence of prediabetes increased with increasing
age, with no additional (in men) or some decreases (in women) after the age of 50 y.
Thus, it is not surprising that diabetes prevalence increased dramatically after the age of
50 y as there were many prediabetes heaping in younger population. A clear interpretation
of this observation may be complex, but there are some plausible explanations for the
age-specific difference in the prevalence of prediabetes, for example: a) Younger
population have more social/family responsibilities but poorer health awareness (e.g. due
to the awareness of lower health risk), and they may be less likely to aware of any slight
elevation of blood glucose. As a result, effective lifestyle modification or medical treatments
are lacking. b) People who remain free of diabetes and prediabetes after the age of 50 y
may have some advantages in terms of genetic, socioeconomic, or lifestyle factors, and
they will continue to be healthier with advancing age.
3. The inclusion criteria for the survey: adults who aged 18 years or older, lived in the
selected community for at least 5 years, and were not pregnant. One concern is that most
college students and many migrant workers (especially younger and unmarried workers
who are less likely to being resident in a fixed community for a long period) for whom
diabetes prevalence could be much lower than that of the general population would have
not been included, leading to an overestimate of the prevalence. Although the authors used
survey data analyses in which the weight coefficient involved the age of national
population, and the results were adjusted for sex and age (of the analytic sample), lower
diabetes prevalence should be expected if the survey analyses were further weighted for
age using data from the national census rather than the analytic sample .

Other minor comments:
Introduction:
P13/L21: “the prevalence of diabetes has continued to rise from 0.67% in 1980 to 10.90%
in 2013”. Such a dramatic increase can be largely attributable to the improved diagnosis
methods/criteria.
Methods:
P16/L11: Why the definition of hypertension excluded physicians’ diagnosis? Also,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, high LDL-C, low HDL-C all were evaluated as
potential diabetes risk factors, but the relevant definitions were missing.
P18/L11: As all analyses involved sampling weight adjustment, more detailed information
on the way of generating sampling weight needs to be provided.
Results:
P21/L29: “48.95% (95% CI, 44.49%-53.44%) of all patients with diabetes were taking
antidiabetic medication”. Should be all diabetes patients who were aware of their disease
(given that the awareness rate was ~42, the treatment rate should not be even higher)?
P23/L31: What are the covariates included in the multivariable models?.

Discussion:
P27/L5-L24: Too much emphasis on potential role of famine and there are some
over-statements
P28/L19-L24: It is difficult to understand how the example that first-generation
Asian-Americans had a greater increase in diabetes prevalence than did Caucasians can
support the statement that “genetic factors significantly influence the prevalence of
diabetes”.
P29/L21 and P32/L14-L17: see the major comment 2.
