There are 2 aspects in the study that cause me most concern and they need addressing
before any further analysis of the work.
One is that the selection of people to be studied excludes those who have not been
resident for some years. This is odd. People who are socially mobile will include people who
are deprived, many of whom will be at high risk of all chronic diseases including diabetes.
Was this design chosen to copy previous studies? If so, it would have been easy to have
studied the whole population, and these non-mobile folk seperately.
The second is that the method of diagnosis has changed with time. There is no data here to
demonstrate an actual increase in type 2 diabetes, as diagnosed by glucose alone. The ADA
method of diagnosing diabetes used here is also not one shared by all international
societies. The authors could easily test their main hypothesis: that there has been an
temporal increase in the prevalence of diabetes, by limiting the diagnosis to those with
abnormal glucose results; a secondary result would be the prevalence of diabetes as
defined by the ADA {though they should note that their study does not have repeat
abnormal values at a different time and may therefore be an overestimate by 10-20%}.
