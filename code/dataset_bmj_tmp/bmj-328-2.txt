• Several definitions are included that may be too basic for this audience (ex: defining
gender), but other terms are included elsewhere where a definition could be beneficial
(ex: “structural forms of gender inequity”). Along with this, more consistency in their
terminology would be helpful. For example, in the section “What are structural drivers

and why are they important?” (page 2-3, starting at line 52 and through line 10 on the
next page), the authors seem to use the following terms interchangeably “structural
determinants”, “structural drivers”, “contextual factors”, and later (line 19 page 4)
“contextual structural factors”. The authors should consider standardizing their language
when discussing similar concepts.
• There are a number of places in manuscript where strong statements are made without
references. For example, in the introduction, references are needed in the second
sentence, second paragraph (lines 19-22, page 2) and second to last sentence in the
same paragraph lines 25-27. For lines 19-22 specifically, it is not clear that girls have
less knowledge and access to information on contraceptives compared to boys, as I
believe there is mixed literature on this point. Similarly, a citation is needed to back the
claim on line 35 on page 2.
• Fewer generalities and more specificity would be helpful throughout. For example, in
line 11, page 2, the authors refer to 15 countries. Are these 15 low income countries? Are
they specific to one geographic region? The discussion of structural drivers on the top of
page 3 provides broad definitions, but not enough specificity to advance their arguments.
Later the authors discuss multiple levels “meso” “macro” and “micro”, and then
“individual”, “interpersonal”, and “household”. There can be more specificity and clarity
on how these levels all relate to each other or to their conceptual framework. Finally, in
the discussion of political participation, it would be more effective if the authors provided
specific examples from different countries/settings.
• Tables 1 and 2 don’t clearly support the arguments that adolescent girls are particularly
at risk for worse outcomes. Death rates for many of listed conditions in those tables
actually seem to be higher for boys compared to girls. As a minor point, I suggest
keeping the columns consistent in those tables, so male or female should come first in
both age groups listed (10-14, and 15-19). It is also not clear what the gray shading
refers to in those tables.
• The Discussion on gender norms (page 3-4), can have more depth and nuance. They
can include more of the literature summarizing what is known on the links between
gender norms and health. For example, there is a robust body of literature showing that
low sexual relationship power and gender inequality norms drive risky sex, sexual
violence, and other health outcomes like malnutrition, depression, and poor adherence to
medications.
• Discussion on food insecurity on page 4 be strengthened. Beyond HIV risk and
adherence to ART, there is a large body of literature showing that food insecurity
contributes to worse health across many domains relevant for women including
reproductive health outcomes, sexual violence, chronic disease outcomes and worse
mental health. The authors can also briefly describe what is known about benefits of food
insecurity interventions for improving the health of women. In their discussion of food
prices on page 5, lines 33-35, the authors can clarify that food prices can affect not only
quantity but also quality of food.
• The final paragraph on the bottom of page 5 (beginning with “Two areas…”) makes some
good points, but the authors may want to acknowledge that there are important economic
and structural barriers to access to social media for girls and women in many settings
such as lack of access to consistent electricity, or lack of money for phone credit, smart
phones/tablets and Wi-Fi.
• The authors bring in a discussion of the LGBTI community in Line 11 on page 6 for the
first time. It may be useful to acknowledge here violence towards or non-tolerance of
sexual and gender minorities, which also ties in with the earlier discussion of gender
norms.

Minor editorial changes:
• Second sentence, lines 7-9 on page 2. This sentence is not clear (as gender is not
particularly marked during a specific time period).
• Line 12, page 2 replace whereas with ‘and’ and remove the comma preceding it
• Line 26, page 4, take out the ‘and” after “living with HIV”.
• Line 17-18, page 5: It is not clear what the authors mean by “working for cash” –do
they mean working for cash in the informal labor force?
• In lines 35-37 on page 7 in the conclusion, the authors may want to add laws that not
only affect women’s access to land, but also their ownership of the land.
• Line 10, page 5: recommend using domestic violence or domestic abuse rather than wife
abuse
• Line 45, page 6: add “respectively” after overcome.
• Last page: Spell out RMNCH first time it appears.
