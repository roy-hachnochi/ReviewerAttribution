The paper describes differences in coverage of nutrition interventions across countries.
I have some comments on the paper's structure and presentation of the findings.
1. The paper is rather shapeless, without a clearly stated aim or description of how it is
addressed. Reading the paper I saw three outcomes emerge, all relating to coverage of
nutrition interventions, which are described as the opportunity gap (gap in coverage
between health services and the nutrition intervention), the equity gap (rural versus
urban coverage gap) and what could be called the regional equity gap (regional
coverage gap). The latter appears right at the end, almost as an afterthought, yet in
the conclusions its importance is highlighted. This is at odds with the figures which
focus on the equity gap.
The problem with the paper's structure is that the first of these outcomes, the
opportunity gap, gets defined only after the first data have been presented in Figure 1.
There needs to be a clear statement at the outset that the outcomes of interest are
coverage, and in particular differences in coverage as described by the three gaps.
2. There also needs to be more said up front about where the data came from and
what was done with them. The fact that they are DHS and MICS data is stated only on
page 18, apart from a brief mention on page 6. Figure 3 involves some quite
complicated statistics that are not explained.
3. The tables and figures are referred to almost without comment, e.g. Table 1 and
Figure 1 on page 4. This makes them hard to process, but in addition the figures
themselves are, though pretty, poorly designed and overly complicated. In addition the
supplementary material contains two tables and three figures, of which only the first
table is cited. The others might just as well not be there.
4. Taking the figures in turn, Figure 1 has no label on the y axis - quite why I find
inexplicable. It makes it very hard to interpret. And the same applies to the x axis in
Figure 2, the many y axes in Figure 3, and both the x and y axes in Figure 4. In each
case I suspect they represent percentage coverage, but it really would be better to say
so.

5. In Figure 2 the x axis is presumably coverage, whereas in Figures 1 and 3 coverage
is on the y axis. Why not transpose Figure 2 so coverage is on the y axis? Also, why
include the numbers in the body of the graph when there is an x axis? - it only
complicates things. A better design might be to use an xy plot with coverage on both
axes, rural versus urban, which would halve the number of points.
6. Figure 3 is extremely complicated and yet poorly explained - the regression lines are
not even mentioned on page 5. In addition the title refers to fixed effects models that
have not been described, adding further confusion. What is the message to be drawn
from Figure 3? it deserves a proper description.
7. Figure 4 is remarkable in having two distinct facets with coverage on the x axis in
one and on the y axis in the other. As with Figure 2 it would be worth transposing the
left facet and omitting the numbers.
8. The 985% facility delivery in El Salvador on page 6 looks to be on the high side.
9. In the final line of page 6, "data is limited", data should be plural.
