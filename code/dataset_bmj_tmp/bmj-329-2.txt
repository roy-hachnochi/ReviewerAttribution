This 7th article in the Countdown to 2030 Series conducts some basic analyses of
temporal and geographical differences between UHC and nutrition intervention
coverage globally to address the issue of equitable reach by nutrition interventions. A
few country examples augment the generalised analysis. The authors emphasise the
paucity and unevenness of data and make a plea for greater coverage. Nonetheless
some interesting insights emerge.
I hope that the following suggestions will improve the paper.
Relatively Major
Some of the analyses in Figs 2 and 4 require revision. The numbers of countries
contributing to comparisons (eg urban vs rural) are different. This may obscure true
differences. In instances where the sample size (number of countries) is large this may
not be a big issue, but it remains an ‘incorrect’ analysis. It would be far better to
restrict the data to orthogonal datasets (ie where each country contributes to both
urban and rural or, in the case of Figure 4 to early and later timepoints). Even if this
advice is not followed it is certainly illegitimate to draw lines joining the data points
when the samples contributing data are not the same. In almost the reverse direction
it would be useful if the pairs of points in Figure 3 were joined by feint lines.
Page 6, para 1: I’m sure the authors will be well aware of the concerns and debates
that the use of multiple approaches to the elimination of vitamin A deficiency have
created some push back against mass campaigns that may have had some influence
on the decline. A short and nuanced mention of this should be included.
Minor
There is a good number of careless typos that need to be cleaned up.
Page 3, lines 46/47: No mention of exclusive breastfeeding?
Page 4, line 49: change ‘showed’ to ‘estimated’ because – at best – this is a crude
estimate.
Page 4, line 57 et seq: Switches from zinc to ORS and back to zinc in 3 sentences.
Please tidy up.
Page 5, line 8: ‘through an equity lens’ or ‘from an equity perspective’ – not from an
equity lens as is written.
Page 5, line 60: This orphan sentence looks clumsy and is not needed.
