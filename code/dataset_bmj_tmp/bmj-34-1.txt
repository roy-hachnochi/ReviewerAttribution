General remarks:
This is a clearly written and well-researched manuscript with valid research questions and use of sound
methodological methods. The manuscript is novel in its comparison of cancer and noncancer patient
population groups. The findings are a relevant addition to the current scientific body of knowledge with
regard to the association between palliative care use and quality of end-of-life care. I suggest to the
editor to consider the manuscript for publication with minor revisions.
Specific remarks:

1. Introduction: line 105, this study is not the first to examine the role of palliative care on healthcare
use near the end of life in patients dying of noncancer illness at a population level. See for example a
recent study using linked administrative data on the population level from Belgium:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025180 (full reference below).
2. Methods: line 130, the authors state cause of death was determined according to the ICD-10 code
that identified the disease that directly caused death as indicated on the death certificate. In the
limitations it is stated that this decision “likely decreased the overall denominator in our study
population”. I wonder if this was more the case for the identification of noncancer deaths (eg dementia)
compared to cancer deaths, and if so, what consequences this has for the interpretation of the results?
3. Methods: line 146, the authors decided to exclude people who received their first palliative care visit
within 7 days of death, to allow sufficient follow-up time to measure potential changes in healthcare use
or to organize the substantial community-based healthcare services needed to enable death at home. I
believe this to be a valid method, but wonder if 7 days is indeed sufficient follow-up time to measure
potential changes? What was the rationale to choose 7 days, instead of a longer period (eg 14 or 30
days)?
4. Methods: line 159, palliative care intervention is broadly interpreted as any registered delivery of
palliative care by a physician in any setting. Were analyses performed for different settings separately,
and were there differences found between associations for the delivery of palliative care in different
settings (home, hospital, hospice)?
5. Methods: line 189 and further, Have the authors considered to search peer-reviewed literature
regarding quality indicators to measure outcomes on a population-level? For example, a study published
in Palliative Medicine developed indicators of appropriate and inappropriate end-of-life care for people
with cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or Alzheimer’s disease, measurable with
population-level administrative data (reference: https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0269216317705099)
6. Results: I was surprised by the finding that in patients who died from dementia palliative care was
associated with an increased rate of potentially burdensome interventions. The authors give some
interesting hypotheses to explain this finding. However, I wonder if this finding could also be an
unwanted result of the method to select patients based on their direct cause of death identified on the
death certificate. Many patients living with dementia are not (or only unofficially) diagnosed as having
dementia. Moreover, this is often not registered on the death certificate as the (direct) cause of death.
This underreporting of dementia as a cause of death on the death certificates could possible skew the
findings towards the current findings, by including only patients with more severe dementia, and thus
more severe care needs.
