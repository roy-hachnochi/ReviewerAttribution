Thank you for conducting this review. It is a very important contribution to the on-going and
heated debate on media and suicide. Although the current debate predominantly is based on
fictional portraits of suicidal behaviour, the meta-analysis marks a highly relevant piece of
evidence that surely merits publication. In general, this is a very well conducted research
project. The strength of the are the methodological thoroughness and the careful
assessment of included studies. The weaknesses of the study relate to the study design; i.e.
the challenge to merge findings from diverging study designs and measures. The authors do
a very good job of pointing out these weaknesses. Below some (minor) comments that
might help shape the text so that more readers will easily understand the important
message of the study.
Specific comments:
Title: Please consider adding the word ‘non-fictional’ to the title. This will make the study
less confusing for readers who are novel to the field of study.
Abstract:
Results: please provide the CI-95% for the estimates of the meta-analyses.
Introduction:
Given that the term, the Werther-effect, stems from a fictional portrayal of a suicide, it
would be good to provide a rational for the importance of distinguishing between fictional
and non-fictional portrayals of suicide in the introduction.
Line 17-26, the message in these sentences are not entirely easy for the reader to
understand. It seems your point is that portrayals of suicide have been linked to suicidal
ideation and this is worrisome because a substantial share of the population do have suicidal
ideation. Does this not underlie the assumption that if a person has suicidal ideation then
this might trigger an action if the person is exposed to material which makes him/her more
suicidal? Do we have support for this assumption?

Also, the sentence on the prevalence of suicidal ideation might be easier to comprehend if
the percentages were used rather than the absolute values.
Depending on the space available, it would be good to have 1-2 sentences the theoretical
background for the assumed association. This could alternatively be mentioned in the
Discussion.
In addition, in the Method Section it is listed that data extraction took account of method of
suicidal behaviour, it would therefore be good to present an argument why this is thought to
be important (optionally in the Discussion if space is not available in the Introduction). Is
this not a part of the hypotheses of the study?
Pg 9, line 58: does adjusting for seasonal variation fall under ‘adjustment for time effects’
RESULTS:
In the Method Section, the measures ‘rate ratio’ and ‘risk difference’ are introduced. It would
be useful if the text in the remaining part of the manuscript uses the same terminology.
Hereby, the precision of the study’s findings will be better conveyed.
The paragraph re Figure 4 could be shortened and it would be good if the text could
summarize the main finding from the Funnel plots.
A bit of text editing might be beneficial at places in the Method and Result sections; for
instance, line 11 on pay 13: “Four studies examined attempted suicide. Excluding these did
not markedly change the findings.” Could it be rephrased to: “Restricting the analysis to
suicide deaths only did not markedly change the findings”?
APPENDIX;
It would be very useful with a table in the Appendix, which summarized the main features of
the included studies. For instance, in the Result Section, one reads that one study found that
media reporting decreased the risk – but it is not possible from the text to identify which
study this is.
Great study.
