Short summary
Mulrooney et al. studied the temporal changes in the incidence of cardiac events, in which
they compared the 1970â€™s with 1980 and 1990. They found that, particularly, coronary
artery disease was decreased over the past decades, which they attribute to the cardiac
radiation in lymphoma patients.
Major comments
1. The conclusion in the title/abstract/ paper feels wrong since this was only shown in in
CAD not for all cardiac events, and also in Hodgkin Lymphoma survivors.
2. In Turcotte JAMA 2017 it states: because comparison by treatment era is subject to
confounding by attained age, SIRs were calculated stratifying on 10-year age intervals.
Multivariable piecewise-exponential models were used to assess the incidence rate of
subsequent neoplasm types, in association with demographic variables and childhood
cancer diagnosis, adjusting for attained age, treatment doses, and 5-year treatment eras.
Why is time since diagnosis chosen for this study? Do you think the results change if the
timescale would be attained age.
3. It seems that a lot of models were done on the data, was there a correction for multiple
testing?
4. A model with model demographic and modifiable risk factors should be done, since this
is very important in especially in CAD, this could be very informative. The treatment and
maybe incidence also changed over time.
5. The percentage of Hodgkin survivors that received anthracyclines changed dramatically
over time, it seems that instead of giving radiation, they give anthracyclines, this is
probably worth mentioning, since anthracyclines are an important risk factor for cardiac
dysfunction.
Minor comments
1. I did not receive any figures, thus I could not review them.
2. page 6, paragraph 1: siblings (n=5,5057) should probably be n=5,057.
3. page 7, paragraph 2: underweight (<18.5 kilograms per square meter (kg/m2) needs
an extra )
4. page 8, paragraph 2: to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of each,
you already gave the abbreviation of 95% CI, so probably should be to estimate relative
risks and 95% CI of each

5. page 10, paragraph 2: For the overall population, the cumulative incidence of heart
failure (HF) at 15 years from cancer, should be For the overall population, the cumulative
incidence of HF at 15 years from cancer
6. page 10, paragraph 2: how were the incidence compared? from which test is the
p-value?
7. page 10, paragraph 2: For coronary artery disease (CAD) the 20-year incidence
decreased successively across all three decades, should be For CAD the 20-year incidence
decreased successively across all three decades
8. Throughout the paper there are double/triple spaces between sentences.
