This is an important update of the current evidence about stress ulcer prophylaxis for critically ill
patients.
This SR and NMA were conducted according to highest standards and is rather well reported and
interpreted.
I have few minor suggestions/queries for the authors to address.
Minor
1- Abstract
- Objective: The wordings « relative impact » is too vague: relative versus what? Impact on what?

- Results: I would suggest adding the certainty of evidence for mortality, as well. Indeed, this is an
outcome of critical importance.
2- Background
- Last word of first paragraph: replace “antacids” with “anti-acids”
3- Methods
- Search strategy is well described in the appendix. Nevertheless, I’d suggest that readers may find the
lower limit for the dates (I presume, databases were searched from inception?). Also, it is frustrating
that Lilacs was not search as it may help identifying additional trials.
- It is not clear if the reviewers for this SR and NMA have contacted primary authors of eligible trials to
get missing information for study selection, data abstraction and risk of bias assessment.
- The target population is unclear. Did this SR/NMA focus on all critically ill patients regardless location,
or only ICU patients?
- Also, provide reasons for excluding children
- The definition for population at high-risk for bleeding requires some explanation. How were the cut-off,
2%/4%/8% decided?
- Why not being more explicit on the ranking of importance of outcomes? Unclear to me what was the
primary outcome measure?
- Definition of outcomes is also very critical, in particular for the “clinically important bleeding”. This
may explain at least partly the incoherence found in many comparisons for this outcome. One approach
may have been to consider only bleeding that required a specific intervention, i.e. blood transfusion
and/or per-endoscopic of surgical haemostatic procedures.
- I would suggest not pooling “placebo” and “no prophylaxis” and including both as separate
interventions.
- The method section defined precisely how a criterion was judged in terms of risk of bias. However, it
remains unclear how a trial was judged at low versus high risk of bias.
3- Results
- Flow chart: I’d suggest providing number of trials found by each database. Also provide for the 308
records excluded main reasons for exclusion. Finally, the last box should provide the number of trials
available for each outcome, unless all 72 trials contributed to all outcomes.
- Legends for forest plot are missing. In addition, they don’t mention what was the outcome of interest.
- In the list of risk factors, a previous history of gastro-duodenal ulcer is not listed. Literature analysis
did not identify it as risk factor?
- Please provide the number of trials judged at low risk of bias
- Please when you report in the main text the results for a comparison, make sure to consistently report,
number of trials and the level for certainty of evidence. As mortality is an outcome of critical importance,
I suggest that data are reported in the main text, and possibly in abstract too.
