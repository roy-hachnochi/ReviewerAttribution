The systematic review and network meta-analysis on the effects of PPI, histamine-2 receptor
antagonists and sucralfate on the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients apparently
is an update on a previous meta-analysis (ref 8). The update was appropriate because of the publication
of ref 14, which changed the interpretation. That change is important as the new conclusion would
support discontinuation of stress ulcer prophylaxis as standard of care in this patient population. I have
no comments on the methods (to be frankly I didn't have sufficient time to review the search
startegy/results and to critically review the analytical approach).
An important justification to stop using stress ulcer prophylaxis is the possibility that it may increase the
risk of pneumonia. Although the meta-analysis data do support that conclusion, more scrutiny on the
(poor) of many of the underlying data for that endpoint might lead to an even more downgraded
interpretation. There was enormous clinical heterogeneity etween individual studies (in patient
case-maix diagnostic approaches and definitiions used) and most studies were non-blinded for the very
subjective diagnostic criteria of pneumonia. But even without the possibility of increasing pneumonia,
the data are sufficiently convincing to discontinue stress ulcer prophylaxis for many patients.
