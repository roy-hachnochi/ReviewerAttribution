This is an impressive study that looked at the compliance with prospective trial registration.
The strengths of the study are that it included several trial registries and a large sample of
10,050 manuscripts and corresponding registration date, when available.
The authors have done a thorough analysis and addressed most possible limitations All
relevant data are presented in the manuscript and the additional material. They also provide
very valuable and constructive recommendation to all involved in trials and their publication.
I will comment on a few issues that could be addressed in more detail:

1. I am not sure that relaxing the requirements for prospective registration would address
the registration bias described by the authors - if most of the trialists choose to register their
trial after the onset of patient recruitment, it is not because they don't have time or because
it is difficult, but because they can do it without any penalty. WHO and ICMJE clearly ask for
prospective registration and WHO ICTRP database clearly flags prospective records because
it compares two fields - the registration date a enrolment date. Extending the registration
date would leave space for investigators to conduct interim analysis before trial registration.
I'd rather go the way the authors thought would be challenging: introducing the date of
primary outcome data collection.
2. Did the authors look at multiple registration? The ICTRP portal provides the Main ID; but
it would be interesting to see the timing of different registrations.
3. Is it possible to see whether there were changes to the registrations? This is possible in
the CT.gov, and it would be interesting to see whether there are changes to this element
during the trial.
