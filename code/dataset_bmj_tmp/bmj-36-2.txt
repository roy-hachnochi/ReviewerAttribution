In most cases, the authors have answered to my comments.
I still have concerns regarding this paper, mainly the overall hypothesis (as I mentioned in
the first review, comparing two different fixation techniques) as well as the interpretation
of the results (QOL and enterotomies which are not statistically different when comparing
the two groups). In my view it is up to the editor to decide whether or not the concerns I
have raised should impact on the final decision regarding this paper.
I have the following minor comments in addition:
Regarding the mix of primary and incisional hernias: This should be further commented on
in the discussion. One paper to consider citing (or another with the same focus): Hernia.
2019 Oct;23(5):831-845. doi: 10.1007/s10029-019-02033-4. Epub 2019 Sep 23. Pooled
data analysis of primary ventral (PVH) and incisional hernia (IH) repair is no more
acceptable: results of a systematic review and metanalysis of current literature.
In the results section it is stated, that “Although inadvertent enterotomies were not initially
considered within secondary outcomes as none were anticipated for our trial, we decided to
include them as one of the secondary results due to the clinical significance of these
findings.”
I disagree with the inclusion of these outcomes. Further, there was no statistically
significant differences between the two compared groups, and the ”clinical significance”
noted is of less use in my view.
Also in the results: “[…] AW-QOL, despite not statistically significant, demonstrated
clinically important differences.” I disagree with this approach and I think the authors
should stick to the statistical analysis, which shows no siginificant differences.
If the authors choose to keep these outcomes in the paper, I would suggest the two above
considerations to be moved to the methods section.
