Re: Development and reliability of an instrument to evaluate the credibility of anchor-based
minimally important difference estimates for patient reported outcomes
I have read the revised paper and answers from authors. Some of my questions from the
previous review still remain, primarily on the methods and the results. Therefore, several
questions below are the same as in my first review of this manuscript.
Title:
• Title says development and reliability of an instrument but the development. I still have
difficulties assessing how the instrument was actually developed but I agree the authors
have tested the instrument.
Abstract:
• Under heading design, it is said that the results were on the basis of a literature review.
Still unclear how this literature review was used, more than the steering committee using
experts’ knowledge.
Methods:
• The second paragraph in Methods describes another paper, systematic review on MIDs.
These two papers get mixed up and it is unclear how the work on this current study was
performed. The quoted paper is submitted and not published.
• Item generation: please add clear description of inclusion criteria for the included papers.
Were there any exclusion criteria?
• Item generation was based on a search but information about the search is still missing.
How many articles were screened?
• Please include the data extraction form in the manuscript.
• The authors used own experience, when they developed initial criteria – still this to be
better described.
Results:
• In results it is said that 41 relevant MID method articles were found but it is not clearly
described how they were used in the study and how many papers were screened. I still
recommend to describe inclusion and exclusion criteria and a flow chart.
• I am also unsure that all relevant papers in this topic have been assessed. The authors
say Cosby et al 2003 (a methods paper discussing how to define and measure clinically
meaningful change including use of anchors) was included but I cannot find it among the
included papers or in the reference list. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here?
• These 41 resulting articles are not described and it is very unclear how data were
extracted from them, only saying that they “informed the item generation stage of
instrument development.” How criteria were actually developed is not described.
The core criteria:

• Will an unprecise MID have a good credibility score in a sample of 200 and above?
• Item 5 is part of the MID definition. I still don’t think the authors should use a part of the
MID definition in their instrument and require researchers to ask for permission to use it. If
not a MID is assessed, then this instrument has no use. Why not say item 5 is an inclusion
criteria for assessing credibility of an anchor-based MID?
• Overall judgment of credibility: why is this an instrument?
Discussion:
• Could items with different response options give different scores – please mention in
Discussion.
• I still do not find the detailed examples easy to understand or to use. How should I
interpret answers? How can I compare quality between studies?
