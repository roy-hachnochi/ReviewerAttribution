This is a highly important manuscript examining the potential risks of duloxetine exposure
in pregnancy conducted by an outstanding group of investigators. The manuscript is
thoughtful and well written and easily understood despite a complicated study design. The
authors use appropriate methods and control for multiple confounding variables including
confounding by indication. The discussion is also thoughtful and the authors are thorough
in their discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of their study. Finally the authors do
an outstanding job of interpreting the data and balancing the risks of exposure to
duloxetine to the risks of untreated psychiatric illness and/or pain in pregnancy. Well done!
