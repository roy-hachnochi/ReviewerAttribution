The authors have appropriately responded to reviewer critiques taking into account space limitations and
limits on the number of references, which precluded a deeper exploration of some of the key issues
raised by reviewers. A few very minor comments to address:
1) The editors recommended bringing in a temporal argument and emphasizing that structural drivers
are the most important obstacles to achieving gender equality. Their response did not really get at that
point, nor did it address the editors question about what it will take to progress change, and on what
timescale. Their sentence (page 3, lines 9-11) focuses instead broadly on the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs), without clarifying which ones they are focusing on, and how realization of specific SDGs
impacts adolescent health.
2) I suggest the authors do a careful proof reading, as there are minor editorial errors throughout which
were distracting, including extra commas, extra letters (e.g. page 9, line 2), extra periods (e.g. page 3,
line 8), missing parentheses (e.g. page 10, line 7) and other minor issues.
