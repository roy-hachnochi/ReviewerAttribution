Main points:
The original version of this paper is that it contained too much spin. The intervention only
demonstrated a small benefit and emphasis was more focussed on the economic
evaluation. As the intervention was low-cost, the authors were able to demonstrate that
this would reach the thresholds for adoption by NICE in the UK, and forms part of a UK
wide health priority goal which is being implemented. In the revision, much of this spin
has now been removed, such that the HE analysis does not overshadow the efficacy
benefits.
The protocol was published in July 2016 (Trials), and they do mention some health
economics in this - recruitment began about this time, so I think the HE evaluation was
always planned in this study (the protocol certainly also contained well known Health
Economists).
This trial was well done, it’s now much better reported, transparent and balanced – we can
tell what they did and it is important for UK policy at least.
