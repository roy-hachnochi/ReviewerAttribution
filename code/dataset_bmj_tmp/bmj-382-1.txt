The authors examined the associations between habitual fish oil supplementation and
cardiovascular disease and mortality risk in a large population-based prospective cohort
study.
The authors found that habitual fish oil supplementation was inversely associated the risk of
all-cause mortality, CVD mortality and incident CVD events. They also found that this
association appeared to be stringer among people with prevalent hypertension. In general,
this is a well-written paper and provide a strong evidence regarding the benefits of fish oil
use for the prevention of CVD outcomes and risk reduction of all-cause mortality. A few
recommendations are made to strengthen the paper:
1. Page 6, Introduction: As you know, a large-scale randomized controlled trial provides the
best evidence. There needs to be a justification for the need of large-scale prospective
cohort study to clarify the current uncertainty regarding the benefits of fish oil.
2. Page 10, Analyses: It is not clear the difference between ‘Asian’ and ‘Chinese’ as an
ethnicity category.
3. Page 16 Discussion: The authors can describe which omega-3 PUFAs (EPA, DHA, EPA and
DHA) might be beneficial to CVD outcome or all-cause mortality. A recent RCT REDUCE-IT
showed that 4g EPA-ethylester supplementation reduced the risk of major CVD events. This
should be addressed in the discussion.
