I think this is a well designed study which merits publication. The authors (rightly) do not
overstate the clincial significance of their findings. There is an appropriate dissection of the
weaknesses of the study. I would suggest only a few alterations:
Table 4.1 should include the statistical analyses comparing the variables between fish oil
users and non fish oil users.
I can see comment in the methods of controlling for socioeconomic status using post code
data but I cannot see where these data are presented.
It would seem that fish oil users are (with the exception of age) already in a lower risk group
for cardiovascular events: more active, female, non smokers and on secondary prevention.
It is plausible to suggest that, already health conscious, these individuals are attempting to
further lower their risk by taking fish oil and may be taking further, unknown, measures.
Whilst the authors acknowledged that there may be other factors that they have not
recognised they could perhaps highlight the stronger possibility of this given their results.
The authors should also acknowledge that although statistically significant the clinical
significance of their results may be substantially less.
