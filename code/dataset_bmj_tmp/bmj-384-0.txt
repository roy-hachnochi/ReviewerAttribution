The interesting systematic review and meta-analysis by Yan et al evaluated the prognosis
of unrecognized myocardial infarction (UMI) determined by electrocardiogram (UMI-ECG)
or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (UMI-CMR). This is the first meta-analysis in the
field of UMI. The paper provided a lot of important, novel information for screening cardiac
ischemia in asymptomatic individuals. These findings are not only important for
cardiologists, but also have important public health implications. I have some suggestions
for revision.
1. Abstract: Results: Thirty-one studies…., should be ‘thirty studies’ according to the main
text.
2. The literature search was up to 30 June 2019. When reviewing this study, I also
searched the Pubmed, and found the following paper published online on 2019 Jul 10.
(Vähätalo JH et al. Association of Silent Myocardial Infarction and Sudden Cardiac Death.
JAMA Cardiol. 2019 Jul 10. doi: 10.1001/jamacardio.2019.2210). Do you considered to
updated the search and whether the paper by Vähätalo JH et al can be included for
meta-analysis?
3. Statistical analysis: What is the base for the log RRs when combined the data by the
inverse variance approach?
4. How to combine the reported relative risks using different metrics (eg. HR, RR, and OR)
in different studies?
5. For subgroup analysis, why the follow-up duration was devided at 6 years, not at 5 years
or 10 years?
6. The reference group for comparison was individuals without MI. In the text, it is defined
as “no MI” or “non-MI”, please keep consistent.
7. Results: UMI-CMR and health outcomes: “Each 1% and 10% increase in late gadolinium
enhancement was associated with a 9% and 77% increase in MACEs, respectively”. I think
these results are not needed. In this study, the main purpose was to explore whether
UMI-ECG or UMI-CMR is associated with a poorer prognosis in terms of CVD and mortality
than the absence of MI, and this was clearly answered by the meta-data with comparing
with vs without UMI.
