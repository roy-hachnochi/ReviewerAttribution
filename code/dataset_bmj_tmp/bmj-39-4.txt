This manuscript is well written and structured. It assesses the comparative effectiveness of
biologics in RA patients based on the current definitions of clinical disease activity index
and low disease activity. I commend the authors for obtaining individual patient data for
CDAI reanalysis as this highlights the need for routine availability of individual patient data
for further research.

More comments about the comparison with other studies are needed. The authors discuss
how different their methods are but do not discuss how their findings align with those of
other NMAs of biologics in RA.
