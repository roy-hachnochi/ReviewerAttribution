The authors have worked hard on the changes suggested by the seven reviewers and, the article has
substantially improved.
I believe that the new section provided (supplementary text S1) which describes their statistical
methods in detail can be very helpful to the reader to understand how the study is done and the quality
of it.
I also find that the introduction and discussion has improved with all the changes and new references
suggested by the reviewers.
I don't have any more comments that could improve the article therefore I suggest to accept the article.
