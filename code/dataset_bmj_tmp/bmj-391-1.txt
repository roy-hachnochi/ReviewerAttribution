As a lay reviewer I found this to be an interesting paper, which has clearly involved a large
team both from the academic institution in the USA and on the ground in Guinea-Bissau. It
was noted that approximately 90% of the children received over 75 % of the planned
interventions. The results suggest that the multicomponent formula NEWSUP had
significant benefits on working memory and other criteria measured during the course of
the study in the younger children (under 4 years of age). However, given that there was
such a large number of components in the NEWSUP compared with the FBF or the
traditional breakfast formula, it would (as the authors indeed allude to) be difficult to
pinpoint those which might be of greatest benefit going forward. Given that the cost of
providing enhanced nutritional formulations to a population such as this would be a major
issue, it is difficult to see that there can be any short-term benefit to the public health

nutrition of such communities. There would need to be more detailed evaluation of
individual nutrients or perhaps smaller groups of such, although no doubt the findings could
also be used to influence nutrition patterns in wealthier countries or communities where
unhealthy diets are prevalent for different social reasons.
The sentence on page 11, lines 29-31 referring to 'there was additional social education'
appeared to read incorrectly - should this not be 'there was no additional social education'?
In summary, although this is interesting, I would question a) what it adds in specific
knowledge other than corroborating the concept that improvement intake of a wide range
of essential and other nutrients leads to improved health outcomes in small children, and b)
what the impact of this research will be on the communities where it was undertaken.
