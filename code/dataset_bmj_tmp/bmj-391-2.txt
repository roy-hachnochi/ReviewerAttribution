Manuscript title: Effects of food supplementation on cognitive function, cerebral blood flow
and nutritional health in young children at risk of undernutrition
Comments: Child undernutrition remains a major health issue worldwide and it causes
irreversible damage to the cognitive development of child. This paper brings out an
important information on effect of multi component supplementary food and traditionally
fortified blended food on cognitive function, cerebral blood flow and health status of
children aged 15 months to 7 years of age. In this context, the study found that change in
working memory was observed in a group of children â‰¤3.9 years who were supplemented
with specific food constituents as compared with the group of children consumed traditional
fortified blended food and control group. Although I really appreciate and recommend the
paper for publication, the author may consider the following suggestions:
1. I think it would be helpful to include nutritional status in stead of nutritional health in the
title of the manuscript.
2. It has been observed that somewhere ITT population and somewhere intent to treat
analysis mentioned in sub heads. The author may maintain similarity in all subheadings.
3. Abbreviations can be mentioned before the acknowledgements.
