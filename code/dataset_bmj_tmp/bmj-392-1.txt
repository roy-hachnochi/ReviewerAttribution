Well written, well conducted.
A few comments:
1. I'm not sure the secondary outcome of whether guidelines refer to overdiagnosis is
strong enough to justify publication.
2. I am very curious about the note for Table 1 reference to an outlier individual who
received $240 million. Surely this warrants discussion in the body of the paper.
3. I find it incredible that APA is at the bottom of the list. In previous work, psychiatrists
have rivalled cardiologists. I think this is worthy of comment.
4. Is the term 'primary outcome' being misused? ordinarily I would expect one or two. The
secondary outcomes are in fact a different study altogether rather than secondary
measures of the first research question(s).
5. There is a discrepancy between how the primary outcomes are set out in the protocol
vs paper, but I don't think there is any significant change in meaning.
6. Worth commenting that women seemed slightly less likely to be entangled?
