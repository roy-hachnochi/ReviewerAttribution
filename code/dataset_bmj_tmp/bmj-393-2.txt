The study is generally well conducted and I congratulate the authors on accomplishing a
huge task. However, concerns remain about how authors ascertain point prevalence of
neck pain from the primary studies. Could this be seriously influenced by reporting bias?
Secondly, it would be good to see sub group analyses based on the causes of neck pain,
especially as neck pain as a result of trauma will differ between countries and would be
influenced by issues related to road safety and high risk occupation policies.
This will help to make the right inferences about what needs to be done to reduce neck
pain prevalence.
