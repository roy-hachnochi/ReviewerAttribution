<b>Summary of manuscript and general recommendation:</b>

This study analyzed promotion and tenure guidelines from an international sample of
universities, focusing on those with biomedical sciences faculties. The authors first
identified a number of relevant evaluation criteria they classify as either traditional or
progressive, and then searched the documents to determine if these criteria were present
and whether they were applied quantitatively. The authors found differences across
continents in terms of availability of promotion and tenure documents, as well as the
criteria used. They also found that across the board traditional criteria are more widely
used than progressive ones. I consider that the manuscript has the following strengths:
<p>
<b>1. Contributes knowledge to an important area of research: </b>Exploring how faculty
are evaluated for promotion and tenure is key to understanding the current incentives that
may be shaping science and contributing to poor reproducibility and lack of adoption of
open research practices. To date, there have been very few studies systematically
analyzing review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) guidelines from universities to determine
which criteria are being used to evaluate faculty and how. Thus, this study has the
potential to make a significant positive contribution to the literature.

<b>2. Global representation in the sample of universities:</b> I collaborate on a study
analyzing RPT documents. However, our sample is limited to the US and Canada. To my
knowledge, this study by the current authors is the first to analyze RPT documents from
additional countries on several continents.

<b>3. Provides examples of how criteria are being used quantitatively:</b> The authors
not only looked at whether specific criteria were present in the RPT guidelines, but also
explored if and in what ways these criteria were applied quantitatively in evaluations.
Appendix 4 provides good examples from different documents and shows the range of
quantitative ‘thresholds’.
</p>
<p>Despite the above strengths, I believe this manuscript can be improved in a number of
ways before publication in BMJ. In addition to the suggestions below, I have included in my
review an annotated version of the manuscript with more specific suggestions.</p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation: Minor revisions</b> (Note: While I am suggesting a number of
changes, I think they all should be relatively quick and easy to address.)

<b>MAJOR COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS:

</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>1. Please consider changing the title of the article:</b> I feel like the title is slightly
misleading, but also underselling the study a bit. It currently reads, “Academic criteria for
promotion and tenure in faculties of biomedical sciences: a cross sectional analysis of 146
universities”. However, the analysis of criteria was only done for 92 universities for which
documents were available. In addition, this is an international sample with universities
from multiple continents. This is a strength of the study, which is not mentioned at all in
the title. I think the authors should consider changing the title to reflect these
considerations. Maybe change to: “Academic criteria for promotion and tenure in
biomedical sciences faculties: a cross-sectional analysis of an international sample of
universities”, or something similar.

<b>2. Please clarify methodological details:</b> In reading through the methods section,
I was a little unclear on exactly how the data was extracted from the promotion and tenure
documents. Was there a set of terms the authors searched for related to each criterion, or
did they just read each document and decide on a case-by-case basis if the text was
sufficiently close to the concept in question? If terms were used, what were there? Many of
the 12 criteria, especially those the authors consider progressive, are discussed with
sometimes widely varying language, which might make these mentions harder to find.
Adding a few lines to clarify these methodological details would help the reader better
understand what was done.

<b>3. Please add sample sizes to tables:</b> In going through the tables, I found it a
little confusing and potentially misleading that the sample sizes are not included for the
different groups. Specifically, it made it hard to understand what was the sample size used
to calculate the percentages, which changes both within and between tables. For example,
in Table 1 the percentages in the first two rows indicate percentage of the total, while the
percentages in the subsequent rows indicate percentage with respect to that continent or
human development index. So the sample size used to calculate the percentage changes,
but is not indicated in the table. Of course the reader can calculate these or go back to the
text, but it would be easier and more transparent to have the information provided next to
each group. Also, considering the sample sizes for South America and Africa, these might
be removed (see next point).

<b>4. Please consider removing South America and Africa from analysis of criteria:</b> I
think it is questionable whether South America and Africa should be included in the
analysis, considering how few documents there are (i.e., only 1 available for each
continent). You really cannot conclude anything concrete with only 1 document available
for analysis, and that 1 document should not be considered representative of an entire
continent. Including these continents makes the study look like it had broader global
representation than it actually did. I think the study is still strong even with removing
these from the analysis, as the global representation is still greater than any previous
study to my knowledge.

<b>5. Please consider the language used to classify criteria:</b> The authors classify the
criteria they studied as either traditional or progressive. I think traditional is fine, but I am
not sure about the use of the term ‘progressive’, which implies a value judgement that
these criteria are somehow better than traditional ones (they may be, but that is not the
focus of the study). In particular, I question calling two of the criteria placed in that
category ‘progressive’, namely citations and accommodations for extenuating

circumstances. With respect to citations, I think the authors’ reasoning is that the use of
article-level metrics is much less common and arguably better than journal-level metrics.
However, citation counting seems to me to still be a pretty traditional measure in many
ways. Calling it progressive might reinforce use of things like the H-index, etc. I wonder,
would the results change, and if so how, if citations were included under traditional criteria
instead?

With respect to accommodations for extenuating circumstances, I think many universities
and countries have rules/laws about providing such accommodations. Even if that’s not the
case, this seems like a very basic requirement for ensuring gender equality, good working
conditions, etc. Calling such accommodations progressive almost sounds to me like
rewarding people for doing the minimum they should be required to do. I don’t necessarily
have a good suggestion for rewording, but I encourage the authors to think if there is
another term that could be used here. At least I would ask that the authors add a few lines
on why these two items (citations and accommodations) in particular were included under
progressive criteria.

<b>MINOR COMMENTS:</b>
</p>
<p>
Throughout the manuscript I have left comments where I think the authors could elaborate
on some points, add key references, or reword certain statements. There are also some
minor grammatical issues, typos, missing words, etc. that I have marked in the annotated
pdf. Please review these comments and make changes as necessary.
</p>
<p>
<b>Summary:</b>
In sum, I think this manuscript is interesting and could make a great contribution to the
literature on academic evaluation if several aspects are strengthened. I recommend minor
revisions and would ask the authors to respond to the suggestions discussed here, as well
as those on the annotated manuscript I’ve included with my review.
