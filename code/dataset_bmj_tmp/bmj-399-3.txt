It's an important topic but I have ta few problems with this paper: 1) it's very UK
focused (that may be fine - it's an editorial decision), 2) the questions it seeks to
answer aren't very clear, 3) the intended audience isn't clear - is this for GPs,
policymakers, industry, patients or others?, 4) the bit about non-medical online
stuff at the beginning is cheesy and I think detracts from the importance of the
main message - and it wastes words, 5) it's a bit too unidisciplinary (two senior
GPs and a patient) - I'd be inclined to bring on a big data expert as a coauthor.
However, some very good points are made and I think with a second bite at the
cherry this could be a very important paper. I suggest replace the intro bit with a
clear and punchy paragraph on why this all matters. By the way see my review of
Louise Fitzgerald's book in BJGP recently - she showed persuasively that disruptive
innovation is just what the NHS doesn't need.
