This is a well written and thoughtful paper. There is indeed a need for documenting
the monitoring systems being used to measure EMTCT.
I have several concerns
1. I do not see the benefit of the comparison with MNTE in this paper. The within
text comparison with MNTE is under-developed . Given that MNTE was the first
perinatally transmitted disease targetted for elimination----what are the lessons
learnt in its tracking/monitoring towards elimination that HIV can borrow. The fact
that the elimination agenda for both is largely aspirational, could have been
sufficiently articulated without the need to compare with Tetanus
2. is the express goal of the paper to document that elimination of perinatally
acquired infection is not possible?
3. the authors did not sufficiently address the three indicators important to establish
whether a disease can be eliminated or eradicated. This is introduced in the first
paragraph in the introduction but subsequently is not alluded to, even though it
appears that the express opinion of the authors is that elimination is not possible.
4. In the section talking about the complexities of eliminating MTCT--the paragraph
starts off by discussing MNTE. This is the first in-text comparison to MTCT --the
heading should be changed to reflect this. Part of the challenge with this section--is
that a lot of the information is in the tables and not expressed clearly within the
body of the paper.
