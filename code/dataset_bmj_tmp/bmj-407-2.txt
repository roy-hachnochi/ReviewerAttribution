i think this paper is important, and should be published. it is highlighting the
disjuncture between the current and forthcoming EU regulations on clinical trials,
and those in the US and CIOMS, whereby the EU regulations will prevent the
conduct of individually randomized, low risk drug and other treatment trials, which
are aiming at a) comparative effectiveness and b) high degree of pragmatism, i.e.,
trying hard to replicate the real world and increase potential for applicability. While

the EU regulations require informed and written consent for randomization, the
other regulators do not require this, and permit, where required for practicality,
waiver of consent. the EU regulations do and will undermine conduct of real world
low risk comparative effectiveness pharmaceutical trials in Europe.
the authors should consider explicitly citing research which demonstrates that
traditional long form written consent procedures jeopardize the
applicability/generalisability of randomized trials, as this is a key element in their
argument. also, since the main idea is that the EU regulations should be made
compatible with the CIOMS and US regulations, it might be worth saying more about
these preferred approaches to regulating consent, maybe even citing some sources
which explain how that more liberal and practical approach came about and which
ethical risks it was thought to create, if any, and how those were minimized.
in general, i think that the rationale is convincing, based simply on low risk,
practicality and social need, but could be made much more coherently. i have tried
to do so by editing the document in ms-word, with track changes. i am happy to
email my suggested edits- there are quite a lot of suggestions for edits, if the
editors and authors would like to see them, but it would take much too long for me
to use this text box to describe and locate them.
