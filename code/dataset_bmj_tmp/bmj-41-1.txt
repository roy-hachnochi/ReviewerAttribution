The most important problems I have with this manuscript:
1. it is unclear how these patients were selected from the large population that was infected
and symptomatic. Which patients came to the hospital and which ones were admitted to the
isolation ward of the hospital, as compared to those who were not admitted. Was the
selection merely done on the basis of a minimum set of symptoms, did frailty play a role?
Was each patient selected following the same criteria? Did non-medical factors play a role?
2. When were the symptoms and test results measured and where they measured in all
patients, irrespective of patient characteristics or course of disease? It seems logical that
when a patient's condition deteriorates, more tests are done, who will often have a worse
result than in patients who have a better course of disease. If all measurements were taken
directly at admission in all patients, irrespective of disease severity, one could perhaps look
at predictive values that could be interesting for the management of isolation wards who use
the same admission criteria?
3.There were other recent papers who already reported characteristics of severely ill patients
with the novel virus, for instance Wang et al, JAMA, February 2020.
Perhaps it would have been interesting for intensive care professionals to read a description
of course of disease in these fatal cases, comparing course of disease with the literature on
patients with very severe (fatal) pneumonia from other causes?
