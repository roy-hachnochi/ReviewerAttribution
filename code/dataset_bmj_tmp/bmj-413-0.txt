Summary comment.
Thank you for the invitation to review this paper. I have given detailed comments below.
In summary, I think the topic of this paper is one of the most pressing topics in medicine
today – how to harness the best of new technologies – genomics/big data – without
making the problem of too much medicine worse. However, I feel the paper needs revision
to make it clearer and sharper.
Given the enthusiasm for the new Big Data/Precision Medicine approach from many
sectors – researchers, industry, government – I think the (counterintuitive) arguments
about its dangers need to be as clear and sharp and simple and compelling as possible. I
think this paper contains these arguments, but they could be communicated in a clearer
and more compelling way.
On “the importance and relevance of the topic to a general readership":
I think the topic of this paper – big data/precision medicine and risk of overdiagnosis – is
vitally important and relevant to a general BMJ readership.

On whether the article covers the topic well, and in some depth:
I think the paper covers the topic well and in some depth – and offers very valuable
insights. However, I think the paper in its current form is not as clear as it could be- and
would benefit from a revision focussing on clarity, simplicity and flow of arguments.
On whether the authors make their case well, either through reasoned argument or
through drawing reasonable inferences from available data:
I think the paper makes its case well, but its arguments would be strengthened through
more clarity.
BMJ comment: Analysis articles aim to stimulate discussion, raise debate, and air
controversies so it doesn’t matter if the author is presenting a one sided view so long as
he or she is making a reasonable case and acknowledges the opposing view
I think that the paper could say a little more about the potential positives of the big
data/precision medicine approach – in order to strengthen the arguments it makes.
I have a few small specific comments – really just examples of where I think the paper
could benefit from more clarity.

Comments
Page 1 L 33 to Page 2 L14 – These three separate paragraphs could be combined into one
strong punchy opening paragraph that encapsulates the argument of this piece. The
current middle paragraph could be made a little clearer and shorter, and integrated into
the first and third. Ideally the final sentence of this new opening paragraph could hint at
why and how the new approach will aggravate overdiagnosis.
Page 3
The section titles “A new era of overdiagnosis”. I suggest opening with the definitions of
overdiagnosis in one paragraph (currently the second paragraph) and then explaining in
the second paragraph how the big-data/precision medicine approach will make it worse –
referring to the figure/s. Also- I am unsure whether Figure 1 is needed in main body of
text at that point – perhaps it could appear a little later. Figure 2 could become Figure 1.
Page 5/6
The section currently titled “The steps towards overdiagnosis” . I find the material on page
6 a little too complex and confusing and I wonder whether it could be presented more
clearly and simply. Also the line: “Below, we first consider the effects of screening 2.0 on
the second and third of these points and then the first and fourth” seems unnecessarily
complicated and could be made clearer and more chronological.
Page 7
The two subheads could be combined into 1.
Page 8, Line 6 . It feels there are too many questions as sentences in the piece at present.
Page 8, L 11-16. I feel you need to add another sentence or two into the main body of
the text explaining the meaning of Figure 3. Also, I feel the on-line application probably
needs some text on its webpage explaining exactly how and why it works.
Page 8 – L19. I find the wording here slightly confusing. It currently reads “ To avoid a
tsunami of overdiagnosis, screening 2.0 is premised on..” Do you mean to say something
like “ To avoid a tsunami of overdiagnosis, screening 2.0 would have to meet the
extraordinary challenge of accurately predicting which….” ?
Page 9, L 48 - …….can you say a little more about an example of the improvement of
predictive values?
Page 11 L 26 – Might be good to have mentioned somewhere before this point, that there
may be examples where big-data approaches maybe able to reduce overdiagnosis.
Page 11, L 35 – I don’t understand what is meant by “fine-masked net”
Page 12, L 29- . You may want to say a few more words about the form of such a long
term prognostic study – in simple clear terms what would it mean – perhaps using an
example …eg “To be sure that detection of any given “abnormality” would be justified, a
study would need to investigate the natural history of that “abnormality” …..etc”
Key messages- 4th point. I think this point could be addressed somehow in the closing
paragraph/s – perhaps authors could spell out or suggest how regulatory frameworks
(HTA for example) currently assessing new technological approaches to screening and
testing and treatment might start to make the risk of overdiagnosis (and overuse) more of
a priority in their assessments.
