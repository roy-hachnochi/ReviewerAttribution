There is currently a major push for "big data" with limited questioning of the potential
downsides of this approach. Undoubtedly there are major potential benefits, but as
someone who has championed person-centred care and shared decision making, I find the
use of the term "personalised medicine" in this context to be problematic.
Nonetheless there are real opportunities, for example to understand the variation in
outcomes and response to treatment in specific diseases in representative populations.
This paper focuses on the risks of overdiagnosis in the context of using big data for
screening purposes. The authors offer a challenging and well thought through counter to
the over-optimism of big data in this context. However, they also offer potential methods
to limit the future problem through expounding the need for big longitudinal studies to
explore the predictive quality of the approach in terms of future morbidity/mortality. This
would in itself be a long term commitment and I share the authors limited optimism on
this happening when the drive for prevention and big data is so high.
I think the paper could also be strengthened by some discussion of the well recognised
Wilson-Junger criteria for screening programmes; the sort of criteria that are used by, for
example, the UK National Screening Committee to determine whether to recommend
implementation of national programmes or not (and even some of those implemented also
lead to over diagnosis despite such robust consideration).
I doubt big data preventive screening would be supported by the application of such
criteria .
In summary, I believe this is an important paper raising issues of considerable importance
that could be further improved by reference to current tried and tested methods of
evaluating the potential of screening programmes
