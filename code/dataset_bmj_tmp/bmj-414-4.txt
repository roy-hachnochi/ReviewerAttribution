An interesting and thought provoking article. Clear explanation of the legal position and its uncertainties
with regard to duty of candour and apology protection. It raises appropriate technical/legal questions,
although this may be more of an academic matter than one directly relevant to clinical practice where
overall it is best for communication with patients to be open and honest (including an appropriate
apology) which is more likely to resolve matters swiftly, than for doctors to be concerned about the
potential risks of doing so. I can of course only comment in this regard on the UK and appreciate this
article will have a wider international audience where concerns about insurance etc may be more vaild.
