The article is meaningful to patient community as it presents analysis in the domain where very few
papers of this kind exist and where public access to such information is not accessible. Table 1 and Table
2 is informative and educating and is good reference for future research on the topic. 4
recommendations provided in page 10 to improve NTAP program are well reasoned and are the
highlights of the paper.
However, in order to further improve the quality of the paper following suggestions shall be considered:
1. More examples of "pay for performance" / "outcome based pricing" should be referenced at page 10
after Reference 21 (various articles on case studies used in NICE, SMC, IQWIG, HAS are published and
easily identifiable via pubmed).
2. More contextual information on other healthcare systems outside of US should be mentioned by
identifying whether they are using similar approach to appraising new technologies. Reference 2 is not
sufficient to understand whether US model is very different or it is related in the context of comparing
HTA appraisals for new technologies (as medical aid measures, medical devices, medicinal products all
are classified as "health technologies").
3. The paper should answer, what barriers do patients in the USA face if they want to access approved
New Technologies via Add-on Payments (is it in general covered by insurance bodies or it varies from
one insurer to other).
4. The authors should discuss whether mobile health apps, health software used to manage health
conditions would fall within the scope NTAPs. If not, what program is meant to cover costs of such
technologies within USA. If yes, provide contextual information whether such technologies have been
submitted for review and why they have not been approved (as they are not included in Table 1). E.g. in
Canada certain health apps / software have been reimbursed by provincial insurance bodies since 2015.
