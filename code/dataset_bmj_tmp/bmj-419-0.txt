This editorial / commentary provides an excellent summary of the global evidence
on factors that drive provider performance, and the effectiveness of a range of
strategies to improve quality of care delivered by healthcare providers. I enjoyed
reading this editorial a lot, and think it is very timely and insightful.
The authors have, in my opinion, organized and summarized the evidence very
clearly and I don't have much to add. One minor suggestion - the title of the essay
“Universal Health Coverage: The Evidence on Incentives for Physicians” seems to be
a bit misleading. The essay is about provider motivation and strategies to improve
performance / quality of care delivered by healthcare providers (and it is an
excellent review on the topic!). Perhaps it might be better to use a title that focuses
on this aspect, which is considerably broader than incentives.
