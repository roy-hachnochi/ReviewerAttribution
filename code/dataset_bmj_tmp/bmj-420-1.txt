In light of the recent debates about medicine prices and their impact on public
health, and the underlying debate about the entire system of intellectual property
and international trade regulations around the world make this a timely and topical
piece. It’s publication is clearly recommended and beneficial for the discourse
happening.
A few comments:
First, I think it is the right thing to do that patient experts review the article so that
a different point of view from the pharmacoeconomic is reflected.
p.1 27-31 - The article applies an - understandably - technocratic view on our
current knowledge on medicine pricing. It acknowledges but fails to discuss the
perceptions about medicine prices and related access issues in the general public
(p.2 3). While considering (and then dismissing) marketing costs in setting the price
of a medicine (p.3 44 and further), it does not consider that the tolerance of the
public for accepting a price point is also a determining factor, albeit soft and
psychological.
p.1 40 - The authors admit that ethical perspectives also play a role in the pricing of
medicines. Then they do not consider this any further. I suggest an additional paper
perhaps that focusses more on this. Such an approach would need to consider other
factors that also explore more the nature, costs and benefits of the current global
intellectual property regulatory regimes (p.3 17-18) and the systems of global trade
agreements.
p.3 18 and onwards - The paper reassuringly and rightly references the seminal
work of A. Hill on what we know (and what we DON’T know) about how medicine
prices are set. However, there seems to be a contradiction between what we know
from Hill’s work, namely that the biggest price increasing factor in medicine prices is
not the research and development cost but the profit margins applied by companies
(cf. chart p.7 7-24).
p.4 42-46 - The WHO definition of affordability indeed refers to the payer’s
resources. It would make sense to point out that most pharmaceutical companies
(or suppliers) don’t consider this but build their pricing strategies on the GDP or per
capita income brackets of countries or entire regions. Moreover, companies don’t
apply any standard scale or measure to classify countries and regions, so one
country may end up being low income for one and middle income for the other.
p.9 9-15 - I suggest that saying out clearly that there is a painful lack of
transparency throughout the entire system would benefit the paper. This is now
suggested in the Conclusions, and I don’t see any harm in being clearer.
All in all, a very good piece that we will be able to use in patient advocacy as well as
continued work in civil society around medicine access and affordability.
