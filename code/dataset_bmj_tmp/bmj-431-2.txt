This is a cohort study conducted in both the UK CPRD and in the Taiwan national database (NHIRD) to
assess the association between 5ARIs and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Specifically,
the authors investigated whether exposure to dutasteride or finasteride (5ARIs) increased the risk of
T2DM compared to exposure to Tamsulosin, (an alpha blocker), all used to treat BPH. Generally, the
studies were well conducted but I have concerns about the writing, and the presentation and
interpretation of the results. See specific comments below.
Introduction
Some of the wording is awkward. Examples:
Page 6, line30 sentence starting “5aR1 is more widely distributed…” It is not clear what they are saying
in this sentence.
Page 6, Line 44 “but did not compare finasteride” (to what?)
Page 7 Lines 8-12: In the last sentence of the introduction it is not clear what the authors are comparing
to tamsulosin use: are they comparing the risk T2DM in users of dutasteride and finasteride separately
to tamsulosin? Are they comparing the risk of T2DM between dutasteride and finasteride? It is important
to express the goal of the study clearly.
Methods
What is a discovery cohort? How is this different from the population in the database?
Page 8, Line 21 generalisable to the whole what?
Page 10 line 23; You need to define baseline and index date.
Page 11, line17. What is meant by: 3 million random samples were used?
Page 11, line 19: “Criteria… were as CPRD.” This is not a complete sentence. In general the writing
needs to be improved throughout the paper. It is apparent that it was not written by a native English
speaker and it is often hard to follow.

Page 11, line20-23; “Use of finasteride and dutasteride required expert reviews…” What does that
mean? The meaning of the next sentence is also unclear.
Results
In the first paragraph of the results, the author say that 39,005 patients were included in the CPRD
study population after exclusions: 8231 (dutasteride), 30,774 (finasteride) and 16,270 (tamsulosin).
These do not add up to 39,005, so authors should be clear that some patients were exposed to more
than one study drug.
Page 14 lines 27-33. The text says the risk of developing T2DM... but was not different between them.
Please be more specific about what is meant by “not different between them.”
The propensity score matched results in the CPRD analysis are based on only around 24% of the full
study population. This should be noted in the text with some explanation and discussion of the
implications of conducting the analysis in such a small proportion of the full study population. Why was it
difficult to find matched controls for so many cases?
Would it be more informative to restrict the study population to patients without strong risk factors for
T2DM? Such as obesity and hypertension? Then you could assess the risk of T2DM among a healthier
population of finasteride, dutasteride and tamsulosin users. This analysis might reduce some of the
concerns of bias and confounding.
Be careful not to ascribe a “different” risk between 2 cohorts where the HR is 1.18 (page 14). While that
may be “statistically” significant, it is very close to the null and could be due to bias or confounding. I
would call an HR of 1.18 a null finding.
Note that follow-up was shorter in the Taiwan data (NHIRD) compared to CPRD. (1.4 years vs 5.2) so if
the outcome is associated with long duration of use they may have had insufficient follow-up. This is
worth considering.
Results or propensity score matched HRs were not very different between CPRD and NHIRD and in CPRD
only the HR of Dutasteride vs Tamsulosin was slightly elevated while in NHIRD only the HR for
finasteride vs Tamsulosin was slightly elevated. One could interpret these findings as inconsistent
between the 2 databases, or one could say that results of both databases were all close to the null.
HRs in CPRD were:
finasteride vs Tamsulosin (HR 1.22 CPRD).
Dutasteride vs Tamsulosin (HR 1.34 in CPRD).
Dutasteride vs finasteride (HR 1.08 in CPRD).
HRs in NHIRD were:
finasteride vs Tamsulosin (HR 1.61 NHIRD).
Dutasteride vs Tamsulosin (HR 1.18 in NHIRD).
Dutasteride vs finasteride (HR 0.94 in NHIRD)
The authors interprete the results to indicate that there is an increased risk of T2DM in users of
dutasteride and finasteride separately for BPH compared to Tamsulosin. They need to be much more
tempered in their interpretation since the effect is very small and not consistent between the 2
databases and could be due to bias and confounding. Dutasteride and finasteride users in CPRD and
NHIRD were more likely to be treated for hypertension and to receive statins which could lead to
confounding.
Note that the NHIRD data do not have information on BMI or smoking which could be confounders in this
study. The CPRD HR for finasteride vs Tamsulosin was lower than NHIRD HR. Authors used multiple
imputation to assess role of confounding but did this adequately address the small elevations in effect?
Authors say dose could not be assessed since there is only one dose. But what about a duration effect?
Discussion
In summary they say that 5ARIs increase the risk of T2DM (I assume they mean compared to
Tamsulosin though this is not stated). They need to be clear that the risk increase is very small and
could be due to confounding or bias. The interpretation of the results is not supported by the data.
Tables
Tables 1-3 need to indicate clearly from which database results are derived.
Why do main tables only include CPRD results? It appears that all Taiwan data are relegated to the
supplementary tables. There should be some table from NHIRD included among the primary results.
Not all patients in the CPRD have BMI recorded. How was missing data handled? I do not see the results
for people with missing BMI values in the tables. Similarly for smoking, alcohol etc. the authors need to
have a category for those with missing data.
Information on activity level in the CPRD – has the quality or reliability of these data been evaluated? I
have not seen it used. Again, there is no category for unknow activity

Small point: There is an error on the percentage in table S2 Tamsulosin users and statins.
In summary, the authors conclusion: 5α-reductase inhibitors increased the risk of developing T2DM in
men with BPH seems overly strong. The authors should temper their conclusion and acknowledge the
small magnitude of effect and the possibility that differences could be due to chance or
bias/confounding.
