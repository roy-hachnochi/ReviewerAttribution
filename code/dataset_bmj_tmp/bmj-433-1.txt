This meta-analysis synthesizes data from 58 diagnostic accuracy studies on the PHQ-9, analyzing
individual participant data from more than 17,000 participants. The analysis was conducted using
state-of-the-art methods and the authors are to be particularly commended for their efforts to
differentiate between previously diagnosed patients and undiagnosed participants, as well as the
extensive sensitivity analyses. The manuscript is clearly written and fulfils standard criteria for
publication.
Addressing three minor issues would further strengthen the manuscript:
p. 16: There appears to be a typo, "described as its authors" should be "by its authors".
p. 18: I suggest providing explicit reasons why the eligibility criteria were chosen as they were. In
particular, the time frame of two weeks may appear arbitrary to readers who are not familiar with the
exact wording of the PHQ-9.
Excluded studies: It is at least not obvious why some studies were not included, e.g. Thekkumpurath et
al. Cancer. 2011;117(1):218â€“27. An eTable providing the reason of exclusion for each study that
received full-text review but was excluded would further increase the transparency of the selection
process.
