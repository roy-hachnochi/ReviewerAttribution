Thank you for the invitation to review this thought-provoking paper. It was interesting to consider the
relationship between organisations and quality improvement, where and what they are.
As a parent carer and representative of the service user population, I am interested to know where
quality improvement within an organisation can originate from and what ‘better’ would look like to
me?
I am wondering where patients are located in the boundaries of an organisation and what their
specific contribution to quality improvement is. Patients can play multiple roles as instigators,
recipients, arbiters, leaders of positive change.
In many examples of QI changes initiated by frontline staff, the role of patients is usually quoted
within the QI story. If organisations are instigators of quality improvement where and how are
patients represented in an organisational way? How do organisational structures and processes
actively involve patients, at the macro, micro and meso level?
I was interested to read about governance modes and wondered whether the self-governance
dimension was actually omnipresent in an adapted form as an implicit layer at play within all
dimensions. The difference between: how things work round here officially and how we actually do

things. Especially in light of ‘regulatory overload’, the teams and wards I have encountered often
recounted to me how they find their own ‘workarounds’ to get things done. I have encountered a
degree of informal self-governance within any formal kind of governance mode.
Box 3 gives a very clear overview of the kind of high-performing QI features an organisation can
have. I would be interested to see if there is an additional feature to add around reflectivity, to what
extent feedback and challenge from the outside e.g. patients is incorporated on an ongoing basis
beyond adverse events? This could include an indicator that measures to what extent the patients also
perceive this organisation to be high performing. It’s a feature that lies between communication and
learning.
It was informative to read about potential risks when relying solely on front-line staff for QI. A degree
of tribalism or siloism is often quoted by patients as an additional burden on them when navigating
the system.
The points around integration and the display of Box 4 were not as clear to me as the rest of the
paper. I would like to know more about it.
My takeaways from Box 5 are that the QI aspiration would be to align vision and culture, have a
learning strategy that incorporates good use of data, balancing the input from various stakeholder
groups. All this in the context of a number of risk factors such as external demands, senior
management stability and resources, which includes time. The role of the Board is to provide
leadership, reflectivity and challenge that includes both clinical and outside perspectives. Could these
also be patient leaders?
I wonder whether that means for healthcare organisations that they need to start with their data,
understanding their own organisation, reviewing their learning strategy and stakeholder management
practices. This may call for different kinds of organisational roles. Is there any evidence of the impact
of new roles on the development of QI within organisations? For example, if there is a ‘Big Data
officer’, did this have an impact on QI?
It would be great to have a comprehensive QI case study that outlines in a story how organisational
factors and the contribution of frontline individuals complement each other. This may exist already
and I am not aware of it.
This was an insightful paper to review, I enjoyed the interplay between text and graphs and hope to
read more on this topic.
