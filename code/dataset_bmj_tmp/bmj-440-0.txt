The current manuscript describes a very well executed and very clearly reported systematic
review of models to predict clinical outcomes in COPD patients. I have no major, but only
minor comments:
Abstract
1. Results. "mortality was the most prevalent endpoint". Please add n (%).
2. Results. "the most commonly used predictors were age, forced expiratory volume in the
1st second (FEV1), previous hospital admissions, dyspnea, sex, quality of life, body mass
index (BMI), partial pressure of CO2, smoking, and previous COPD exacerbations." Please
add n(%) for each predictor.
3. Results. "BODE and ADO indices were the most updated and externally
validated models." Please add numbers.

4. Results. "low risk of bias". Please add how this was assessed (PROBAST).
Methods
5. Eligibility criteria. Can the authors elaborate on why they excluded cross-sectional
studies?
6. Risk of bias assessment. The authors use a summary score for risk of bias based on
quartiles. It is not entirely clear to me how this was operationalised. As it reads now, it could
be that a model/study was considered to be low risk with a score of, say, 5, when all other
models scored 6. Correct? This seems rather arbitrary to me.
7. Statistical analysis. Did the authors consider to meta-analyse the c-statistics across
models, e.g. for the most common outcome(s)? Studies/models could be stratified by setting
and heterogeneity could be assess across these settings and be presented in forest plots.
This could be an alternative to the comparison of median c-statistics. A similar approach
could be used to inform the reader in more detail about the results of the studies that
externally validated the BODE, ADO, DOSE, and BODEx.
Results
8. Development studies. "In only 49 prediction models (38%), calibration was performed".
Would suggest to use "assessed" rather than "performed".
9. Development studies, final paragraph, last sentence. For readability, please restate the
median c-statistics in the different settings.
10. Model updates, final paragraph. "Among them, 13 of the updated models (22%) had
better performance that the respective original models, whereas 31 updates models (53%)
did not present a statistically significant difference in C-statitic compared to the original."
Was this reported by the original authors, or was this assessed by the authors of this
review? Obviously, the c-statistic in itself is not solely informative on whether the addition of
a new predictor to an existing model leads to better performance. Reclassification is also
important.
11. Same sentence as in the previous comment. Please replace "that" by "than", "updates"
by "updated" and "C-statitic" by "C-statistic".
12. External validation studies. As mentioned in one of my previous comments, it would be
interesting to focus on these models and their performance at external validation in more
detail.
13. Critical appraisal. "Eighty-six models had low risk of bias (i.e., a risk of bias score
≤3),...". In line with one of my previous comments, this cut-off at ≤3 seems rather
arbitrary.
Discussion
14. Third paragraph, on methodological pitfalls. "Missing data often lead to biased
estimates if not imputed, because it can distort the performance of a prediction model if
values are not missing at random." It probably depends on definitions you use and how you
are tought to describe missing data, but at our institution we generally distinguish 3
missingness patterns:
MCAR: missing completely at random (missingness not related to other factors)
MAR: missing at random (missingness related to other factors: could introduce bias when
ignored)
MNAR: missing not at random (missingness is related to the value of the missing value itself,
e.g. income, or sexual preference, could introduce bias but hard to account for).
Using this terminology, if not imputed the performance can be distorted when the data ARE
missing at random (rather than the authors statement "not missing at random"). May be
good to use a reference here, e.g. Rubin DB. Inferences and missing data. Biometrika
1976;63:581e90, or simply state "if the missingness of values is related to other known
characteristics".
