Novel/fascinating approaches to consider 1- time-varying red meat consumption exposure
and 2- replacement of red meat with other protein sources. Good job controlling for changes
in other lifestyle factors over time (e.g., changes in total energy intake).
Only a few comments/requests for clarification:
- What is the median red meat intake in the US (servings/day)? NHANES would have info on
this. Essentially, are participants in the NHS and HPFS (as white, well-educated health
professionals) eating less red meat than the general population?
- It seems as though the results for the NHS are driving the pooled estimates. Would you
expect sex differences in associations between red meat intake and mortality?
- Your figures are hard to read, so it is difficult to see whether there are differences between
the NHS and HPFS in terms of cause-specific mortality.
- What do you posit as a potential biological mechanism for your associations with
respiratory disease mortality? You do this for the other chronic disease deaths in your
discussion section.
- Consider adding some discussion of how your results compare with the JACC study by
Nagao et al. (2012, Eur J Clin Nutr). They found that moderate meat consumption was not
associated with CVD mortality.
- If possible, eTable2 should be included with your main tables/text; it paints a nice
historical picture/context for your data.
