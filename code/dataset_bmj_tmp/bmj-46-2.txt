Important paper on relevant topic, using an impressive network meta-analysis, leading to
definitive and feasible recommendations for clinical practice. One comment I would like to
raise: On page 12 the authors seem to dismiss 'the plethora of available 'apps', based on
their finding that self-monitoring as an isolated intervention was ineffective, but do not
consider the added value of apps that are actually designed to support the regularly
supported self-management principle. It would be helpful to make this distinction, as there
are now apps available that can be tailored individually and do facilitate self-management
advice on how to respond to deterioration, in addition to just enabling logging of symptoms
or peak flows. This would indeed be in line with the statement that 'information on
managing an unexpected acute event needs to be available for reference when the attack
arises (whether written, digital, on-line or whatever medium is most convenient)'. If
incorporated well in the day to day healthcare processes, it could indeed provide a
meaningful way of delivering self-management interventions to reduce healthcare
utilization and improve quality of life among patients with asthma.
