This is an interesting study which nicely compliments the earlier publication from some of
the same authors, indicating that a genetic predilection to increased serum calcium was
associated with increased cardiovascular disease. Here, we find that genetically elevated
serum calcium levels are not associated with bone mineral density or fracture risk. As the
authors point out, calcium supplements continue to be quite widely used despite the
evidential base for that use being mostly negative. There are no major calcium
supplementation studies underway at the present time so further evidence is not going to
come from that source. The use of Mendelian randomisation is a further way to address the
important question of the anti-fracture efficacy of calcium supplements, which becomes
more important now that we recognise these supplements might have life-threatening
adverse effects.
For the average clinician, the techniques of this study are challenging but the conclusions
are clearly stated and of immediate clinical relevance. Therefore, I think the BMJ is an
appropriate vehicle for its publication. My specific points are minor, as follows:
1.
In the abstract it is not indicated that eBMD was derived from ultrasound. This
should be added. Also, in the methods we are not told how eBMD is derived from
ultrasound. There should be a brief description of this or at least a reference for those who
want to obtain the details.
2.
Reference 31 is referred to as a meta-analysis. It is in fact a randomised controlled
trial.
3.
The mean value of eBMD and its standard deviation are not given. Therefore, it is
not possible to determine the possible clinical significance of the mean differences in this
parameter that are reported in Table 1.
