This manuscript is a thorough synthesis of the post ebola policy recommendations and progress on
their implementation, and will undoubtedly receive a lot of attention. I only have a few minor
comments:
a) there are several mentions of the WHO DG election, but no indication of the timeframe. It may
be useful to mention it for authors less familiar with the process
b) In the "operational issues" progress report, while WHO's inability to respond rapidly to
outbreaks is recognised, there is no mention of GOARN, and its positive contribution. It may be
worth mentioning, in particular because certain countries are creating rapid response teams that
may be deployed through this mechanism as part of building a global emergency workforce
c) While ther authors's work focus on 7 prominent post ebola reports, they all originate from UN
organisation or high income countries. It may be worth mentioning either in the intro or the
conclusion that the west African Workshop on post Ebola global reforms that took place in
Monrovia in July 2016 broadly reached the same conclusions- therefore the view on post Ebola
priorities are shared by the countries affected by the outbreak
d) The authors highlight the remaining gaps- However some of the recommendations, in particular
around WHO and UN reform may require a longer timeframe than the year or so since WHO has
declared the outbreak over. It may be helpful for the authors to indicate what a realistic timeframe
for implementing these recommendations might be
I also not that David L Heymann is listed in the "other authors" list on page 2 but not in the
