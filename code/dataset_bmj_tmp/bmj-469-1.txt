Overall this is a good paper which systemically reviewed the efficacy of LIPUS on bone fracture or
osteotomy. Although lots of papers showed that LIPUS is effective in muscular skeletal system both clinic or
experiment. Surprisingly, this manuscript proved that LIPUS is not effective for bone healing. Based on
your description, you set a reasonable standard for study selection and avoiding the risk of bias. In
addition, the conclusion of this review was based on the evaluation of patient's bone healing time, pain,
radiographic image. So I think this is a very nice article and it is suitable for publication in BMJ.
