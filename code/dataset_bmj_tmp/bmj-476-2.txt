General comments
1. This is a report from a large multicenter population-based case-cohort study. The inclusion of all pregnancies, standardized
clinical case review, and the use of a multidimensional classification methodology are all great strengths.
2. The analysis is well done and the manuscript is well-written and complete. The strengths and limitations are well described
and the findings are not exaggerated and support the conclusions.

3. One suggestion is to modify Table 2 to show the show the proportion of cases stratified by livebirths and fetal loss in
addition of the grand total. Recent estimates of global burden of disease are limited to both livebirths and isolated defects so
discussion of these numbers would be an important addition to the field.
A table that includes only livebirths from Table 2 is below. I suggest that it might be useful to discuss isolated defects. Limiting
global estimates to live born cases with isolated defects underestimates prevalence because 81.8% of live born cases have
isolated defects.

Minor comments (using page numbers at bottom of each page)
4. Page 5 line 18. Please add year to the text (ref 3)
5. The number of cases with unknown etiology page 11, line 6 in the Results (4,390) does not match the total of unknowns in
Table 2 (4,391).
6. Page 11 lines 6-13. This paragraph is confusing. Are the proportions of males and multiple based on the Grand totals or on
familial totals? Perhaps a more general discussion based on the table in comment 3 would help.
7. Page 11 lines 36-41. This paragraph belongs in the Methods. Also, why only 18 of 20?
8. In Table 2 the Grand total percentage for fetal loss (2+ majors) should be 2.5% not 2.9%
