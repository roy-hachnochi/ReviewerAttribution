1. This is a pharmaco-epidemiological database study comparing the short term mortality associated
with treatment with antipsychotic drugs, amongst patients who had recently had an acute myocardial
infarction. Haloperidol was at least 50% more hazardous than atypical antipsychotics.
2. The study was carefully and elegantly done, reasonably large, using transparent statistical methods,
and with extensive sensitivity analyses to check results. The study used propensity matching to create
matched groups receiving each type of drug, and this process was highly successful judged by the
characteristics at baseline. Patients following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are likely to be at
increased risk, so studying this group allows sufficient events to be recorded to allow analyses. Since the
presumed mechanism of antipsychotic harm is through causing arrhythmias effects and differences may
be ‘magnified’. So this is a clever group to study, from the statistical power perspective
3. The question is important. It has proven difficult to do randomised controlled trials of antipsychotic
drugs in delirium, especially outside of intensive care units. The largest trial reported by the authors has
n=45. Although anti-psychotic drugs are widely used in the short term treatment of delirium, and may
have a role in shortening or reducing the severity of symptoms, this is uncertain, and it remains possible
that net harm results from this practice. Moreover, there are few data to guide the choice of drug.
Haloperidol is often used as it is available parenterally (although rarely used IV nowadays in Europe) and
has a ‘long track record’, is generally considered safe, and has few anticholinergic effects which are likely
to be deleterious in delirium (or dementia).
4. The biggest problem with the study is that delirium was presumed (by virtue of the fact that an
antipsychotic was prescribed) not diagnosed. A reference is presented in the discussion to justify this
assumption. Delirium diagnosis is often poor (although that is rapidly improving), and if diagnosed may
not be coded. Any medical diagnosis (or combination of diagnoses) can cause delirium, AMI amongst
them, but AMI may be considered a slightly unusual precipitating cause (drugs including opiates further
contribute to delirium risk). The study identified 6500 such cases however. Whilst indicating the value of
‘big data’ to investigate questions like this, the worry is that the group is unrepresentative, or that a
subtle difference in indications results in residual confounding. For example, haloperidol is an
anti-emetic; I am unaware of atypical antipsychotics being used in this role. Was haloperidol being used
in this role? This commonly happens in end of life care (alongside levomepromazine), and the authors
attempted to exclude those at the end of life (using a number of reasonable assumptions). But it is
possible that haloperidol was being used for nausea, or co-prescribed with opiate analgesia. You would
have to ask an American cardiologist if this were likely. There was a curious difference in length of
treatment (2.4 vs 3.9d, haloperidol shorter), which might suggest a difference in indication (or different
effectiveness, which is unlikely). That said, on balance I think that these differences would increase
rather than decrease the risk associated with haloperidol. The increased risk is probably real.
5. The 7-day time frame is short, but so was the drug exposure so this is appropriate
6. The authors are upfront and open about potential weaknesses.

7. A couple of points in the abstract. The title mentions delirium but not the abstract – it probably
should, and include the presumption about antipsychotic use = delirium. Secondly ‘as-treated analysis’ is
not clear (also p9). Does it mean an ‘on-treatment analysis’
8. The conclusion is important. The study says nothing about whether antipsychotic treatments has a
beneficial effect, but clearly suggests using an atypical antipsychotic if any is chosen. In a field where
trial data are unlikely to be obtained, the authors have used good statistics to come up with the next
best thing.
