The paper discusses the comparison of Haloperidol versus the use of Atypical Antipsychotics, in the
context of managing Delirium in patients with Myocardial Infarction. It is noted that there is an
interchange of the term Delirium and Dementia within the developed abstract and title. There is an
assumption of Delirium presence which is driven by the adminstered use of such medications, outwith a
contextual assumption of Mental Health issues. This has an applied consideration, in that also Mental
Health issues may be still present, but just undiagnosed such as which is reflected on for the presence of
Delirium. The paper also positively reflects on the wider potential for residual confounding which is
present within the research and explores this in a high level of detail with contextual exploration and
transparency to the reader.
