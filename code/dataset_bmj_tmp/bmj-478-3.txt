Thank you for the invitation to review this interesting paper. The introduction was
informative and a good length and the intervention was thoroughly described. The
statistics and treatment of those lost to follow-up was thoughtfully constructed and
readable for even a non-statistician. I was interested in this intervention as I found

Tai Chi helpful in my recovery from spinal trauma and I experienced less pain with
Tai Chi than modified aerobics so it was interesting to see this trialed. The flow chart
was clear, it would be helpful to have this in the paper to refer to as with 5 groups it
is good to be able to track their fate while reading the paper.
The paper was easy to read other than a few points where I was lost on where
whether the intervention 1 or 2x a weeks and cycled. I would have thought this
would make it challenging to see which was more effective and produced less
attrition. I wondered why it was not the same choice for both groups especially
given that it was rotated three times in the Tai Chi group?
Abstract/summary/key messages/What this paper adds - reflect accurately what the
paper says?
Yes
Participants studied - adequately described and their conditions defined?

Yes

Are the study's aims and the issue and questions that the paper addresses relevant
and important to you as a patient? Do you think it would be relevant to other
patients like you? What about carers?
The intervention is relevant as an adjunct or complementary therapy. It does not
rise to the level of an important public health intervention and I hope this statement
would not be included in the paper given the implications for policy setting and
insurance reimbursements where more effective treatment could be denied and the
patient left with an intervention they were unable to use even though it was
effective for others.
The sample is small with power calculations at only 80%. For this it is expected
patients invest one hour daily plus transportation, getting ready while ill etc. and
doing the testing, Is this enough? The intervention would be more relevant and
easier for patients to have confidence in if the study design and the trial would have
included patients in prioritizing the outcomes, reducing the burden of participants
and patient testing the feasibility/ and user acceptability of the design. It is great to
offer as an option that is safe and might help and is especially useful if the patient
canâ€™t tolerate aerobics or have not enjoyed relief with other interventions, plus it is a
low-risk intervention.
It was great that it reduced drug usage although in some areas where
improvements were reported CI seemed a bit wide.
Are there any areas that you find relevant as a patient or carer that are missing or
should be highlighted?
It would be helpful if patients have access to their data post-trial as they could use
this data to better self-manage care and plan recovery commitments.

Scientific reliability Research Question - clearly defined and appropriately answered?
Overall design of study - adequate ?

There is no detail given on how much difference 1 or 2 x a week made. Did patients
appreciate the community of the instruction or was coming in 2 x a week an ordeal?
What did patients prefer, was this piloted and were they asked?
I have concerns about the aerobic training v Tai Chi as in the Tai Chi they were
given a similar routine to do at home but in the aerobic they were to walk and the
time was also altered, this requires a shift that may be challenging for a patient in
chronic pain given the effect on the corresponding brain areas.
Fibromyalgia is a disease that has relapses and remissions. It would have been
helpful to have a control group of usual care no intervention patients as this would
make the outcomes more definitive in terms of actual benefit.
From your perspective as a patient, would the treatment, intervention studied, or
guidance is given actually work in practice? Is it feasible? What challenges might
patients face that should be considered?
This is why patient partners are needed so they could be asked, adapt the
intervention and then report on this so others can successfully replicate the work.
Patients might find it easier to work in a gym and let that become a habit rather
than walk which is a different process and requires ideal outside conditions. For
example, many people with fibromyalgia are sensitive to the weight of outdoor
clothes, wind on bare skin triggering nerve pain on walking or sensitivity to
temperature variances. We do not know if patients had a safe place to walk or an
aide to walk with them, this would be particularly critical if patients experienced
sudden exhaustion or dizziness.

Are the outcomes that are being measured in the study or described in the paper
the same as the outcomes that are important to you as a patient? Are there others
that should have been considered?
>20% of fibromyalgia patients report co-morbidities, such as arthritis, lower back
pain, depression, high cholesterol, hypertension, headache/migraine, anxiety, and
sleep apnea were any of these improved with the interventions? I suspect the
answer may be yes because pain meds were reduced in both groups however
because we are not told this remains an assumption. Did cognitive function
improve? As a patient, I would do the one hour a day just for this benefit.
Unclear why all secondary outcomes are not reported. If they were insignificant a
table like table -1 in the protocol showing the numbers might be helpful. The
authors say all the secondary outcomes are important in the protocol due to the
disease variance so not reporting them is unacceptable and a table may resolve this.
A small note to explain revised FIHR and what this does to outcomes, and please
could you make it clear what the effect size means in terms of the primary outcome.
How much difference does that make to patients, what can they do that they could
not before the intervention and how strong was this difference in clinical terms.
It would be helpful to offer the other intervention at no cost to the patients post
study who continued the intervention to which they were assigned.
Do you have any suggestions that might help the author(s) strengthen their paper
to make it more useful for doctors to share and discuss with patients?
Even post study patients could advise on dissemination to advocacy groups and
other patients.

As a patient, I would like more information on adverse events even if they appear
minor as that would help me to guide my treatment choices.
Other points
The CONSORT checklist only has check marks, what is needed to review this is page
number and preferably paragraph numbers so this can be reviewed in context.
Line 8 New approaches that patients are willing to embrace are needed to (They
may be willing but unable)
Line 37 patients were ALLOWED to take medications, could this be changed to
patients continued medications prescribed by their treating physicians, allowed is
paternalistic.
There are a lot of papers with Wang as first author, perhaps this is an
under-researched area?
