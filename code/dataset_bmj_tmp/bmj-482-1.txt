This unique, fascinating and important article adds exciting new information about how physical function
in older age is influenced by socio-economic status in addition to well-known lifestyle factors. The
manuscript contributes new knowledge that has major implications for population health and clinical
practice.
The great strength of this article is that it pools data from a large number of sources worldwide,
resulting in a strongly powered, large data set that enables important new relationships to be examined.
Also the figures are very nice and provide an excellent summary of the main trends.
The main limitations concern the lack of detail presented regarding the sample and sampling
methodologies. The justification for participant exclusion criteria is excessively brief. There is a lack of
discussion about 2 additional “life-style” factors: (i) social isolation (ii) stress, which are known to
influence mortality and morbidity.
In addition, it is not clear why people who walked with assistive devices such as walking canes are
excluded from the analyses. Given the very large number of older adults who walk with a stick or frame,
it would seem to be important to retain them in the sample and instead use “walking device” as a
co-variate. For this reason the results probably under-estimate the strength of relationships between
physical function, socioeconomic status and lifestyle variables.
Of note, in this manuscript it is not clear the extent to which the different datasets excluded older adults
with the following: (i) Cognitive impairment (ii) Mental health conditions that precluded the ability to
provide informed consent, such as major depression, major anxiety, psychoses etc (iii) Other reasons,

diagnoses or conditions that excluded them from the original data sets because they could not
participate in the research, such as visual impairment, literacy, rurality /access to participation in
research (iv) Diagnoses that prevented measurement of gait, such as severe stroke, severe Parkinsons
disease, severe arthritis, severe respiratory diseases, severe dementia etc. Another comprehensive
table needs to be added summarising the exclusion criteria for each of the data-sets from which the
pooled data were derived.
The discussion section of this manuscript needs to explore this issue in detail, and discuss the limitations
of the generalisability of the data much more clearly.
For the statistical analyses, it would seem important to analyse in more detail the co-variance between
the different lifestyle factors, socio-economic status and physical function. The way in which the
manuscript is written, the emphasis feels like it is currently on one variable at a time. However many
factors such as obesity, diabetes, smoking and low physical activity levels co-exist in individuals,
especially those with low socio-economic status. These inter-dependencies and co-existing relationships
need to be acknowledged and discussed more clearly, with reference to appropriate multi-variate
statistics.

Additional feedback is as follows:
1.
Title: This is long and hard to understand if the reader does not know what 25x25 is (which
most people don’t know. Please reword “ Association of Socioeconomic Status and the 25 x 25 Risk
Factors with Physical Functioning at Older Ages” to something shorter and to the point such as “Physical
function in older adults: relationships with socioeconomic status and lifestyle”.
2.
Abstract: This needs greater detail about the sampling methods; also the results currently focus
on a small strand of major findings; a more compressive account of the results needs to be given.
3.
Introduction: Clear but needs greater referencing to recent publications on physical function in
older adults (2015-2017). The terminology “25 x 25 Risk” is unclear and needs to explained and
de-emphasised as this catch phrase is over-used in this manuscript.
4.
Methods:
•
Please address each of the comments raised above and provide greater specificity and
description about the sample. This is a very major point that the final sample characteristics are only
very briefly presented.
•
Please give greater details on the sampling methodologies, the inclusion and exclusion criteria
and the sample size calculations. Did you have an a-priori hypothesis? If so, please include.
•
The consort diagram is far too brief and needs to capture the detailed data from each trial that
fed into this comprehensive data-analysis.
5.
Results: Greater specificity needed (see above), especially for multi-variate analyses. Also I am
concerned about the exclusion of data from people with walking sticks etc – can this be somehow
incorporated?
6.
Discussion: This needs quite bit of work as it largely repeats what was said in the introduction
and it needs to discuss and interpret the findings in comparison with contemporary research in this field.
The limitations section needs major revision (please see comments above). Also add new text in the
discussion about additional “life-style” factors: (i) social isolation (ii) stress (iii) other factors as
appropriate, which are known to influence mortality and morbidity. The limitations needs to discuss
more about countries not included, such as in Oceania and different parts of Africa etc and the
implications.
7.

Conclusion: Please comment on inter-relationships between all of these variables.

8.
References: Please update the search and ensure all of the major articles on this topic are
included, especially in the last 2 years.

Overall: An impressive work with international implications.
