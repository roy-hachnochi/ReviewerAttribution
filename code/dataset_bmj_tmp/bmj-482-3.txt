This study pools data from 37 cohort studies to look at the relationship between physical functioning (as
measured by walking speed) and a number of different risk factors.
Although the main statistical methodology used is appropriate, I have a number of concerns about the
select group of heterogeneous cohorts included in the study.
1.
How were the 37 studies included in the analysis selected? Are they all the studies included in
the Lifepath project? Is it feasible that this select group of cohorts might introduce bias into the resulting
relationships with physical functioning? More details would be useful.
2.
There is a high degree of heterogeneity between the cohorts. One important issue is that the
main physical functioning outcome, walking speed, is measured over a different range in each study (2.4
metres to 15.2 metres). Surely average walking speed is affected by walk distance?
3.
Mortality is said to have been obtained for, ‘…a subset of the cohorts…’ (Page 8). Hence, ‘years
of life lost as the outcome’ is based on a smaller number of cohorts. How many cohorts? How many
participants?
4.
A reasonable large number of participants (15%) were excluded from the analyses due to
missing data for SES, which possibly leads to a slightly less representative study group.
5.
More information on the ‘25x25’ risk factors should be provided. Also, it does not seem
appropriate to include this terminology in the title.
6.
Physical inactivity is included as a risk factor for walking speed. However, surely it is possible
that the actual direction of the relationship could be the reverse?
7.
It would be of interest to know whether there are any significant interactions between the risk
factors.
8.
The authors report some differences in the relationship between YFL and SES for high and low
income countries (Page 11). What other differences between countries, or between cohorts, were found?
9.
“Analyses repeated using a meta-analytic approach yielded similar results” (Page 11). However,
the data for this study was not obtained by a properly conducted systematic review, but from a select
group of cohorts.
10.
Figures 3 to 5. It is not immediately clear to the reader what ‘minimally and ‘mutually’ adjusted
results refer to (although this is explained in the text). Perhaps a footnote could be added to these
Figures?
