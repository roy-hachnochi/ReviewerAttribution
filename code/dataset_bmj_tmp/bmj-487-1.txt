The authors investigated the associations between potato consumption and risk of hypertension in 3 large cohort studies of US
health professionals. It was found that total potato consumption, as well as intakes of baked, boiled or mashed potatoes, and
French fries, but not potato chips are positively associated with hypertension risk.
As recently limitations on potato products of several health promoting programs such as WIC were lifted, due to a lack of
evidence on potato's negative effects on chronic diseases, this study provides timely evidence which suggests a potential
harmful effects of potato consumption on developing hypertension, an established risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. This
study is well designed and written.
I only have one minor suggestion:
The associations in table 2, 3, and 5 seem heterogeneous among 3 cohort studies, with non-significant or inverse associations
observed in HPFS. Please provide a P value for heterogeneity for these associations. If P for heterogeneity is statistically
significant, a random effect model should be used for the pooled analyses. If not, please mention the results in the text.
