This interesting paper reports on the long term follow-up of the POBASCAM trial, particularly on the incidence on
invasive cancer and of intraepithelial neoplasia among cytology- and HPV-negative women and its implications on the
optimal screening intervals with cytology- and HPV-based screening. A main objective is defining if 10-year intervals

are appropriate with HPV in countries where 5-year intervals were the standard with cytology. The follow-up and the
analysis are generally well conducted and results relevant.
I am a little doubtful on the choice of just comparing screening rounds and considering the rounds boundaries at 4,9
and 14 years. This was reasonable in order to show that more CIN2+ and CIN3+ had been detected with HPV at the
first round (because of greater sensitivity) and less at the second (because persistent CIN had been detected and
removed in advance) as in Rijkaart et al Lancet Oncol. In that case, such intervals actually identified women mainly
having a first and a second primary HPV test. For the present problem, however, this choice implicitly assumes that all
the cases of CIN and cancer detected in a given group up to 9 years after recruitment would have been detected at 5
years would all women have been tested at that time. Same for 14 vs. 10 years. This are plausibly upper bounds of
the true 5- and 10-year risks. Cumulative incidences up to 6 and 11 years are plausibly lower bounds for the same
true risks. Therefore, in order to define the screening interval I suggest to also compare the 11-year cumulative
incidences of CIN2+, CIN3+ and Ca in HPV- women from the HPV group to the corresponding 6-year cumulative
incidences in cytology- women from the cytology arm .
For all considered triage strategies, CIN3+ incidence among HPV positive women negative according to the triage
protocol was at least 10 fold that among HPV negative women. Authors suggest that HPV-positive triage-negative
women should be re-tested after 5 years but the basis for this interval is not clear. Their 6- and 9-year cumulative
incidences of CIN3+, at a glance, seems higher than the 11- and 14-year cumulative incidences in HPV negative
women respectively. In addition, it is not clear to me why authors do not report the risk among HPV-positive women
negative to the triage protocol actually followed in POBASCAM (which entailed HPV repeat within 18 months). This
seemed natural. In addition, it can be expected that when HPV clears the risk returns similar to that among HPV
negative women.
The reasons for the analysis by age are also not obvious to me. The incidence rate ratios of both CIN3+ and cancer
between age groups 39-53 and 29-38 in the intervention and in the control group are reported. They appear to be
quite similar (not incredibly similar: 0.21 vs. 0.31; incidentally a test for heterogeneity should be reported),
suggesting that the incidence rate ratios between the intervention and control group within each age group are also
similar. However, the intervention vs. control incidence rate ratios are much more interesting as themselves and in my
view should better be reported.
It is reported that cancer incidence was significantly lower in cytology-negative women from the intervention group
than in cytology-negative women from the control group while CIN2 and CIN3 incidence was similar. However, no
interpretation is provided. This is clearly the result of the detection and treatment of a number of HGCIN by HPV
testing in the intervention arm, which prevented them to progress to invasion. Conversely HPV testing can detect
HGCIN (earlier than cytology) but does not allow preventing it. This interpretation is quite trivial but I think it should
be reported explicitly in order to avoid confusion for the reader.

Results on invasive cancer are surely the most relevant for determining the screening interval. CIN3 incidence is an
interesting proxy but provides only part of the needed information. As underlined by reference 29, an important
determinant of cancer risk given the screening interval, is the time needed for progression from CIN to cancer which,
in addition to be known only very imprecisely, is clearly not related to CIN incidence. This should be clearly reported
while In addition, CIN incidence is in fact CIN detection (and so should be denoted). It does not actually
