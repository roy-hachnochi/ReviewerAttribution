This update of a previous Cochrane review with meta-analysis of controlled trials on the impact of
communicating genetic risks of disease in risk-reducing health behaviour is timely, given that several
additional controlled trial have been published following the publication of the original meta-analysis in
2010.

The authors have implemented a very rigorous study methodology, the manuscript is very well written, and
the introduction and discussion link the review/meta-analysis to previous, related reviews. Overall this is a
high-quality review and I believe the topic is relevant to readers of the British Medical Journal. I
recommend publication without further changes.
