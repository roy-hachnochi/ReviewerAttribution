I commend the authors on their rapid work to review the literature in this fast-evolving
space. The paper demonstrates that while a number of prediction models have been
developed in this space, reporting is poor, and methodology and risk of bias is high. The
methods used in this review article are appropriate and robust. I strongly agree with the
authors conclusion that urgent sharing of patient data is required to support the building of
more robust prediction models - doing so will surely save lives.
I have one major comment and a few minor ones.
Major comment:
Rightly there are major concerns raised about the current models in the literature and their
use is not recommended. Through better data sharing and engagement with predictive
modelling experts we hope to rapidly build and deploy new models that can better support
triage decisions. However, this will take some time, and clinicians need to know how they
should make these decisions now. Should all models be ignored and just rely on clinical
judgement? I don't know whether it's appropriate for this paper to make a recommendation
on this or not - or perhaps an accompanying editorial can do so? I leave it to the editors and
authors to decide.
Minor comments:
1.
P5L10: might be worth emphasising that there is likely to be severe under-ascertainment of
cases.
2.
P5L17: 'more countries may follow'. Suggest 'more countries will almost certainly follow'.
3.
P8L37: also local variation on how people would be defined as cases / hospitalised and hence
be selected into the studies?
4.
Can the Tables please include the reference number?
