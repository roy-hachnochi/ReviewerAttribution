In the present analysis, the authors have performed an IPD meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of effect of betablockers on the mortality and other CV end-points in individuals with HFrEF. In particular, the authors have used this large
dataset to investigate the potential effect modification (i.e. interaction) of age and gender on the event reduction associated
with the use of BB in this scenario.

The authors should be congratulated on the clinically meaningful question the present study proposed to answer, particularly
for the impact of age on this analysis. I believe the current study adequately answers question, and the current results are of
interest for the general audience of a general medicine journal.
I do have, however, some concerns and suggestions regarding the present version of the manuscript. I believe the authors can
fully address all those points. The point-by-point list is presented below:
1. When reading the manuscript, particularly more so for the conclusion, the authors emphasize “Similar absolute effect sizes”
and “no significant interaction”. However, there is a significant interaction for age as a continuous variable for CV mortality,
first CV admission, death or CV hospitalization, CV death or HF hospitalization; while a non-significant trend is noted for allcause mortality, first HF-related hospitalization and fatal and non-fatal MI. Just by looking at the HR in table 3, it is clear to
note that the values for the fourth quartile are closer to one than in the first quartile, while for most outcomes a clear trend is
noted across quartile. In my personal opinion, this needs to be highlighted by the authors. While the benefit may be seen
regardless of age, the effect is less pronounced in the older individuals.
I think this fact should also be presented in the conclusions, as for many events the relative reduction is less than half from
one quartile to the other (many from 0.6-0.65 range going to 0.77 – 0.87). This is from 40 to a 13% RRR.
2. Following up on the concern above. I have a suggestion, which I believe is important to fully address the question of the
impact of age on this interaction. For many clinical conditions, the association of age and events is non-linear. Assuming
linearity may force the model to an assumption that is not correct. I would strongly suggest the authors to perform one of two
strategies:
a. Try additional models for age as a continuous variable using quadratic (centered) terms.
b. Consider investigating this association using splines.
If those strategies do not results in significant changes they may not need to be presented, but in case they do, they may
significantly affect the results and conclusions. I understand the complexity and limitations of such strategy when dealing with
interaction terms and complex models, but I believe this should at least be considered during the analysis. I figure two with
splines or quadratic term would probably be of interest.
3. Particularly for the models using age as a continuous variable, I was unsure about the need to exclude the extremes of age.
Have the authors considered including those patients in a sensitivity analysis for the models with age as a continuous variable.
4. I have some concerns about the variable follow up when merging the data together. The authors describe they have
censored all data at 1200 days. I agree with the idea of censoring, but I was curious on the choice of cut off value, as the
media follow up is close to a third of that (~400 days, 1.3 years). Shouldn’t the censoring be closer to the median follow up?
5. For the tolerability comparisons, neither the table nor the text present any formal statistical test to conclude whether those
results are similar or not. The authors mention “numerically higher” and “similar rates”. Please provide how this was formally
tested, as well as the p value / statistical significance of those findings. With such a large sample size, I would expect a 1.2%
absolute difference in discontinuation to be statistically significant. A similar lack of formal statistical testing occurs for BB
dosage and cause of death. The authors mention there as a difference across quartiles of age or gender for the cause of death,
but not formal testing is presented (table B and C)
Minor:
1. I think the abstract conclusion is a bit overstated. Instead of say “… provides robust evidence … should receive BB …”, a
conclusion such as “ BB significantly reduce xx events irrespective of age and gender” would be more appropriate for the data
provided in the study.
2. For continuous data (such as age in the abstract) please provide mean and SD. Similarly, for proportions, I suggest
providing absolute numbers together with the % values.
3. Many journal request the PRISMA checklist to be provided as part of the appendix, though I am not sure BMJ necessarily
requested that.
4. In page 7, I did not understand the statement: “we have insufficient evidence to comment on whether patients were
actively involved in the design or management of these eleven trials”.
5. In the results the RRR in the second paragraph of the “primary outcome” have no 95%CI, please provide.
6. For the secondary outcome, the author mention, “there was SOME attenuation”, I think, “there was attenuation” would be
more appropriate. Attenuation is a reduction in strength or signal, which was clearly seen. Similarly “slightly attenuated
prevention” in the third paragraph of the discussion.
7. The overall amount of table is quite substantial. In my personal opinion table 2 is not needed. Similarly, I think
supplementary figure A is not needed.
8. Additionally, the tables are not in the order presented in the text. Table 2 is introduced before table 1, please check.
9. In table 2, I think it would be key to present what is the age range of each quartile.
Overall, this is a very interesting study, within the scope of BMJ.
