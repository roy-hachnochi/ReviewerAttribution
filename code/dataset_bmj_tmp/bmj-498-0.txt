The response to my comments is excellent, and I am happy with the revision. However, I must
recommend that the titles for Figures 2 and 3 be improved. They must come with a clear warning (in
the title or footnote) that the uncertainty of each ratio is not displayed, due to the majority of studies
not providing this, and that pooling results is not justified due to the heterogeneity and poor reporting.
Further, they do not state that each circle represents a study, and how the size of the circle was
calculated.
