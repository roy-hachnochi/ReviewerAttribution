The revised manuscript has resulted in a more readable and informative review of the heterologous
effects of BCG, measles/MMR and diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccines. It represents the most
complete and best attempt to date to summarize a very challenging and disparate literature about a
topic important to understanding the potential impact of immunization on all cause mortality not caused
by the agents targeted by the vaccine.
Specific suggestions and questions:
1) Page 5, line 9: in “as a result of immunization that augments the way…” change augments to
modifies (note that changes can be either increases or decreases)
2) Results section, Pages 7 and 8. Not all of the supplementary tables or figures are called out in the
text of the relevant sections; please do so.
3) Page 7 line 12: It is stated that statistically significant findings were reported in 27/77 of the studies.
However, in Tables 2-4, which purport to show significant findings from all of the studies, 29 studies are
cited.
4) Reading the sections on BCG, measles, MMR and Tetanus vaccine studies would flow better if the
final paragraph in each section came first.
5) Page 9, line 34. The response described is not the IFN-g responses to BCG but in BCG immunized
subjects, assessed as unstimulated or stimulated production of this cytokine in culture. Also, rather than
a consistent increase in production, it appears to my view of the figure that such an increase was seen
in nearly all but not all studies.
6) Page 9, line 42: It would be more informative to state that IFN-g showed an increase in 2 of 3
studies, rather than all but one.
