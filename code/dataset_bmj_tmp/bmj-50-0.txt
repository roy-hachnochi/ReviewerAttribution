The authors have responded very clearly to my comments, and made suitable revision to
the paper. I thank them for their clear responses throughout this process. My only
remaining comment is that throughout the paper the authors discuss results in terms of
risk and lowering risk of T2D. However, I think they mean rates, not risk. Please consider
this throughout. The word ‘risk’ should be accompanied by a particular time-point (risk by
what time), whereas rate refers to the whole follow-up.
Some examples of this are:

1) “After adjusting for lifestyle and dietary risk factors for diabetes, participants in the
highest quintile of total whole grain consumption had 29% (95% CI: 26% to 33%) lower
risk of T2D comparing with those in the lowest quintile”
- I think the authors mean lower RATE and not lower risk
2) “Spline regression showed a nonlinear dose-response relationship between total whole
grain intake and T2D risk in that the risk reduction slightly plateaued over two servings/d
(P for curvature < 0.0001)
- Again, rate reduction rather than risk reduction?
Same applies in many other places too
I thank the authors again.
Best wishes, Richard Riley
