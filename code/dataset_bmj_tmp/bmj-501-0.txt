The authors have comprehensively addressed the points I raised.
In my opinion the paper makes an important contribution to our knowledge about the use of adrenaline during inhospital cardiac arrest.
My remaining comments are minor and I defer to the editors and authors as to whether they wish to incorporate them
1) I still find the 2-3 minute window confusing and think it would be better described as < 3 minutes
2) Page 17, line 25 Consider revision of this text "The goal of the main analysis was to compare survival to hospital
discharge between those receiving epinephrine ≤ 2 - 3 minutes after the first defibrillation (i.e., before the
recommended second defibrillation) with those not receiving epinephrine in this timeframe (including those receiving
epinephrine > 2 - 3 minutes after the first defibrillation)"
to make it clear the control group included no adrenaline - suggested change
"The goal of the main analysis was to compare survival to hospital discharge between those receiving epinephrine ≤ 2
- 3 minutes after the first defibrillation (i.e., before the recommended second defibrillation) with those not receiving
epinephrine or receiving epinephrine > 2 - 3 minutes after the first defibrillation)"
3) The editors observation that this cohort of patient differs from those reported in other settings is valid (30%
ventilated, 90% monitored in this study compared to 5% ventilated, 40% monitored in UK - NCAA Nolan 2014).
Discussion of these differences and hence the generalisabiliy of findings could be considered.
