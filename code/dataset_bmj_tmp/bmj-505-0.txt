This is an interesting paper that adds to the literature on management of hip fracture and also on implementation of
guidelines. The methodology and interpretation of findings are generally well done. My concerns are relatively minor.
1. The interpretation of some findings is made difficult because higher scores on some variables indicate good health
(eg AMTS) while higher scores on other scales are bad (eg ASA). So in the abstract it says that "the use of THA was
limited based on ... lower ATMS" and then shows an OR of 1.44, which means that higher AMTS scores were
associated with an increased likelihood of having THA. And yet on page 10 it infers that "increasing ... AMTS ... [was]
associated with fewer THAs."
I also had to think twice about "highest quintile of social deprivation", which means "least deprived". For example, on
page 13, it says "the inappropriate use of THA was more common in the lowest group of socioeconomic deprivation"
and here (I think) the "lowest group" means the "highest quintile".
It would be good if all variables were recoded, at least for the logistic regression analyses, so that high scores always
mean "good" or always mean "bad" - this would make results easier to interpret.
2. The units for the odds ratios in Table 2 are not always clear. Does the OR of 1.44 for AMTS mean a 44% increased
likelihood of THA for every 1 point increase in AMTS? If not, was ATMS dichotomised? A similar issue arises for age
and ASA.
3. Page 9 mentions "unexplained variation" (para 2) and "variation ... could be explained". Two points here: (a) how
were these figures calculated? (b) it would be better to be consistent between paragraphs and write about just one or
other of "unexplained" or "explained".
4. Are figures 2 and 4 necessary?
