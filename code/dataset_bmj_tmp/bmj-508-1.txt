The manuscript is improved and I believe the authors have dealt appropriately with all of the
main points raised in the last round.
The paper could use a little editorial attention, especially in the discussion, where for example the
opening paragraph runs to 2+ pages, and there is some repetition of points (e.g. the issue about
duration of follow-up is covered both in the opening paragraph and in the limitations section.
Where the authors refer to the "risk in healthy never-smokers" (and similar), I suggest they reword to clarify that they mean restriction to people who were healthy at baseline.
