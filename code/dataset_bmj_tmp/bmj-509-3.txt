Certainly an important issue that the patient community desires to have evidence-based effectiveness, however, there are
some concerns with the current study and conclusions addressed in the article.
The title although clear and concise think it is misleading in terms of exactly what the study covers and its findings. Clearly
referenced the target conditions covered in the study would be important for the patient community rather than assume this
article covers every issue and conditions of the hospitals.
As an example, in this regard and of major concern to the general public, is how many hospital deaths are contributed to
medical mistakes? How many Die from Medical Mistakes in the U.S. Hospitals? Health News: NRP, September 24, 2013:
“It seems that every time researchers estimate how often a medical mistake contributes to a hospital patient's death, the
numbers come out worse.
In 1999, the Institute of Medicine published the famous "To Err Is Human" report, which dropped a bombshell on the medical
community by reporting that up to 98,000 people a year die because of mistakes in hospitals. The number was initially
disputed, but is now widely accepted by doctors and hospital officials — and quoted ubiquitously in the media.
In 2010, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services said that bad hospital care
contributed to the deaths of 180,000 patients in Medicare alone in a given year.
Now comes a study in the current issue of the Journal of Patient Safety that says the numbers may be much higher — between
210,000 and 440,000 patients each year who go to the hospital for care suffer some type of preventable harm that contributes
to their death.
That would make medical errors the third-leading cause of death in America, behind heart disease, which is the first, and
cancer, which is second.”
Of course not addressed in this article but a general reader may assume the article relates to all hospital issues and
conditions.
The number of patients compared from 2,252,818 to 177,800 seems unbalanced and the segment of the HVBP to be slightly
younger, more like to be male, black, slightly more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and less likely
to have CHF is not fully represented by patients across the board.
Appreciate the limitations outlined on Page 12 which seems to mollify the stated strict conclusion of the study which may be

misleading to the patient community, policymakers and public at large that this program is not effective requiring changes.
“If medical severity of illness is changing over time in ways that our current risk-adjustment methodology cannot account for,
then the effect of HVBP may be more difficult to identify. Finally, we only have data for three years following the
implementation of HVBP. Improving an outcome such as 30-day mortality may take longer than our study period and further
studies may need to examine longer-term effects. However, given that we failed to identify even an early trend, one would
posit that benefits, if any, are likely to come well down the road.”
Perhaps changing the title to reflect the study would be more appropriate: The Impact of the U.S. Hospital Value-Based
Purchasing Program on 30-day Mortality Rate
