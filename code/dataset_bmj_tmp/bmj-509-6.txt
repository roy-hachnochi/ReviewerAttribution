Summary:
This is a well-written paper reporting on an analysis to assess the impact of the US Hospital Value-Based Purchasing program
on patient mortality. The authors used a quasi-experimental design with a control group to evaluate the impact of the program
on mortality. Several sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted. The analysis was comprehensive, including all eligible
hospitals in the US and a total of over 2 million patients between 2008-2013. The article is clear, methods seem appropriate
(although could be clarified in places), and results are presented clearly, consistently and concisely. The conclusion is that the
HVBP program is not associated with better outcomes. I would like to congratulate the authors on an exemplary study using a
rigorous approach and analysis. I really have no major concerns, but several suggestions for their consideration.
Specific comments:
1. While I believe the statistical methods were appropriate, there are some confusing aspects. For example, the method of
analysis is described as an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis. However, the description of the analytical model is not what I
would have expected for an ITS design. Rather than analyzing a single series using aggregate outcomes and a segmented
linear autoregressive analysis, the authors seemed to have conducted a patient-level analysis using a Bayesian hierarchical
model to compare differences in trends while adjusting for patient clustering within hospitals. Or was this process used merely
to generate the risk-adjusted aggregate mortality indicators prior to an ITS analysis? Please clarify.
2. There are a few additional areas for clarification. Please define the time interval for the regression analysis (presumably time
was coded in quarters and analyzed as a continuous variable, but this is not stated in the Methods).
3. Please clarify the primary approach with respect to the comparison of pre- and post-mortality slopes between participating
and non-participating hospitals. Was this in fact done using segmented linear regression of aggregate data as described in ref
16 (i.e., including a term to describe change in intercept after the program started and another to describe change in slopes
after the program started) or was this implemented using interactions with time. The description of the analysis seems to
indicate that only difference in slopes was accounted for, rather than difference in level and slope as an traditional ITS
analysis. Was this an apriori decision or decided based on significance testing?
4. Please describe how the analysis accounted for the autoregressive error structure if conducted as an ITS analysis (or
alternatively, for the correlation in repeated measures on the same hospital over time if conducted at the patient-level)?
5. Did you consider allowing for a ramp-up period by censoring a period of time to allow for the hypothesized effect of the
program to be realized as described in Penfold RB and Zhang F. Use of interrupted time series analysis in evaluating health
care quality improvements. Acad Pediatr 2013 Nov-Dec;13(6 Suppl):S38-44. It is unlikely that there would be an immediate
effect of the program upon its implementation and this may need to accommodated in the model.
6. An additional analysis is described using logistic regression with hospital fixed effects. Why were hospitals not considered
random effects, i.e., hierarchical logistic regression?
7. Please provide details of how the matching of the worst-performing hospitals was carried out.
