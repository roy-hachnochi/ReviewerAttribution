I read this manuscript with great interest and I can see some stimulating and novel concepts
proposed, but I am not entirely sure if it fits for an Analysis article based on the journal’s
guidelines.
Below are my specific comments (following the flow of the manuscript):
1. I am thrilled to see researchers proposing the use of the precautionary principle (PP) in the
context of COVID-19. This is a helpful decision making framework originated from the
environmental policy discipline. They often need to make political decision on novel
environmental contaminants that may have severe harmful effects on humans and the
environment, when the science isn’t even there yet. There are some useful references that the

authors can refer to (e.g. the European Union Article 191:
https://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/precautionary_principle_
decision_making_under_uncertainty_FB18_en.pdf), instead of the Wikipedia.
2. A major issue with the current manuscript is that the discussion on the existing evidence/
debate and guidelines on masks have already been covered in several recently published
articles, particularly Chan et al. BMJ 2020:
https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/03/11/whos-confusing-guidance-masks-covid-19-epidemic/
and Chan & Yuen 2020 IJE: https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa044. A more in-depth systematic
review of evidence (that the authors mentioned) would have offered more additional insight,
whereas the qualitative account included in the present paper could be improved with more
succinctness and less overlapping with the previous commentaries.
3. Given the supposed focus of this manuscript (application of PP in contemplating the value of
masks in COVID-19), the materials covered under “evidence and guidelines” and “contested
interpretations” seem to have have muddled up the focus of the paper (or the way that they
are presented made it so). It was not until the end of page 6 that I found the authors’ insight
on the topic of focus. Considering my comment #2 and this, I suggest the authors to start
arguing for the use of PP earlier and substantially shorten the two sections on the existing
evidence/ debate.
4. I am not sure if the authors have constructed a sufficiently strong argument under the
section about the PP. The use of the PP framework requires us to obtain and evaluate new
evidence rapidly, but even at this stage of the epidemic, I am conservative about relying on
“anecdotal evidence” based on news reports . There are some preliminary studies investigating
the value of wearing masks during COVID-19 (e.g.
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034660v1.full.pdf – although this is
ecological); as well as analogical evidence (one aspect of Bradford Hill’s considerations of
causality, which is a key component in the PP framework to evaluate novel toxins by
referencing known toxins with similar chemical nature) on SARS-CoV-1, influenza or other
primarily droplet- and fomite-borne respiratory infections (e.g. Leung et al. Nature Medicine
2020; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0843-2, Lau J et al. Emerg Infect Dis
2004;10:587–92.).
5. There is also a need to better articulate the potential threats of COVID-19, with some
numbers on the direct and indirect health and economic impact; and more specifically for
masks, to discuss the potential risk of not wearing masks – which would be more in line with
the PP to support a precautionary approach to take action to avoid the risk associated with
“exposure to not wearing masks during COVID-19” despite the lack of complete evidence.
6. Line 167: I believe the authors meant East-Asian countries here? Use of mask was not as
common in South-East Asian countries even for Singapore.
7. Lines 180-185: this seems to be oddly positioned and not entirely fit into the flow of the
article.
Overall, I think the underlying concepts proposed are insightful and valuable to the debate
about masks but there seems to be a need of substantial revision to better formulate the
argument.
