I read this revised manuscript about whole grains and all-cause and cause-specific risk and mortality with
great interest. I think that the authors did a great job addressing review comments.
Besides the few extra comments below, I have no further comments to add.
I think that this meta-analysis addresses a important topic, and that it could have a large and broad
public health impact, as many countries are still to focus more on increasing the whole-grain intake of
the general population, due to the many health benefits elegantly illustrated in this meta-analysis.
Few extra comments:
- Supplementary tables 3, add a column indicating the actual outcomes under study (e.g. for CVD,
indicating that the outcome is incidence of ischemic heart disease). I know that it is mentioned in the
table, but it would be more clear, if it had a separate column.
- First line of the discussion: please avoid priority statements.
