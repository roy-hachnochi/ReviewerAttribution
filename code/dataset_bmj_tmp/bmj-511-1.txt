I thank the authors for their very detailed replies to comments on the submitted version.
While I find such studies very interesting, as I’m sure most of us do, I’m quite sceptical about whether
we can draw reliable inferences. In all such studies the risk of residual confounding is considerable.
I’m in favour of transparency but I do question whether we need 22 supplementary tables and 95
supplementary figures
Specific comments in response to the authors’ responses:
1. I queries the use of 7 servings a day as optimal. The authors have not changed this. While it is fine to
use 7 as the reference the term “optimal” is surely inappropriate. In the context of diet in particular I
think this term is unwise.
2. I’d prefer that the authors note that tests for “publication bias” do have low power when there are few
studies, not that they may have low power. And note that it is recommended that funnel plots not be
used with fewer than 10 studies (Sterne et al BMJ 2011;343:d4002).
3. The authors present calculations of numbers of deaths saved if grain intake was increased to 120 g/d.
Such calculations make very strong assumptions. Apart from the relevance of the actual studies to the
general population, no account is taken of other changes to the diet that would occur if someone
increased grain intake.
Other comments relating to reading the revised version:
4. PRISMA is not a guide for conducting a systematic review (p176).
5. Table 1 should explain what the RRs are and also be explicit that RR<1 favours those with higher
intake.
6. Figures. It would be good to reduce the size of the black squares in forest plots so that the CIs can be
seen.
7. How were CIs for splines calculated?
8. I don’t really get a good idea from the figures of the range of intakes – I’d find it useful to know what
was the range of intakes of each food of most people in the studies. But I’m not sure how easily that can
be summarised across studies.
9. The existence or not of an association is defined by P value. P>0.05 shows lack of evidence of an
association – it doesn’t demonstrate lack of association. This is especially so as there are fewer than 10
studies for most analyses and thus low power. So it's not good to say that there was no association. Of
course nor does P<0.05 demonstrate that there is an association. I think that the words used to
summarise the results should not be based solely on P values.
