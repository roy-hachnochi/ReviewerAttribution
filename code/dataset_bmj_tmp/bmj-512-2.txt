This is a very interesting study, and the results are certainly worth publishing. However, revision of the text is needed.
At present the text is too long and difficult to follow. Furthermore, the clinical implications of the findings need to be
described. I have made a number of detailed comments to illustrate these points.
Introduction is too long and repetative. For instance:
• first sentence in first paragraph is almost identifcal with first sentence in third paragraph
• page 4, second half af line 35 + lines 36-37 + last part of line 42 + lines 43-44 could be deleted
• page 4, line 55 + page 5, line 2 (first half) can be deleted
• page 4, line 5: replace ”different types of LBC tests and conventional cytology” with ”screening tests”
• page 5, line 7: replace ”primary screening smear” by ”test”
• page 5, lines 9-11: the sentence ”Whereas…” can be deleted
• page 5, lines 29-31: What is the meaning of ”cytology screening with cytology triage”? Should it not be ”cytology
screening with cytology follow-up testing”?
• Page 5, lines 38-42: The sentence starting ”By using these data,…” could preferebly be replaced by something like:
”By using these data, we were able to assess the interval cancer risk after a negative screening test, and thereby
indicate whether the sensitivity for progessive CIN lesions differs between the tests”
Results
• Page 10, line 29: the sentence ”No significant …,” could be ended by adding: ”…, though from month 60 onwards the
cumulative incidence increased more for ThinPrep than for conventional cytology.” and then
• Page 11: all sentences concerning time dependency could be deleted
Discussion
First three lines can be deleted, so the text starts with ”The overall….”
Page 13, lines 22-29: suggested to be replaced by: ”…cytology, but fairly similar during the first 60 months. The
increased risk is due to a 58% higher risk …”
Page 13, line 33: add at the end: ”… while the number of CIN lesions decreased slightly but not statistically
significantly so.”
Page 13, lines 49-50: the text ”since the study did not take place in a controlled setting” is repetitative and can be
deleted.
Page 15, line 16: reference 33 seems to be the same as reference 19??. Anyhow, the sentence lines 14-16 is
redundant and can be deleted.
Page 15, line 22: ”similar number of CIN lesions” add ”as for conventional cytology”.
Page 15, lines 35-37: The sentence is redundant and can be deleted
Page 15, line 44 (from ”Thus, …”) + lines 46-55 + page 16, lines 3-5: The text can be deleted. As the results show the
overall pattern for the three screening types, there is no need to address interobserver agreement here.
Page 16, lines 9-16 (up to ”As the risk…”): can be deleted. There is no need to refer to consequences in the NL, as the
NL will anyhow change to HPV-screening.
Page 16, line 53 (from ”…according to”) + line 55 + page 17, lines 3-10 can be deleted. The text is difficult to
understand and not needed in order to understand the previous sentence. It is furthermore not needed to mention
QALYs.
I miss a section on the clinical consequences of the findings. If for instance only CIN III are recommended for
treatment, then 3 more women will be treated for each extra saved cervical cancer case, if conventional cytology is
replaced by SurePath, etc.
Page 18, lines 9-12: ”Multiple studies” ? only references 19 and 20?

Table 1, title: ”Baseline characteristics” of what?
Table 2: Absolute numbers should be added as they are not all included in Table 1.
Figure 1: Title should be changed so one can see that it is cervical cancer and cervical screening.
Changes along the lines listed above will highly improve the text of this very valuable study.
