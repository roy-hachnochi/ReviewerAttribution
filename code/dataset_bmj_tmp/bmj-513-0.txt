Dear Dr. Merino,
I think that the authors have worked diligently and conscientiously to incorporate all of the
reviewers' comments in their revised version of the manuscript. The manuscript is now a very
informative descriptive guide to the early manifestations of the neurologic sequelae of
congenital ZIKV infections, as revealed by neuroradiologic imaging. I have no new comments to
add and I am satisfied about the author's take home message.
I think that this manuscript will be an important paper and should be published. I think that it is
ready with the exception of a very close editorial viewing:
Page 8 line 11 change " of a craniofacial ..." to "or a caraniofacial..."
Page 8 line 15 change "worsen" to " worse"
Page 23 line 8 please correct the spacing
Page 27 change " intraparenchymatous" to "intraparenchymal"
