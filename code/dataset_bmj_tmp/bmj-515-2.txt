The authors used a cohort of 7238 patients who survived beyond 1 year after acute myocardial infarction.
After defining the 1 year after AMI as a 0 time point, patients had a median follow-up of 1.5 years. The
authors assessed ischemic and bleeding outcomes over this period with the objective to compare them with
those observed in the placebo group of the PEGASUS trial, a trial evaluating ticagrelor treatment after the
first year of an AMI. The analysis was done for 3 types of patient samples: the sample of 5279 patients
meeting the inclusion criteria in the PEGASUS trial, the sample of 1676 patients meeting both inclusion and
exclusion criteria of the PEGASUS trial and the entire "real world" post-MI survivors of 7238 patients. They
found much higher incidences of ischemic events and higher bleeding rates in their cohort as compared
with those seen in the placebo arm of the PEGASUS trial and calculated the number of events that would
have been prevented with ticagrelor after applying the risk estimates of the PEGASUS trial.
The most concerning issue of the present analysis is the huge difference in important prognostic
characteristics (including age, diabetes, type of AMI) as well as in the length of follow-up between the
cohort used by the investigators and patients included in the PEGASUS trial. Therefore, the risk estimates
observed in the PEGASUS trial may not apply to the analyzed cohort. The greatest contribution of this
analysis might be represented by the report of event rates in a real-world population with AMI largely not
treated with P2Y12 antagonists after the first year. Any comparison with patients and outcomes from the
PEGASUS trial is best done in the discussion without a formal comparative analysis.
The two samples created based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the PEGASUS trial represented
96% of the "real world" cohort. Yet, the age difference between the 2 samples and the entire cohort is
surprisingly large.
