This research study seems to be well conducted with a conclusion that is entirely reasonable. On closer
consideration from a patient’s perspective, the approach taken by the researchers does suggest a
number of concerns.
Participant selection was based on age range, classification criteria for RA, no commencement of DMARD
therapy and less than two years since diagnosis. Part of the usual classification of a patient’s symptoms
requires a swollen joint count. A proportion of patients do not have sustained swollen joints, instead they
may demonstrate swelling for short periods of time, swelling that rotates across the body or swelling
during flare episodes. As such, I believe, that excluding such patients could be considered a weakness.
The endpoint definition for patients between 16 and 24 months of disease activity was defined as clinical
remission, no swollen joints and non-progression of radiographic joint damage. Other secondary
outcomes were also considered. Having read numerous research papers on clinical remission and
attempts to define and quantify the state, I remain suspicious that reductionism is triumphing over what
patients feel. In other words irrespective of the measured definition, if the patient still feels unwell, is still
unable to live as they did prior to RA then remission has not been achieved. As such I suggest that broad
claims “that remission has become achievable” (p4) would be better described as “a large proportion of
RA patients reach improved quality of life today than was historically the case due to tight control
strategies and new therapies.”
The survey design based on 11 centres in Norway does seem limited on two grounds: sample size and
cultural peculiarity. Not all health care delivery jurisdictions in other parts of the world would be
dominated by university hospitals. In a number of jurisdictions familiar to this writer, private practice and
community health centre support for patients with RA are the dominant form of delivery.
Radiographic images of just three joint areas do appear to be somewhat limited. Imagery of the shoulder
joints should, I believe, have been included for improved analysis sensitivity. It was disappointing to see
that no discussion was evident on the impact of ultrasound examination itself on patient motivation and
levels of concern.
Assessing pain and fatigue are not simple matters. The interplay between adequate sleep, mental health
and shear trauma of the RA experience have not been considered except by the ACR core set and VAS. It
would have been useful to understand the relationship between levels of pain and positive ultrasound
images. The reliance on global measure like DAS and ACR and the lack of patient involvement in the
development and design of this study is, perhaps, the main shortcoming.
This is an interesting and worthwhile study.
