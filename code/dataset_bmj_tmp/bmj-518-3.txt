This is a timely study, evaluating the possible additional value of adding imaging in the decision process
on tight control in treatment of patients with early RA. The results are quite clear, not only in showing
that there is no additional value, but also resulting in a caveat re increasing perhaps unnecessary
aditional treatment. The border between under-treatment and over-treatment becomes smaller in
sophisticate tight control strategies; this is an important to realise.
The study is well performed, and the authors were clever to design an acceptable concealing strategy to
prevent bias in the evaluation of the primary outcome. Powercalculations and analysisplan are up to date
and adequate.
I have one major question with regard to the actual performance of the study. In many strategy studies
treating physicians have clear rules how they should come to their treatment decisions, but they may
always deviate when they are convinced that patients interest prevails. E.g. in the well known BEST
study this has been evaluated as having happened in 25% of the decision-moments. In other studies this
might be lower. The authors of the present study do not mention this problem at all. I wondered whether
this indeed didn't happen? Please comment and evaluate.
In addition, were the sonographers trained, perferably repeatedly during the trial, and alligned in order to
get as good as possible the same cut off points in their judgement ?
Minor remark: p 6, line 42 DAS score: is this DAS 28 or 44, ESR or CRP ?
