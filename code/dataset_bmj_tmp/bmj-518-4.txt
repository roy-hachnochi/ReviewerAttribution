General considerations:
This article is interesting and original since it is one of the rare published studies performed in multiple
centers using a strict computer based tight control design for the monitoring of RA treatments. It is also
as the authors mentioned one of the first study using, in one arm ultrasound as a tool to monitor
therapy.
I have no special remarks regarding the design of the study, the selection of the patients, the number of
patients included, the schedule of the visits and the treatment algorithm, the clinical and radiological
targets used to assess the response to treatment. They have all been validated in previous studies. The
high amount of steroid infiltrations can however be questioned.
I just regret that the authors have not included a third arm for which treatment adaptations would have
been made according to physician decision in collaboration with the patient. Even if previous studies have
already shown that a stringent tight control algorithm performed better in term of remission than the
classical physician based approach, in clinical practice, decisions made by a computer without any
discussion and previous acceptance from the patients does not seem really applicable and even desirable.
Moreover clinical and US results of this third arm would have been very interesting. This point could be
discussed by the author.
As a specialist of the use of US in RA, I have some reservations concerning the ultrasound component of
the study. The author stated that they used a validated score but in fact they (reference 31) only showed
that the score was reliable in terms of inter-reader performances. To my knowledge, this score has never
been evaluated for its sensitivity to change and its performances compared to clinical disease activity
measurements such as the DAS.
Moreover there is no explanation for the US changes chosen (10%, 20% of the total score) to decide
treatment rules in the US arm. Are those criteria clinically relevant? Why choosing total B and Doppler
score for treatment adaptations and just no Doppler as the final target? DAS relevant changes (>0.6,
>1.2) have been previously validated so the US rules should also be validated.
Why the authors did chose only clinical and radiological outcomes and no ultrasound outcomes either
primary or secondary, although one of the final targets in the US group was no Doppler activity? The
design of study has nevertheless included US evaluation in both groups. Some of these US outcomes
were expressed and compared between the two groups at baseline, during and at the end of follow-up.
In contrary to clinical and radiographic outcomes, they are significantly different between the two groups
after treatment adaptation (table1 and 2).
For me, this point is not adequately discussed. According to previous studies mentioned in the
introduction by the authors, the better Doppler results in the US arm could suggest that the remission
obtained based on US evaluation is more robust and could led to less relapses. The conclusion of the
article should therefore be a little bit modulated, not rejecting so straight fully ultrasound as an additional
tool for treatment tailoring in RA.

Some comment on the US operators and machines used could also be useful if one really wants to
appreciate how the results can be applied to clinical practice and to other countries: how many different
operators, how many different machines, which ones, repartition and balance of operators in the different
centers.etc).
Minor remarks and questions to in authors in the text.
Introduction:
P4: Line 35 : I donâ€™t think that a majority of patient in clinical remission have US signs of activity it is
more around 30 to 50%.
P4: Line 40 : imaging remission discussed here and not taken into account in the paper although you
have some US data collected for that. (no Doppler activity in the Us group and even data to compare in
the non US group).
Participants:
P5 line 46: consent : was it clear that that the patient had to accept and follow strictly the computer
defined rules.
Randomization:
P6 line 6 : personel: Who did the US evaluation in the US group, was it the same physician or a different
one? How many physicians how many ultrasonographers took part to the study?
Were patients randomized adequately in each center or did some centers evaluate most patient of US
group and some others most of patients of the clinical arms since these factors can have a great impact
on results especially if no prior standardization was performed?
Assessments
P6: Line 17: validated score, see above remarks
P6 line 30 : blinded to the results , what about the US group blinded or not to US?
Treatments strategy
P6 line 52 : methotrexate , oral or subcutaneous?
Outcomes
P7, Line 46 , why so many early X-ray evaluations in patients with only moderate disease activity ?
Results:
P10, table1: it would be interesting to know the % of patients with Doppler activity at baseline in both
groups in order to compare them with follow-up data (table 2)

P10 , line 53, why 8 and not 6 months ?
Results
P12, table 2: Doppler results are significantly different between the two groups in contrary of baseline
data (see above )
Gray scale and total score results during follow-up like in the baseline data would have been interesting.
to know. Are they also significantly different between the two groups?
