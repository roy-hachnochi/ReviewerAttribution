Overall the paper is very well written and easy to understand - addressing a key area of global
importance (that is the reduction in AMR through over use of antibiotics - principally in ambulatory
care).
This paper shows very clearly that it is safe to reduce antibiotic prescribing for self-limiting diseases with
the slight increase in the number of infections the average GP practice may see - offset by reductions in
the side-effects of antibiotics as well as associated costs (although the latter not discussed). This is very
important in low and middle income countries where often there is 100% co-payment for antibiotics and increased resistance is leading to increasing use of more expensive antibiotics with implications for
access and patients completing the course. Consequently should be published in a high impact journal
such as the BMJ.
I do not have major suggestions - only some minor ones for consideration only. These include:
a) May be good to define Primary Care since in a number of countries this is 'ambulatory care' - so avoid
confusion.
b) Page 3 line 10. Other references for consideration include: (I) Laxminarayan R, Matsoso P et al.
Access to effective antimicrobials: a worldwide challenge. Lancet. 2016;387(10014):168-75 - as this

gives figures for the appreciable increase in antibiotic use worldwide during recent years and the
implications; (ii) taken forward in LMICs by Mendelson M, Rottingen JA et al. Maximising access to
achieve appropriate human antimicrobial use in low-income and middle-income countries. Lancet.

c) Line 20 page 3 - negligible benefits to whom?
d) Page 3 Lines 38 - 47. Good also to say that interventions are also being targeted at patients to reduce
antibiotic prescribing as do mention this on page 13 (lines 42/ 43) and in the French study quoted. Other
publications discussing this include Rezal RS, Hassali MA et al. Physicians' knowledge, perceptions and
behaviour towards antibiotic prescribing: a systematic review of the literature. Expert review of antiinfective therapy. 2015;13(5):665-80. This is because patients themselves are often a source of over use
of antibiotics in ambulatory care as mentioned on page 13). This is recognised by typically
multicomponent strategies among authorities to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, e.g. (i) Huttner B et
al. Characteristics and outcomes of public campaigns aimed at improving the use of antibiotics in
outpatients in high-income countries. The Lancet infectious diseases. 2010;10(1):17-31; (ii) Dyar OJ,
Beovic B et al. How can we improve antibiotic prescribing in primary care? Expert review of anti-infective
therapy. 2016;14(4):403-13; (iii) Furst J, Cizman M et al. The influence of a sustained multifaceted
approach to improve antibiotic prescribing in Slovenia during the past decade: findings and implications.

e) Page 5 line 38. Not sure every reader outside the UK will be familiar with Read codes as opposed to
ICD 10 codes - so a brief explanation may be needed
f) Page 5 lines 50 - 57 - may be good to say why broke the cohorts down into the age groups discussed
and not other potential age groups
