This is a ground-breaking observational study in an area of maximal clinical importance.
Writing from the perspective of a clinician with an interest in diabetes and shared decision making, I
can think of few contributions to the literature of equal importance. There are insuperable inherent
difficulties in conducting randomised controlled trials in this field. A large representative cohort study
of this kind may be the closest we can come to evidence that permits shared choices in this common
condition.
It is hard to see how this could be bettered in size or thoroughness of analysis. The tabulated data
will be of huge value to the diabetes community and the "bottom line" messages will help to guide
clinical practice, used with the caveats which the authors clearly state. If anything, I find these too
conservative, especially in relation to the prima facie harms of insulin.
I expect this study, together with its companion piece on microvascular outcomes, to be one of the
most accessed papers the BMJ ever publishes. I do not think that I can usefully add comments on
detail because it is written with admirable clarity, and discussion of the exact findings and the
statistical analysis of them could occupy pages without adding much to an editorial decision about
the article.
