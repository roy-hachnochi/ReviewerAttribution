This is a very intriguing study. The manuscript is well-written. I have some concerns though:
1. After having a closer look on “Appendix 5 – Google search term trend analytics using the search term `statin side
effects”, I was not convinced that there was a real peak in April 2014. Although it is true that it was a peak compared to
January 2014, it was not really a peak compared to October 2013.
2. The authors claim that “the media coverage resulted in 218,971 patients across the UK stopping statin therapy, and
would account for at least 2173 excess cardiovascular disease events over 10 years”. While this is an important finding,
it turns out to be a ‘modeled’ finding. This finding is not based on empirical data e.g. incidence data from relevant
registries and is therefore preliminary.
3. With regard to the findings about “Changes in statin cessation” on page 11 line 36, I wouldn’t say there was strong
evidence, was there? Also not after inspecting Figure 1CD where the findings are small.
