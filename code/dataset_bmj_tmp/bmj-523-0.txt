This manuscript nicely describes the mortality experience of a large cohort of long-term survivors of
pediatric cancer from Britain. It describes mortality trends over 7 decades, which is also of particular
interest and contributes to the current literature on late mortality in these survivors.
A few comments:
- In the introduction, sentences 2 and 3 in paragraph 3, do not make sense. If the authors want to
give the sample size for each of these cohorts, perhaps, it could be included after the specified
cohort in parenthesis (i.e. Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (n=6,056) …)
- Because of the long span of time covered in these analyses, there are areas where additional
information would be of value to the reader, to help keep these results in context. First, as suggested
by authors, the overall 5-year survivor rate has changed rapidly over this time period, which would
suggest that the more ‘at risk’ population would have not survived the 5 years necessary to be part
of this cohort. Second, treatment has also changed drastically during these designated treatment
eras. Even though authors describe they are unable to obtain treatment information on this cohort, it
would be of value for the authors to discuss both these changes over, to help explain some of these
findings.
