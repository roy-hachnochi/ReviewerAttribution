The authors have addressed all the reviewer points to my satisfaction. I have two extremely minor
further observations.
1. Page 15 line 435 includes three citations with full names that can be omitted.
2. The last line of Table 4 gives the range of observed/expected ratios. Including the median as well
would be useful.
