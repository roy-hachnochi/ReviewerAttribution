Dear Editor,
Thanks again for letting me review this very interesting manuscript. Compared to the first version,
the current version seems to be completely rewritten, and has been improved in every way. The
whole concept is much easier to grasp, including the assumptions, methods, results and
interpretation. I congratulate the authors with an excellent revision. I have only a few minor
comments below.
Compliance and persistence: The presented values seem more optimistic than the numbers
suggested by the editor previously. My interpretation of this discrepancy (and my clinical sense) is
that there is huge uncertainty with regards to such numbers. Would it be an idea to include also a
sensitivity analysis where these numbers are lower?

While the first version presented 95% uncertainty intervals, the current version reports inter-quartile
ranges as a measure of uncertainty – my sense is that this will introduce a false feeling of precision
as many readers will interpret these as 95% CI. Please discuss your choice of measure further.
Sensitivity analyses: First you say that the extra scenarios did not alter the main findings. But it
seems in the following sentences that it did have significant impact on the results – 60%
effectiveness reduction (1) and eliminating benefits on inequality (2) seems to me to be quite
dramatic changes. Please elaborate.
