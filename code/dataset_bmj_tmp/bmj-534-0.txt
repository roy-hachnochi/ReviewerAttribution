1. The much-discussed ‘weekend effect’ for acute stroke hospital admissions was analysed by comparing a research
cohort (with clinical conformation of diagnosis and severity measurement) with cases ascertained from
administrative datasets. The apparent ‘weekend effect’ was explained by miscoding of low risk cases on weekdays,
giving weekdays a falsely low mortality rate. Casemix differences between weekends and weekdays were evident,
but overall did not contribute to the effect. These issues were further explored in a systematic literature review and
meta-analysis. The authors urge caution in using and interpreting data using administrative datasets across a
variety of conditions, of which stroke is likely to be representative.
2. The subject is highly topical especially for a UK readership, but also relevant to service improvement worldwide,
and to areas that rely on routine administrative data outside of stroke and acute medical conditions.
3. The study used research-quality data alongside clinical coding, from a long-established and well-regarded caseseries/cohort, giving a good sample size. The time period of ascertainment was 2002-14, during which clinical
stroke services have developed and evolved considerably.
4. Clinical coding was poor. 75% of admitted strokes were correctly codes, and of those coded only 63% had had a
stroke. The weekend effect was driven by miscoding of non-stroke or elective admission with old stroke during
weekdays ie weekdays demonstrated a falsely low mortality rate. Among all OXVASC acute stroke admissions, there
was no imbalance in baseline stroke severity on weekends versus weekdays and no difference in case-fatality or
functional outcomes (Rankin) at 30 days or a year.
5. In a systematic review of previous studies, the finding of a ‘weekend effect’ was associated with studies using
administrative coding only. Lack of severity measurement and inability to casemix-adjust likely contributed further.
6. The paper is thorough and carefully analysed and written. I could not find any fault with the logical or the clinical
epidemiology. The careful encyclopaedic documentation and analysis of previous studies from the literature (in large
part confined to web appendices) is especially impressive.
7. There are a lot of figures and tables, but these are all helpful and contribute to clarity in presentation and
understanding.
8. The written style is somewhat heavy, but this is a result of the careful description of methods and dissection of
findings.
9. The data come from a long period during which services were changing considerably, and are from one city with
good services (but nonetheless challenged as much as many UK acute services are). This limits generalisability, but
these points are acknowledged
10. It has long been taught in clinical epidemiology and health services research that observational data are
unreliable in assessing treatment effects. It is why we do randomised trials. These cannot address every problem or
research question, but where other methods are used, conclusions must be caveated as they are necessarily
uncertain. We forget this at our peril, especially in an era of transparency, publishing of individual clinician-level
outcomes and 'big data'. Their appeal is seductive, but unreliable. Rothwell has pioneered the use of high quality
cohort data in investigating both natural history and the effects of treatment. He has done us a further service with
this paper, which clearly shows, that in the UK at least, administrative data cannot and should not be used for some
purposes for which we might like to use them. The conclusion that ’Future studies addressing the ‘weekend effect’
should ideally be based on prospective studies of clinically confirmed cases’ is entirely reasonable.
11. The sadness is that the opportunity to seek potential areas of research interest or service improvement through
use of routine administrative data has now been undermined and probably fatally discredited by political misuse of
what should have been tentative and uncertain conclusions, supported by senior clinicians who should have known
better. This issue would be worth an editorial – maybe by Nick Black or Martin McKee.
