This article exposes some significant weaknesses in prior studies which have attempted to study the "weekend
effect" on stroke diagnosis and management. Few questions for the authors:
1. Have they defined what is the exact time that a weekday ends and weekend begins? This may provide some
more granularity to the data.
2. How do the authors expect this data to affect care and reimbursement by payers in countries without a social
healthcare system?
3. Have the authors notified the OXVASC group regarding this information? Which is to say could the "false-positive"
cases lead to invalidation of any studies coming out that dataset?
Overall, great article.
