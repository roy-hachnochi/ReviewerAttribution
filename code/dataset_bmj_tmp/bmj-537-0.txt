Paper is improved and my major concerns were mostly allayed.
My only major comment was to consider also including NNT estimates in addition to the results presented
for absolute numbers of event prevented and bleeds caused. ("Our analysis indicated that addition of
ticagrelor to the treatment regimen of these patients might prevent 101 of these events per year for every
10,000 patients treated, at the cost of 75 major bleeds. This ratio is almost identical to the calculation
reported in the main trial results (42 vs 31), although the absolute magnitude of potential net benefit of 26
is greater in the real world data.")
NNTs may be easier for some to conceptualize.
