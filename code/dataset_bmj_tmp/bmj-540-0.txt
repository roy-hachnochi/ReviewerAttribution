This manuscript describes results from two cohort studies exploring the association between use of 5-alpha reductase
inhibitors (5ARIs) and erectile dysfunction (ED). The other cohort consists of 71.849 men with BPH, the other consists of
12,346 men with alopecia. Use of 5-ARIs was not significantly associated with ED in either study group.
The topic is of importance, as 5ARIs are a commonly used drug group, and they have been previously linked with sexual
side effects such as ED. This study attempts to control for confounding by indication by limiting the analysis to a group
of men who all share the indication for 5ARI usage.
I have the following comments:
- Methods, Patient Populations: A flow chart including inclusion criteria and exclusions would make it easier for the
reader to understand how the two study populations were formed.
- Methods, Patient Populations: Numbers of men included in each cohort should be reported here
- Methods, Exposure Definition: the available prescription data should be characterised further: did you have data on
each individual prescription of 5ARI for all participants in your cohort?
- Methods, Exposure Definition: In the BPH cohort the exposure was categorized by recency of use, whereas in the
alopecia cohort the model was more simplified, with all 5ARI users categorized as exposed until the censor date, without
any subcategorizations. Why did you handle the exposure differently between the study cohorts?
- Methods, Covariates of Interest: It seems odd that you did not take into account diabetes, which has been associated
both with BPH and ED; thus it is a possible confounding factor which has not been accounted for
- Methods: Statistical Analyses: Which variables did you include in the model when calculating adjusted ORs?
- Results, Erectile Dysfunction in the BPH Population, last sentence: I am not sure whether this sentence is true: the
proportions are little higher in 5ARI+AB users, but was the difference to other drug users statistically significant?
Sincerely,
Teemu Murtola
