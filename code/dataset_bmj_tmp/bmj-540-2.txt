The authors evaluated the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED) in men who used 5-alpha reductase
inhibitors (5ARI) to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or alopecia using UK Cinical Practice Research Datalink.
They found that 5ARIs do not appear to significantly increase the risk of incident ED, regardless of indication for use.
General comments
Overall the paper is interesting and well done. The main problem is the retrospective nature and the type of the analyses
performed which represents major limitations.
In addition the paper presents other important methodological limitations.
Abstract
Results section must be simplified.
Introduction
A better analysis of the available data must be performed. In particular better description of post 5ARI syndrome must
be performed (see also Corona et al., J Endocrinol Invest. 2012;35:915; 21; Traish et al., J Sex Med. 2011;8:872-84.).
In addition, it must be recognized that a recent meta-analysis documented that the use of 5ARI was associated with
higher risk of ejaculatory problems in men with BPH (Gacci et al., J Sex Med. 2014;11:1554).
Methods
The selection of case and controls reflects the aforementioned limitations.
The type of factors included in the multivariate analyses must be better specified in the text and in the tables.
Results
LUTS represents the link between ED and BPH, the lack of this information analog with many other clinical parameters
represent further limitations
The type of factors included in the multivariate analyses must be better specified in the text and in the tables.
The use of non ED sexual dysfunction category is misleading since 5ARI are potentially associated with low libido even
after drug withdrawn.
Discussion
A better comparison with available in particular RCT studies must be performed.
