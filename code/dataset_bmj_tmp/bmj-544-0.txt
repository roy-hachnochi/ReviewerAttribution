I liked this article. I think there is a major unaddressed point about uncertainty of prognosis. This is
true for cancer as well as non cancer diagnoses. We did a study (ASPECTS) back in 2006 which
looked at what people understood about prognosis when making a decision to have palliative
chemotherapy. There was very little understanding of extra length of life that might be gained, based
on interviews following the discussion about chemotherapy.
The point about finding your 1% is an excellent one. It can be more of an obstacle than a help. I
think acknowledging uncertainty and discussing hope for the best and planning for the worst is a
better strategy. It is one that needs reviewing as people deteriorate.
It may be worth mentioning treatment escalation plans, particularly in the hospital setting. The
discussions are more subtle than DNACPR and are based around what would you want us to do if you
become less well. ACP in hospital can be tricky.
The authors may want to consider making recommendations at the end rather than having a box for
questions. For example, giving practitioners some specific advice about what to say when
acknowledging uncertainty would help.
