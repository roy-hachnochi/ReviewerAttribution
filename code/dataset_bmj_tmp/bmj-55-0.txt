Thank you for this manuscript. As a rapid scoping review I have approached it as I would a narrative
review; if there was a defined search strategy it would be helpful to include this (possibly as an
appendix).
It generally reads well, with a logical flow. The only major topic I can think of that isn't addressed is the
impact on patients with long-term conditions of social distancing and impaired infrastructure. I know the
team at CEBM in Oxford have been working on this so the BMJ may have plans to address it elsewhere.
Specific comments:
The section on the gig economy (para 1, "Loss of income") could be referenced.
The "disaster capitalists" paragraph would be improved by a specific example of potential to benefit from
the pandemic for those of us less familiar with this literature.
