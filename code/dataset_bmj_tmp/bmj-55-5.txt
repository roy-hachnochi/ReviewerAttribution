I found this to be a very useful and very timely analysis article, which commendably covers a broad
range of potential impacts of COVID-19 social distancing and isolation policies. I entirely agree with the
authors' argument that "to reduce adverse impacts on health and health inequalities, actions must be
targeted to support the most vulnerable people".
The section on loss of income was very powerful. I agree that the impacts of social distancing and social
isolation will likely disproportionately impact the income and earning potential of the already
disadvantaged in society. I thought the point about disaster capital was fascinating and one that will be
interesting to follow (I wondered if we are already seeing examples of this in instances where prices of
many products have risen significantly).
Main points for consideration:
I am not sure whether the disruption to education section was as convincing - at least so far as it being
a disruption to the same degree as the other sections. Whilst the link between education and health is
unequivocal, I am not sure whether the period of social distancing and isolation will be long enough to
cause any lasting educational disadvantages (although because of the unprecedented nature of the
COVID-19 and its associated policy, this is hard to determine - but my assumption would be that it will
be a hiatus of a few weeks/months). Certainly, the point about vulnerable children is an important one
(and you might move this next to your discussion of vulnerable children and family violence in a prior
section).
Perhaps those who stand to lose the most are those children at critical junctures of their education (e.g.
GCSE, A Level, degree finals) but as you may well know very recent (likely after the article's submission)
'no detriment' initiatives are being taken. I did wonder about the impact on (very) young children for
whom, arguably school is a particularly necessary outlet for social development, and who are at an age
when disruptions to socialising might be more likely to have longer-lasting developmental impacts?
I also wasn't as confident about the point about social disorder. Whilst I agree it is in theory possible, I
do not know of any (I may be wrong of course) examples of other countries in the current pandemic or
in past pandemics, where this actually occurred. Better I think to focus on the more tangible risks
around domestic disturbances and violence which you have already noted well.
Minor points:
p.4.l. 26: 'Children who are reliant on free school meals may go hungry': My understanding is that
schools remain open to vulnerable children which might be mitigating this somewhat for many of the
most reliant on FSMs.
Similarly: ' social distancing measures can themselves take essential workers from
the workforce, for example when schools close, requiring parents to provide childcare". Again, my
understanding is that schools are staying open for keyworkers' children. However, how effective this is
proving to be in practice remains to be determined (so i think your point is still valid, but might need
qualifying at least in light of the attempts to protect essential workers' ability to continue working)
p.4 .l12.: 'risks family violence'. This is an important concern. To my knowledge, there is (media)
coverage that has started to support this.
(https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/world/coronavirus-domestic-violence.html)
p. 5. l. 45. 'A future risk is that older people
and other groups that are being particularly protected by the response become stigmatised'. Maybe,
although again (as you note in your following sentence), it could be that compliance with social

distancing is evidence of public and social solidarity and cohesion around protecting the most vulnerable.
I did wonder whether a little more discussion in this section of the particular risks to those over 70 (less
likely to have igh internet use and thus less online social connection support?), as far as isolation and
loneliness and mental health might be worthwhile?
