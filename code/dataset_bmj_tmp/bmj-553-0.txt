The effects of e-cigarettes are often very passionately debated and evidence available is often patchy and inconclusive. The
present manuscript is a very neat and clear paper that provides urgently needed data about the population-level impact of ecigarette use and presents them objectively. My comments are mainly editorial in nature.
I am not able to evaluate the statistical analysis used and would refer this to a statistical editor or expert in the use of ARIMAX
modelling.
1. The title needs double-checking, it reads association between… on…
2. What is already known paragraph: I find it a bit odd to refer to a specific systematic review here and would suggest
referring to concerns about this in general. Otherwise, a reference would be needed here
3. What this study adds: The sentence about the TPD is too vague to be meaningful. It could possibly be clarified why these

findings are important when considering the TPD, but I would suggest removing the sentence as it does not seem to be based
directly on the study findings. Also, there is little or no discussion of the TPD in the main body of the manuscript so this
appears like an afterthought.
4. Introduction: The first sentence needs some references
5. Aim 1 is nearly unreadable, please consider splitting this sentence or rephrasing to make clearer.
6. Aim 2: As in the title, this talks about associations on something. Also outcome ‘attempts’ – would this be proportion making
an attempt, number of attempts or something else? Please define
7. Aim 3: as above - ‘association on’; and is it really necessary to repeat the words ‘quit attempt’ eight times within this
sentence? It is tautological to say ‘during a quit attempt among those who made a quit attempt’
8. page 6,line 19 and 44: Why was 0.1% chosen, presumably this was the figure when data were first collected?
9. It would be useful to have response options for the question on aids used during quit attempts and to give all outcome
variables labels.
10. “Price of cigarettes was correlated 0.99 with time and was thereby taken into account by use of differencing to make the
series stationary” This sentence will be completely opaque to most readers and should either be explained or moved to the
supplementary appendix.
11. Analysis: I appreciate the appendix, but some explanation of ARIMAX modelling would be helpful here, e.g. ‘first
differenced and seasonally differenced’.
12. Sample characteristics: The stop smoking services do not report the number of smokers but the number of quit attempts
made with them
13. In terms of writing style, it would be better not to start most paragraphs in the results with ‘Table x shows…’ or ‘Figure x
shows…’. At least in some places describing the finding and then referring to the table/figure would flow better
14. briefly define in one place what determines that a result is inconclusive
15. Discussion: page 12, line 32: which policies?
16. To address concerns about population impact, a brief mention of e.g. prevalence of e-cigarette use among never smokers
would also be helpful.
17. The formatting of tables 2 to 4 is disgraceful even though this is only review stage. Please reformat so that the font size is
reasonable and they don’t extend beyond the page margins.
