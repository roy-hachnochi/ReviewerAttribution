This is an important and timely study that provides strong empirical evidence in support of e-cigarettes' potential to benefit
public health by promoting cessation of combustible cigarette use. Large-scale studies looking at the population-level impact of
e-cig use for smoking cessation have been lacking. Other population-based studies on e-cigs' impact on smoking cessation
have had significant methodological limitations. Thus the current study certainly addresses an important gap. Furthermore, this
is the first study to use multi-year data and time-series methods to elucidate the link between increase in e-cigarette use and
increase in smoking cessation. The study adequately adjusts for potential confounders (e.g., anti-smoking policies, media
campaigns). Another methodological strength of the study is the detailed way in which e-cig use is assessed (e.g., any use for
cessation help, use during quit attempt). The study is well-written and data analysis is well-explained. This study is likely to
significantly advance tobacco control research.

I have a few minor suggestions that the authors may want to consider:
1. It may help the reader if the sampling strategy is explained some more. For example, how many households were contacted
monthly or quarterly? My understanding is that random location sampling involves quota-based sampling and response rates
do not apply to this method. This may need to be mentioned.
2. The finding related to the decline in rates of quit attempts over years may need some discussion.
3. Page 5, second paragraph, question #3, a-c, it may not be necessary to mention "among those who made a quit attempt."
4. Page 11, last paragraph, there is a typo.
5. Please distinguish between over-the-counter NRT and prescription NRT with examples. The negative relationship between ecig use and prescription NRT use, but not the other NRT use, may need some discussion.
