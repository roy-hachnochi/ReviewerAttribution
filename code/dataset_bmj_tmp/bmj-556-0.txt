This is a very interesting and well performed meta-analysis. It brings light to a relevant topic with findings relevant
to the clinician.
I only have a few comments:
1) It would be useful if you would reference the papers in your sub-analysis, in the text and/or in the figures (e.g. in
Figure 3 and Table suppl. Figure 3 etc.).
2) In the limitations you should briefly mention the risk of having missed studies in your search. Iâ€™m aware of one
study from our group (Bang CN, AHJ 2012) with a sub-analysis on new-onset AF and the risk of all-cause mortality
in AS patients. Please also include this study in your analysis if suitable.
