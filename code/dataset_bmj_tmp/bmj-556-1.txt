Review comments for manuscript BMJ.2016.033290 ‘Atrial fibrillation and the risks of cardiovascular disease, renal
disease and death: a meta-analysis’ by Odutayo et al.
Odutayo et al. summarized the evidence from prospective observational studies regarding the association of atrial
fibrillation (AF) with a variety of cardiovascular outcomes, renal disease and mortality. The authors performed an
impressive and well-reported effort to summarize this evidence, which will be very helpful for researchers and
decision makers to get a complete overview of the risks associated with the significant population burden of AF. I
think the paper is of interest to the BMJ readers, if the following issues can be addressed or clarified:
Comments
1. Page 5, Methods: the authors should report their search strategy, so others can replicate or build on this. The
search strategy can be supplemented online.
2. Page 5, Methods: describe the study selection criteria (inclusion/exclusion) under a separate header, and explain
why you chose to exclude studies with <100 participants and <6 months follow-up
3. Page 5, Data Extraction and Quality Assessment:
4. Page 5, Methods: the authors correctly address the potential sources of bias regarding adjusting for potential
confounders in multivariable analysis and the method of AF diagnosis at baseline. However, for complete study
quality assessment the authors should consider providing details regarding the following: I) Selection of exposed
(AF) and unexposed (Controls) participants; if Controls were likely to have other health issues, it has to be
considered how this affects the reported relative risk and to what extent this can be projected onto the general
population. II) Completeness of follow-up data; if for some reason a larger proportion of Controls were lost to followup than AF patients, this might bias the reported relative risk. III) Outcome ascertainment during follow-up; was it
possible that AF patients were more closely monitored for outcomes than Controls, for example using routine
administrative data rather than a regularly monitored prospective cohort study? This might bias the reported
association for outcomes other than mortality.
5. Page 6, line 13: explain why studies that did not report the covariates were excluded. Are these studies
presumably of less quality than studies that were minimally adjusted or unadjusted?
6. Page 6, line 16: I agree to distinguish between ‘minimally’ adjusted and ‘adequately’ adjusted relative risks.
However, does it not depend on the outcome of interest regarding which variables should be minimally included as
covariates? Age and gender are standard, but for example where CVD history is relevant for ischemic events, for
stroke we know that the CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors are associated with stroke. Different risk factors will be relevant
for heart failure, bleeding, and other outcomes. With your method, does it mean that the outcome-specific known
risk factors are taken in account for the ‘adequately’ adjusted relative risk, rather than ‘minimally’?
7. Page 6, line 19: should “adequately adjusted” also include adjustment for certain treatments, depending on the
outcome of interest? For example, in recent studies many AF patients will be on oral anticoagulation, which will
lower the relative risk of a stroke.
8. Page 8, line 6: clarify which statistical tests were used to test for trend.
9. Page 8, line 7: clarify why AF type and % oral anticoagulation were not used for stratified analysis, as both had
>9 studies.
10. Page 14, Discussion: the paper could benefit from more extensive discussion of the results. Two examples: I)
relative risks found in general population studies were typically larger than in specific settings. This could be related
to the selection of the Controls and the proportion of AF patients treated with effective evidence-based therapies. II)
the potential publication bias for reporting stroke incidence, and the lower relative risk after removing the studies
that were causing most of the heterogeneity, are important findings. Many scientific papers and funding proposals
are based on the same presumptions regarding the risk for stroke in AF, typically referencing the Framingham study
and other well-known prospective cohort studies. However, your finding might indicate that this risk is actually
lower, or has become lower in recent studies due to higher rates of oral anticoagulation use. Can you explore the
latter and comment more specifically on this issues in the Discussion?
11. Page 17: if AF is simply a marker and not a cause of these outcomes, many risk factors are at play. However,
hypertension deserves special attention as typically 70-80% of AF patients have hypertension, and it is also an
important risk factor for all reported outcomes. Please add this consideration to the Discussion.
12. Page 17: if AF is a marker, but has significant associations with all of these outcomes, this might also indicate
that the selected observational studies are inadequately correcting for the real causes. Please discuss as a
methodological issue, or limitation.
13. Page 17: if AF has a causal relation with the outcomes, treatment of AF should lower their incidence, please
discuss whether there is any evidence for this. Previous rhythm vs. rate control trials (AFFIRM, RACE, others) have
addressed this issue, and with the rhythm control options they had available there was no benefit over rate control.
These studies also assessed other outcomes than stroke. These results meant that either the rhythm control
treatments were not very effective at treating AF, or that AF is not the cause of the non-stroke outcomes. You can

include more recent evidence to discuss this.
14. Page 17: another important AF—specific scenario for illustration: the new oral anticoagulants are at least as
effective at preventing stroke and cause fewer bleedings than warfarin. However, warfarin might prevent some more
myocardial infarctions, one of your non-stroke outcomes.
15. Page 17: a next research step could be to use your absolute risk increases for AF patients to determine what
types of interventions or strategies need to be tested next to further reduce their burden of disease, please
comment.
