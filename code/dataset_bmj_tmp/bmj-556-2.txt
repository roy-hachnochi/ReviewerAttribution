The Authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the relationship between atrial fibrillation
(AF) and the development of cardiovascular disease, renal disease and death. The results of this meta-analysis
involving 9,620,130 participants (6% with AF) demonstrated that AF was associated with increased risk of all-cause
mortality, cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events (MACE), stroke, ischemic stroke, ischaemic heart
disease (IHD), sudden cardiac death (SCD), heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
The increased risk of death and stroke in patients with AF is already well-known and cardiovascular diseases such as
hypertension and heart failure are common co-morbidities in this population, as is CKD. It is important to highlight
that multiple risk factor management (blood pressure control, rate/rhythm control to prevent/reduce risk of HF,
weight, smoking, alcohol intake, diet (all to reduce cardiovascular risk)) is essential in AF patients, as the Authors
conclude, although stroke prevention will necessarily remain a key treatment goal.
* Importance of work to general readers - does this work matter to clinicians, patients, teachers, or policymakers?
Is a general journal the right place for it?
Yes. This is a very comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis and the Authors should be congratulated on
this. In my opinion, the paper is of sufficient interest/importance to general readers to warrant publication in the
BMJ. However, the majority of the results are contained in the very extensive Supplementary Tables (9 Tables) and
Figures (23 Figures) and I feel that this impedes the readability and understanding of the results. I’m not sure how
this can be rectified though or how many Supplementary Tables and Figures the journal allows.
* Scientific reliability
Research Question - clearly defined and appropriately answered?
Yes
Overall design of study - adequate ?
N/A
Participants studied - adequately described and their conditions defined?
N/A
Methods - adequately described? Complies with relevant reporting standard - Eg CONSORT for randomised trials ?
Ethical ?
Yes, overall.
How were the outcomes of congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease and CKD defined in the studies?
Please provide a clear rationale for why American Heart Association estimates of the incidence of cardiovascular
mortality, IHD, HF, SCD were used, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates were used to calculate
the absolute risk increase for each vascular outcome?
MOOSE checklist should be included.
Results - answer the research question? Credible? Well presented?
Yes, but the vast majority of the results are contained in Supplementary Tables (9 Tables) and Figures (23 Figures)
Since the Table of characteristics of the included studies is not included in the main manuscript it would be helpful to
add a short paragraph summarising these in the Results section.
Please explain what Figure 1 represents in the text in the Results section.
The I-squared statistics are very high, demonstrating substantial heterogeneity and this calls into question the
validity of combining the data, although the results reported were broadly similar when studies were excluded until
heterogeneity (I-square statistic) was less than 50%.
Page 10, lines 18-19 “…relative risk of major….” does not make sense. Please clarify.
In Figure 3, when stratified by age, the age groups are overlapping, 64 and 71 appear in 2 groups. It is not clear to
me what the other figures in square brackets on the left hand side for CHD and stroke represent.

Confidence intervals should be written in the format (1.36 to 2.60) within parentheses, using the word "to" rather
than as (1.36, 2.60).
Interpretation and conclusions - warranted by and sufficiently derived from/focused on the data? Message clear?
Yes
The proportion of patients on anticoagulation will likely affect all the outcomes of interest (particularly all-cause
mortality, stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic). The implications of this on the findings should be considered further
and discussed.
References - up to date and relevant? Any glaring omissions?
Yes up to date and relevant.
A reference(s) to a clinical guideline(s) would be more appropriate than reference 5 in the Introduction. It would be
better if you did not reference just one of the NOAC clinical trials (currently reference 4) but included a reference(s)
which summarised the findings of VKA trials (e.g., Hart et al, 2007) and NOAC trials (e.g., Ruff et al, 2014); there
are many others to choose from.
The references in the text should be given as numbers in square brackets or superscript throughout not a mixture of
the two.
The references from 19 onwards are missing from the main reference list.
Abstract/summary/key messages/What this paper adds - reflect accurately what the paper says?
Yes
