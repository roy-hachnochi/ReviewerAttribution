Thank you for the opportunity to review and to the authors for the thorough response. While
the authors provide rationale for their study design choices in the response and in the
manuscript, the use of an active comparator of another medication would enhance the study
methodology. In addition, while the authors provide rationale for their interest in examining the
27 NSAIDs individually (and making specific inferences about their individual hypotheses), to
some degree, the authors are still making generalizations from these hypotheses about the
global association between NSAID use and HF, which one can see in their conclusion. Some
acknowledgement of the risk for multiple comparisons may still therefore be warranted.
