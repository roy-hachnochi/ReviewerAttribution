1. Do the authors have any information regarding the ethnic/racial composition of the birth cohort in the Netherlands?
Is there any specific information on false positive cases?
This would be informative for other jurisdictions interested in adopting this protocol or comparing their results to the
author’s results.
2. It is surprising that only 18 of the 32,622 samples (less than 1 in 1,000) were identified as demonstrating a
maternal RLD variant on serological testing, this rate compares to about a 1 in 100 incidence of weak D predicted in
US studies (Sandler et al Transfusion 2015;55:680-689). Do the authors feel that the majority of prenatal patients
with a weak D type 1, 2 or 3 genotype are being classified as D positive by serologic testing algorithms in use?

3. Since cord blood testing will no longer be performed, will there be any method in place in the future to ensure that
test sensitivity and specificity remain within acceptable limits?
