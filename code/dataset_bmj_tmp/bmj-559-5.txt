De Haas et al reported their experience with implementing a nation-wide foetal RHD screening programme in the
Netherlands. This manuscript reports the results from 32,222 non-immunised Dutch RhD-negative pregnant women.
This very large sample size is a key strength of this study. This feature is a key distinguishing characteristic of this
study compared with a number of other theoretical analyses that have been published in the literature. Perhaps the
only other study that is comparable with the authors’ work is the paper by Neovius et al which reports the results on
6723 subjects tested using RHD DNA screening. However, the study by de Haas et al is still much larger in size.
Another ‘unusual’ feature of the current study is its choice of week 27 of pregnancy as the time for implementing RHD
testing. The high sensitivity and specificity provide justification of such a choice.
I have the following specific comments.
1. The study period ran from July 4th 2011 to October 7th 2012. As it is already June 2016, I wonder whether the
authors might have at least some summary statistics of any updated results since October 2012, which is already
some 3.5 years ago?
2. What is the reasons for the authors having used two diagnostic algorithms in two periods during the study?
3. I find eTable 2 extremely difficult to understand. I think that this table should be completely redesigned. There

should also be a detailed description of how a reader should decipher this table.
4. What is the time delay from blood collection to sample arrival at the laboratory? Did this time delay have any
bearing on the test results?
5. In the field of non-invasive prenatal testing for fetal chromsomal aneuploidies, many laboratories use blood
collection tubes with a preservative. Have the authors tested such tubes for fetal RHD testing? If not, why not?
6. Would using more than 1 mL of plasma further improve the authors’ test results?
