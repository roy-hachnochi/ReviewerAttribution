First; I´d like to congratulate the authors to this excellent study. It´s the largest study on routine noninvasive fetal
RHD screening so far and it will be a landmark study in the field. The results are excellent and answer many questions
regarding implementation and safety of this method in the clinic. For example, it shows that a program with
noninvasive fetal RHD genotyping provides both a higher accuracy and compliance and hence is safer to guide a
prophylaxis program, than routine cord blood serology testing after delivery.
It is a very large and well designed prospective population based study on the performance of noninvasive fetal RHD
screening in pregnancy and the safety of this method to guide antenatal and postnatal anti-D prophylaxis. The
manuscript is clearly written and has an adequate size and numbers of tables, figures and references. It definitely has
an interest for the readers of BMJ.
My questions and comments:
Method section, page 8. Since the need of requiring a new maternal plasma sample is very rare in your study, I would
like to know how much blood you request from the women initially? 7 ml in one tube or more?
How are women with no prenatal typing results handled in the Dutch program? If cord blood serology is not routinely
taken in RhD negative women, what is the risk these women will be missed?
Discussion section, page 18, line 40-42: ”.. such as invasive procedures or LATE MISCARRIAGES OR TERMINATIONS
OF PREGNANCY.”
Conclusion: I suggest you further develop the discussion regarding your findings that noninvasive fetal genotyping for
RHD is safer in guiding prophylaxis than cord blood serology. Both since the accuracy is better, but most importantly
since, in the Netherlands, a cord blood sample was missing in 20% of the women! That is a lot. And this in one of the
most well organized programs in the world. So maybe cord blood serology is no longer the gold standard.
My main issue with the study is why performing the analysis in GA week 27 if the objective is not only to guide
antenatal anti-D prophylaxis, but also postnatal prophylaxis? Even if you would like to avoid the slighty lower
sensitivity in the first trimester, why not performing the testing at 20 weeks (the amount of fetal DNA will be enough
to achieve the same excellent accuracy) to be able to targeted postnatal prophylaxis to all women with preterm births
< 28 weeks as well? In these cases, there is a potential risk that determination of RhD status of the baby will not be
done and the woman will not get anti-D. She then has a high risk of immunization and a complicated future

pregnancy, when she already had serious perinatal event with the preterm birth.
Otherwise, I am happy with the manuscript and recommend it to be accepted for publication in BMJ.
