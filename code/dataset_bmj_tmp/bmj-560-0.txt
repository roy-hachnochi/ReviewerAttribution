Dear Drs Oh, Park and Colleagues –
Thank you for the opportunity to serve as a reviewer of your manuscript, titled “Screening as a cause
of the thyroid cancer epidemic in Korea: evidence from a nationwide study”. Overall I think this is a
carefully constructed paper that will be a useful addition to the literature – I think some will continue
to be concerned that the epidemic is real – but it is still very useful and I think quite powerful.
I think the problem detractors will point out is that rates of small clinically detected tumors also went
up (which you rightly point out could be either misclassification or inaccurate insurance claims). I think
an additional effective argument here might be to add that 8-9mm tumors are just too small for any
patient to notice or physician to find at such high rates. To be palpable or cause symptoms at such a
size they would have to all be located at the isthmus (easier to feel) or external surface of the thyroid
(also easier to feel), or be invading/pressing on the trachea or recurrent nerve or esophagus (not likely
for every single one of these tumors). It falls into the category of what Gil Welch has taught me to
label as - ‘possible, but not particularly plausible’. The clinically detected rates going up as they did is
likely reflective of more complex changes in medical practice than can be seen in higher level data
reviews, and also the problems you point out of misclassification and insurance claim issues.
The remainder of my comments are directed at readability and making sure your discussion section is
complete.
1. Methods section is very well written. I feel like I clearly understand what you did.
2. I like the supplemental tables 3 and 4 (incorrectly labeled in the discussion text as supplemental
tables 2 and 3). They help the reader feel confident in your sampling methods. Waiting until the
discussion seems late to bring them up. Consider mentioning them in the methods or results.
3. There are just so many results, it was a really a struggle for me to cognitively shift gears every time

I was looking at a new way to organize the counts, rates, and changes. Are we really helping the
reader learn something by showing the data so many different ways? This is an editorial and authorial
decision, of course, but I have a few thoughts.
Would it help if it was explained in the text what the value is of seeing an absolute number instead of a
proportion, etc.? Or, another idea - maybe the tables and figures could be notarized in the ‘white
space’ to help the reader see why each way of looking at the data adds something unique to the
paper? This may not be fixable (in some ways, it is the curse of epidemiology that I always struggle
with as an author, myself), but worth thinking about. Also, I know it may not be something the editors
want in their journal, but if it spurs discussion, about how best to present the results, then I will have
helped.
4. In the discussion, reporting relative survival rates of >100% may not be easily understandable to
readers not closely familiar with the various kinds of survival calculations. You may want to take a
minute to explain it, such as by saying ‘rates are >100% because the life tables used to make the
calculation are not exactly representative of those undergoing the screening - those undergoing
screening are healthier than the general population’. Alternatively, you could truncate the rates at
100%.
5. Page 16 line 21: ‘the truth seems to be the opposite” is not followed immediately by a strong
argument of why the truth is opposite. Consider rephrasing to strengthen /clarify the argument or
altering the flow of the discussion.
6. Page 16 line 25 : typo - “and the most” was probably meant to be “and most”
7. Page 17 line 24: ‘one of the first to show a direct association’ of routes of detection, or is this
actually better stated to be ‘the first’? I don’t know of another study that is quite like this one, but
have not done an in depth literature search. There are others that were similar, and it would be polite
to reference them – for example a 2014 study authored by Udelsman in the journal Thyroid that
correlated the density of surgeons, endocrinologists and insurance claims for ultrasound with rates of
thyroid cancer in the U.S. might be a good one.
8. Page 18, lines 24-29: “Although many experts suggested that the increase in the incidence of
thyroid cancer was mainly due to the increasing utilization of imaging tools for thyroid cancer
screening…”, this is an oversimplification of what we now recognize about how thyroid cancers are
detected (and of what Dr. Welch and I said in the discussion section of the paper referenced for this
statement). The problem starts at the macro level, with how health care is paid for at the system level,
and extends all the way down to the microscopic level, with how pathology specimens are processed
these days compared to how they were examined 30 years ago. You will help readers understand the
complexity of the problem by indicating this more fully. I was the head of a task force that looked at
this and published a review paper in 2015 in the journal Endocrine Practice outlining the known
contributors (and non contributors) to the increasing incidence of thyroid cancer, and there was also
another similar paper written in 2013 in the Journal of Cancer Epidemiology with the first author
Pellegriti. Both have good reference lists to show the other work that has been done to illuminate the
various ways thyroid cancers can be detected.
9. Page 20 line 22: typo - “provides an evidence” should be revised to “provides evidence that’.
10. Page 20 line 33: typo – “conserted” is spelled ‘concerted’.
