This is a very good revision and I am happy with their response to my statistical comments.
They do adjust for baseline and have, most importantly, re-worded they interpretation of the
results.
Two minor issues remain:
- It is not clear to me why the quartile baseline value of the FAO score, rather than the
continuous baseline FAO score itself. I doubt this makes much difference, but it seems suboptimal. Perhaps the authors can simpy confirm in the paper that, in their continuous outcome
analyses using SAS PROC MIXED, that the use of a continuous baseline score did not change
findings?
- Also, the authors say in the methods that: “This approach which used all available
assessments including baseline as outcomes …” – I don’t think baseline was an outcome, but an
adjustment factor (covariate), as later you say: “Predictors in the model included baseline FAOS
quartile as a factor …”. You can’t have the baseline as both an outcome and an adjustment
factor.
- in the discussion the authors say that confounding is unlikely to be a problem and 'Baseline
group comparisons essentially demonstrated equivalence on such factors' - yet Table 1 shows
there is slight imbalance, with a higher grade 2 injury % in the physio group. I think the
authors should be clearer about this and tone down their writing here.
