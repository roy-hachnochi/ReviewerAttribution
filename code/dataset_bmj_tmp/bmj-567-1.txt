A very interesting systematic review of a topic that needed assessment.
The conclusions match the results and methods.
The trustworthiness use is very interesting and definitely sensible especially when assessing
wide variety of papers some with only 1 case. However I would be dubious still despite
explanations and appendices for comparison between research of such vastly variable numbers
of raters, patients and patients per rater.
My concerns are regarding the relatively small sample size used in this study in comparison to
number of papers screened with only 22% of reviewed being included. There was also no
assessment made of intra-rater agreement which may also have a large influence in such cases
thus explaining some of variation.
One typographical error on page 7 line 57 - unnecessary ) after occupational functioning.
The unanswered questions are very relevant as well as recommended future research and the
need for standardisation of assessments due to wide inter-rater agreement variability. It casts a
shadow on validity of conclusions of these disability evaluations in clinical and real life.
I would recommend the study paper for publication with minor revisions.
