I. General comments
Since Louise Brown, the first live-birth to be conceived outside her mother's womb via in vitro
fertilization (IVF), born in England in 1978, this treatment for infertility is a complex and
expensive procedure that has since then resulted in millions of births around the world.
Predicting the chances of having a baby after one or more complete cycles of in-vitro fertilisation
is important to clinicians, researchers, policymakers, educators, and patients. For couples having
infertility problem that can be treated by IVF, knowing these chances will empower them in their
decision-making process as well as clinicians to make better healthcare decisions. While previous
studies have either only estimated the individualised chances of a live born baby after a single
fresh embryo transfer or have ignored the contribution of frozen embryo transfers to the
cumulative chances of a live-birth, this article seeks to augment the knowledge base by
estimating the cumulative chances of having a baby over six complete cycles of IVF before
treatment and after the first fresh embryo transfer attempt. Such cumulative prediction model
could potentially aid clinicians and patients in estimating individualised chances of a live-birth
over an entire package of IVF treatment which can potentially help avoid unnecessary side
effects, complications and costs of IVF in treating women who have little chance of success while
ensuring that IVF is not underused in those who have a good prognosis. The results from the
estimated model could help couples plan their time and prepare emotionally and financially for
their complete IVF journey, as noted by the authors.
The study reads well and is ethical. Participants are adequately described, their conditions
defined, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria adequately described. The main outcome
measure is clear. The references are up to date and relevant. The documents in the
supplemental files properly match what is in the manuscript.
II. Scientific reliability
1. Methodology
The research question is clearly defined, but inappropriately answered. The overall design of
study is inappropriate to adequately answer the research question. The authors correctly
consider survival analysis for investigating the time-to-event data at hand, like in most clinical
studies where estimating the cumulative incidence function (or the probability of experiencing an
event by a given time) is of primary interest. However, assumptions about the event-specific
hazard functions matter in research questions in this population-based cohort study. The
standard hazard modelling approach is used in this manuscript. Instead of directly modelling the
timing of the event, the authors model the probability of the occurrence of a live-birth over
multiple complete cycles – one using pre-treatment, and another based on additional
information collected during the first IVF attempt). It, however, does not solve several
methodological problems. First, it provides little insight into how to summarize the information in
past and future covariates (prior to IVF treatment as well as over six complete cycles), and it is
likely to yield biased estimates because of omitted variables bias in estimated models. Second, it
does not solve the dynamic selection problem inherent in cohort data being analyzed. In fact, a
discrete-time logistic regression model provides no insight into the effects of that selection.
Third, this model has the unfortunate characteristic of mixing the parameters for the speed with
which the event (i.e., a live-birth) occurs with the parameters for whether or not the event
occurs. A dynamic strategy that addresses these problems entails a model formulation in
continuous time consisting of applying systems of hazard models. Statistical approaches
conventionally used to analyze such competing risks problem include the cause-specific hazard
(usually best for detecting the effect of an intervention if the intervention only affects either the
primary outcome or the competing event), the cumulative incidence function (usually best when
the intervention affects both primary and competing events, but in opposite directions), and the
event-free survival (usually best only when the intervention affects both primary and competing

events in the same manner). A comprehensive approach using all three approaches will provide
estimates under alternative specifications of the prediction model, and is likely to provide useful
insights on the effect of IVF/ICSI treatment of infertility on the relative and absolute risks of
multiple competing outcomes (a live-birth being the one of primary interest).
When the data consist of patients who experience an event and censored individuals, the
censoring mechanism cannot be assumed to be noninformative nor can it be ignored (by
exclusions of all censored individuals from analyses). In other words, the survival time of an
individual (or the time at which a subject experiences an event) cannot be assumed to be
independent of a mechanism that would cause the patient to be censored, nor can it be ignored
through exclusions of censored individuals. Often times, a patient may experience an event
other than the one of interest which alters the probability of experiencing the event of interest.
Such events are known as competing risk events, and analyses should take this into account. In
this setting, to calculate the cumulative incidence of a specific event of interest (i.e., having a
live-birth after a given complete cycle ci of IVF/ICSI, i varying from 1 to 6): 1) any subject who
does not experience the event of interest can be treated as censored; or 2) a patient
experiencing a competing risk event (e.g., having other pregnancy outcome – e.g., stillbirth -after a given complete cycle ci of IVF/ICSI, i varying from 1 to 6) is censored in an informative
manner. The cumulative incidence function for an event of interest must be calculated by
appropriately accounting for the presence of competing risk events. The authors should consider
competing risks in survival data analysis nonparametric estimation of the cumulative incidence
function for the event of interest in the presence of competing risk events and compare the
resulting estimates with those obtained using the simplistic approach used here, to demonstrate
the importance of appropriately estimating the cumulative incidence of an event of interest in
the presence of competing risk events. In the presence of competing risks data within a
woman’s reproductive life cycle, methods of standard survival analysis such as the discrete time
logistic regression method for estimation of cumulative incidence for the assessment of
covariates lead to incorrect and biased results.
Previous studies have critically evaluates standard assessment methods such as those presented
in this manuscript, and have favored the use of hazard models in which right censored IVF/ICSIto-birth intervals and time varying covariates can be handled. Such model specification controls
not only for couple/woman specific unobserved heterogeneity, but also for cycle specific
stopping unobserved heterogeneity at each complete cycle. A system consists of n-equation
simultaneous equations model in which each equation represents the hazard of making a
particular transition to a live-birth of complete cycle i, is better suited to establish the timesequence between the timing of an IVF/ICSI treatment and the timing of a subsequent livebirth, a necessary exposure-occurrence condition to make “causal” inferences between the
timing of a complete IVF/ICSI treatment and the shift in risks of a following live-birth. When
using time-to-event endpoints that are often influenced by competing risks as it is obviously the
case for these cohort data, standard discrete-time survival analysis techniques used in this
manuscript tend to yield seriously biased results.
2. Omitted variables, confounding variables, and specifications of variables and models
The authors consider two clinical prediction models for estimating the chance of a live-birth over
multiple complete cycles -- one using information available before commencing treatment,
another based on additional information collected during the first IVF attempt. These prediction
models are unsatisfactory because they do not capture the full information available in the data
at hand about a woman’s reproductive life cycle (pre-treatment, during each cycle of IVF/ICSI
treatment, post-treament). The system of hazard models within a life cycle perspective, as
proposed above, is important for several reasons. First, the life cycle approach is the appropriate
method within which to consider the consequences of the stochastic nature of human
reproduction and IVF/ICSI treatment. Second, the dynamic approach provides a more
appropriate methodology within which to examine the relationships between IVF/ICSI treatment
and fertility at each and all complete cycle. Third, modelling human reproduction as a stochastic
process has a long tradition in population biology. Fourth, it allows the estimation of cyclespecific probabilities of a live-birth given relevant covariates up to that cycle as well as the joint
probability over the life-cycle (or over multiple complete cycles) for a given woman or couple.
A number of influential variables for cohort studies of pregnancy outcomes were left out of the
models and analyses, including type of delivery (e.g., singleton birth, twins or other multiple
births), marital status of the woman (and changes in marital status over the study period -potentially a proxy for emotional stability), female age (to be treated as a time-dependent
variable over multiple complete cycles, and not as a fixed covariate at baseline assessment).
Moreover, hazard estimation techniques which incorporated unmeasured heterogeneity – to
adjust for other potentially important predictors of pregnancy outcomes not available in the
HFEA dataset (e.g., female body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol intake,
and measures of ovarian reserve such as antral follicle count) are needed.

III. Minor comments
1. Answers to the following questions will be insightful: what is the pregnancy ratio per embryo
transfer? What is the yearly live birth rate for all couples who undergo this procedure? How
many of those deliveries are twins or other multiple births?
2. Specify the software used for the analysis.
3. Typo in the abstract: couple’s specific…, instead of couples specific…
IV. Abstract, key messages, interpretation of the findings, and conclusions of the study
Because of the importance of the subject matter to clinicians, researchers, policymakers,
educators, and patients, the results of the study need to be retrieved from suitably robust
methods of analysis and estimation methods capturing the full information (especially the
influential factors of pregnancy resolutions under IVF treatment) prior to treatment and during
multiple complete cycles. The Abstract, interpretation of the findings, conclusions of the study,
should be derived from such methods. At a minimum, the authors should provide convincing
arguments that their results, conclusions and key messages are unchanged under alternative
assumptions about the event-specific hazard functions in this population-based cohort study.
