The manuscript was well written and succinct and I appreciate the opportunity to review this work.
I have a few pertinent comments as they relate to patients and how they might find value in this
manuscript and for how this manuscript could be revised to help inform patients:
1. The use of colloquial language should be avoided: e.g. "Sham" trials. As a non medical
professional this particular vernacular seems offensive and unethical. Patients are more familiar
with the "placebo" trial language and although it means the same thing, that some patients are
given a placebo or believe they are receiving the intervention, stating it as an intentional deception
using "sham" does not imply respect to the patient experience.
2. Since the cardiovascular results make up the bulk of the "high quality trials" included, more of a
discussion around the effects found for this particular grouping would help focus some of the
results and provide additional clarity. I am unsure of BMJ word limits, however.
3. Although ischaemic conditioning had no effect on all-cause mortality, I was left wondering about
what effects it did have on the secondary outcomes. Since the secondary outcomes were not
clearly delineated I was unsure what to make of this. Just because something does't prevent death
does it follow that it does not have value? Especially if any of those secondary outcomes lead to an
improved quality of life, which many patients with acute injuries that lead to chronic conditions
(kidneys, heart etc.) will find of value.

4. If all-cause mortality and preventing acute events are the only reason for using this procedure,
and it has limited effects, why would teams choose to use it to begin with? A discussion around this
idea would help clarify why patients should be interested.
