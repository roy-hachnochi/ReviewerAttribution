The authors have done an excellent job of addressing the editorial and peer reviewers comments.
I have two (related) queries.
First, a clarification. On page 32 under strengths and limitations the authors state that they had found 868 men with
alopecia with prescriptions for finasteride to include in the analysis. However, the figure that they report on page 20 in
the results for this group is only 463. Please clarify which figure is correct.
My related points is the sample sizes, and statistical power of the study. Obviously this is an observational study and
sample size is uncontrollable, but the numbers in the alopecia groups, particularly in the case control study; and in all
studies for non-ED sexual dysfunction are not large, and the confidence intervals for these estimates potentially include
clinically important harms. It would seem appropriate that some comment is made about certainty with which
conclusions of "no harm" can be made based on these analyses
