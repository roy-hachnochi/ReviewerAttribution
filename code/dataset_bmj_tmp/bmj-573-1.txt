The authors have provided useful clarifications; this has improved the manuscript. I still have some concerns on the how
cases and controls were matched. From my understanding of the authors' response to my initial comment, it appears
that cases and controls were matched on calendar date and not duration of follow-up. This leaves the door open to some
biases, as it is possible that the "look-back period" was different between cases and controls. This bias can either
underestimate or overestimate the point estimate. For example, if the look-back period is shorter in cases than in
controls, then the controls would have a greater opportunity of being exposed (in the presence of a true association, the
point estimate would be biased downwards). Conversely, if the look-back period is longer in cases than in controls, it
would lead to an overestimate of the association. Because the selection of controls is random, it is not possible to predict
the which direction in which the point estimate will be biased. This bias can be easily prevented by using duration of
follow-up as the underlying time axis versus calendar time.
