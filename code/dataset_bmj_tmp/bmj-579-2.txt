This is excellent work and the authors are to be congratulated for addressing this question. We are often misled by
effect size and consider this as stronger evidence, disregarding the fact that evidence needs to be concluded with
corroborative findings from several sources. We are therefore often challenged as to why we need a second trial if the
first one was so significantly positive; this is especially true in surgery.
The authors have helped us support the need for further trials in any research program.
The only issue that I have is that only a very small number of studies ended up in the analysis. I am suggesting that
the authors address this some more in their discussion with emphasis on whether including trials that did not fulfill the
exact inclusion criteria would alter the results.
Another question may be answered by another study in which the subsequent studies would have variable sizes to
determine whether the difference in results is influenced by the difference in size between the index and subsequent
studies. This can be expanded to more than one subsequent study as well. Another issue that could be addressed is
whether it makes sense to conduct subsequent studies when well designed and adequately powered index studies are
negative nto only by statistcal significance but also by clinical importance.
I would recommend publication of this paper
