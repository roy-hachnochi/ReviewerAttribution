Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection of high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) and develops over several
years through a series of precancers. In addition to HPV-vaccine, cervical cancer can be prevented by detecting and

treatment of precancers before development into invasive cervical cancer. Usually it takes more than 10-15 years from
HPV-infection to development of cervical cancer.
Cervical cytology (Pap-smears or liquid based cytology) is used in most countries with a cervical cancer screening
program. Several countries recommend screening every three year for women 25-65 years of age. In Finland and the
Netherlands they recommend Pap-smear every five years for women 30-60 years of age. In countries with an
organized screening program, the cancer and CIN3+ incidence rates decrease with age because a high proportion of
women with precancer are detected and treated during the three first screening rounds. Thus, the intensity of
screening can be reduced for women 40 years and older.
HPV-testing is more sensitive than cervical cytology and the screening intervals can be extended from three years to
five years without increasing the number of cervical cancers. In the new HPV based screening program which will be
implemented in the Netherlands in 2017, women will be invited for screening at 30, 35, 40, 50 and 60 years of age.
Even though mathematical cost-effectiveness models supports 10 years intervals for HPV negative women above 40
years of age (especially if they have had negative HPV-tests at 30, 35 and 40 years of age), there is limited
documentation that 10 years screening intervals is safe.

Page 2, line 28-34, Abstract: “The cumulative cancer and CIN3+ incidence among hrHPV negative women in the
intervention group, after three rounds of screening (0.009 and 0.0006) were similar to the corresponding cumulative
incidences among cytology-negative women in the control group after two rounds (0.009 and 0.0007)”
The cumulative CIN3+ rate has to be higher than the cumulative cervical cancer rate. I think it is easier for the reader
if the cumulative incidence rates are presented as XX per 100,000 women (similar to Table 1).
Page 2, line 39-41, Abstract: “The long-term CIN3+ and cancer risks among hrHPV negative women are low and are
supportive of an extension of the screening interval up to 10 years” add “for women 40 years and older.”
Page 3, line 25-29, What this paper adds: “This study indicates that the 10-year cancer and CIN3 risks after a
negative hrHPV DNA test are similar to the corresponding 5-year risks after negative cytology and is supportive of an
interval extension to 10 years” add “for women 40 years and older.”
Page 8, line 25-40, Results, “Cumulative cancer incidences after two and three screening rounds (corresponding with
nine and 14 years after baseline, respectively), were 0.0003 (95%CI 0.00003–0.0005) and 0.0009 (95%CI 0.0002–
0.0015) among hrHPV negative women, 0.0001 (95%CI 0.0000–0.0003) and 0.0007 (95%CI 0.0001–0.0013) among
double negative women, and 0.0009 (95%CI 0.0004 – 0.0013) and 0.0019 (95%CI 0.0011-0.0026) among cytology
negative women. Two- and three-round CIN3+ incidences were 0.0031 (95%CI 0.0023–0.0040) and 0.0056 (95%CI
0.0043–0.0069) among hrHPV negative women, 0.0027 (95%CI 0.0019-0.0035) and 0.0052 (95%CI 0.0040–0.0065)
among double negative women, and 0.0069 (95%CI 0.0056-0.0081) and 0.012 (95%CI 0.010-0.014), among
cytology negative women.”
I think it is easier for the reader if the cumulative incidence rates are presented as XX per 100,000 women.
