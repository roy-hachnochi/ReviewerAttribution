GENERAL COMMMENTS
The authors provide new long term outcome data of the POBASCAM randomised trial which compares efficacy of HPVbased versus cytology-based cervical cancer screening.
The results of this study are of high public health relevance since it provides evidence on crucial questions for new
cervical cancer screening policies, such as determination of the screening interval and triage of HPV+ women.
I had the opportunity to review an earlier version of this manuscript. The authors have implemented most reviewers’
remarks and have improved the quality of the paper considerably. Only minor comments are given.
SPECICIF COMMENTS
ABSTRACT
Results. It would be good to mention the rates in the sentences “CIN3+ incidence was 70% lower among HPV negative
was…” and “was 10.4 times higher than among HPV negative women”

RESULTS

“Among HPV negative women, similar incidence rate changes were observed (62.0% for end-point cancer and 72.2%
for CIN3+).” It is not clear what these % mean.
DISCUSSION
Page 11
A limitation to our study is that the presented cancer and CIN3+ incidence estimates were not adjusted for
imperfections in screen detection and diagnostic work-up. This sentence needs explanation for the reader.

Utility of registries. A ref recommending use of linked registries in Europe can be added. (Ann Oncol 2010; 21:44858).
