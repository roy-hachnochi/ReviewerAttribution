Excellent and needed review of the available literature in this sub class of patients with Aortic
stenosis. The low to intermediate risk group constitutes the next step in the evolution of TAVI. The
authors should be commended for their rigorous methodology in attempting to quantify the effect
of not only TAVI versus SAVR, but also balloon expandable versus self expanding platforms, and
transfemoral versus transapical approaches to delivery of the device. Finally, inclusion of patient
representatives in the review panel is unique to my knowledge in this type of review. It is a
welcome inclusion and including their input provides an often overlooked insight into the viewpoint
of a patient. Excellent review of the literature and I look forward to it's publication.
