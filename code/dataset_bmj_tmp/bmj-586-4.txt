The “Transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in low and intermediate risk patients
with severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis” is a well-written paper dealing
with an essential interventional/surgical question; the border between SAVR and TAVI.
The methods used are valid and the analyses are quite comprehensive.
The authors´ conclusion that femoral TAVI is superior to SAVR and that non-femoral TAVI has
results similar or possibly inferior to SAVR is important information, and agreed upon by most
cardiologist, while our surgical colleagues remains skeptical.
Personally, I think the conclusion is valid. However, the studies included in the analysis are
extremely inhomogeneous ranging from the 70-patient prematurely stopped STACCATO trial to
Partner “ including > 2000 patient.
Also, it may be problematic to pool studies on balloon-expandable and self-expandable devices; at
least concerning need of postoperative pacemaker treatment.
Still, the analysis offers valuable information on current TAVI vs. SAVR treatment of low-moderate
risk patients.
The increased risk of heart failure is interesting and should be discussed. The paper does not
include analysis of paravalvular leakage or overall regurgitation. This parameter is difficult to
assess quantitatively, but would be of major interest in the context of heart failure.
