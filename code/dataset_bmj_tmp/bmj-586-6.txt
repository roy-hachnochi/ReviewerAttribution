This is a meta-analysis comparing event rates of TAVI and SAVR in low to intermediate risk AS
patients using only randomised data. The authors are reporting superiority of TAVI for many
important outcomes, especially mortality. However, permanent pacer implant rates and heart
failure symptoms are more common with TAVI. Unfortunately, data on chronic aortic regurgitation
is not provided. Although at least 2 previous meta-analyses included the same trials the current
paper does add important insight into pre-existing data. The methodology followed is robust.
Critique:
I did not quite understand why data on chronic valvular regurgitation is not reported. Severe
chronic aortic regurgitation and associated heart failure can change the long term results of the
trials. This was seen with the famous SYNTAX trial for example. Initial 1 year data showed
equivalence of CABG vs PCI in multivessel disease but long term data clearly showed superiority of
CABG for both mortality and MIs.
I am afraid if authors prematurely conclude that transfemoral TAVI is superior to SAVR in everyone
with this data this may be misleading. Also is there any relation between pacer implants and heart
failure symptoms in these trials. It is clearly known that chronic RV pacing does lead to heart
failure, which can again neutralize the early benefits.
The final paragraph of the article appear too speculative to me.
