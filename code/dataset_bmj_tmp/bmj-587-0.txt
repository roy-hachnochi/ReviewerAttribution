The paper reports on a very well executed study and the presented results will be of international
importance. I recommend to accept the manuscript for publication and have only very minor comments:
- abstract: the blinding of the measurement is not clear in the abstract. It may be worthwhile shortening
the introduction so that more words are available to describe how blinding was achieved.
- some acronyms have to be either defined, or to make it easier on the reader, it would be preferable to
use the full word:
- page 5: CRL
- Page 5: FGLS
- Page 7: FH is used instead of SFH
