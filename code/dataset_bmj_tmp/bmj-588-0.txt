Are the study's aims and the issue and questions that the paper addresses relevant and important to you as a patient?
Do you think it would be relevant to other patients like you? What about carers?
yes, I believe it would be relevant if one is highly interested in this topic. However, I'm not sure most patients are going
to be interested in this topic at this level. It seems very scientific and merely concludes further study is necessary. It
does not directly affect the behavior of patients and their providers.
Are there any areas that you find relevant as a patient or carer that are missing or should be highlighted?
I think it's hard for carers (lay people) to know what "folate, homocysteine, or transsulfuration pathways" are and why
they are significant.
o
Would the treatment, intervention studied, or guidance given work in practice? Is it feasible? What challenges
might patients face that should be considered?
yes, i imagine it would be feasible to study this topic more. But I think the things patients will most get out of this paper
is there is a loose association between CHD and depression and there may be many other things that affect this.
o
Are the outcomes that are being measured in the study or described in the paper the same as the outcomes that
are important to patients? Are there others that should have been considered?
Some patients may be interested. But, most patients are not going to know what folate, homocysteine, or

transsulfuration pathways are or why they are important.
o
Do you have any suggestions that might help the author(s) strengthen their paper to make it more useful for
doctors to share and discuss with patients?
I don't. I think it's a good paper and part of science. But I'm not sure it's a paper patients will want (or even need) to
read.
