The authors have made substantial changes to the paper in response to comments from the
editorial board and reviewers. I am content that the points which I raised have been largely
addressed. I think that the paper, in its revised form, may benefit from a detailed statistical
review to ensure they have done & presented the new analyses correctly (reclassification) and
that their answer as to why they couldn't take the survival nature of the data into account for
their ROC statistics (my point 9) is appropriate.
