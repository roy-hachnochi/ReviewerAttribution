The authors substantially revised the paper, and I think the overall quality has improved.
However, I still have major concerns about several issues.
1) It seems that the implemented imputation procedure is overly simplistic:
* The imputation models do not seem to account for estimation error. In particular, it seems
that missing values have simply been replaced by predictions from a regression model. Also,
there is no mention of combining results from multiple imputed datasets.
* The imputation models appear to only use information from age and sex
* The imputation models are based on linear regression, which might not be reliable for
imputation of nonlinear data such as BMI.
* Smoking status was imputed deterministically as "non-smoker"
I would like to re-iterate that numerous recommendations have been published on how to deal

with missing data. It is not clear to me why the authors did not consult any of these guidelines.
2) The calibration plots in Figure 3 do not seem to be be generated using appropriate methods,
and appear to be based on linear regression models that have been estimated from grouped
points, rather than individual observations. Again, I strongly recommend to consult the
literature on how to generate calibration plots, especially when the outcome represents a binary
endpoint. Note that statistical software exists to generate advanced calibration plots, e.g. the
"rms" package in R from Prof. Harrell.

3) I still miss requested measures of calibration performance such as the calibration slope.

and Updating. 1st ed. New York: Springer; 2009. (Statistics for Biology and Health).
4) The authors did not address my comment that updating the FRAX-10 model renders some
comparisons of performance obsolete (e.g. total O/P ratios, senstivity and specificity). This is a
major limitation of the FRAX-10 model.
Minor comments
1) I previously recommended Poisson approximations for adjusting the baseline hazard of the
model. However, it seems that the authors actually used Poisson regression (i.e. using
individual data points) to adjust the predicted risks into five-year probabilities. Regardless, I
think it is ok in this case to say that all 10y probabilities have been multiplied by a factor of 0.5
to generate 5y probabilities (but I wouldnt recommend the same approach for other types of
validation studies)
2) I am not a big fan of reclassification measures, and think that net benefit approaches would
be more useful for translating measures of prediction model performance to potential impact in
clinical practice.
