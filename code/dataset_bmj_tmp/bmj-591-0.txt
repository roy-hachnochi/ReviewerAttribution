Dear editors and authors:
This is a prospective, multi-centre, multi-country observational study for UGI bleeding. 5 scoring
systems are evaluated for their accuracy in prediction of different clinical outcomes. The authors
have made a tremendous work in this study. However, several concerns need to be addressed:
1. Page 9, Methods;Patient management: paragraph 1, line 7:"Following endoscopy, the policy in all
centres.." How about the policy of timing of endoscopy in all or each site? Please elaborate it since
early (≤ 24 hours) upper GI endoscopy was recommended by international guidelines.
2. Page 13,Results;Comparison of scores ability to predict outcomes; paragraph 2, line 4:
“Intervention or death was recorded in 3.4% of 564 patients with GBS≤ 1, compared with 14% of the
436 patients with ARS=0 and 25% of the 865 patients with AIMS65=0. According Table 3, the
accurate percentage for GBS≤ 1, ARS=o and AIMS65=0 was 4.0%, 16.3% and 33.2%, respectively
3. Page 15, Missing values: Please describe clearly the effects of missing data on the results of the
study and how to manage the missing data, since large numbers of missing values of AIMS 65
(n=511) and Full Rockall score (n=1000) and sample size calculation of the study is based on
AIMS65 and Full Rockall score.
4. Page 23, Table 1: Please add a row for time from admission to performance of endoscopy
(according supplementary table 3, the data should be available.)
5. Page 23, Table 1: Findings at endoscopy: The listed 4 variables (normal findings, gastric/duodenal
ulcer, variceal bleeding, upper GI cancer) only account 52% total endoscopic findings, what are the
other findings? Please illustrate.
6. Page 25, Table 3 CNumber (%) of patients dying during admission among patients classified as
low risk: Please add “or 30-day follow up” after admission since some of low risk patients are treated
as outpatient.
