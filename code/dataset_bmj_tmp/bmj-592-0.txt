This is an interesting and timely article about proposed referendum in California, one of many ongoing efforts to bend the cost
curve, which would have implications for drug pricing, perhaps even across the United States. In the US, the cost of
prescription drugs is an important and pressing issue.
The figures are particularly clearly and illustrative.
I have no major concerns with the manuscript, which is well written and clear. The topic not broached enough perhaps is what
objections the industry would have to this initiative. I imagine that the objections are typical: that any reduction in revenue will

inherently mean less R&D and less innovation. Of course, with profit margins well in the double digits, and so much innovation
occurring in the public sector, I don't find this compelling, but I would appreciate the authors to make their case as to whether
they find it compelling. As well as other potential objections. One of the authors of this piece has elsewhere written a nice piece
on what constitutes fair profits (http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v22/n6/full/nm0616-576.html)
Specific comments:
This argument, "For example, should military service entitle individuals to substantially lower prices for prescription drugs than
poverty or old age"
Strikes me as odd because the price that the agency (VA, Medicaid, Medicare) pays for the drug is not the same as the out of
pocket expense to the individual. The authors could add the average out of pocket expense for each group and then make this
argument.
