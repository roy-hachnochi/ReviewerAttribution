In this manuscript the authors look at the investigation of sex-differences in treatment effects, as
captured in recent Cochrane reviews. The authors are very systematic in their approach, and their
findings suggest that this most basic of subgroup analyses is being conducted in a haphazard
manner with findings which are difficult to interpret. The manuscript is written clearly and I have
only a handful of minor comments:
[1] TOP OF PAGE 8
I suggest that the authors quickly explain why there is particular interest when the first RCT on a
topic shows evidence of a sex difference in treatment effect.
[2] PAGE 14, PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
The authors could point out that with only 7.3% statistically significant findings, the false positives
are likely to outnumber the true positives, making any one such result very difficult to interpret.

Would "... even in the presence of a common relative risk" be a bit clearer as "... even in the
presence of equal treatment effects"?
