This is a interesting study trying to answer a highly relevant question. The study is well performed
and written. I only have a few comments.
1) Did you use fixed-effect model and the random-effects model?
2) Were there any difference in type of ACEi, and as well type of RASi? It would maybe be interesting
to see if you could tease out a difference.
3) I think the conclusion is too strong. The objective of the study was to critically evaluate the
efficacy of RASi in patients with CAD and preserved LV function and to assess whether in 2016 the
control event rate continues to dictates its benefit. The findings showing no benefit of RASi in trials
with active controls is fine. However to conclude that "RASi should no longer be considered preferred
therapy in CAD patients" is a littel bold and not fully in line with the objective of the study.
