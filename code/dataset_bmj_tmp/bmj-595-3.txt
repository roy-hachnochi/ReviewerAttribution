General comment
This is an interesting meta analysis dealing with the benefit from the use of ACEIs in patients with
CAD and preserved LVEF. As recent studies questioned the effectiveness of this class of drugs in low
risk patients as compared to those at high risk, an effort was made to give shape to the hypothesis
that ACEIs should not be considered as a first-line choice for all CAD patients. The authors selected
24 studies yielding about 200,000 patient-years of follow-up using a sound methodological approach.
They concluded that ACEIs reduced CV events and all-cause mortality compared with placebo. This
was independent from BP lowering, except for the outcome of MI. Moreover, the efficacy of ACEIs
was mainly observed in trials where the control event rate was high. Finally, ACEIs did not reduce
the risk of events when compared with active controls such as calcium antagonists or diuretics.
Remarks
- The impact of a different prevalence of DM, statin use, previous MI among the selected trials should
be further discussed;
- Data on incident diabetes mellitus reported in figure 5b deserve a comment in the Discussion
section;
- Looking at figures 1b and 2b, I wonder if the authors could be able to define a threshold of risk
beyond which the use of ACEIs becomes beneficial.
