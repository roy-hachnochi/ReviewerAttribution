This study is now more clearly described. Nevertheless, some issues remain.
1) In the abstract, the results of this observation study are still described in what looks like causal language
2) In the introduction the discussion of previous studies could be clarified and improved. Specifically the 2nd
paragraph of the introduction quotes both a couple of selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of testosterone on
cardiovascular disease and meta-analyses including these RCTs. It makes more sense simply to give the totality of
evidence rather than to single out a couple of RCTs without explanation. So the 2nd sentence of the 2nd paragraph of
the Introduction would be best deleted. The next sentence (3rd sentence) on observational studies is missing
references and again would be best to quote meta-analyses, with references, where possible. The next sentence (4th
sentence) on meta-analysis of RCTs of testosterone on cardiovascular disease is again missing references to these
meta-analyses, which should be added. The 5th sentence implies that the Health Canada and FDA required a warning
about venous thromboembolism on testosterone following the publication of these meta-analyses of RCTs, however
some of them were published after the warning. Moreover, the publicity following Vigen’s and Finkle’s papers seem to
have been more of a catalyst for action. Finally, as regards the evidence on VTE it would be better to give the
observational evidence then the experimental evidence, rather than the reverse which implies that observational
evidence trumps experimental evidence.
3) The definition of the exposure should be in the exposure section rather than in the Statistical analysis section.
4) I am still worried as to whether considering testosterone by duration of use introduces bias. Case-control studies
are open to time-related biases, specifically “we show the importance of insuring an equal time window to measure
exposure for cases and controls”. Time-window bias in case-control studies: statins and lung cancer. Suissa S,
Dell'aniello S, Vahey S, Renoux C. Epidemiology. 2011 Mar;22(2):228-31. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0b013e3182093a0f.
PMID:21228697. It is not clear to me that dividing testosterone use into never, ≤6 months and >6 months fulfills that
criterion. In addition, in order to be in the >6 months testosterone use category, the man cannot have a VTE in the
first 6 months of testosterone use which might give a different period of observation for cases and controls. As such, it
would be very helpful if in the discussion the authors could explain that case-control studies are open to time-related
biases, but their study is not open to such a bias when considering men by testosterone exposure duration. Such an
explanation would strengthen the study considerably, as the difference in risk of VTE by testosterone exposure
duration is the main finding.
5) It would still be better to justify the matching and adjustment variables as confounders (i.e., common causes of
testosterone prescription and VTE)

6) The very different results by pathological hypogonadism status require some explanation in the discussion. Does
testosterone have a different effect in men with pathological hypogonadism? In this case the estimates would be fine.
Is it possible that men with pathological hypogonadism and susceptible to VTE from testosterone have somehow been
weeded out of the sample available to the study, perhaps because they are already dead or have already had a
previous VTE? In this case the estimates would be biased towards the null by selection bias, as explained here in a
different context: Cigarette smoking and dementia: potential selection bias in the elderly. Hernán MA, Alonso A,
