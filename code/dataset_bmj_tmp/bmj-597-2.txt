I believe the authors have done adequately replied to all the reviewers’ comments and that the manuscript is clear and
accurate.
I have two very minor points for clarification:
1) The sensitivity quoted is 92% which means that roughly 10% of cases could be missing. This would only be an
issue if there were differential identification (e.g. identification of VTE case more likely if treated with testosterone).
This is unlikely to be the case but might be worth including in the Discussion.
2) Their definition of Recent use, I believe it should be – “that ended at a point between 2 years before and 30 (or
31?) days before index date”.
