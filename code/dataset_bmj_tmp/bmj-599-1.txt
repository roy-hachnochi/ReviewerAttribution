I was favorably impressed with this paper. Heart failure is a common diagnosis, especially in the
elderly, and involves high morbidity and mortality. Recognizing a history of community acquired
pneumonia as a risk factor for the development of heart failure is potentially useful in the
management of these patients. This is true whether CAP actually causes HF, or is simply a marker of
higher risk. I have very few comments on the paper. It might be helpful to elaborate a bit on how
primary care physicians could use this information in terms of managing modifiable risk factors for
heart failure in these patients, and whether there is any information suitable to be given to patients
who have had CAP in that regard.
A minor point: “heart failure” can be used as a noun or as part of a compound adjective (e.g.,
“heart-failure-related hospitalization”). To avoid confusion, the words should not be hyphenated
when used as a noun. For example, in the results section of the abstract, the phrase “combined
endpoint of heart-failure or all-cause mortality” could be misread to mean “combined endpoint of
heart-failure mortality or all-cause mortality,” because of the inclusion of the hyphen in “heartfailure.” Someone reading the abstract might be unclear on whether the intended meaning was
“heart failure” (noun) or “heart-failure mortality” (“heart-failure” is a compound adjective modifying
“mortality”). Similar errors occur throughout the paper.
