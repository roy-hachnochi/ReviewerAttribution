The authors have responded positively to all my comments, and Table 3 in particular is now
much clearer.
I have a few further minor comments, which are more copy editing than statistical.
1. Table 2 contains small numbers labelled Std following the AUC values. They are said to be
standard deviations, but are far too small for that. I suggest omitting them, as in Supplements
5 and 6.
2. Data are generally plural, and such phrases as "data contains", "data ... is", "data does",
"data was" etc need attention.
3. Start of Discussion. The main findings are principal not principle findings.
4. Page 42 line 9. I think it should be humerus not humerous.
