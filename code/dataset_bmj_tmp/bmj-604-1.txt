This a very nicely written paper that explores the relationship of exposure of fetuses/infants to antenatal
corticosteroids (ACS) to death and/or major morbidities between 23 and 34 completed weeks. The analysis
plan is ell outlined and follows a similar pattern as some of the other major papers on this topic conducted
by members of this group.
I have a few minor comments:
1. I agrees that this is a cohort design but my guess is that this is a retrospective study of data that is
collected for the Pediatrix Clinical Data Warehouse. So the real description of the design is a retrospective
cohort design.
2. Most of the discussion focuses on the findings for the infants <30 weeks which is quite appropriate but I
think it would be helpful to comment on the group of infants â‰¥ 30 completed weeks especially as the
incidence of the outcome measures are much lower and the NNT increases significantly. Arguments for and
against ACS are important to include I think as concerns about long-term effects of ACS will come up.
