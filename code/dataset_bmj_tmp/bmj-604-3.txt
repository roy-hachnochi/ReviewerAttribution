Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript, which addresses the impact any antenatal
corticosteroid on death or, a composite of death or individual sequelae of prematurity, according to the
week of gestation at birth. They use a database of 117,000 infants, apparently the largest study to date by
far.
The manuscript is generally well written and clear with a logical flow.
There are some methodological concerns:
1) The manuscript addresses the issue of “any antenatal corticosteroids”, rather than the “ideal dose of
antenatal corticosteroids”, and in fact appears to include both inadequate dosing and overdosing with
multiple doses of antenatal corticosteroids.
a. This issue should be flagged immediately to the readers by adding the word “Any” to the title.
b. Although it is mentioned in the definition, it should be repeated in the limitations section.
c. Since multiple doses of steroids improve short term outcomes like lung function, but have adverse
effects on long term outcomes related to growth that extend even into childhood, it would have been ideal
to limit the population to those receiving no more than 1 complete course of Betamethasone, or at the least
to do a sensitivity analysis, but this does not appear to be possible given the structure of the data. Again,
noting this in the limitations section would be important.
2) It is important for all observational studies to include the STROBE checklist, as well as figure 1 that
depicts:
a. the number of infants for whom data was missing,
b. loss to follow-up, etc.
c. How much missing data is there on the outcomes of interest, and on predictors?
3) It would be helpful to know more about the Pediatrix Clinical Data Warehouse.
a. Is this an insurance company based database?
b. Has it been validated? If not, this would be an important limitation to mention
4) In the analysis section, it is mentioned that birth weight was adjusted for. Line 37, “Adjusting for factors
present at birth . . . birth weight, sex, mode of delivery and mutliples” This is generally highly correlated
with gestational age at birth.
a. Was this examined?
b. Later in lines 44-49 mentions other variables including small for gestational age <10% which were ?tried
but not retained in the mod
5) There appear to be a number of important predictor variables not included in the regression analyses,
including for instance socioeconomic status, congenital anomalies, chorioamnionitis, ‘outborn versus inborn’
(i.e. in a tertiary centre), and most importantly surfactant use, etc. Was data on these not available? If so,
noting this in the limitations section would be important.
6) Why was a composite of death or individual sequelae of prematurity selected as ?primary analyses,
rather than a composite of death or all of the (major) sequelae (for example death or any of the following:
severe, grade 3 or 4 intracranial hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis stage II or higher, severe ROP,
BPD)? Examining the sequelae individually does ‘isolate’ the effect of steroids on each if you will, and I
could understand doing that as a secondary analysis, but clinically, most parents and clinicians want to
know about mortality or any major morbidity, not individual morbidities.
a. This outcome does appear in Table 3, but it goes almost unnoticed.
7) Table 2 shows that it is not just up to 30 weeks that there is benefit from steroids, yet this is not much
emphasized.
a. It feels like somewhat artificial that 30 weeks is emphasized to the degree it is throughout the
manuscript.
b. One example of this is in the Abstract results, and it comes again in Line 20 of p. 10, “The current study
shows a survival benefit associated with the exposure to steroids at each gestational age <30 weeks. In
the Cochrane review . . . subgroup analysis of those infants less than 30 weeks showed that rates of
neonatal death were not significantly decreased”. Nor were rates <28, but this is due to the small #s in the
RCTs as the authors acknowledged elsewhere, and the point estimates are still much less than 1.
c. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death was not significantly reduced after 24 weeks in this study either,
and this is a key outcome that one would expect would be.

d. Although it is stated in the final sentence of the results that “Benefits were less consistent for infants
born >/=30 weeks”, if one looks at the other 20 outcomes beyond Bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death in
Table 2, 13 out of 20 show benefit. Hence, it looks like the guidelines are correct in recommending
steroids to 34 weeks. Again, it is unclear given this why the emphasis is on 30 weeks to the extent that it
is in the manuscript.
8) It would be helpful if all post hoc analyses were labelled as such. For instance, the outcome measures
that are listed on page 6 in the methods section are either death or a competing composite outcome
independent of death. However, in table 3, there are a number of additional outcomes including the
individual sequelae of prematurity, survival without major hospital morbidity, and ventilation day 0, 1,
and/or 2 after birth.
9) Twin outcome data was included, but there did not appear to be analyses took into account the
correlated nature of these outcomes like GEE.
10) The final sentence of the manuscript needs revision. It currently reads “in the absence of evidence from
randomized control trials, this study supports the current recommendations for the administration of
antenatal corticosteroids to women with threatened preterm labor from 23 to 34 weeks gestation.” This
suggest there are no RCTs spanning that time frame which is not true and is surely not what the authors
intended to convey.
11) There are similar issues with wording on the What is already known section.
a. The last sentence “Previous studies have not examined the effect of antenatal corticosteroids at all
gestations for which administration is currently recommended.” The RCTs did span 24-34 weeks, hence
this should be revised.
b. Even the 1st sentence would be better if revised. “Meta-analyses of RCT have shown no difference in
mortality in infants <30 wks.”The subgroup analysis shows no benefit in infants born <30wks but the
overall Cochrane states that there is benefit. (RR 0.77, 0.67 to 0.89)
Suggestions to editors are included here, given that there does not appear to be a separate place to include
them:
1) I would strongly advocate blinding the reviewer to the authors and their institutions. Although I do not
believe that I have been unduly influenced by having the knowledge of the authors and their institutions as
I am not familiar with them, however, I believe that in other instances, this might occur for some
reviewers. I can not see a down-side to this blinding. Since we all acknowledge the benefits in RCTs, why
do we not use the benefits in reviews?
2) I would strongly advocate that journals consider using software to detect plagiarism/self-plagiarism even
if it means charging authors a fee for publishing in their journal to off-set the costs of the software.
My review indeed assumes that this has already been done, as I am sure that the Journal would want to
prevent inadvertent publication of work that has been previously published.
Thank you for considering these two points. I would welcome any feedback you have.
