International Medical Graduates (IMGs) make up more than 20% of the workforce in USA, UK, Canada and Australia. They are
the backbone of some specialties and geographical areas where locally trained doctors are reluctant to work. However the
IMGs are often targeted when things go wrong , often from system issues, in the media. So this article looking at the
performance of IMGs and measuring the usual bench marks like mortality, readmission rates and cost is very timely. The
authors have measured this in common clinical conditions where the internists take care of the patients. When this happens in
lower socio economic groups in smaller set ups , the results are more significant
The methodology and sample size are adequate and the paper is well written.
It is interesting to note more IMGs work in internal medicine compared to the local graduates. May be better outcomes are
from more "holistic " care given by the internists than subspecialists?
Overall good paper with good take home messages for IMGs and people involved in assessing them and licencing bodies
