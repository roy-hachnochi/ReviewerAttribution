Reviewer- Pinar Karaca-Mandic, PhD
This is an important paper that nicely analyzes the prevalence and implications of concomitant use of
opioids and benzodiazepines. I have several general comments:
1) It is not clear why all enrollees are included in the study sample. Given the focus on whether an
individual who is an opioid user also uses benzodiazepines, I believe the study sample should be included
only to the opioid users, and all the descriptive statistics and multivariate models should be estimated on
this sample of opioid users.
2) Authors define concomitant use as “having filled one opioid prescription and one benzodiazepine
prescription in a given year”. One year seems like a very wide window. Is this measure validated
elsewhere? Authors acknowledge that this measure allows for the possibility that a person may be using
opioids and the benzodiazepine in a way that is not temporally related. They in fact conduct a sensitivity
analysis where they compute the temporal overlap of the two prescriptions. Re-defining concomitant use
based on some temporal overlap definition would make the paper much stronger. For example, among
opioid users, define concomitant users is they used a benzodiazepine if there is at least X days of overlap.
At the minimum, authors should define concomitant use within a shorter time frame than a year: “within a
month”, or “within three months”. These should be the main models throughout the paper.
3) In multivariate models that relate concomitant use to outcomes such as ER use and hospitalization, the
unit of observation is a person-year. This suggests that the person could have an ER visit, and engage in
concomitant use afterwards. While showing the association is interesting, interpretation of the direction is
difficult. Authors could consider setting up a follow-up time after the first date of opioid use. Both the
concomitant use and outcomes such as hospitalizations/ER visits could be evaluated during this follow up
time.
4) If the unit of analysis is person-year, and if the study sample includes only opioid users in a given year
(see comment 1 above), then it is not clear why authors need to impose the strong restriction of
continuous enrollment over a 13 year period. I would think continuous enrollment for a few years, or even
only one year would be sufficient, and it would significantly increase the sample size.
Abstract

Line24: are all insured (N=423,841) included, or only the opioid users among them? Does this N represent
unique individuals or person-year observations?
Line 26: Define the relevant time frame for concomitant use (during the same month? Anytime during the
year?)
Line 29: Is the outcome “percent of opioid users who also used benzodiazepines” or “an indicator for
whether the opioid user individual also used benzodiazepines”? also specify the time period for concomitant
use.
Line 43: The sentence/result “population attributable fraction for concomitant benzodiazepine/opioid use
was 0.500…” is jargon/unclear.
Introduction
• Please be specific about the time frame of concomitant use (and co-prescribing) throughout in general
and when referring to particular studies. Do all studies consider concomitant use within the same time
frame (same day, same month, same year, overlapping by X days etc).
• Motivate why looking at the privately insured is interesting and lay out hypotheses on how the findings
could differ potentially from the veteran population. This may be especially important for the non-USA
readership not familiar with the veteran population versus the privately insured.
Methods/Data: Discuss the national representation of Marketscan in terms of general geographic
racial/ethnic representation.
Methods/Sample: Specify if the continuously enrolled sample were required to have enrollment both in
medical and pharmacy benefits.
Methods/Sample: why does the sample include individuals who have never used an opioid. Given the main
focus of the paper as concomitant use, study sample should be limited only to those who are opioid users
in a given year. A
Methods/Outcomes: Specify the time frame for when the outcome variables are defined. For example, is
there a follow-up period from when the concomitant benzodiazepine/opioid use? Or are ER
visits/hospitalizations examined the same year as the concomitant benzodiazepine/opioid use? If so,
authors should limit the study to examine outcomes after the observation of the concomitant
benzodiazepine/opioid use. Otherwise, it is not clear how to interpret the ER/hospitalization outcomes
before the concomitant use.
Methods/Sample (p9/lines13-20): This is the first time authors define concomitant use as “having filled one
opioid prescription and one benzodiazepine prescription in a given year”. This should be stated earlier. In
addition, per general comments above, one year seems like a very wide window. Is this measure validated
elsewhere? Comment on its relevance clinically.
Methods/ sensitivity analyses: Given the substantial reduction in sample size, I am not sure that the model
with patient-level fixed effects add much value to the paper.
Table 1: Per general comments above, it is not clear that the column for overall (n=423,841) provides
relevant information. The table should focus on opioid users and compare -BZD and +BZD
Figure 1: This figure is about opioid prevalence. Per general comments above, it is not directly related to
the main research question of concomitant use of benzodiazepines among opioid users. I would remove
this figure.
Figure 2: uses a title “co-prescribing”. Is this the same definition as “concomitant use”? If so, please be
consistent.
Figure 3: Need to refer to this when discussing it (page 13, lines49-57; page 14, lines 4-13).
Figure 4: Showing relative risks is useful, but it would be more informative to show unadjusted and
adjusted absolute risks of opioid overdose risks for opioid users who are concomitant users and those who
are not.
