This is an interesting study conveying an important message: that patients presenting with chest
pain that remains undiagnosed after 6 months are at significantly higher risk of cardiovascular
events over 5.5 years than those who can be confidently diagnosed with non-cardiac pain
(unsurprising – it has not been possible to exclude CHD and some of them have it) but more
importantly, that they carry a greater burden of myocardial infarction over this longer period than
those diagnosed by six months with angina, because of their greater numbers. This finding I agree
justifies the main conclusion, that such patients should be more actively investigated and followed
up with an awareness of their increased risk, as many of these subsequent events are preventable.
However, over the shorter term (the first six months) an assumption is made that a lack of specific
(cardiac or non-cardiac) diagnosis by the GP at initial presentation indicates diagnostic uncertainty,
and this is not necessarily the case. Entry into the record of a CHD code immediately enters the
patient on to the CHD register, and however certain the GP is that the patient is describing for
instance, angina, s/he should not use an Angina code at this point. CHD is a secondary care
diagnosis, particularly since the Quality and Outcomes Framework established these registers in
April 2004, during the data collection period of this study. So according to best practice, a patient
presents with classical exertional angina to their GP, who enters ‘Chest pain’ as a code in the record,
refers to the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic, who 2 days later confirms the diagnosis, coded in the
secondary care record and then (following receipt of the report) into the primary care record. No
diagnostic uncertainty on anyone’s part, but this patient would be included in the ‘diagnostically
uncertain’ group. Such people inevitably have a high risk of being diagnosed with CHD in the next
six months, many (if I’ve understood the study design) will be in the next few days.
Those still undiagnosed at six months are another matter however, as these people will have (many
of them) been investigated to some degree and their diagnosis remains unclear, or at least uncoded.
I should point out that some presenting with initial ‘diagnostic uncertainty’ will later be confidently
reassured that the cause is non-cardiac but there may be little motivation to add a non-cardiac
diagnostic code in the record. Along with those whose diagnosis is genuinely undetermined at six
months, this group has, apparently a higher burden of subsequent myocardial infarction than the

group diagnosed with angina or myocardial infarction during the first six months, simply because
there are so many of them. This is an important finding which could change practice, because the
conclusion is that as a group they should be investigated more thoroughly.
