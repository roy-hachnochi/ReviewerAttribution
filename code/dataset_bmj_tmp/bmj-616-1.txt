This major undertaking of evidence synthesis on the important topic of ovulation induction therapy in
polycystic ovary syndrome makes a significant contribution to guide clinical practice and will inform
upcoming evidence based guidelines. This work exemplifies the role that network meta analyses can play
when there is a sizeable body if research yet it cannot directly answer key clinical questions on optimal first
line therapies as it is not possible for RCTs to study all possible therapies with each other.

The strengths of this work include the overall numbers of women studied and the ability to enable
exploration of the outcomes across
- pregnancy
- live birth
-ovulation
-multiple births
-miscarriage
The other strength is the ability to rank all treatments in a pooled analysis with inbuilt strategies to reduce
bias. Limitations are well discussed. Perhaps the most important is the fact that the authors did not pursue
aligned data from original authors to enable subgroup analysis, based on body mass index (BMI) and
ethnicity. Whilst IPD could enable this, it is a massive body of work and an interim measure could have
been to request data be reanalyzed and presented by original authors in away to enable this analysis.
In the discussion the authors note that new trials evaluating ovulation induction should either compare
letrozole to the combination of clomiphene and metformin. Further justification of why letrazole should be
compared to metformin in future and what gaps this would address would be useful.
The statement that" In women with WHO group II anovulation, expectant management is not
recommended, as pharmacological ovulation induction significantly improve pregnancy rate (OR 2.43 to
6.11) compared to placebo no treatment." may warrant clarification. One would presume this refers to
women who have defined infertility following 12 months of failing to conceive. The way this statement
currently read could mislead readers to think that in women with PCOS, OI should be used firstline at the
time fertility is desired without allowing time for spontaneous conception.
In the discussion only the UK NICE guidelines are referred to. It would be useful to contextualize this work
with the initial evidence based guidelines in PCOS which were recently updated and recommend both
Clomiphene and Letrazole firstline (Teede et al) and the recent WHO guidelines on infertility management
(Balen et al). Indeed, whilst there are many included tables and figure here, a table on current
recommendations from key quality guidelines would be useful to contextualize the novelty and importance
of this work. It would highlight the potential impact of the current work, whereby all guidelines would now
need to be updated or modified in some way, based on this work, especially in relation to clomiphene +
metformin vs clomiphene alone and letrazole.
Was it not possible to explore congenital abnormalities in this network meta analysis as this is the main
remaining concern in relation to letrazole?
Given the complex statistical approaches used in the current study a review by a statistician familiar with
this methodology would be useful.
