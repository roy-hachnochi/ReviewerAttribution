This is a interesting and pertinent article describing the relationship between birth weight and adult
lifestyle with type 2 diabetes.
In general, the authors do a nice job of describing the study design and presenting their results.
However, the entire article, particularly the abstract and background need to be copy edited for
grammatical errors.
I have a few questions/suggestions:
1) I know the authors are using the healthy lifestyle score they previously developed and published but I
think this manuscript would be strengthened by addressing why this score does not include blood
pressure (i.e., hypertension) and/or cholesterol when we know these two factors are also very important
to determining later-life risks for chronic conditions.
2) Within the healthy lifestyle score, I would assume that unhealthy diet score and BMI would be highly
correlated with one another, why include both in this score?
3) I think some discussion is warranted regarding heavier babies so those >4kg, some studies have
suggested a U shaped curve in that there is increased risk for T2D in both small and large babies, but
that doesn't seem the case in this study.
4) I think more discussion is needed on the gender differences and possible explanations in regards to
men versus women. These differences could be due to pregnancy complications such as GDM (which we
know greatly increases a woman's risk for later T2DM) as well as other hormonal and reproductive risk
factors.
