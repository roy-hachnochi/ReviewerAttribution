Chen and colleges have submitted an interesting manuscript on how ICD performs in a real world
setting outside the RCT, in patients with a primary prophylactic indication for ICD.
The topic is relevant as there is an ongoing debate on how clinical studies translate into guidelines and
clinical practice. In the case of primary prophylactic ICD, it has been discussed if the large RCT´s
(reference #1 and #2) supporting the general recommendation for ICD implant, has been overinterpretated especially when the population offered ICD implantation differs from the original
population studied in the RCT´s. In this context, age could be of importance, as co-morbidities may
play a bigger role compared to SCD. Specific co-morbidities expressed as non-elective admission
preceding ICD implantation, should also be taken into account when comparing the landmark studies
to current clinical practice.
In the presented study, the authors have drawn a subset of patients age > 66 years who are admitted
for heart failure or other acute conditions and compared patients with- or without ICD implantations.
By combination of different registries, the authors try to “examine the effectiveness of primary ICDs in

elderly patients”.
I have the following comments:
The concept of introducing latency analysis is very well explained and executed, and is a new way of
looking at this complex field. The statistics is adequately described.
My general concern is the choice of study population and comparison to landmark trial. Although it is
clear that the authors seek to examine the elderly, there are numerous comparisons to the landmark
trials MADIT II and SCD-HeFT. The population included in these trials are different in several aspect.
Most importantly they are considerable younger than the patients included in the current study. The
median age in SCD-HeFT was 60.1 and in MADIT II the mean age was 64 y. The current study only
included age > 66 years. The authors have discussed this in details in the last part of the paper, but I
think that the focus the elderly population beyond the scope of the landmark trials raises the following
question:
1. Is it a problem? Is the current pattern of ICD implantations worldwide shifted towards populations
not covered by the original RCT´s? Do the authors have any references to support this (assumption)?
In a recent paper in Europace (doi.org/10.1093/europace/eut017), the mean age in a population of
Danish patients for primary ICD, the mean age was between 65-59 years.
2. Are the guidelines promoting primary ICD wrong? Should the guidelines include caveats?
3. Should we do a RCT in the elderly?
4. It is not sufficiently clear that the current study seeks to examine the ICD effectiveness outside the
population that has been studied in the cited landmark trials.
5. The age distribution in the two often cited landmark trials (#1 and #2) should be mentioned, so the
difference between these studies and the current study it is clear. Even in the conclusion it is
mentioned that the effectiveness is present in the current study as demonstrated in previously pivotal
trials.
Minor comments:
6. The average non-US reader of BMJ, as the current reviewer, may not be as familiar to the North
American healthcare insurance system, and therefore the use of MEDICARE and MEDICAID as a
reference population is not clear enough. It might be better to describe the populations and the
generalizability in more generic terms instead of e.g. noting if patients are “eligible for Medicare” (p.
12, Study population). There is a large appendix, but the paper would improve its readability if these
issues were explained directly in the main part of the paper.
7. The paper is in general very well written. However, the sentence p. 20 starting with: “Third, due to
the chosen…” doesn’t make any sense.
