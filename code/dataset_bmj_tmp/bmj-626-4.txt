The authors should be commended for using the SPARCS database to enable to study
such a large numbers of surgical cases. It is a very thought provoking manuscript.
I have a few comments. While the paper benefits from these large numbers, it runs
the risk of confounding variables biasing the results. The nature of the SPARCS
database may prohibit the ability for these potentially confounding variables. The
biggest potential confounding variable is that of concomitant sling. In Table 1 and in
discussion of the regression analysis I see no mention of concomitant sling. It is quite
likely that surgeons who utilize "mesh" in there repair, may be more likely to do a
concomitant sling procedure or other anti-incontinence procedure. If this is the case,
then all of the finding that the authors attribute to "mesh" may be in fact related to
anti-incontinence procedures, not "Mesh." I apologize if I missed how this was
controlled for, but I can't seem to find any reference to it in the paper. If it was not
controlled for, the conclusions form this observational study may not be valid.
Furhtermore, I don't see any way in which degree of pre-operative degree of
prolapse is controlled for; it is also likely that the case in "mesh" arms of the study
were done for more severe prolapsed than the "non mesh" arm" and this could also
potentially explain postoperative differences between the groups.
I also think the verbiage in the paper should be changed. This is not a study of
"mesh", it is a study of augmenting "grafts". It is made clear in the Methods that
mesh was defined in the study as including synthetic and biologic materials. Most
biologic graft are in no way mesh-like in their make-up. I feel the authors should
therefor use the more accurate term of graft and not "mesh". Otherwise the
conclusions are inaccurate and misleading. It is also unclear whether sacral
colpopexies were included in the "mesh" or the "No Mesh" group. Sacral Colpopexies
almost invariably utilize "mesh", but this cannot be coded/billed for separately the
way it is for in vaginal surgery. There should be some discussion of this issue in the
Discussion.
Finally, I think the "Discussion" section need to be revised. The last sentence states
that "Our study helps inform regulators, clinicians and patients in the absence of
clinical trial data." There is not an "absence of clinical trail data." There are multiple
randomized clinical trials (which by design drastically limit the risk of confounding
bias) investigating this very issue. One of the few RCT's they do reference is
misleading. They reference the Altman RCT by saying that this trial showed "mesh
patients had higher risks of bladder emptying difficulties". This finding in the trial was
only during the hospital stay. THere was no difference between groups in intervention
for urinary retention, and in fact at one year follow-up, the patients in that trial in the
mesh arm demonstrated significantly less bother on the Obstruction sub-scale of the
UDI as compared to the non-mesh patients.
There should also be some discussion about the purpose of utilizing augmenting
grafts in prolapse repair. The purpose is to increase the durability of the repair. I am
not suggesting that there is strong evidence to suggest that graft achieve this goal

(although that was certainly the finding in the Altman study at one year), but
whether or not they do is not addressed in this study. Any surgeon who employs
grafts in their surgical repair, does so with the knowledge that s/he is exposing
her/his patent to potential graft-specific complications such as graft erosion. S/he
does this with the expectation that the trade-off of a more durable repair in the longterm (i.e. greater than just one year of follow-up) is worth this risk. It should be
acknowledged in the Discussion, that while this study can look at the risk of reintervention in the first year, it can not look at the other side of the equation. With
numbers this large (n~15,000 after matching) the 1% difference (3.3% vs 2.3%) is
certainly statistically significant. Is it clinically significant especially if the rate of
prolapse recurrence is possibly lower. I can't answer that definitively, but I think the
issue should be addressed in the Discussion.
Thank you very much to the editors for the opportunity to review and to the authors
for all the hard work they put into this interesting study.
