This is an interesting but controversial topic and worth publishing. It will certainly
generate public and media interest, probably appropriately, although almost
evidence is indirect. It is a bit wordy and could do with some editorial trimming.
On page one line 44 I think the word pragmatic is a typo for practical. On page 2 I
know that non human primates have been infected experimentally, have they
checked thoroughly enough for data on infecting doses used?

The article could be improved by more acknowledgement by the authors of the
very real difficulties of reducing exposures within a small house/flat especially with
one toilet shared etc; inclusion of a few practical examples of how to achieve this
would carry a bit of weight. Since the authors have a direct interest in “Germ

Defence” I think they should be explicit about this in the text as well as in
contributor statements, as they push it very heavily in the text. Are there no other
successful community behavioural initiatives and/or websites they can cite to
offset this rather heavy bit of self-promotion?

There is a similar but punchier article in New Scientist a few days ago
https://www.newscientist.com/article/2238819-does-a-high-viral-load-or-infectiou
s-dose-make-covid-19-worse/ which is more circumspect. That article cites a
useful paper from Liu in China supporting the role of higher viral loads at
presentation and thereafter being associated with poor outcome and should also
be cited here
