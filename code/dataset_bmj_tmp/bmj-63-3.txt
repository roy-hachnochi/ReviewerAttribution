the manuscript under review is an opinion article. It is a short, and rather
interesting, read regarding the possibility of reducing Covid-19 infectivity and
severity bij lowering the viral inoculum amongst household contacts.
As the authors state themselves, there is limited evidence regarding the
association between the viral load and the infectivity of Covid-19 at this point in
time. However, based on experimental data and observational data on other
virusses, the authors state that there probably is an association between the viral
load of Covid-19 and its infectivity. Although this point is clearly pointed out and
seems plausible, it is not quite clear what the practical implications of this
association should be.
Do the authors suggest using PPE by household contacts of Covid-19 patients? Or
should household members of Covid-19 patients keep people with symptoms in full
isolation? Due to the limited availability of PPE and the humanitarian and social
barriers for isolation within a household, both options do not seem te be very
realistic.
in summary, the point the authors are trying to make in this manuscript is clear,
but the clinical consequences seem to be limited.
