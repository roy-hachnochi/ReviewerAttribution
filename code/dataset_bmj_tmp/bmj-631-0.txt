This is well analyzed and well written manuscript describing the results of a pooled
analysis of cervical screening studies in Africa in which screening tests were provided

by nurses and addresses a topic of major interest for cervical cancer control in subSaharan Africa. There are no major issues in the statistical analysis of this pooled
analysis. The authors may consider the following comments in revising their
manuscript.
1. Methods: The authors state that the included studies should meet the criteria that
the study population is not at risk of cancer. This may be confusing to the reader.
The women in the age-group included in the studies are at risk for cervical cancer.
Probably the authors meant that women already diagnosed with cervical cancer were
excluded. Moreover, the HIV infection status of women included in many of the
included studies was not known, since these women were not tested for HIV or if
tested elsewhere, the test results were not documented in the study databases. Most
women in tropical countries complain of symptoms such as discharge commonly.
2. Methods: the reference standard investigations ("gold standard" investigation for
final diagnosis) used in the studies may be briefly described.
3. The number of included studies in which quality assurance was carried out for
reference standard (colposcopy, histopathology) should be mentioned.
4. The sample size of included studies may be shown in the in their forest plots
(Figure 2).
5. A major concern in the included studies is the high accuracy reported in those
studies. The possible reasons for this reported high accuracy should be discussed in
detail. The reference investigations were largely applied by newly trained clinicians in
techniques such as colposcopy and directing biopsy and their learning curves
possibly evolved with the studies. In most locations where these studies were
conducted, there was practically no or only limited prior screening and prior
colposcopy experiences and these providers were mostly rapidly trained when the
studies were initiated. Similarly the pathologists involved in the studies probably
overcalled CIN 2 + lesions given their limited experience, recent reorientations and
lack of adequate quality assurance. The correlation between the visual techniques
might have been another contributory factor. These factors together might have
contributed to overcall of true positive lesions. The lesion sizes detected might have
been larger lesions given the fact these practically never screened populations.
6. The authors may emphasize in the discussion that VILI as a single test has never
been implemented. It has always been evaluated following VIA. Even with all the
blinding, some level of contamination cannot be eliminated. Given the uncertainties
for VILI as a single test, the value and limitations using both visual tests in a
sequential manner may be discussed.
