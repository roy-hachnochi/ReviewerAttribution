General comments:
The authors report a retrospective cohort study on the association between perioperative transfusion of
packed red blood cells (pRBC) and stroke or myocardial infarction (MI). Using data from a voluntary
healthcare benchmarking database capturing approximately 20% of U.S. hospitalizations, the authors
used time-stamped lab/procedure claims and ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes to ascertain pRBC transfusion
and the outcomes of interest. They found a substantial association between pRBC transfusion and the
risk of stroke and MI. This is a very well-written manuscript detailing a thoughtful analysis on an
important clinical topic. Below are a few specific comments that may help to improve this paper.
Specific comments:
1. Page 7, line 9 states that a subgroup analysis was performed limited to patients who did not receive
transfusion on postoperative days 1-7, but on page Page 5, line 15 it states that all patients undergoing
transfusion on postoperative days 2-7 were excluded. Could the authors please clarify this? Do they
simply mean that the primary analysis excluded those transfused from day 2-7, and the subgroup
analysis additionally excluded those transfused on postoperative day 1? Also, what about patients with
transfusion beyond postoperative day 7? I realize this would be rare, but it would be helpful to clarify.
2. The statistical approach is nicely done and very clearly explained. I just have a few questions:
a. Why not model the number of pRBCs as a continuous variable? In our paper (reference 2 in your
paper), besides the primary finding of increased stroke/MI risk with hemorrhage requiring >4 units of
pRBCs, in a seondary analysis we found a nicely linear relationship between the overall number of pRBCs
transfused and the risk of stroke/MI.
b. Why meqrlogit instead of xtmelogit?
3. Page 10, line 49: Just to be completely correct, would add something like “Although not perfectly
population-representative, these findings …”
4. The inclusion of VT/VF in the composite outcome distracts from the overall message of the paper. At
the very least, there should be an explanation of the rationale for including it, and it should be more
consistently referred to (e.g., the the Results of the Abstract refer only to stroke/MI, as does Table 4). I
would favor removing VT/VF altogether, or including it as a secondary outcome.
5. I agree with the authors that a substantial portion of the association between transfusion and
stroke/MI is likely to be causal. But it should be acknowledged that it is not possible to completely tease
apart the deleterious effect of transfusion from the deleterious effect of bleeding. Even a single-unit
transfusion may reflect surgical oozing that may activate innate hemostatic mechanisms. The data cited
on transfusion after PCI is compelling, but it is not in a directly comparable population since one would
expect generally more blood loss with surgery than with PCI. I think it would make the paper stronger to
mention this in the limitations section.
6. Conclusion: I think it is fine to call for more randomized trials, but given existing randomized trial
results (refs 18 and 19), I think a somewhat stronger claim for transfusion-sparing strategies can be
made. Something to the effect of, “Our findings of rare but serious adverse outcomes, combined with
several randomized trials showing the safety of transfusion-sparing approaches in critical care and
postoperative medicine, argue for …”
