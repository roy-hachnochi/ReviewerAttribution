This study is valuable because it is the first randomized comparison between two often used treatments
for pyoderma gangrenosum. Trials on medication are usually sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.
The immunosuppressiva prednisone and ciclosporin are relatively cheap, on the market for many years,
and the patents have expired. It is very difficult to obtain funding for clinical trials on these drugs and it
is therefore admirable that the authors were able to perform this investigator initiated study with help of
independent government funding
The study has news value. It shows that the effectiveness of ciclosporin is comparable to prednisolone,
which is new information. It also shows that the effectiveness of both treatments (47% healed at 6
months) is lower than we presumed. Which confirms that pyoderma gangrenosum is a difficult to treat
(and devastating) disease. I support publication of this clinical trial in the BMJ.
Comments and questions:
The outcome is that both treatments are comparable and that a choice should be made based on sideeffects and relative contraindications. It would be helpful if, in the discussion section, the authors advice
the readers. What is your first choice ?
If this depends on relative contraindications, a suggestion is to include a table, e.g.
prednisolone ciclosporine
obesitas (> 100 kg) - +
diabetes -- +
hypertension - --renal insufficiency + --osteoporosis - +
In pyoderma gangrenosum rapidly expanding ulcers can occur, destructing a large area of skin in a few
days. It is important to have a treatment that can stop this expansion as soon as possible. Some
clinicians think that a high dose of prednisone is more suitable for this purpose because it works in a few
days while ciclosporin takes more time upto a week. It could be that this is just an opinion not based on
evidence. From the data in the study, with the first observation at week 2, this question can not be
answered. But it is an important question. Please, from your study experience, answer this question: is
prednisolone working more rapidly than ciclosporin ?
Related to this previous question: how many ulcers increased in size between day 0 and week 2 ?

Was there a difference between the ciclosporin group and the prednisolone group ?
Table 1 baseline characteristics: the two groups are very comparable except for 2 items: the
prednisolone group contains less females and more patients with pre-existing diabetes (17% diabetes
versus 6.8% in the ciclosporin group). Could this have influenced the outcome ? Did the 5 patients with
severe infections as adverse event have pre-existing diabetes?
One patient in the prednisone group died. What was the exact reason of death ? Is it likely that it was
related to prednisolone?
Is it likely that prednisolone causes more infections than ciclosporin? One would expect that both
treatments, when prescribed in their therapeutic range (0.5-1.0 mg/kg prednisolone, 3-5 mg/kg
ciclosporin) cause a similar amount of infection-related side-effects. The study allowed a dosis increase,
if necessary. Were the patients in the prednisone group with severe infections treated with a higher dose
than 0.75 mg/kg?
