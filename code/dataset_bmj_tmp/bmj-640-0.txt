Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to review this revised paper. I think that the
authors have made substantial efforts to improve the paper and I agree with most of their
responses; however, there are several points that I believe still need to be addressed.
1. GRADE system: I am pleased to see that the authors have adopted the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to rate the
quality of evidence. However, I am not sure whether the authors have followed the principles of
the GRADE system appropriately. According to the GRADE handbook (Sch√ºnemann H et al.
GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. Updated
October 2013. The GRADE Working Group, 2013. Available from
www.guidelinedevelopment.org/handbook), the quality of evidence from observational studies
is initially classified as low. Factors for downgrading the evidence include study limitations,
indirectness of evidence, inconsistency of results (i.e., unexplained heterogeneity of results.),
publication bias, and imprecision. Factors for upgrading the evidence include a dose-response
relation, a large effect, or the existence of plausible confounders that would result in the
underestimation of the true effects. Of note, the 5 factors for downgrading quality of evidence
must be rated prior to the 3 factors for upgrading it and the decision to upgrade should only be
made when serious limitations in any of the 5 factors reducing it are absent.
Please provide an explicit explanation for your evaluation. I also suggest that the authors
specify the investigators who assessed the quality.
