The authors report a study of antithrombotic therapy at the time of discharge for AF-related stroke
and its association with subsequent time spent at home. Using linked data from the Get With the
Guidelinesâ€”Stroke registry and Medicare claims, they performed a propensity-matched comparison
of warfarin versus no oral anticoagulant therapy, and found that those prescribed warfarin had a
lower risk of cardiovascular events and more time at home. This is a well-done and very nicely
written paper on an important clinical topic. My main suggestion is for the authors to touch on the
possibility that their findings may represent a substantial underestimate of the efficacy of warfarin
therapy, since the authors relied on warfarin status at discharge, while recent work indicates that

50% of Medicare beneficiaries who are prescribed an oral anticoagulant fill only one prescription
(PMID 25359164). It may well be that patients who have already had a stroke are more likely than
the general population of AF patients to comply with warfarin therapy, but nevertheless it remains
highly likely that many of the 88% of stroke patients who were given warfarin at discharge
switched over to no oral anticoagulant therapy soon afterward. This would serve to attenuate the
apparent effect of anticoagulant therapy on outcomes. On the other hand, it could be argued that
the authors design represents an intention-to-treat comparison that reflects real-world
effectiveness. My second suggestion is to elaborate more on whether presenting the benefit of
warfarin in patient-centric terms, rather than traditional clinical descriptions of outcomes, may help
improve adherence to proven anticoagulant therapy.
