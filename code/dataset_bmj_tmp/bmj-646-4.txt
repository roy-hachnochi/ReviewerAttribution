This is a very well written article, and an interesting topic. I have reviewed this from a statistical perspective and have
some important concerns, which I hope are addressable by the authors upon revision but need care and additional
analyses.
1) Was clustering of children within the same family accounted for? It seems not, and this would not be captured by
the propensity score analysis. Children from the same family are likely to be similar to one another, and therefore are
not independent. The Cox regression should therefore be re-done, accounting for this (it could though be noted as a
sensitivity analysis in the article) to see if conclusions remain the same.
2) Usually, after a propensity score is calculated, the individuals are ‘matched’ (e.g. one in the smoking group is
matched to a non-smoker, based on their score being very close). Individuals who cannot be matched are removed. It
seems the authors don’t do this, and rather include everyone and adjust for the propensity score value in categories.
This seems inferior to me than the matching approach, as the latter allows one to display the baseline characteristics
of the two groups and see that (hopefully) the groups are now more balanced. Therefore (again as a sensitivity
analysis perhaps), please re-do the analysis with matching (again, accounting for clustering of children in the same
family too). Without the matching, one might still have extremes of the propensity score for one group but not the
other, and therefore regression adjustment may still not be fully adjusting for the confounding (as compared to
matching).
3) It’s not clear how the population attributable fraction is derived in the fully adjusted results. Please clarify.
4) Children were excluded if they were not followed up for 3 years – and the authors say there were no differences
between these and those that did have 3 years follow-up. But it is not clear if these children were excluded from ALL
analyses, or just from the dental score analysis at 3 years. They should have been included in the survival analysis, as
that can handle drop out before 3 years Please clarify.
A related issue is that the exact time of caries is not known (I think). Rather, the authors only know if they appeared
by 18 months or 3 years. So I am struggling to understand why the Kaplan-Meier method was used, as time of event
is not known exactly. Please clarify. Were some children censored before 18 months? If so, how was the censoring
time calculated? Or are the authors assuming censoring took place at time zero or just before time 18 months? What is
the justification? If there is no censoring, then wouldn’t a relative risk at 18 months (and then again at 3 years) be a
better summary than a KM estimate (or perhaps they are equivalent) Please clarify, and justify why the analysis
chosen and assumptions are appropriate in relation to the data available.

Hazard ratios relate to the whole follow-up period, but here I think the authors are looking specifically at risk ratios at
3 years. Therefore either the hazard ratios are actually risk ratios at 3 years, or they need to explain why the whole
time period is being accounted for. Why are hazard ratios (or relative risks more precisely) not given for 18 months
also? I assume this time-point could include more patients than the 3 years one, so I’d like to see the effects at this
time also (Especially as it is closer to the 4 month measurement of smoking, and thus less likely to be affected by
changes in smoking habits over time).
4) Kaplan-Meier %s are given in the Results but these are UNADJUSTED for confounding, thus should be removed or
clearly labelled as unadjusted.
5) The authors should note that the non-significant result for maternal smoking may be due to low power to detect a
small effect (if indeed genuine).
6) Abstract says: ‘hazard ratios of second hand smoke …’ This is loose language. It is hazard ratios of dental caries for
children linked with second hand smoke versus those not linked to second hand smoke
7) Page 7 tells us that the number of decayed, missing or filled teeth were 0.06+-0.48 …. What does these numbers
actually mean? Is it the average number per individual with its standard error? If so, how can the lower interval value
be negative?! <0 decayed teeth? Please be explicit!
8) The propensity score analysis adjusted for the propensity score divided into quartiles. This seems again unjustified,
as it loses information and the propensity score should be left on its continuous scale. Please see point 3 above for a
better method also.
9) Were there any missing values in the adjustment factors used in the propensity score analysis? With such
databases, there are usually missing values for some patients, but I cannot ascertain how this was handled in the
analysis. Was multiple imputation used?
10) The authors say there were no differences between those included and excluded from analysis (Supp Table 1). I
think there ARE observed differences, but these are generally small. Please re-word. Similarly when discussing Supp
Table 3.
In summary, this is an important study but there are a number of important areas for re-analysis and added clarity, to
address my concerns. I hope my comments are helpful to the authors moving forward.
