This is a carefully conducted study addressing an important question: does exposure to benzodiazepines
increase the risk of dementia, Alzheimer's disease or cognitive decline?
The data is generally of good quality. Medication exposure relies on dispensing data, which may overestimate the drugs taken by patients. Cognitive data uses a combination of an objective screening
instrument and more detailed clinical diagnosis. Covariates are based on a combination of patient report,
health care records, and dispensing records and appear to be an appropriate selection of variables likely
to confound the association between benzodiazepine exposure and dementia/cognition.
The methods, results and discussion are very well and clearly presented.
The main issue that I believe requires clarification stems from the very low exposure of the population
over a long period, which makes it difficult to determine meaningful comparison groups. If I understand
the data correctly, the authors are comparing three relatively low levels of exposure over a long period to
people with no exposure. The 'high exposure group' of 121 or more standard doses over 10 years, would
equate to over about 4 months of daily exposure over 10 years. Therefore, it is not very surprising that
there is not a dose response relationship with the 'low', 'medium' and 'high' exposures described. I
wonder if the clinical message of this paper is predominantly about the risks of low exposure? Please
justify the dose cut-offs investigated here further. The discussion does raise the issue that the exposure
in this US study is lower than that in the Canadian study, which found an association with dementia for
the highest exposure group.
