Impact of BCG, DTP and measles-containing vaccines on childhood mortality: a systematic review
Review by Frank Shann, Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. shannf@netspace.net.au
A huge amount of effort by the authors and the members of the WHO Working Group on the Non-Specific
Effects (NSE) of Vaccines has gone into this analysis. This paper and the NSE of vaccines are very
important indeed, with the potential to make substantial further reductions in child mortality at minimal
cost using the current EPI vaccines. The statistical expertise of the analysis is impressive, however, the
authors overlook some aspects of the pre-specified hypotheses relating to the non-specific (heterologous)
effects of vaccines (Fine, TMIH 2007;12:1-4; Shann J Inf Dis 2011;204:182-4) - this is understandable,
given that only one member of the WHO Working Group and no member of SAGE has contributed original
data testing the NSE of vaccines. I note that the project was funded by WHO, and that the conclusions
strongly support the current WHO immunisation schedule.
The main comparisons are (1) BCG compared to unvaccinated, (2) DTP given after BCG compared to BCG
alone, and (3) MCV given after the last dose of DTP compared to DTP. Other important comparisons are
(4) DTP with BCG compared to DTP after BCG, (5) DTP with MCV compared to DTP before MCV, and (6)
DTP after MCV compared to DTP before MCV. BCG represents BCG ± OPV and DTP represents DTP ± OPV
throughout.
1. The big picture: opposite effects within studies
The main analysis in this manuscript assesses the effects of each vaccine (BCG v none, DTP v BCG, and
MCV v DTP) separately. The authors find that both observational studies (with a high potential for bias)
and clinical trials suggest “a beneficial effect of BCG on mortality”; that among the observational studies
(with a high potential for bias) “the majority suggest a potential deleterious effect of DTP on mortality”;
and that four clinical trials “pointed towards a beneficial effect of MCV” and 18 observational studies (with
a high potential for bias) “consistently estimated the effect of measles-containing vaccines on mortality
within the first 2-5 years of life to be beneficial”.
However, it is very important to analyse the effects of DTP on all-cause mortality compared to the effects
of both BCG and MCV *within studies* as well as between studies. Comparison within studies greatly
reduces the potential for bias. I attach a forest plot of the data from all six observational studies from
five different countries that provide estimates for BCG and DTP and MCV (and were classified as not
having “too high” risk of bias). In five of the six studies, the MRR following DTP was higher than 1.00 (it
increased mortality relative to BCG), and the MRR for both BCG and MCV was less than 1.00 (BCG
reduced mortality relative to no vaccination, and MV reduced mortality relative to DTP); the results of the
sixth study (PNG 1989-1994) also found that mortality after MCV was approximately half the rate after
DTP, but it reported a non-significant reduction in mortality when DTP was given after BCG. It is highly
unlikely that these findings in the six studies of all three vaccines are caused entirely by bias.
For bias to explain the findings of the between-study and within-study comparisons, it is necessary to
postulate bias that would cause BCG to approximately *halve* mortality compared to no vaccination,
then cause DTP to approximately *double* mortality compared to BCG in the same community, then
MCV to approximately *halve* morality compared to DTP in the same community. This is a crucial point
that should be strongly emphasised in the discussion.
In addition to the RCT evidence (with low bias) of the effect of BCG on neonatal mortality in GuineaBissau (Guinea-Bissau 2002-2008 early and late), these within-study comparisons strongly suggest that,
until the next vaccine is given, DTP may be associated with higher mortality than BCG and MCV.

I suggest that a version of my funnel plot should be included in the paper to illustrate the importance of
examining the *differential* effects of BCG, DTP and MCV within single studies. In addition, the paper
should emphasise the fact that bias is unlikely to be the sole explanation for these systematic differences
within studies because the effects go in opposite directions from BCG to DTP, and from DTP to MCV.
2. The analysis of DTP-after-BCG versus BCG-only
The WHO schedule is for BCG to be given at birth, and the first dose of DTP (DTP1) at 6 weeks of age; so
this is the timing that should be tested. (There is evidence that mortality may be less when DTP1 is given
at the same time as BCG: Hirve, Vaccine 2012;30:7300-8, and Aaby, Int J Epi 2004;33:367-73).
In Burkina Fasso 1985-1993, the mean age for BCG was 4.8 months and DTP1 6.3 months, so many
(probably most) infants will have received DTP1 *with* BCG. In addition, there was survival bias in this
study. It should be removed from the analysis of DTP.
The DTP-after-BCG versus BCG-only data for Bangladesh 1986-2001 are from an unpublished re-analysis
by Aaby and Ravn (ref 31). Dr Aaby kindly provided me with a copy of the re-analysis. It states, “If there
were problems in registering subsequent vaccinations after the initial registration some children who died
after having received the second or third dose may not have had these vaccinations registered and
therefore ended up as a death in the first group; in other words mortality would be too high in the first
group and too low in the subsequent vaccine dose groups. That something similar might have happened
is suggested by an analysis of mortality in relation to vaccination status and distance from the hospital
(Supplementary table 1); mortality among unvaccinated children did not differ by distance from the
hospital but mortality for the BCG-only group was much higher with distance from the hospital and even
higher than mortality in the unvaccinated groups. With such potential registration problems comparisons
of the subsequent vaccinations might be biased, e. g. DTP1 (after BCG-first) versus BCG-first or DTP2
versus BCG+DTP1. For these reasons, the main comparison in the present analysis is between the three
ways of starting the vaccination schedule.” Bangladesh 1986-2001 should be removed from the analysis
of DTP-after-BCG compared to BCG-alone, given that the investigators who calculated the MRR of 0.52
(0.31-0.87) state that it is a biased estimate.
For PNG 1989-1994 (Int J Epi 2005;34:138-148), the HR of 0.48 (0.22-1.09) is used from the 29d-5m
section of Table 6, however, we are not told what group is being compared to DTP1 (we know only that
all the children in Table 6 received BCG by 6m, but Table 3 shows that BCG was often given with or after
DTP1); however, Table 3 says mortality for 29d-5m was 16/230369 (deaths/person days) with DTPafter-BCG, and 12/116245 with BCG-only, giving a MRR of 0.67 (0.30-1.56) (N = 2374). This is the
estimate that should be used in Figure 3, as we know that DTP-after-BCG is being compared to BCG-only
(and propensity scores are not required, as we are told on p.147 that adjustment made no difference
when the analysis was confined to children who had received BCG). In the 1970s and 1980s, I was the
paediatrician responsible for the Tari region of PNG where this information was collected, and the data
are highly suspect: vaccines were given only at clinics, and sick children were not vaccinated (page 147);
the 1-5mo unvaccinated children had a mortality rate of 230/1000py (Table 3) compared to an infant
mortality rate in Tari of 68/1000 (page 147), so there was very large frailty bias among children who
were unvaccinated or vaccinated late (had BCG, but had not yet had DTP). A strong case could be made
for excluding this study for too high bias.
The DTP estimate (in Figure 3) for Guinea-Bissau 1990-1996 (BMJ 2000;321:1435-1441) should be 2.50
(1.31-4.78) which is adjusted for nutrition, and not 1.74 (1.10-2.75).
With these changes, for DTP-after-BCG versus BCG-only, we have Benin, GB 1984-85, GB 1990-96 (RR
2.50, 1.31-4.78), GB 2002-08, India, Malawi, PNG (0.67, 0.30-1.56), and Senegal; I2 is 33.7% with
fixed effects MRR 1.85 (1.40-2.44), and random effects MRR 1.86 (1.31-2.64).
3. A surprising lack of concern about the possible adverse effects of DTP
The authors are remarkably complacent about the evidence that DTP given on-schedule after BCG may
increase child mortality until MCV is given. The within-study comparisons (above) suggest that bias is
unlikely to be the sole explanation for this increase in mortality.
In the existing Figure 3, the point estimates for MRR for DTP-after-BCG are fixed effects 1.27 and
random effects 1.38 - and the revised estimates are fixed effects MRR 1.85 and random effects 1.86.
Importantly, the MRR is approximately 1.75 in fixed and random models in the within-studies
comparison. These are extraordinary figures! If DTP increases all-cause mortality by approximately 27%
(let alone 50% or 86%), then it is responsible for approximately 1.3 million excess under-5 deaths per
year (there were 6.3 million under-5 deaths in 2013: 6.3/1.27 = 5.0, and 6.3 - 5.0 = 1.3); this will overestimate deaths in high-income countries, but most under-5 deaths occur in low-medium income
countries.
The confidence intervals for these estimates are wide, but the available evidence (especially from the
within-study comparisons) strongly suggests that there may well be a very substantial problem. This
should result in *urgent* action to obtain reliable evidence that DTP is safe. *Millions* of lives are at
stake.
It is inappropriate to downplay the importance of this signal in a misguided attempt to protect the
immunisation programme. Immunisation is, of course, extremely important - but only because it saves
lives. If one component of the programme may have a harmful effect, we need reliable estimates of its
extent and how to minimise it while still protecting children against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.

Any hint of a cover-up will do far more damage to immunisation in the long-term than urgent action now
to determine the actual effect of DTP on all-cause mortality and minimise the problem if it is real. This
should not be seen as a threat to immunisation, but rather as an exciting opportunity to further reduce
child mortality at minimal cost - by exploiting the beneficial NSE of BCG and MCV, and minimising any
potential harmful effects of DTP.
Throughout this paper the implicit assumption is that strong evidence is needed that DTP is harmful
*before* urgent action is taken - “the available evidence does not support a change”. This complacent
attitude to the evidence that DTP may be causing over a million excess deaths a year in high-mortality
countries is in striking contrast to the suspension of the administration of RotaShield vaccine in the USA
after only 15 cases of intussusception (MMR 1999;48:1007); there is a worrying inconsistency here. The
onus of proof is on those of us who advocate administration of DTP to every child in the world to provide
evidence it is safe: we need robust evidence of safety, and we do not have that evidence.
Not enough emphasis is given in this review to the importance of Guinea-Bissau 2004 (Aaby, Int J Epi
2004;33:374-80), which is the *only* study of adequate size that has described the effect on all-cause
mortality when DTP was first introduced - the MRR was 1.92 (1.04-3.52). This suggests that there was
an increase in mortality even in the absence of herd immunity from previous use of DTP.
Given that “the majority of studies indicated a potentially deleterious effect of DTP on mortality” (page 7,
line 11), it is inappropriate to say that 8 observational studies “found a tendency for DTP to have a more
beneficial effect in boys than girls”. The correct wording is, “a tendency for DTP to have a more harmful
effect in girls than boys”.
4. DTP with oral polio vaccine (OPV)
The statement in the Abstract that there is insufficient evidence about DTP “in part because it was almost
always administered with OPV” should be removed. First, BCG is also usually given with OPV. Second, if
DTP with OPV may be harmful (as suggested by “the majority of studies”), then the harm is no less
important than if it is caused by DTP alone. As is done for BCG and MCV, the Abstract should report the
MRR for DTP (from studies with a high risk of bias), but say that this effect was also seen in within-study
comparisons with much less risk of bias, and that randomised trials are urgently needed to obtain reliable
information about the effects of DTP on all-cause mortality.
The evidence suggests that OPV may have mildly beneficial NSE (Aaby, Vaccine 2004;22:3014-17);
Aaby, Vaccine 2005;23:1746-51), so that DTP alone may be even worse than DTP with OPV. Further, IPV
may have harmful NSE (Aaby Ped Inf Dis J 2007;26:247-52), so the proposed change from OPV (possible
beneficial NSE) to IPV (possible harmful NSE) may substantially increase all-cause mortality in highmortality countries.
5. Risk of bias
The sources of bias considered in the analysis should be spelt out, and an indication given as to whether
each one will give a conservative or exaggerated estimate. Studies with marked survival bias should be
excluded. What evidence is there that selection after a vaccine has been given causes bias? It should be
emphasised that bias is very unlikely to explain why BCG reduces mortality, then DTP increases
mortality, then MCV reduces mortality (especially within individual studies).
The nomenclature for risk of bias is clumsy (low, moderate, high, too high), why not say low, moderate,
high, and very high? The results for studies that have very high (too high) risk of bias should not be
reported in Figures 2-4, and data from these studies should not be used in Figures 5-7 - for example: for
Figure 6, India 2006-2011 (BCG), GB 1989-1999 (DTP), India 2006-2011 (DTP), Philippines 1988-1991
(DTP), Ghana 1984-1991 (MCV), India 2006-2011 (MCV), and Senegal 1989-1996 (MCV).
6. BCG versus unvaccinated
The combined results for the only two studies in the analysis with a low risk of bias (GB 2002 early and
late) should be presented separately, as RR 0.52 (0.33- 0.82) from Ped Inf Dis J 2012;31:306-8 Table 1
- they provide strong evidence for the use of BCG-Denmark in low-birth-weight babies, which is not
current practice (note, however, that different strains of BCG should not be assumed to be equivalent,
Comstock, Clin Inf Dis 2000;30[Suppl 3]:S250-3 and Favorov, PLoS ONE 2012;7[3]:e32567). Most of
the studies of BCG in Figure 2 were not confined to the neonatal period, and this phrase should be
removed from page 6 line 50.
7. Effect of vaccine sequence
Figure 5 provides evidence that DTP should not be given with or after MCV; in fact this effect is important
in girls but not in boys (Aaby, BMJ Open 2012:2:e000707). This should change policy, and girls should
not be given DTP once they have received MCV. It also suggests an urgent need for randomised trials of
the effect on all-cause mortality of the booster dose of DTP in the second year of life (because it is given
after MCV).
In Figure 5, the estimate from Senegal 1996-1999 (TRSTMH 2015;109:77-84) should be 2.54 (1.235.24) for DTP-with-MCV from the Cox model and not 1.96 (0.95-4.04), and 2.74 (1.19-6.31) for DTPafter-MCV from the Cox model and not 2.40 (1.00-5.75). This will change the risk ratios.
8. Effect of sex

This should be analysed using female/male mortality ratios (which greatly reduce bias) - in addition to
comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated children, which introduces a high risk of frailty bias (as shown by
the fact that for DTP the three “inconsistent” studies had frailty or survival bias and showed benefit for
girls, while all the other studies showed harm for girls). For female/male MR data, see Aaby, BMJ Open
2012:2:e000707. Figure 6 should present deaths/children as in Figures 2-5 so the nature of the
comparisons is clear.
9. Effect of age at vaccination
In Figure 7, Bangladesh 1986-2001 is listed as having “too high” bias in Figure 2 (BCG effects). Why is it
included here? Under MCV, I suggest adding Aaby, Ped Inf Dis J 1989;8:197-200 (see Table 2).
10. “Short-term” follow up
The paper refers frequently to “short-term” follow up and implies that this is a shortcoming of these
studies. In fact, it is an inevitable consequence of the hypothesis that the main NSE of a vaccine are seen
only until a different vaccine is given (Fine, TMIH 2007;12:1-4; Shann, Clin Ther 2013;35:109-14). The
WHO schedule is for BCG at birth; DTP at 6, 10 and 14 weeks (so BCG NSE occur from 1 to 5 weeks of
age); MCV at 9 months (so DTP NSE occur 1.5-8 months); and DTP booster at 18 months (so MCV NSE
occur 9-17 months). This should be explained, and the insinuations removed that that “short-term”
follow up is inappropriate. Note that, in 2013, 4.6 million (73%) of the 6.3 million under-5 deaths
occurred in the first year of life, and an even higher proportion occurred in the first 18 months.
11. The Discussion
Page 8, line 52 should say, “Receipt of BCG and measles-containing vaccine was associated with a
reduced risk of all-cause mortality, but DTP was associated with an increased risk of mortality in 7
studies and a decrease in 1 study. In comparisons within studies, DTP was associated with a higher risk
of mortality than BCG and MCV.” (The estimate for Bangladesh is regarded as too biased by its
originators, and a high proportion of infants in Burkina Fasso received DTP-with-BCG - so these estimates
should not be used).
Page 9, line 56, “Evidence concerning modification of the effects of any of the three vaccines on the risk
of all-cause mortality by vitamin A status, or age at vaccination was generally insufficient to allow
conclusions to be drawn. The data suggested that DTP given with or after MCV or BCG is likely to be
associated with a higher risk of mortality in girls.” “In girls”, given the F/M ratios and Aaby, BMJ Open
2012:2:e000707.
Page 9, line 18, “Baseline confounding may have exaggerated the benefits of BCG and measles
vaccination and underestimated the harm from DTP.”
Page 9, line 26, “While the majority of studies of DPT vaccine suggested that vaccine recipients were at
increased risk of all-cause mortality until they received MCV, we have little confidence in attributing the
observed higher mortality to DPT vaccine. However, within-study analysis also suggested that DTP may
increase all-cause mortality, and analysis of vaccine sequences suggested that mortality may be
increased when DTP is given after BCG or MCV.” Please justify why do you have “little confidence”. Bias
cannot explain why BCG reduces, then DTP increases, and then MCV reduces mortality between and
(especially) within studies, and the sequence of vaccination analysis (Figure 5) also suggests increased
mortality when DTP is the most recent vaccine. Confidence is at least “moderate”, and the findings
should lead to urgent investigation.
Page 9, line 34. “Follow-up periods were often short, particularly in observational studies, mostly to less
than 12 months of age for BCG and to less than 9 months of age for DTP” - this should be removed, as
explained above. Line 36, “A substantial proportion of the studies were conducted in a single country,
and it is unclear whether the results are generalizable to infants and children in other settings” - this
should be removed, see Sankoh, Int J Epi 2014;43:645-53, and note that the six important within-study
comparisons come from five different countries. Page 9, line 38, “The studies typically took place in
communities with many years of use of these vaccines. As a result, a combination of direct vaccine
effects and herd immunity means that these communities had low incidences of the diseases targeted by
the vaccines, so that the substantial net benefits of routine use of these vaccines may not have been
apparent” - this is pure speculation, and is contradicted by the evidence in GB 1984-85 (Aaby, Int J Epi
2004;33:374-80) where introduction of DTP was associated with a MR of 1.92 (1.04-3.52). The entire
paragraph should be deleted.
Page 9, line 48, “provide some support for the hypothesis”. Why not “substantial support”? Two RCTs for
BCG in neonates, and the majority of observational studies showing benefit from BCG and MCV but harm
from DTP (separately and within studies, and with interactions) - exactly as described in BMJ
2000;321:1435-41.
Page 10, line 5, “We do not believe that the available evidence supports a change in either the choice of
vaccines or the timing or sequence of immunizations routinely administered to infants and children. We
believe calls to alter the immunization schedule so as to maximize any possible beneficial effects of BCG
and measles vaccine or to minimize any possible deleterious effects of DTP vaccine on all-cause mortality
are premature.” The results of this analysis (especially after the corrections) suggest that BCG should be
given to all babies at birth, rather than being withheld from all low-birth-weight babies and only given to
term babies when there are enough babies present (policy should be changed to suggest opening a vial

even if only one baby needs BCG). The policy that MCV not be given after 12 months should be changed
(Fisker, Lancet Glob Health 2014;2:478-87), and the main indicator for EPI should be the proportion of
children given MCV before 12 months of age (rather than the proportion given DTP3). The significant
interactions between DTP and MCV suggest that it should be policy that DTP be given before MV, and not
with or after MCV in girls. In addition, the analysis suggests an *urgent* need to test the effects of DTP
on all-cause mortality, perhaps beginning with randomised trials of the booster dose of DTP (which is
given in some countries but not in others).
12. Minor issues
Please could the reference numbers be included in Figures 2-7? It is a laborious process to identify a
study in a Figure, then look in the appropriate section of Appendix 2 to find the reference number for that
study, then look in the “References of included articles” section at the end of Appendix 2 to find the
citation. This is made even more difficult by the fact that some studies are incorrectly named:
Guinea-Bissau 1984-1985 should be Guinea-Bissau 1984-1987.
Guinea-Bissau 1989-1999 should be Guinea-Bissau 1998-1999.
Ghana 1984-1991 should be Ghana 1989-1991.
Reference 12 is Trop Med Hyg Int Health 2013;18:1329-37.
Reference 15 is Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 2015;109:77-84.
“Sex” and “gender” are used interchangeably throughout the manuscript. It is normal practice to use
“sex” to refer to biological effects (as in this paper), and use “gender” in “cultural or social contexts”
(Oxford English dictionary). I suggest using “sex” throughout.
13. Changes to data
Delete all analyses of studies with too high bias in Figures 2-7.
Present the combined BCG estimate for the low bias RCTs GB 2002-2008: MRR 0.52 (0.33-0.82).
In Figure 3, delete Burkina Fasso 1985-1993 (many children got DTP with BCG).
In Figure 3, delete Bangladesh 1986-2001 (too high bias in reanalysis).
In Figure 3, PNG 1989-1994 should be 0.67 (0.30-1.56), N=2374 (DTP-after-BCG vs BCG only).
In Figure 3, GB 1990-1996 should be 2.50 (1.31-4.78) which is adjusted for nutrition.
In Figure 5, Senegal should be 2.54 (1.23-5.24) for DTP with MCV (Cox model).
In Figure 5, Senegal should be 2.74 (1.19-6.31) for DTP after MCV (Cox model).
For sex, add female/male mortality ratio analysis.
14. Abstract
The Results and Conclusions need to be revised.
Results
We identified results from 32 birth cohorts. Most evidence was from observational studies assessed as at
high risk of bias, with some from clinical trials. Most studies reported on all-cause (rather than nonspecific) mortality. BCG vaccine appeared to reduce all-cause mortality: the average relative risks (RR)
were 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.01 from five clinical trials and 0.47; 95% CI 0.32 to
0.69 from nine observational studies at high risk of bias. DTP appeared to increase all-cause mortality
(RR 1.86; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.64) from eight observational studies at high risk of bias; this effect appeared
stronger in girls than boys. MCV appeared to reduce all-cause mortality (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.07
from four clinical trials, RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.63 from 18 observational studies at high risk of bias):
this effect appeared stronger in girls than boys.
Conclusions and implications of key findings
Bias is unlikely to be the sole explanation for the observed reduction in mortality after BCG, followed by
an increase in mortality after DTP, then a reduction in mortality after MCV. There is limited evidence to
suggest that BCG and MCV reduce overall mortality by more than expected through their effects on the
diseases they prevent, and that DTP may increase all-cause mortality when there is herd immunity to
diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. The available evidence suggests that BCG should be given to as many
babies as possible soon after birth, including low-birth-weight babies; that DTP should not be given to
girls with or after MCV; and that children should be given MCV even if it has not been given by 12
months of age. Further research is urgently required on the possible non-specific effects of
immunizations on the immune system and on mortality in low income settings.
15. What this study adds
Through a comprehensive systematic review and risk of bias assessment, we found few randomized
trials, and that many types of bias may have influenced the results of the numerous observational
studies.
We found limited evidence to suggest that BCG and measles-containing vaccines reduce overall mortality
by more than expected through their effects on the diseases they prevent, and limited evidence that DTP
may increase all-cause mortality when there is herd immunity to diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.
Bias is unlikely to be the sole explanation for a reduction in mortality after BCG, followed by an increase
in mortality after DTP, then an reduction in mortality after MCV.
