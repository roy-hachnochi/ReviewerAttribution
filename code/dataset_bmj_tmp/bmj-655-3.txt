To place the subject in context, this is a very important review as it concerns unexpected effects of
vaccines that are recommended for most of the population of the world, and which are interventions that
have made the greatest impact on human health of anything in modern medicine.
1. The abstract needs to be carefully worded as there is a risk that the findings may be misinterpreted
negatively, increased by the attention that a publication such as this may draw.
2. Abstract and conclusions. The implications for the findings could be made clearer. Whether or not they
are real, these seem to be that the current recommendations for the vaccines that are given and the
sequence and timing in which they are given should not be changed. Indeed the vaccines potentially
have more impact on mortality than purely obtained through prevention of the diseases they are
designed to combat, and consequently it is even more important that these vaccines are given to children
per WHO schedule.
Objectives
3. The objectives of the study are not proportionate to the bulk of the article which is for the most part
focused on assessing bias. Was assessment of the contribution of bias (or more broadly, assessment of
the quality of studies) not an objective?
4. It may be helpful to add a brief sentence to capture why bias might lead to observation of increased or
decreased childhood mortality.
5. Last sentence of results: co-administration of DTP with polio vaccine makes it hard to attribute an
effect but doesn’t really explain what is observed. Would it be better to add inconsistency or other
wording to support the lack of a firm conclusion?
6. The results in the abstract do not include anything about timing or sequence of vaccines, so the
conclusions and implications on this point do not follow. Given that the results seem to show a reduction
in all-cause mortality, there will be pressure to chance timing and/or sequence of vaccines, so it would
seem important to add to the results a comment about the evidence being insufficient on this point.
Background
7. There seems to be missing an explicit causal framework to inform the development of hypotheses for
interpretation of possible bias and to explain what is observed, if caused by bias. Given the centrality of
assessing bias to the methods, an explanation of each type of bias that might be expected and what
direction and size of effect this might have on observed childhood mortality would make the paper much
more accessible to the non-specialist reader. For example, a healthy vaccinee bias would mean that
mortality might be expected to be lower in vaccinated individuals in observational data etc.
8. The second paragraph of the background and final paragraph of the discussion refer to calls to alter
the immunization schedule, but do not explain how the schedule would be changed. Figure 5 also refers
to “favour alternative” with respect to vaccine sequences. As the idea of an alternative schedule is at the
heart of the question that WHO SAGE was answering, it would be helpful to describe what alternatives
have been proposed with appropriate citation(s).
Methods
9. Birth cohorts. It is a little difficult to get a sense of whether information might have been lost through
the process devised to avoid double-counting. Is there any way to report how many secondary results
were not included as a result of this approach?
10. It may be helpful in relation to the definitions of “birth cohorts” to refer to Figure 2 as an illustration
of how this was applied.
11. The methods are, righty, focused on sources of bias as the major issue. However there are other

considerations in study design, and other tools for assessing quality especially of observational studies
now being used for systematic reviews that may have provided both more detailed and broader
information for evaluating observational studies than the Cochrane tool. Some discussion of this is
warranted.
12. Were authors contacted for missing information pertaining to potential sources of bias?
Results
13. The link given for the detailed results of the review is to a general landing page for SAGE documents
and should refer to a specific (detailed) review document to justify the statement.
14. Forest plots. Consistency of direction of effect is striking for BCG and measles, and inconsistency
striking for the sequence and gender effects. It would seem important to ensure that these graphics are
clear and positioned in a way that they can be easily compared in any publication.
15. Sequence. Age is an important influence on mortality, especially for diseases such as pertussis and
tetanus that are given before measles vaccine because they need to be given early and repeatedly. How
was the effect of age and sequence separated?
16. What impact would a correlation of maternal tetanus immunization have had on outcome of childhood
immunization on mortality?
Context.
17. Is there additional information about the context in which the different studies took place that might
be pertinent to differences such as higher mortality in girls due to social factors/inequity?
Interpretation
18. It may be helpful to refer to how the findings may relate to the recent publication in Science by Mina
MJ, Metcalf CJ, de Swart RL, Osterhaus AD, Grenfell BT. Vaccines. Long-term measles-induced
immunomodulation increases overall childhood infectious disease mortality. Science. 2015 May
8;348(6235):694-9.
19. Effect sizes would be worth discussing in the context of possible bias.
20. It is fair enough to state that the effect of DTP cannot be separated from OPV if co-administered, but
that only muddies, and doesn’t explain the observations.
21. Final conclusion page 10. If the authors’ recommendation is for randomized trials to be ethically and
practically conducted, it would strengthen the recommendation if they were more specific about this
could be done, ethically and practically. I am not convinced that we have sufficient equipoise but am
interested to hear the arguments.
22. It seems to me that a more positive tone about the possible additional benefits of vaccines would be
really important to adopt in drawing conclusions and making recommendations. These data seem to be
another good reason to reach all children on time using the existing schedule.
23. SAGE presumably supported the recommendations of this work that they commissioned and funded.
The role of SAGE is different to that of scientists, being a step closer to policy makers. Given the
independence of the authors from WHO SAGE and their lack of similar (and appropriate) constraint, this
paper is an opportunity for them to make recommendations for researchers and research in this area that
go beyond addressing the question of whether a change in vaccines, or the timing or sequence of
vaccines is warranted. It seems a shame to miss this opportunity.
