The authors have been very responsive to the reviewers' comments and the manuscript has improved. I
have one small comment about the discussion. The authors have now added in a reference to the
statement that "excessive alcohol consumption may increase energy intake". I think that excessive sounds
like high alcohol intakes, which, in their reply, the authors said would decrease energy intake. I suggest
changing "excessive" to "moderately high" or something similar. I have no other comments.
