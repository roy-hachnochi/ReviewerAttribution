This is a useful paper reviewing the existing evidence for the non-specific immunological effects (NSIE) of vaccines. It
clearly illustrates the lack of consistent and reliable data, and thus the urgent need for well-designed randomised trials
sufficiently powered by sex in order to address this topical issue. I am sure it was a huge undertaking to extract the data
from each of the papers and I commend the authors on their comprehensive presentation and summary of their
findings.
Definitions
The definition of a specific immunological effect could improve, “vaccines target pathogen” is not grammatically correct.
I do not agree with the definition of a NSIE – It states that this is due to something other than an antigen from the
vaccine target, but in fact it may well be due to one of the vaccine target antigens. For example BCG vaccine contains a
number of TLR agonists which are part of the vaccine target but stimulate innate responses that might be considered
NSIEs. Another theory is that NSIE may be due to the stimulation of T cells via a cross-reactive vaccine antigen that can
cross-prime T cell responses to other pathogens (T cell heterologous immunity). Indeed this is referenced in the
Introduction (ref 10 by Welsh et al).
It would be worth mentioning some of the other terms used for non-specific effects of vaccines including “heterologous
effects” and “non-targeted effects”. Indeed “heterologous immunity” is a MeSH term as follows “The immunological
phenomenon by which exposure to some organisms or vaccines can profoundly alter the host's response to subsequent
exposure to unrelated (heterologous) organisms or vaccines”.
In the TT section in Results the authors do not actually comment on what NSIEs have been found in the various studies.
Could this please be summarized here?
The Tables summarising each of the papers are very helpful, in particular Table 2 which summarises all studies with
statistically significant outcomes. Given that the authors later assess risk of bias (Supplementary Table 6) it would be
helpful if a quality metric could also appear on this table since this will appear in the main manuscript and many may not
read the supplementary material.
The Supplementary figures need to be referenced in the results so that the reader is aware that these figures are
available in supplementary material. In particular supplementary Fig. 8 needs to be referenced in DTP / DT section of the
results, and also the figure legend needs to describe the figure more clearly.
The authors state that they sought unpublished reports. I am aware that some such data was sent to WHO and was not
included in the review. It might be better to remove this sentence.
It is well known that BCG vaccine is used as a bladder cancer immunotherapy, and in fact it is one of the most successful
cancer immunotherapies described. The immunological effects have been described in some studies. Surely this is a
good example of a non-specific immunological effect of BCG vaccine. While I appreciate that it is not used in this context
in children, I think this use should be mentioned in the manuscript. Furthermore, intralesional BCG has been used to
treat melanoma, and intralesional MMR to treat warts. These also deserve a mention.
Minor Points
Introduction – The last sentence of the 1st paragraph is long and unwieldy and should be re-written.
Table 2 – The title should state “all included studies…”
Discussion – 1st line should explicitly state “following human vaccination”
