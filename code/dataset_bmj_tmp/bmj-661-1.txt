General comments
Overall survival and relative survival are both useful statistics to know for women diagnosed with breast cancer,
although I think the former is what most patients care about. In particular, many women newly diagnosed with early
breast cancer assume that they are at much higher risk of breast cancer death than they actually are, and knowledge of
survival statistics and the effects of various treatment options is important in making treatment decisions.
Specific comments
1. Abstract, results. On page 6, Statistical Analysis section, the authors state that given the shorter follow-up in the later
cohort, “no statistical comparisons [of survival] were performed between the two time periods.” I am unclear on how
they can then state in the abstract that “Relative 5-years [sic] survival rates were higher in 2006-2012 for all tumour
and nodal stages.”
2. Abstract, conclusion. The second sentence states that “Early breast cancer detection remains vital.” While it is true
that if breast cancer survival were the same at all stages there would be little or no need for early detection (e.g.,
through screening mammography), the fact that tumour stage still influences overall survival tells us little about the

current benefit of early detection, other than that early detection may still have some benefit. In addition, decisions
about screening involve weighing both the risks and the benefits and inevitably involve value judgments. The authors’
statement that early breast cancer detection is “vital” seems like an opinion rather than something that follows from
their data. I think the second sentence in the conclusion should be deleted.
3. In the first full paragraph on page 4, the first sentence is unclear. What data were published in 2004?
4. Re: the last sentence on page 12, see comment 2, above.
5. On page 18, the heading in the legend for Figure 2 has a typographical error. The figures appear to show relative
survival, not overall survival.
6. P. 22-23, Tables 3 and 4. The tables show increasing hazard ratios, however overall survival should be going down,
not up, as tumour category and node category increase, similar for other unfavorable factors. Is it possible the hazard
ratios are for overall mortality instead of overall survival?
