I think that this article is a timely analysis of the way that the FDA uses its expedited approval categories
and the potential value of drugs approved through one or more of these categories. While I have a
number of comments about this article none of them challenge its value.
Page 5, lines 43-51:
There needs to be somewhat more information about a standard review – e.g., how long should it take
and how many clinical trials does it usually require.
Page 5, line 53 – Page 6, line 40:
I think that it would be useful to summarize the information in this paragraph in a Table format.
Page 6, lines 42-47:
Are these times for all drugs or just those going through the 4 programs that the authors are discussing?
Page 8, line 42:
Were diagnostic agents included?
Page 8, line 49:
Why was the FDA framework used rather than the WHO ATC system for determining first in class status?
Page 9, lines 28-30:
There should be a citation for the breakthrough designation.
Page 9, lines 47-52:
I would suggest that the authors do a sensitivity analysis classifying only type A as a “priority review”
and types B and C as “standard review” to see if that changed their results.
Page 13, line 6:
The authors may wish to cite the following paper that looks at how well a priority review granted by
Health Canada predicts significant postmarket therapeutic gain - Lexchin J. Health Canada’s use of its
priority review process for new drugs: a cohort
study. BMJ Open 2015;5:e006816.
Page 13, lines 47-52:
Would making the change in the requirements for advertisements require legislation?
Page 14, lines 3-11:
My understanding is that the FDA currently has the authority to levy fines if confirmatory studies are not
completed on time. Are the authors proposing something new?
Page 14, line 54 – Page 15, line 11:
Did this Act allocate additional resources to the FDA to cover these new responsibilities?
