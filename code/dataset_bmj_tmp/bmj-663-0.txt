This is a good paper with very thorough statistical analysis and new and interesting observations. This
study defines the added value of third trimester BP readings taken in clinical practice to inform risk in
pregnancy.
Our concern lies in their conclusions that low risk women can be surveyed less often based on these
findings. A 1 in 28 is still a significant risk justifying regular checks of BP, given the potential morbidity
associated with pre-eclampsia. Few clinicians would opt to reduce the current antenatal visit frequency at
this risk, particularly considering that antenatal visits are used to identify other disorder of pregnancy
and give advice and support unrelated to pre-eclampsia. In addition, most women appreciate this regular
point of contact. We would recommend, however, that the increased risk may justify increased
surveillance from the recommended schedule and this may be a better strategy.
The discussion about BP and spontaneous preterm birth is confusing. Firstly there is little or no
relationship between the two. Perhaps the authors should equate BP readings to iatrogenic preterm
birth.
The authors state novel biomarkers for prediction of preterm birth are not efficacious. The paper they
quote (ref 39) excludes all the established markers which are efficacious. So it is wrong to imply there
are not existing good predictive tests of preterm birth.
Iâ€™d like to acknowledge the involvement of Dr Hannah Nathan (Clinical Research Fellow) in reviewing this
article.
This is a joint opinion.
