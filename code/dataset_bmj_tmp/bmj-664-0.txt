The manuscript provides an updated analysis the geographic patterns and time trends in colorectal
cancer in Europe.
Although potentially of interest for the Journal, the manuscript would be improved if data on screening
practices across European countries will be also shown, particularly since the authors give large
importance to this issue.
Moreover, the manuscript needs substantial improvements in the presentation.
In particular, the results are quite confusing. I suggest to describe each Table/Figure separately and
follow the same scheme for the description of male and female data. I also suggest to eliminate the
mean/median values for all European countries combined. Moreover, please check the comparison of
data for various age groups (Last par pag 6, first par. page 7), since there seems to be some
inconsistency.
The Discussion can also be improved. It is sometime speculative, in the absence of specific data (for
example on screening practice across countries). Lifestyle factors are mentioned in various parts of the
discussion and not only in the specific section on lifestyles. The third paragraph at page 8 “In addition….”
can be deleted.
An accurate revision of the English language is also necessary.
