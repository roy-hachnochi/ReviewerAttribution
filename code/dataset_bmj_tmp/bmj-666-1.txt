This is an excellent randomized controlled study investigating the efficacy of beta-histine at low and high dose against placebo
fro the management of vertigo and other symptoms of definite Meniere’s disease.
It is a very well structured study and acts as a very important contribution to this area of clinical treatment. Such a wellconstructed and rigorous trial has been long awaited.
Meniere’s disease is relatively uncommon (as highlighted in our recent BMJ review) but it is a well known condition in general
practice and the article is likely to have an important bearing on the management of these patients.
The study design, participants, methods, results, interpretations and references are beyond criticism.
I strongly recommend the article to the BMJ
