The manuscript is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind 3 arm Phase III clinical trial for the prophylactic treatment of
vestibular episodes in Meniereâ€™s disease. The intervention consisted of two dosages of betahistine-dihydrochloride [high dose
(HD): 3 x 48 mg per day, (N=74); approved standard dose (LD): 2x 24 mg per day, (N=73)] and placebo (PL) (N=74) over a
period of 9 months. The results show no significant differences among the three groups.
Since betahistine is the most prescribed drug to treat MD in Europe, the result of this clinical trial should be published and they
will have a significant impact on current clinical practice.
The RCT has been carefully designed, including power calculation and no apparent bias is observed to this reviewer.
There are some minor questions to solve:
1. Patients with MD have a high prevalence of migraine. Vestibular migraine may overlap with MD is some cases. How did the
author consider migraine and vestibular symptoms? Was migraine one of the exclusion criteria? If so, it should be stated. If
this was not the case, this information should be added on Table 1. The most common adverse effect was headache and it
would be interesting to know if patients reporting betahistine-associated headache had in fact a previous history of migraine.
2. Patients with MD also have a higher comorbidity of autoimmune diseases (Gazquez 2011; Tyrell 2014) On Page 7: in the
exclusion criteria, complex diseases that might confound treatment assessment were included. Autoimmune background is
probably involved in a subset of patients with MD. Did the authors exclude patients with systemic autoimmune disorders such
as rheumatoid arthritis or SLE? This should be also included in the exclusion criteria.
3. Table 1 does not include the age of onset of the disease on each group. This could be a potential bias in case of differences
among groups.
