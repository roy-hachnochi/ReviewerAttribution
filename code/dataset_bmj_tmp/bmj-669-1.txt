I read with pleasure the network meta-analysis from Capodanno et al. The topic is hot enaugh to
guarantee high priority, methods are appropriate and the manuscript is well written without need of
further English language copyediting. The main findings of this updated and comprehensive metaanalysis comparing different treatments for in-stent restenosis are that plain balloon angioplasty was
less effective than drug eluting balloons and DES, which were the most effective interventional
treatments for in-stent restenosis and that in particular everolimus-eluting stents may reduce the risk
of subsequent target lesion revascularization compared with drug eluting balloons. Other interventional

techniques to treat in stent restenosis were evaluated but, as expected, yelded higly heterogeneus
results. Finally the available number of patients included in randomised trials comparing drug eluting
balloons and DES was not enaugh to show a significant difference in target lesion revascularization risk
between the two treatments.
The metanalysis from Capodanno et al comes after another from Lee JM et al (JACC Intv 2015) which
cannot be considered as the most updated because did not include two large randomised trials
comparing drug eluting balloons with DES for in stent restenosis treatment. The information added as
supplementary online material is particularly suitable to evaluate the quality of the review process,
that seemed to me very good.
Thus I congratulate the authors for their efforts to craft a beautiful network meta-analysis and I
support their manuscript acceptance for publication in the Journal.
