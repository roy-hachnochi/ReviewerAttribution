In this manuscript, Giacoppo and colleagues present the results of a network meta-analysis of
randomized controlled trials of therapies for coronary in-stent restenosis. Although there are numerous
prior published meta-analyses, this is by far the most comprehensive one, comparing all therapies
studied both in the setting of bare metal and drug-eluting stent ISR. The authors observed that
treatment with DES and DEB is the most efficacious compared to plain balloon angioplasty (PB).
Primarily historical therapies brachytherapy, cutting balloon and rotablation were not found to be more
effective, thought they were not unsafe.
The manuscript is very well written and easy to follow. It does tend to be on the lengthy side. It is
unclear that multiple angiographic endpoints need to be reported, at least in the main body of the
manuscript. The authors provide excellent rationale for utilizing LLL as the primary endpoint, and they
should focus on this endpoint as the angiographic endpoint. The others if they are to be reported at all,
should be relegated to the supplemental appendix.
