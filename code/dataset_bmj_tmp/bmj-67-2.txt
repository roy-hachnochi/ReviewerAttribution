This meta-analysis reported that prediabetes is associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality,
composite CVD, CHD and stroke in the general population, with similar findings in the ASCVD population.
Congratulation for such a good job. In the past years, many studies have aimed to explore whether
prediabetes is associated with a poorer prognosis. Now, we have a clear answer for this hot topic.
This study has several strengths, including large sample size, adequate duration, inclusions of
prospective cohort studies and multiple subgroup analyses, meta-regression analysis to draw a solid
conclusion. My concerns listed below:
1) In the abstract, the authors stated that “Prospective cohort studies were included for meta-analysis if
they reported adjusted relative risks (RRs) of…”. Actually, from the text, they included studies reported
not only RRs, but also those reported ORs and HRs.
2) Abstract: “The median follow-up duration was 8.8 years”. It is better to report the follow-up duration
in primary and secondary prevention respectively.
3) Abstract: line 48, the phase “in the general population” can be deleted, as it is indicated in line 40.
4) The controversy on the definition of prediabetes is raised by the lower cut-point of the ADA guideline,
compared with the WHO/IEC cut-point. I suggest adding a brief introduction of the cut-points of
impaired fasting glucose in different guidelines. This should help the readers, especially who are not
familiar with the definition and cut-points of prediabetes, to better understanding the importance of the
study.
5) Inclusion criteria: (3) adjusted relative risks (RRs) or hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were reported. How about studies reported ORs?

6) Exclusion criteria: why excluded retrospective studies, case-control studies, or post hoc analysis of
clinical trials? These studies may also report adjusted RRs.
7) Results: IFG-ADA was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15
to 2.22) and composite CVD comorbidity (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.75) in patients with established
ASCVD. Is it possible to perform similar analysis with that in general population to explore whether there
was a step increase within the IFG-ADA range (FPG 100–109 mg/dL vs. <100 mg/dL or FPG 110–125
mg/dL vs. <100 mg/dL, repectively)?
8) Limitation: the sentence ‘A Finnish study showed an increased risk of CVD associated with IGT, which
was not confounded by the subsequent development of overt diabetes’ is quite confusing and needed
rephrased.
‘The inclusion of people with low blood glucose in the reference group would underestimate the risk in
individuals with prediabetes.’ May be better to be rephrased as ‘…would make the association of
prediabetes and risk towards null’
