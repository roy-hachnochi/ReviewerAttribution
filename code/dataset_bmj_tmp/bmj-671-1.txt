Everything is perfect about this paper.
The only thing is I found a paper named "
Design and methods of a randomised double-blind trial of adding liraglutide to control HbA1c in
patients with type 2 diabetes with impaired glycaemic control treated with multiple daily insulin
injections (MDI-Liraglutide trial)" published on Prim Care Diabetes. 2015 Feb;9(1):15-22.
The same team finshed the same project, and almost the same results. I am not sure it is ok for your
journal.
