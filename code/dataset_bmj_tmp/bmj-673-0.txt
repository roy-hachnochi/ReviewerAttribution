This is an extensive literature study of which the outcome could definitely be of importance to

patients. Also the necessity to guide physicians and patients with an indication for digoxin
therapy is recognized.
However, this guidance is not given. The paper stops with the conclusion that “digoxin is
associated with a neutral effect on mortality in randomises trials and a lower rate of
hospitalisation across all study types.” This paper would be far more useful for doctors and
patients if recommendations were given on further research or “the next step”. Further research
would answer the question in which way should digoxin therapy be changed.
