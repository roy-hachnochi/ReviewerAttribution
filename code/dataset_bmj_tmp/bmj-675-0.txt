The Authors have developed and externally validated risk prediction equations to quantify the absolute risk for
blindness and lower limb amputation in patients with diabetes, at 10 years.
The methodological approach adopted is well designed and applied. Equations, with a double external validation,
show robust results. The methods description is clear and easy to follow.
Reasons to conduct the study and provide patients and doctors of a prediction tool are well discussed. Data sources
are reliable and currently used in observational studies.
Results are of practical interest for clinicians. The identified predictive tool could be used for better stratifying
patients according to their individual risks.
As general comment, I would stress in discussion the problems of generalisability to other countries with different
epidemiological patterns.
I have got only minor comments.
Abstract
- Measurement: Mortality is listed beside hospital and GP electronic records as a source to measure incident
diagnoses of blindness and amputation. This choice seems weird. How mortality record can contribute in identifying
amputations and, specially, blindness? As clearly stated in Methods, ONS provides data on survival, for censoring
observation. If ONS is also used for identifying diabetes cases and complications, it should be clearly stated. The role
of ONS for identifying the study outcomes, if any, should be clarify. (Same comment for the paragraph 2.2 in
Methods).
- Methods (pag. 3): among the listed measures I would substitute sensitivity with accuracy, as we are interested in
both sensitivity and specificity.
Introduction
Beside the cited UKPDS model, other models provide estimate of risk of microvascular complications. For example,
the CORE Diabetes Model provides simulation of amputation and several models (CORE diabetes model, EAGLE
model and Sheffield Diabetes model) provide risk estimates for retinopathy rather then blindness. Such literature
should be mentioned as relevant background. Accordingly, in Discussion (4.1 Key findings), the estimated equations
cannot be considered the first in predicting blindness and amputation. Such statement should be rephrased to better
position the study contribution within the existing evidence. Mostly, to provide a tool to easily calculate the
mentioned risks.
Methods
For international readers, the Egton Medical Information System and the Read codes are not straightforward. Please,
provide a concise explanation.
The acronym OPCS is not fully explained at its first use.
In the predictor variable identification, is there any cut-off time point for variables based on the latest information
recorded in the primary care record before entry to the cohort?
Methods to identify the clinical events used as predictors (atrial fibrillation, congestive cardiac failure,….) have not
been clarified. I would not recommend a detailed list of the criteria/codes, but a generic reference to the data
sources used and the time frame searched. Number of years since diabetes diagnosis is also a variable of interest
and details on the source should be added (see comments on results).
Derivation of the models:
- Typo in 2.4 (second line): “for” is repeated.
- Reasons to carry out 10 imputation should be clarified as for readers, especially clinicians, it is not meaningful. The
same for the criteria used for retaining variables (<0.80 and >1.20).
- What is intended with “plausible” in examining interactions?
Results
The high percentage of newly diagnosed patients is not easily justifiable. A comment should be provided. Still, from
the table is not clear if there are missing data on this variable.
When listing the amount of missing data for the different variable, cholesterol ratio should be added.
Is there any explained reason for the difference in recording ethnicity and HBA1c among QResearch and CPRD?
Provide a comment.
The paragraph 3.3 Primary outcome of amputation and blindness: Description in the text of absolute number of
events is not of great interest. I suggest to describe the relative measures and to highlight the relevant differences,
where present (e.g lower blindness among men in CPRD versus QResearch) .
3.4.1. Lower limb amputation: The effect of smoking should be described.
3.5.1Validation results for QResearch are not so similar to those of the CPRD cohort, as stated. Even if a formal
statistical difference is present only for amputation (ROC statistic both in women and men), all the point estimates of
the indicators are lower in QResearch. Authors should comment this result even if it does not change the overall

discussion.
The last paragraph of Methods (beginning of pag.15) should be detach from the previous by adding a specific title
(e.g. 3.6 Implementation).
Discussion
Overall, I recommend a more exhaustive reference to the literature in the filed of predicting models. The last
sentence of the 4.1 Key findings could be changed into “the fist tool for predicting…”.
4.3 Comparisons with the literature, last sentence “However, as previously reported,…” Data seem not to support the
statement as smoking was not included in the final models. Rather, it was included in the amputation models. Could
it be a typing error?
Figure 4 and 5. Are not easy to understand. Please add the y-axis label.
As the outcomes identification was mainly based on Read codes (used by UK general practice), I am not familiar with
them and I was not able to judge the selection provided by the Authors.
