Overview: in somewhat crude terms, defensive medicine captures the idea in which physicians may deliver
more care (more tests, procedures, etc.) as a result of fears over liability. One of the conventional ways to
shed light on the empirical relevance of this concept is to construct metrics capturing the extent of those
liability fears (perhaps captured by the presence of a damages cap) and then to observe whether
physicians deliver more care when such metrics suggest higher levels of malpractice pressure—i.e., more
spending when the environment suggests stronger liability fears. In this traditional light, the causal
direction of the analysis runs from the liability environment to the physician behavior. One thing is missing
from these studies, however. Presumably, in response to stronger fears, one would exercise more care in
order to stem future liability exposure. With this in mind, one might also want to investigate this latter
channel—that is, does the exercise of more care in fact lead to a reduction in future liability. Stated
differently, if physicians do practice defensively, do such measures work as they intend? As the authors
suggest, there may be a number of mechanisms by which greater spending can achieve favorable liability
outcomes looking forward (more potential ‘errors’ may be caught, patients (or jurors) may view their
physician as having exhausted all resources, added care may improve the likelihood of winning a
malpractice case if a patient is sued, etc). This question, in the opinion of this reviewer, has been
substantially less studied in the literature. In fact, to my knowledge, I agree with the authors that they
may be first to tackle this particular question. With this in mind, this submission was well received and
provides a very welcome contribution to the literature in attempting to fill this gap. I believe it has the
potential to motivate many additional papers on this question, with others attempting to follow the lead in
linking rich administrative data on medical incidents to malpractice claims data on physicians.
Clearly, the fact that this relationship between spending and liability claims may potentially work in both
directions creates the possibility for a reverse causality problem in any attempt to focus only on the
spending-causing-few-claiming story. Appropriately, the authors attempt to address the reverse causality
concern by carefully structuring the timing of the analysis—that is, by estimating the association between
current spending and future med mal claiming against that physician—as captured by the incidence of an
event leading to litigation that occurs the year after the observed spending level. I suppose one minor
suggestion for the authors would be to alternatively try some kind of a distributed lag specification that
builds even more forward-looking dynamics into this relationship.
Even with the timing structured so as to alleviate some reverse causality concerns, there naturally remains
some omitted variables concerns that may limit the ability to make strong causal claims here—e.g.,
concerns over unobserved differences in patient mixes that may simultaneously drive spending and med
mal outcomes (note the physician fixed effects specifications help resolve many concerns over unobserved
physician heterogeneity). Nonetheless, the authors do much work to resolve patient mix concerns with
careful comorbidity controls. In any event, the authors are clear to state this caveat for the reader (and are
generally clear to address most other limitations that came to mind in reviewing the piece). They are also
clear to suggest that any such bias here should work in the other direction (and thus not explain their
findings). Given the novelty of their exercise and the care that went into looking rich inpatient claims data
with the malpractice history of the associated attending physician, I do not view caveats of this nature as
being detrimental to the paper. The contribution here is nonetheless powerful.
A few additional comments / questions:
(1) I might recommend that the authors cite one paper that comes close to the contribution they are
making. See Greenberg, Michael D., Amelia M. Haviland, J. Scott Ashwood, and Regan Main. 2010. Is
better patient safety associated with less malpractice activity? Evidence from California. Santa Monica:
RAND Institute for Civil Justice. This paper likewise tries to approach the problem in reverse, though
instead of focusing on spending / utilization measures, the paper asks whether a hospital’s success at
reducing patient safety incidents is associated with reductions in future med mal claiming. While the
present paper attempts to illuminate the idea of defensive medicine, this Greenberg et al paper attempts to
illuminate the notion of deterrence of medical errors, a related but distinct concept.
(2) The fact that greater spending is associated with reduced liability is consistent with the presence of
defensive behavior. However, it doesn’t necessarily prove the existence of defensive medicine. First, it
bears mentioning that one could conceivably note such a relationship even if no physicians are
prospectively acting defensively. It could that physicians are acting without liability in mind but happen to
spend at different rates for idiosyncratic purposes. And, ex post, it happens to be that those who spend
more have more favorable liability outcomes. Of course, with so much commentary suggesting the
presence of defensive behavior ex ante, it is not unreasonable to think that physicians would anticipate
such an outcome and alter their behaviors initially. Regardless, the fact that the authors observe this
reverse finding is highly illuminating to the bigger defensive medicine debate and does complement those
studies that attempt to look at this question more prospectively.
(3) Relatedly, it is important to note that defensive medicine does not necessarily follow from their findings
if we thought that patient outcomes are actually more favorable with higher spending—that is, let’s say the

mechanism at play here is higher spending leads to fewer medical errors, which in turn leads to less
lawsuits. This may not be characteristic of “defensive medicine,” which we typically think of as being
wasteful medicine. Rather, this could be capturing favorable deterrence in action. The authors acknowledge
this, but this is an important point that I think might deserve a tad more emphasis on revision. To be
consistent with the law and economists' general approach here, I suppose my comment is that one should
really reserve the label "defensive" for situations of wasteful spending or wasteful avoidance, as distinct
from socially beneficial deterrence. In any event, regardless of the precise interpretation, the finding that
higher spending is associated with lower lawsuits is still highly important and interesting.
(4) It helps that the sample was cutoff in 2009 to allow time for claims to be processed, which as the
authors note take on average 4 years. The concern otherwise would be truncation at the end of the sample.
Even stopping at 2009, I imagine there may still be some claims open at the time of data collection and
thus not in the sample. Year fixed effects, which the authors use, should address this concern. However,
the authors may, as a robustness check, also consider estimating the relationship between spending and
the likelihood of an incident leading to a claim that closes within 4 (or 5) years throughout—i.e., even in
the early years of the sample.
