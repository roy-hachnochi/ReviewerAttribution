Dear Editor, Dear Authors
Thank you for the opportunity to review this article. I believe that this is a timely and important topic
and that the article provides some useful guidance, and structure, in which to approach the allocation of
ventilators. In particular Table 1 provide an important overview and resource that can be easily referred
to.
What isn’t clear is the main aim of this paper (particularly in Lines 93 – 100). A distinction here is being
made between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients, but is this paper about allocation of ventilators to
both groups in general, or is it specific to handling the allocation of ventilators to non-Covid-19 patients
during the current pandemic? Also, how common is the re-allocation of ventilators before Covid-19, how
is that different and what can we learn from there?
In the section on psychological support for clinicians there are some points that warrant consideration
for inclusion. First, just as it is with patients, staff should be briefed/preparaed for this eventuality so
that they can preperate psychologically, including sigponsting to resources and support. Second,
healthcare workers should be encouraged to look out for each other, provide support and reach out to
those who may be avoiding or withdrawing from work/others. This includes monitoring of the staff after
an event/ pandemic over a longer period of time. See Greenberg et al. (2020) for info and a possible
reference.
Finally, a minor point in relation to Line 118. Is there a missing word at the end of the sentence, after
“face” – possibly “value”?
