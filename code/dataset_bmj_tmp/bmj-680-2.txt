Statistical Review:
In my view the new version of this manuscript adequately addresses all the questions asked by the
reviewers. There are three very minor points that need checking:
1) In their letter of response to reviewers (page 2) the authors write that as part of their sensitivity
analysis –“However, it found that for each 1 day increase in length of stay for these patients, there would
have been an associated 6% increase in their offs of death during 11-30 day time period after hospital
admission over the study period (95% confidence interval 1.05 – 1.08; p<0.001).” In the next page (page
3 of the reply) they state that in the Results this increase was of 7% with an associated 95%CI of 1.07 –
1.10. This is consistent with what is presented in the manuscript but not with the paragraph above. Please
check.
2) Looking at Figure 2, the result for 2009 appears to be an outlier. If possible please can they check the
influence of this extreme year on their results? It could just be reported as a single sentence in either the
same Figure or in the Discussion.
3) In their response to reviewers letter, the authors comment that they had originally planned to use Cox
models but that the assumption of proportional hazards was not met. Please can this also be reported in
the Limitations/Conclusions as it is a change from the original approach that could be useful for readers.
This also explains why they use Kaplan-Meier estimates but do not report hazard ratios.
These are all very minor points that have minor impact on the current manuscript.
