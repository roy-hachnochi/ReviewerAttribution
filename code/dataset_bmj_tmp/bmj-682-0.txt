This is a long awaited manuscript and I am privileged to be asked to review it. This report outlines a
secondary outcomes â€“ major falls and the impact of the activity intervention on that outcome.
Mobility disability was reduced in prevalence by 5% (35% to 30%) in the first report of the trial.
The introduction is succinct and places the study in context
The methods are clear.
Was the activity intervention ongoing throughout the 2.7 years or was it for a designated time
period? It is not clear.
The serious fall definition is clear including radiological confirmed fracture and hospitalisation for a
fall injury. Activity restricting falls were not adjudicated. The method of ascertaining falls was 6
monthly recall of events is not the gold standard but is an acceptable alternative and this limitation is
noted. It is possible that serious events were underreported. Forgetting hospitalisations is unlikely,
but possible, this also is noted in the limitations section.
The pre-specified subgroups are sensible and I agree with the post hoc subgroup of prior fallers.
Results differed for men and women with appropriate reporting of the observed sex interaction. The
effect was not visible until all subgroup characteristics were included in the models.
The tables are well set out. Rates of hospitalisation from falls are as expected for a community
population with some level of reduced physical function. The prior fall rate is high, as high as those in
residential care attesting to the low level of function.
Were the figures adjusted for the subgroup variables?? This should be noted in the legend if so. The
results section I think suggests that they were.
I would support the absolute risks being presented more transparently. The rate of outcomes could
be presented and discussed by sex. In the figure showing the event rates 10% of healthy ageing
group men had serious fall event and 6.6% of activity group did. The same incidence of 10% was
observed in women in both groups.
Men and women are different; physical activity uptake in most trials is along the same line as here,
men engage more and thus benefit more from the physical training. Women usually fall more than
men, except in very old age where men tend to die more, and women become more disabled from
falling. Women are usually more likely to have serious injury from fall, so it is intriguing that the
overall incidence is similar between the sexes. This is an important point to contextualise these
results. Potentially men and women may need different intervention design to best reduce falls. this
has not really been seriously contemplated in the fall prevention literature.
The interpretation of the findings is correct, there is no overall impact. The finding that men
benefitted more than women from this intervention is also correct. Serious injuries from falls are
very difficult to prevent and these finding are important to the literature on this subject.
Activity levels are available on all participants. It would be interesting to examine the relationship
between level of activity and serious falls. Falls per meter walked, or falls per lo, mod, hi activity
level may illuminate a more significant relationship between starting point in activity, response to the
intervention, and falls injury, particularly for women as women have lower walking speed and lower
levels of habitual activity (usually) thus as they increase their exposure to activity, the risk may
differ. There was definitely more activity going on in the intervention group, was there also more fall
free activity? This is obviously not the question posed by this report, but may increase the novelty of
the approach if we can all get our heads around fall free activity.
