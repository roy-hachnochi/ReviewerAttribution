Revised title: Comparative Outcomes after Device-based Hysteroscopic versus Laparoscopic Approach to

Permanent Birth Control
(Previously: Comparative safety and efficacy of device based hysteroscopic sterilization versus bilateral
tubal ligation)
1. Summary: This review is for the authors’ first revision of manuscript on a retrospective cohort of 8,048
(revised) undergoing hysteroscopic sterilization & 44,278 (revised) women undergoing laparoscopic
sterilization in NY State between 2005-2013. Data are from the NY Statewide Planning and Research
Cooperation System. Objective remains to compare differences in efficacy and safety of hysteroscopic
sterilization (HS) compared to laparoscopic sterilization (LS). Found increased odds of reoperation with
HS within one year of procedure, no difference in pregnancy rates after HS versus LS.
2. Authors have made some substantive revisions that improve the overall quality of the analysis and
findings: separating outcomes for women with a history of previous abdominal surgery or history of
cesarean, separating outcomes for reoperation and unintended pregnancy, removing procedures
performed by laparotomy, and adding data for outcomes at 2 and 3 years after the procedure. I also
appreciate the authors’ attempts to be consistent and unified in their reference to hysteroscopic
sterilization, however there are still multiple uses of other phrases such as “device based surgery.”
3. However, there are still many unaddressed problems and flaws with the manuscript. In fact, it is
disappointing to see that most of the Reviewers’ comments from the first review were not incorporated
into the manuscript.
4. Overall opinion: Comparative data on HS compared to LS remains a timely and important topic, and I
continue to give credit to the authors for their efforts to contribute to this issue. However, I still feel that
there are too many major problems with the manuscript to accept it at this time. I do not think the
manuscripts meets the appropriately high standards set by The BMJ.
GENERAL COMMENTS
1. Response to Reviewers. The authors provided some reasonable responses to issues pointed out by the
Reviewers. However, these answers and/or explanations were NOT incorporated into the manuscript,
which is a major omission. Readers will likely have similar questions to the Reviewers and deserve to
have explanations.
2. Overall, this manuscript remains underdeveloped.
a. Missed opportunities for highlighting interesting and important findings
i. In the Response to Reviewers, the authors provide very interesting data regarding the use of general
anesthesia for HS procedures in the database. These are very interesting results that are not currently
reported in the literature and should be included in the manuscript. In the U.S., the manufacturer of HS
heavily emphasizes HS as an office procedure that can be done without general anesthesia. If 50% of
patient who underwent HS in NY State during the study’s time period had general anesthesia, then this is
important to include.
ii. No difference in effectiveness at 1, 2, or 3 years. Manufacturer’s advertisements and the majority of
previously published literature state that HS is more effective than LS. Finding no difference in
effectiveness should be highlighted.
iii. And I agree with highlighting the increased risk of reoperation with HS (although reoperation needs to
be more clearly explained, see below). In fact, I would think that one of the main discussion points for
the authors would be why there is promotion of a procedure that may have the same effectiveness but
has a higher risk of reoperation.
b. Lack of interpretation of findings. Failure to provide further insights. For example:
i. Why are charges for HS much higher than LS?
ii. See 2.a.iii
iii. Not differentiating between findings that were statistically significant versus non-significant in
Abstract, Results, and Discussion.
iv. Outcomes that may be statistically significant but not clinically significant.
3. Poorly defined outcomes
a. Pregnancy: This continues to be a major concern. Need better explanation for how pregnancies after
the procedure have been captured in this database and how reliable the database is for identifying
pregnancies after a HS or LS procedure. Would abortions performed at non-hospital sites (e.g. Planned
Parenthood) be included in the database? Are women who get pregnant before the HSG confirmation test
included in the pregnancy data?
b. PID: Further explanation is still needed for how a history of PID, (and now major abdominal surgery,
and cesarean section) was identified? Were ICD-9 codes used? Would a woman who was diagnosed and
treated for PID in an office-setting also be identified? Was it only women who were admitted to a hospital
with PID that would have been included? Because this would generally represent a group of women with
more severe PID than those women treated with outpatient oral antibiotics. Were women diagnosed with
PID from the Emergency Department included in this analysis? PID is a clinical diagnosis that be over or
under-represented in the database.
c. Complications: Can the authors please define complications more specifically? They seem to break up
complications into iatrogenic versus major medical complications. However, these classifications are not
mutually exclusive. An iatrogenic complication of hemorrhage could cause peri-operative shock. Why was
this classification chosen? If patient had more than one complication, how was that dealt with in the
analysis?
d. Reoperation: Defined in Appendix currently. Needs to be defined and explained in Methods section
since this is arguably the main outcome for this analysis.

4. Limitations. Lines 38-42, p14: In discussion of limitations, the authors seem to only be concerned with
whether a limitation applies to both sterilization groups. Since this manuscript is also reporting on overall
incidence and prevalence of various outcomes related to both procedures, all limitations with data and
analysis should be included.
a. Description of how history of PID was identified should be included in the Methods section (see below)
and addressed in the limitations portion of the Discussion. Majority of women undergoing sterilization
(55%) were 30-39yo and an additional 20-25% were 40 or older. But diagnosis of PID only searched for
from 1995 onward. So a woman undergoing sterilization at age 35 in 2005 who had a history of PID at
age 15 in 1985, would not be identified as having had PID.
5. Multiple problems with poor writing, grammar and syntax which negatively affect readability, including
poorly written sentences that lack a subject or verb. Manuscript also has lacks agreement between past
and present tense in many areas. These issues were NOT addressed in the revision. Before the authors
resubmit this manuscript to the BMJ or another journal, it must be thoroughly reviewed and corrected. A
few examples from the first few pages of the manuscript:
a. Line 12, p4: “was developed a less invasive…” Should be “was developed AS a less invasive…”
b. Line 14, p4: “US” should be “U.S.”
c. Line 49, p4: “cohort study is conducted” should be “cohort study HAS BEEN conducted”
d. Line 58, p4: “Secondary objective was to determine…” Should be “THE/OUR/A secondary objective
was to determine…”
e. Line 12, p5: “SPARCS is an all-age-group, all-payer data that collects…” The word “data” should be
“DATABASE.”
f. Line 36, p5: “CPT code for HS…” Should be changed to “A CPT code for HS…”
g. Line 45, p5: “as index procedure…” Should be “as THE index procedure…”
6. Addition of info regarding MAUDE database is interesting, but is currently tacked onto the Discussion
section of the manuscript without being described and defined in the Methods section. Also, why did
authors only look at events reported in MAUDE between January 2013 and January 2015, when their
study spans2005-2013. Also a citation should be provided for the “Reporting source” in the footnote.
7. Exclusions
a. Methods need to have better description of how many women identified in the database were excluded
and why they were excluded.
b. Appendix A should really be Figure 1. And more detail is needed on why n=880 and n=3,260 were
excluded. As is, the figure is very confusing. Were the exclusions to avoid double counting an individual
patient? Please explain.
8. Appendix E: Why is Appendix E an afterthought? The table shows no significant difference in
pregnancies between HS and LS, but there are big differences in reoperation. These findings are very
interesting and important, and are still based on large sample sizes (relative to other existing
publications). These should be included in main findings.
9. Inclusion of “Not Reportable” results in analysis: I agree with previous Reviewer who questioned the
inclusion of outcomes with “NR.” The authors describe NR results as inconvenient, which makes me
question whether or not they understand the issue. For example, in Table 2, the number of ectopics after
HS is categorized as NR. However, even if only 1 ectopic was seen after HS that would be
1/8048=0.01%, which is the same percentage of ectopics after LS. So how could there be a statistically
significant difference in these results? In my opinion, any categories of outcomes that have NR can be
reported as such in summary tables, but should not be used for any further analysis.
ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC COMMENTS
The comments that have not been addressed in the revised manuscript (although they may have been
addressed in the Response to Reviewers) remain listed below.
Abstract
Line 34: “…significant increase in the utilization of hysteroscopic procedures” Significant based on what?
Line 41: What is p-value or OR, CI for difference in PID between LS and HS?
This has not been changed. Many readers will only read the Abstract. Therefore, any Chi square p-values,
etc. should be included in abstract. The authors should also specify whether referring to adjusted or
unadjusted results.
Introduction
Line 14: What is a “CE mark?” Authors should define and describe its relevance.
Methods
Page 5, Line 10: How complete is SPARCS database? Has its reliability ever been validated by a check
against medical records? Would office-based HS procedures be included in DB? More information should
be provided.
Page 5, Line 53: Hispanic is an ethnicity and not a race.
Page 6, Line 19: Can the authors please define “30-day surgical safety events” more specifically? They
seem to break up complications into iatrogenic versus major medical complications. However, these
classifications are not mutually exclusive. An iatrogenic complication of hemorrhage could cause perioperative shock. Why was this classification chosen? If patient had more than one complication, how was
that dealt with in the analysis?

Page 6, Line 32: Re-intervention was determined based on repeated sterilization procedures. But earlier
in methods, authors state that only index sterilization procedure was included. Please explain.
What about re-intervention for a complication? If a woman had HS and returned to OR two weeks later
for pain and was found to have a coil perforating the fallopian tube, would that not be counted?
Based on authors’ answers in Response to Reviewers regarding re-intervention for complication, this
scenario would not be captured unless procedure coded that tube was resected or ligated. This is a
limitation that should be addressed in the Discussion.
Page 7, Line 3: “General linear mixed model, accounting for hospital clustering as a random effect…”
What does this mean and why did the authors choose it? Why is hospital clustering important for this
kind of analysis?
Page 7, Line 12: What is frailty modelling? Why was it used? A one sentence description would be
helpful.
NEW SPECIFIC COMMENTS
Line 47, p5: “Patients with previous encounter of sterilization were excluded from the final cohort.” What
does this mean?
Line 27, p6: How were “total charges” defined and calculated?
Line 29 and Line 45, p6: Authors describe “re-intervention.” Do they mean reoperation? Also the
definition for reoperation should be included in the manuscript text, not just in Appendix E.
Line 25, p7: The first sentence of this paragraph is confusing and should be clarified.
Lines 32-38, p7: Some explanation should be given for why specific covariates were chosen and how the
adjustment was done. For example, was any forward or backward elimination performed or were all
covariates included from the start and kept?
RESULTS
Lines 10-14, p9: In discussion of temporal trends among procedures, it would be helpful to be consistent
in unit of measurement, whether that is percentages or absolute numbers.
Line 23, p9: Different numbers reported in text compared to those reported in Table 1 for age and
insurance.
Lines 25-38, p9: Results with statistical significance should be described as such with corresponding pvalue.
Line 10, p10: Numbers given in the text for iatrogenic complications within 30-days are different than
those reported in Table 3.
DISCUSSION
Lines 17-23, p12: Last sentence of the paragraph is a run-on sentence with too many ideas and
disparate thoughts. For example, did the authors really want to highlight that this the first such study
from New York State data? Or did they want to point out that it’s the first state-wide study with all
payers.
Line 40, p12: I think the statement about major medical complications is misleading since the adjusted
analysis showed no difference between HS and LS in adjusted analysis (Table 3).
Line 45, p12: Here and elsewhere in the manuscript “around” should be replaced with “approximately”
where appropriate.
Line 45, p12: “5 adverse events avoided per 1000 patients.” Authors should describe what data was used
to calculate this number and how it was calculated.
Line 8, p13: Worth noting that the Chudnoff paper that is quoted also lacked 5 year follow-up data for
30% of the cohort, and excluded some pregnancies from their analysis.
Line 10, p13: Should include what mean the mean time for post-procedure follow-up was in the French
study.
Line 34-40, p13: The authors correctly point out the flaw of how pregnancy was identified in the French
study. However, they need to go one step further to describe why that is a flaw, e.g. may underestimate
subsequent pregnancies as only includes women with hospitalization records and most likely does not
include women who miscarried or had an abortion.
Lines 12-18, p14: I agree with authors’ discussion of detection bias regarding HS reoperations. By the
same line of reasoning, there may also be a detection bias regarding LS procedures since operators can
directly visualize the procedure and hopefully note any perforations or bleeding complications. However,
those same outcomes are not readily identifiable during HS and perforation of the coil through the
fallopian tube, for example, may not be detected until patient reports pain, which may coincide with the

time to reoperation that is seen for HS.
Line 47, p14: The authors assert “coding errors are less common for major procedures and
comorbidities.” A citation to support this assertion must be given.
Line 58, p14: The authors assert that residual confounding is unlikely to have a strong impact on their
estimates. Why is this? A one sentence explanation should be provided.
Lines 16-19, p15: “…need for technology surveillance after widespread adoption.” I absolutely agree. This
point should also be made in the Introduction.
Line 19, p15: “We illustrate that national and regional registries…” I disagree. This manuscript does not
report on any national or regional registries. It does report on one state registry.
Table 3
Footnote reports exclusion of patient in 2011, but most likely authors mean 2013.
Further explanation required for model adjustment. Were models comparing age groups and PID history
also adjusted? If so, they couldn’t have been adjusted for all covariates listed in the footnotes and this
should be clarified. For example, if looking at PID (Yes/No), can’t adjust model for PID, as footnote
currently states.
