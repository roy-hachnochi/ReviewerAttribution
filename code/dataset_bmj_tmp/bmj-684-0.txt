I think the authors have responded well to my comments. I have two remaining issues with the paper.
First, the analysis: it seems clear that the wards were paired and that therefore a paired analysis is
appropriate - this can be done either by including a fixed or random effect per pair (essentially using metaanalysis techniques -see Thompson et al Stat Med. 1997 Sep 30;16(18):2063-79.). While I accept the
points about the levels of clustering, I still don't think the analysis currently in the paper is right for this
study. Second, now I have seen the full details, the sample size also seems appropriate for a non-paired
rather than a paired analysis. Was the decision to pair wards taken after the study was funded? If so, this
should be made clear. In addition, while it is strictly not possible to estimate an ICC from a paired study I
would have thought the estimate of 0.001 in the sample size is rather small - although a paired study
would usually require smaller numbers so pairing would to some extent compensate for any underestimate
in the ICC it is unclear whether it would have compensated for the choice of such a small ICC.
