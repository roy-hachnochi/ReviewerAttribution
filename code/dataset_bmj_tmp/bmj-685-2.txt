Overall comments:
This paper is aimed to breathe new life into the “leaky pipeline” conversation regarding the paucity
of women at top positions in academic medicine, by generating a “moustachio ratio” to reflect the
statistical gender gap. Overall, it was a quirky idea that received my attention, a topic near-anddear to my heart anyway; however, the arguments made to close the gender gap were weak and
the researches could have prepared a much more inclusive literature review regarding the recent
host of papers written (mostly in Academic Medicine) regarding how to attract, retain and promote
women to the top ranks in medicine. I also struggled with the methodology- it could have been
much clearer, as I was confused as to how the total number of “leaders” was generated. I believe
this paper could undergo some heavy revisions and be re-reviewed but I would not consider it for
acceptance in its current state.
Specific feedback:
Introduction: Could be stronger. If I am a male chairman of medicine, make me want to hire
women, what is the data? Why would my program benefit? What do women bring to the table (can
use the business literature about fortune 500 companies and profit, etc).
Lines 20-27
“This is a problem not only because of the strong theoretical argument for equality, but also for
practical reasons: in business having more women leaders has been linked with better
performance” - This sentence should make me want to read on…. And it doesn’t. Build this
argument, make it stronger, there is better data and be specific about it.
Methods:
How did you get to the final number of leaders = 1,017? If you were to identify the “leader” in
each of the 50 schools of medicine in the areas that you focused on, the n would be 1000 (if
everyone was accounted for).
Did each of the 50 schools of medicine have a department in each of the fields that you list? And
were you able to find a “leader” for each field listed? What did you do about the Department of
Medicine, where there are typically several “leaders” → i.e. chief of cardiology, chief of
pulmonology, etc. please clarify.
What did you do if you came across more than 1 “leader” per department? For example, we have a
division chief and a department chair of medicine. If you came across this, would both of these title
count? Did you just count the most senior figure or would they all count? Please clarify.
Were there any departments that you were unable to identify the “leader?” How did you account
for “leaders” if there was no picture?
May be helpful if you could better outline the flow of how you tracked down the “leaders”- right
now the methodology is a little unclear.
Results:
May want to consider putting the “medical specialty” graphs in ascending order, as the bell-curve
style is hard to read (as there are no anchors on the x-axis)
Discussion:
I appreciate the argument that defining hiring criteria may lead to less bias and discrimination
when hiring women.
In terms of your other argument to close the gender gap, you argue that large practices, electronic
medical records and shift work may reduce gender inequality. This argument is fairly weak and not
explained very well. These things have been around for the good part of 10-15 years at big
institutions and still not much change in the proportion of women at the top given that medical
school admissions are 50/50.
There are great papers that aim to fix the “leaky pipeline” phenomenon (i.e. why women leave
academic medicine), none of these are cited in your paper and there are very few papers from the

last few years supporting your arguments (of which there have been many). I suggest you pubmed
“women leaders in academic medicine” and make your introduction and discussion arguments
much stronger. As you said, this article is aimed to “facilitate meaningful discourse”- and I think it
could do that with major revisions, but as it stands your arguments are weak and references are
out of date.
I love this concept. It’s a great way to get people talking about the dearth of women at the top.
Please keep working on this paper and get it out there!
