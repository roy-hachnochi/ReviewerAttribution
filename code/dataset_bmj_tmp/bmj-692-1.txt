The topic of decision making between total hip arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty is highly relevant in all developed
countries. Authors offer a paper on adherence to NICE national guidelines regarding this topic. Methods and statistics
seem sound. Results are interesting and relevant. Discussion and conclusions are based on results. The paper is well
written and understandable, also for non-native speakers coming from another country with another health system.
I recommend acceptance of the paper.
