I am afraid that I can be of little help reviewing this paper, because I do not consider myself qualified to adequately
assess the methods that have been used in this paper. Below are 2 minor comments that I already spotted when reading
the paper.

for England and Wales, whereas pseudo information is available for the other home nations. Can you explain whether
(and if so: how?) this has affected the calculations of IMD2007?
