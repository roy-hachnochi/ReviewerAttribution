Review by K Benhalima.
This is a well written manuscript on a prospective cohort study evaluating the association between potato

consumption and the risk to develop gestational diabetes (GDM). GDM is an increasing problem and there
is lack of data on which specific macronutrients and food components are specifically associated with an
increased risk to develop GDM. More data are also necessary on which diet can best reduce adverse
pregnancy outcomes in women with GDM.
The strength of this study is that it is a very large prospective cohort study using a validated food
questionnaire every 4 years with a 10 year follow up. The impact of potato consumption on the risk to
develop GDM is evaluated with different covariates in 4 different multivariable models. Another strength
is that different types of potato preparations were also evaluated.
Major comments:
* How was screening performed for GDM and which criteria for GDM were used? Did this change during
the course of the follow up? This should be commented on.
*There are no data on gestational weight gain which is a known independent risk factor for GDM. This
should be commented on.
*This study provides epidemiological data but can off course not show a causal relationship. RCTâ€™s are
needed before pregnancy and/or early in pregnancy to evaluate which preventive strategies can best be
implemented to reduce the risk to develop GDM. This should be commented on.
