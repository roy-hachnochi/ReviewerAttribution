Access to alcohol and heart disease among hospitalized patients.
The authors study more than 1 mil. adult Americans living in different counties in Texas. The study participants were
all hospitalized between 2005 and 2010.
This is a very original study. The authors have used the opportunity to analyze whether the participants where
residents in a “wet” or in “dry” counties and thereby supposedly exposed to more or less alcohol. Hence, it is an
example of a natural experiment - and the results are also quiet significant. In a sub-study the authors look at the
“effect” of changing status of the county from dry to wet on hospital admissions. Propensity scores were usedas proxy
for confounder adjustment.
From several perspectives this study is interesting. If you are a gastroenterologist interested in lever disease, a
cardiologist interested in coronary heart disease, or a public health officer studying the effect of changing legislating in
order to decrease availability of alcohol, this study has some interesting point.
On group basic (clusters of wet or dry counties), the well-known results from observational epidemiology regarding
risk of atrial fibrillation, alcoholic cirrhosis and cardiovascular diseases were re-produced: there were higher risks of
atrial fibrillation and alcoholic cirrhosis and lower risk of coronary heart disease in counties where people supposedly
drink more.
I would have loved to see the discussion of whether the individuals in each county really drink more or less according
to the wetness of the counties and also to what degree miss-classification of the alcohol intake in this context would
mean.
Further, the authors may want to discuss induction time apart from the small sub-study of changes in alcohol status of
the county. It is quite un-clear whether residents are exposed before they actually are hospitalized.
