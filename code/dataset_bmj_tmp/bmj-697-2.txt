I think the authors interpretation of the data should be toned down. While their work provides no evidence that
methotrexate-biologic combinations are superior to triple therapy, and while I believe their interpretation is most likely
correct, the confidence intervals of the data presented do not outrule a clinically significant benefit of biologic
combinations over synthetic combinations.
While the statistical analysis appears well performed to me I am not fully familiar with Bayesian methods and would
advise a formal statistical review for any work of this nature and complexity.
Major comment:
I think this is a question more appropriate for the editor rather than the reviewer. This work is an abridged version of a
Cochrane review which I assume will be published as part of the Cochrane database. What is the value of duplicating
that work in the BMJ?
In summary I believe this is an excellent and important article however I have concerns regarding the value of it being
published twice.
