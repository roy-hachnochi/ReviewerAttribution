The revision is excellent, and I thanks the authors for answering my comments in detail and revising the
paper accordingly.
I have some further, minor comments
1) Why was a 90% CI used when looking at non-inferiority (why not 95%?) – page 16. Is this a
standard level used in the non-inferiority field (I am not familiar with this field, but it is important to
clarify here as I don’t see why 95% is not used)
2) “The estimates and 95% confidence intervals at our primary time point of interest were all below our
original sample size estimate (OR=0.5)” – do you mean below or above (OR estimates are above 0.5)?
Please re-write to be clearer
Best wishes, Richard Riley
