This large prospective epidemiologic study using data from the Nurses Health Study II compares self reported MD
diagnosis of migraine with incident cardiovascular disease and mortality. The primary outcome is total
cardiovascular disease, which combines myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular mortality. The adjusted odd
ratio for total CVD was 1.50. Migraine with aura could not be separated out in this study.
Other studies, as discussed, have shown similar findings. This study generalizes the cardiovascular risk to all
migraine subjects and to multiple cardiovascular risks.
Of separate interest, since this was controlled for in this study, was the report of the baseline increased proportion
of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of myocardial infarction) in the migraine
vs non-migraine groups in this population.
Limitations as noted include the generalizability of the results and clarity of the type of migraine present in the
subjects.
I have no suggested changes or modifications
