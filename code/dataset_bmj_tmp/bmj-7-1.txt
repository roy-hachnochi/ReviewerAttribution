I cannot locate whether or not there has been any input from patients or carers in this
study either in the protocol or on the study project team. I would suggest, that if there was
input and it's not been included, to include an overview of the patient or lay involvement.
I found some of the mathematical extrapolations difficult to understand.
I interpreted the conclusion as within this study there was no change to blood pressure.
Would you not expect the result to be lower blood pressure.
I would like to see long term data, but I by that I mean using potassium chloride over tens
of years in order to see and further adverse events.
Consideration of the potential metabolic differences in handling potassium chloride between
a Chinese population and the population in the west should ve investigated.
