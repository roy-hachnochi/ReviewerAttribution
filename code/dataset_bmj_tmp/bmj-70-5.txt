This largely descriptive study presents data on changes in all-cause mortality over the
period 2012 to 2020 in the city of Nembro.
Population and mortality data obtained from a number of sources are used to show an
increased mortality rate in March 2020 which is much higher than can be attributed to
confirmed Covid-19 registered deaths.
There are a few issues relating to the derivation of ‘person-time’ data which need to be
addressed, and the presentation of results also needs to be improved.

1. Monthly population data is said to have been available for the period January 2012 to
December 2019, together with monthly mortality data. However, to calculate mortality
rates, rather than deriving simple monthly rates using these two sets of observed figures,
interpolation of the population data was carried out between the individual months to
obtain estimated daily figures, and a spline regression model used to obtain fitted
person-years estimates per month. Presumably, these fitted estimates were used to
calculate the presented monthly mortality rates presented in Figure 2? How much did they
differ from the more simplistic rates?

2. The resident population for the period January 2020 to March 2020 was estimated using
regression models based on data from the period January 2012 to December 2019.
Perhaps it might be appropriate to carry out a sensitivity type analysis, and show a range
of possible person-years estimates for this later period, which would then lead to a range
of monthly mortality rates for Jan, Feb, Mar 2020? It is also possible that some migration
to and from this area might have occurred immediately prior to any travel restriction, and
this should be discussed.

3. Could age-sex standardised mortality rates be derived?

4. Were data on cause of death per month available? It would be interesting to see
whether the major causes of death (other than Covid-19) differed pre and post January
2020.

5. Figure 1. It would be more appropriate to extend the y-axis here, eg.to start at 11000
rather than 11500.

6. Figure 2. I would suggest labelling the x-axis with just year (with month tick marks) for
2012 to 2019, and then month labelled for Jan 2020 onwards.

7. Figure 3. I suggest omitting this Figure.

8. Figure 5. It would be useful to summarise this information in a table (perhaps for the
65-74 and 75+ age group alone).
