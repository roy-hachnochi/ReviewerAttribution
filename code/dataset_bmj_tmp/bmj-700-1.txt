Major concerns:

(1) The inclusion and exclusion criteria were not described in the text. Did the authors limit the study
design only to completely randomized design? Or they also included other study designs, e.g.
factorial design, partial factorial design, etc.
2) The event rates varied a lot across studies in this meta-analysis. For example, the even rate in the
treatment group was as low as about 1% (Seino, 2012). In such situation, RR from this study may be
unstable. Did the author consider any specific method to treat rare event (e.g. 1%), e.g. Poisson
random effects model?
3) The statistical heterogeneity test showed there was no variation across 10 included studies (Isquare=20%, P=0.26). However, this heterogeneity test only reflected the difference in the effect
estimates (RRs) from each study. It could not reflect the event rate levels themselves. There are a
huge variation between even rates themselves, e.g. the even rate in the treatment group was as low
as about 1% (Seino, 2012), and as high as about 30% (Barnett, 2013), which deserved a discussion.
4) The extracted information should be listed for each arm, not for overall. Though randomization
can improve the balance of these characteristics between groups, it cannot guarantee the balance. It
would be better to show important variables, e.g, HbA1c and age, by study arm. And compare
whether there is a significant difference in these key factors. It there is unbalance, the related
variables should still be adjusted in a meta-regression framework.
5) The authors missed some important information such as statistical design (here I mean
completely randomized design, factorial design, etc, since all of them are RCTs), and gender (e.g.
male proportion) in table 1.
6) Since hypoglycaemia is a serious adverse event, the relation between such adverse event and
medication should be commonly evaluated in a RCT. Therefore, this meta-analysis should also pool
the risk ratio for adverse effect if possible, though most of the adverse events may be adverse
effects.

Minor concerns:
1) Page 2, line 34 to 41, what is the P for interaction between the dose (full vs. low) and DPP4-I use?
2) Page 2, line 46, 50% should be 52% , or about 50%, also please correct throughout the text.
3) Page 4, line 6 to 8, the full name should be given for ACCORD.
4) Page 6, line 13 to 19, based on the description here, the authors of this meta-analysis should have
gotten some requested data from the principal authors. But this reviewer did not find any sign to
indicate there is such data throughout the text.
5) Page 7 to 8, statistical analysis part, since the significance level was set as 0.10 for heterogeneity
test, the authors should also report the level for publication bias test, and for main analysis.

6) Page 24, Figure 1, the last sentence in the legend does not match the numbers in the box. Out of
13 studies that could be eligible, data from three studies, not four studies, were not available.
7) Page 30, Figure 7, the x-axis should be ln(RR), not RR.
8) Page 31 and 32, Table 1 and 2 could be combined, not necessary to separate them.
9) Page 37, it is debatable to combine low risk of bias and unknown risk of bias.
