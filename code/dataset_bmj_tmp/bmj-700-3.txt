Risk of hypoglucaemia related to DPP-4 inhibitors plus sulphonylureas: systematic review and metaanalysis
I apologise for the delay in completing this report.
The authors have conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs looking at the risk of hypoglycaemia. They
undertake two analyses, a meta-analysis of relative risks (RR) and a meta-analysis of numbers
needed to treat (NNT) to observe a harmful event.
1. The RR meta-analysis method is described on page 7, and is based on either a fixed effect or
random effects model dependent on the statistical significance of the test of heterogeneity (using a
P<0.1 criteria). No method is described for comparing subgroups.
2. The NNT meta-analysis method is described on page 8, and the methodological description simply
described as “pooled in a forest plot”. This is an inadequate description and it is unclear what has
been done.
3. For the RR analysis, the authors report results of comparisons of subgroups (according to
definition of hypoglycaemia, according to dose) but do not explain what test for the required tests
for differences between subgroups have been undertaken. For the comparison of hypoglycaemia a
P-value is reported for “evidence of heterogeneity between the groups” on line 7 of page 10, but we
do not have a method. For comparison of doses the focus is on whether each group is statistically
significant rather than assessing for differences between the groups (lines 9-10), which is regarded
as a misleading way of undertaking subgroup analyses.
4. It is not recommended that an average NNT is computed by pooling, as appears to have been
done in this manuscript (although the method used is not clear). This is because NNTs
mathematically depend on the underlying event rates, which typically vary across studies,
introducing heterogeneity. For example, one determinant of event rates is length of follow-up,
which always increases event rates. Thus pooling studies with mixed length of follow-up (here
studies vary between White with 76 weeks follow-up and baseline event rate of 6.3% and Kikucho
and Seino with 12 weeks followup both with baseline event rates of 1.0%) is likely to introduce
heterogeneity for NNTs, whereas the relative effects are more likely to be consistent at different
follow-up points.
5. The recommended approach (as stated in the Cochrane Handbook) to estimate an average NNT is
to obtain the pooled RR estimate from the meta-analysis and to estimate NNTs from it across a

range of prevalences which reflect different settings. These prevalences may be obtained from the
data in the trials, or from other sources. Clearly here it is important to standardise for the length of
follow-up time, and the NNT needs to be stated conditional on that duration of treatment (the
longer you treat for the more events will happen).
6. I would also encourage the authors to stick with the notation and terminology introduced by
Altman for NNTs, which is the NNT for one person to be harmed NNT(H) or benefit NNT(B). The
authors introduce this at the beginning, but then slip into the rather inappropriate NNH – number
needed to harm. Although widely used, this abbreviation is erroneous.
