The authors have addressed all my concerns.
Regarding the calibration plots, the authors have concern that the revised plots may be difficult to
interpret, primarily the miscalibration at the higher end of risks. Personally I would truncate these plots,
the authors can confirm, but there will likely be very few events at this extreme (i.e. not much data, and
therefore the model doesn't appear to work as well). so 1a and 1b have the plot region 0 to 0.3 on both x
and y-axes and 1c and 1.d, have the plot region 0 to 0.2 on both axes. The authors can make a
comment in the paper that there is some miscalibration at the higher end - this is the region where
miscalibration is probably less important anyway, as they are high risk anyway.
Presenting merely the calibration plots in groups of ten equal size (which is common practice), some
would (and do) argue could be misleading, because of the arbitrarily grouping of patients...
