The authors studied whether oral fluoroquinolone use was associated with an increased risk of serious
arrhythmia. They included adult patients aged 40 to 79 years in Denmark and Sweden. Individuals with
end-stage non-cardiovascular disease or substance abuse were excluded. In comparison to
fluoroquinolones, penicillin V, an antibiotic without pro-arrhythmic effect was studied, each group
consists of more than 900,000 patients.
I recommend this manuscript for publication after minor revision, because new, important data on the
safety of a widely used class of antibiotics are presented. The fact that more than 80% of the patients
had been treated with ciprofloxacin by the oral route should be mentioned in the abstract. Also, it might
be reasonable to indicate the oral use of these drugs in the title “Oral fluoroquinolone use ….”.
