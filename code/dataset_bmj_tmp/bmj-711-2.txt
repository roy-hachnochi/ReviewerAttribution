Originality - does the work add enough to what is already in the published literature? If so, what does it
add? If not, please cite relevant references.
It is generally accepted that population level sodium reduction is potentially a highly cost effective
public health intervention. Thus this paper cannot be regarded as novel or highly original. However it
provides an extremely detailed and comprehensive estimates of the cost effectiveness of sodium
reduction strategies worldwide. Given the scope and execution of the analyses, it effectively extends
and complements earlier papers focused on specific countries and regions. The findings are clear and
definitive and I expect that this paper will become one of the standard references on the cost
effectiveness of population level sodium reduction strategies.
Importance of work to general readers - does this work matter to clinicians, patients, teachers, or
policymakers? Is a general journal the right place for it?

The work is primarily of relevance to policy makers. However it is also highly relevant to clinicians given
their key role in guiding and informing the policy agenda.
Scientific reliability
No issues of concern. The authors draw on high level and relevant expertise in public health nutrition,
epidemiology and economics. The sensitivity analyses addressing the effects of altering the lower
threshold for benefits of sodium reduction is of particular significance and is clearly described.
Research Question - clearly defined and appropriately answered?
Yes. The research question is clearly specified and appropriately addressed.
Overall design of study - adequate ?
Yes.
Participants studied - adequately described and their conditions defined?
Not applicable.
Methods - adequately described? Complies with relevant reporting standard - Eg CONSORT for
randomised trials ? Ethical ?
The methods are succinctly but adequately described
Results - answer the research question? Credible? Well presented?
The results address the research question and are credible. The presentation of findings from cost
effectiveness studies of this nature in a general medical journal with a largely non specialist readership
poses significant challenges. The authors have addressed this challenge well. The tables and figures
provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the main findings. There may be an issue in relation to
the number of tables and figures for the print version of the paper.
Interpretation and conclusions - warranted by and sufficiently derived from/focused on the data?
Message clear?
The overall message/ conclusion is admirably clear, succinct and well written.
References - up to date and relevant? Any glaring omissions?
The authors should cite recent studies that have suggested an increased risk of cardiovascular disease
or death among people consuming less than 3.0 g of sodium per day, as compared with average intake,
e.g. Oâ€™Donnell M et al. Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion, Mortality, and Cardiovascular Events N
Engl J Med 2014; 371:1267. While this paper and others with similar findings have significant
methodological flaws, it is important in the discussion of the current paper to emphasise that this worse
case (and highly implausible scenario) for sodium reduction has been addressed in the sensitivity
analyses.
Abstract/summary/key messages/What this paper adds - reflect accurately what the paper says?
