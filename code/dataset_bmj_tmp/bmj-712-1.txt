This paper has improved.
I am concerned about the use of the term 'recommended' about the frequency of testing,
since as now can be clearly seen the guidance is AT LEAST once or twice a year.
I note that the guidance quoted is often later than the period of the study. So for example
the NICE comment is from 2009. The realisation that intensive control when applied to
people with type 2 diabetes not previously so controlled was dangerous was also not known
until about 2009.
Nevertheless this is an important study which should change present guidance!
