This is a very important topic, and it is also timely and has a variety of interesting implications for public
health, policy, and the people we seek to serve. It is possible that some of my points of confusion emerge
from my lack of familiarity with the overall methodological approach of the study, especially the formulation
of the models and person-years, as I am an anthropologist. At first pass, I loved the paper, but by the third
time through, I did have questions, which I raise below.
Thus, I tried to focus this review on questions that arose for me as I read the paper, which I found to be
stimulating and exciting. I realize that many of my suggestions may soon be addressed by other or future
papers by these authors, and I do hope so, but do not expect them to manage to explain or expand on

everything here. However, I wanted to take this opportunity to “speak back” to the data. Thank you for this
topically interesting paper!
* Originality - does the work add enough to what is already in the
published literature? If so, what does it add? If not, please cite relevant
references.
Yes, this adds to the literature by distinguishing between kinds of migrants, refugee and non-refugee, and
adding information about that to the general knowledge base. It also helps us look at regional differences
in risk.
* Importance of work to general readers - does this work matter to
clinicians, patients, teachers, or policymakers? Is a general
journal the right place for it?
I do think that if the analysis is correct, this information is important for the general audience because it
will help justify further attention and funding to this high-risk population, as well as more research on the
refugee experience, help-seeking and psychosis. It may also prompt studies that reconsider the role of
migration in psychosis risk. It is generally thought to be highest in second-generation migrants, and to
have something to do with “seeming different." This article begs the question: Does this hold true for
refugees (that children are more at risk)? Or, are refugees more or as at-risk as second-generation
migrants? This research also prompts questions about the impact of trauma on mental health and
psychosis risk, and whether that trauma has the most impact pre-, during-, or post-migration. This, of
course, can help us tailor interventions for these populations more accurately.
On the other hand, it is odd/interesting/worthy of more discussion that refugees present to services over a
year sooner than other migrant groups! How can this be? Given that pathways to care/engagement is so
important for successful early intervention, I really hope that more will be written about this, as well (p.11,
line 29-35).
* Scientific reliability
Research Question - clearly defined and appropriately answered?
The concept of person-years is unfamiliar to me, at least, and should be defined at the outset given its
prominence in the paper. How is person-years reflective of general risk, or why were the researchers
asking questions about person-years? Why did they change their analysis from cases to person-years, in
other words? What was gained and lost? Not knowing why (and not understanding the statistical
maneuvering involved) makes me less confident in the findings, even though I very much trust some of
these authors based on their other work. An explanation would be very helpful.
Overall design of study - adequate ?
1) Is the person-years concept and elevated risk assumption are adequately linked in the scientific
literature?
2) Also, why do the included dates stop at 2011? This was quite a long time ago. Some justification would
be helpful.
Participants studied - adequately described and their conditions
defined?
Some issues:
1. Given the very low number of women, I did wonder whether or not it was appropriate or necessary to
include them? They excluded “regions” with less than 1000 refugees per region, why not use the same rule
for gender? I found it perplexing, for example, that only 27 refugee women (out of how many overall?
From where specifically?) developed nonaffective psychosis. This is quite remarkable and warranted more
than a footnote on Table 3. I want to know who the women were who were diagnosed, and how so many
seemed to avoid being diagnosed or developing psychosis given their parallel backgrounds to the men.
2. The Supplementary Table 1 for regional representation was abominable and made very little sense. A list
showing the case (%) from each country in each region would be more adequate and much more readable,
take up less space, etc. This must have been some kind of mistake. Again, the person-years seem like a
stretch.
3. Why did they only include nonaffective psychosis? What diagnoses did they thus include and exclude to
achieve this distinction?
4. Why did they even include inpatients if the later years are outpatients? Could they not do 2001-2011 to
make sure all possible patients are always accounted for in the study? Explain?
5. pg.10, line 18-26, why do you not include gender on this list? You may have missed some of the effects
of being “unfamiliar with the Swedish healthcare system” or having “poor health literacy” for women.
Moreover, given this possibility, it is even more extraordinary that the number of cases from sub-Saharan
Africa is so very high in terms of crude incidence for both kinds of migrants and men! If this holds true,
surely the women may be tremendously underrepresented here. This deserves some acknowledgment or
comment, and I would love to see a richer exploration of this by these authors—also sorely needed in the
literature.
Methods - adequately described? Complies with relevant reporting
1. See above about person years

2. On page 8, why did they adjust for age, sex, their interaction and disposable income? We need more
explanation for these moves. Why? How? To what effect?

standard - Eg CONSORT for randomised trials ?
N/A
Ethical ?
I am not sure what Sweden’s rules are on citizen’s rights and biographical information in their database, so
I cannot speak to this one. Ideally, they asked participants for permission to use their information before
doing so. However, they do have ethical approval, so that's promising.
Results - answer the research question? Credible? Well presented?
Interpretation and conclusions - warranted by and sufficiently
derived from/focused on the data? Message clear?
The finding that African refugee and non-refugee populations are similar in psychosis risk may suggest that
they experience similar levels of trauma in their home countries (as stated pm page 12, lines 3-6, which
really warrants a citation if true), or it may suggest that the effect of ethnic density is more intense than
the effect of being a refugee, or that racism-driven misdiagnoses are more prevalent for this group
regardless, etc. It could also mean that cultural norms are more sharply contrasting between Swedish and
African-born populations, making them more vulnerable to a diagnosis that involves “bizarre behaviors.” Or
maybe it’s because the urbanization of a primarily agrarian African population is acutely stressful. The list
goes on, and this finding warrants further discussion, and hopefully further research!
Furthermore, because this did not hold true in the sub-Saharan Africa population (not 60% higher risk in
refugee population), at least to me it seems to challenge the overall finding of this paper. More discussion
of that issue would also help! Or again, maybe African migrants/refugees (along with women) deserve
separate consideration since there does not seem to be a “refugee effect”? And I would love to see more
about how this relates to the overall literature.
Pg. 10, lines 31-39, ignores how their own data suggests a potential huge diagnostic bias against subSaharan African populations, which are either experiencing (as with Tanya Luhrmann’s work on “social
defeat”) or possibly being diagnosed at much higher rates then the general population (the work of Selten
and Cantor-Grae (cited in #3, but not quite done justice?) on Moroccan migrants in the Netherlands comes
to mind here, although one piece of this work, cited as #8 is used in an unusual way to both raise and
dismiss the issue).
References - up to date and relevant? Any glaring omissions?
This is completely biased, but I do think my piece, Myers,N. (2013) Update: Schizophrenia across Cultures
in Current Psychiatry Reports may be of interest to these authors! It has a good list of recent references
(2010-2013 only) that may update this bibliography a bit, as well.
Abstract/summary/key messages/What this paper adds - reflect
accurately what the paper says?
The broader claims may be weakened by some of the issues mentioned above, and as a non-statistician I
cannot really evaluate that impact (just speculate).
