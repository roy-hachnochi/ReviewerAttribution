This is an interesting and topical piece of work.
As far as I can judge it appears to be methodologically and statistically sound and original.
It's findings are consistent with other research on social determinants and particularly "social gradients" - and is in the
tradition of other research that show that Nobel Prize winners live longer than runners-up.
I think it is in the Christmas tradition of being something people will talk about and will certainly attract media interest.
I recommend publication.
Has anyone done something similar on doctors - or on the health professions more generally?
