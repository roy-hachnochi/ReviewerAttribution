This is an interesting paper which has good potential as a BMJ Christmas paper. Like a number of papers it looks at mortality
rates but it does it properly (unlike some I have reviewed for the Christmas issue) by looking at cohorts of members entering
the two houses, and for those who have died, the date of death, in relation to standard life tables. Data are properly censored
(as for instance when those in the Lower House move to the Upper House). Overall it was a stimulating and interesting read,
and I would have thought would interest many BMJ readers.
The major findings are: a) that MPs and Lords have longer life expectancy than do the general population, b) that that better
longevity has been increasing, and c) that differences between Labour and Conservative are present but are explained by
educational differences. All of that is of general interest I would have thought.
There are specific issues which do however need resolving and clarifying:
1. Figure 1 is very interesting. Is there a trend test, and are the slopes the same in the Lords and MPs?
2. A very interesting part of the analysis is the effect of education level, and in some ways it is the meat of the paper. However
I was worried about the quality of the data, in particular after looking at Appendix table 4. ‘Graduate’ is missing in only about
4% of cases, but ‘Oxbridge’ is missing in about 40%. It seems surprising that university is not known – few people don’t put it
in their Who’s Who entry, and most MPs and Lords are in Who’s Who. What happened here? Ditto for school.
3. If there are really such large amounts of missing data on education, how was it handled in the models? Was some form of
multiple imputation used, or what? In Figure 2 where, for instance 18% of Labour MPs went to Oxbridge, that is confusing as
while 47% didn’t go to Oxbridge, a further 47% are Missing. Since the missing proportions differ between Labour and Tory, the
bars cannot be compared in any meaningful way.
4. There was something confusing about referring on p.4 to “using the same models” (i.e. SMRs) to study relative mortality. If
one looks at table 4, which refers to relative mortality, then it is clear that the oldest members and the ones in the earliest
years have the highest SMRs. What does this mean? That members elected before the age of 30 are much likely to die young?
(Or to die younger than the population of 30 years olds at the time they entered a House?). Somewhere this doesn’t seem
right. I have probably misunderstood, but it would help if it were clarified.
5. p.8. “Only in conservatives we observed evidence of an enhanced rate of mortality improvement relative to the large
improvements already seen in the general population”. Not sure about this. Firstly, where is this tested (i.e. an interaction
between linear year and party)? And secondly, how does it relate to the conclusions about education, where it is said that
Tory/Labour differences disappear when education is taken into account? Are there shifts in educational level between Tory and
Labour (and I can imagine that the Labour entrants of 1945 were far less likely to have degrees than those post-2010). Are
these various statements compatible?
6. Although fairly experienced in statistics, I am not experienced at these quite specialist SMR calculations and would
recommend that they are also looked at by an expert.
Minor issues
1. The calculation of SMRs seems appropriate. In the tables, though, I wondered whether there shouldn’t also be ‘expected
deaths’, to be compared with actual deaths.
2. p.3 and elsewhere. Lords are not elected. “Appointed” is the probably the correct term for the non-hereditary peers. Should
hereditary be distinguished from non-hereditary, and Lords Spiritual and Lords Temporal? Some comment needed. I presume
some hereditary peers could have entered the Lords in their first year of life, in principle (death of Lordly father soon after birth
of child).
3. p.3 (and ? elsewhere). Data (as a word) is plural -- ‘were’ and not ‘was’.
4. I liked the use of ‘strs’ in Stata, but a reference and a line or two of explanation might be helpful (and when a reviewer has
to look at Google then probably the authors have not been quite explicit enough).
5. “Measures of success”. Knighthoods cannot be counted as a measure of success in any simple way since Labour MPs rarely
accept them on principle (although they do go into the Lords). The Labour MPs are therefore ‘structural zeros’ here, and need

handling differently.
6. p.9: “political leaders”. “Politicians” would be better – some of these individuals fortunately had little influence in the way of
leadership…
7. Graduate/postgraduate. Since one can’t be a post grad without being a graduate and graduates and postgraduates are not
distinguished (which is a shame) surely “graduate” is all that is needed?
8. “public secondary school”. Some description of the vagaries of “public school” in UK education might be useful for non-UK
readers – “private sector (‘public school’)” is the sort of phraseology that helps.
9. There seems to be no sex difference (and it should be sex and not gender, using standard medical and scientific use, unless
there is some more information than I had realised on the gender roles and gender identities of members of the two Houses).
But why aren’t the women living longer? Has that already been taken into account by using SMR? If so, a) it should be said,
and b) it should be clarified what the meaning is in table 4 and elsewhere. I guess it means that women members did not live
any more or less than female members of the population than did male members than the male population. Plenty of scope for
confusion here.
10. I did wonder whether years in government/opposition was related to outcome? Did a Labour MP newly elected in 1979
have a different outcome from a Labour MP elected in 1997 or 1945? And indeed, how did years in Parliament affect things
(clearly not relevant to Lords, who stay until they die). Shouldn’t be too hard to calculate.
