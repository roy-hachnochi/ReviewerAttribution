Trying to understand areas of concordance and controversy on the sodium and health
story is a laudable and important one. For attempting that, I would like to congratulate
the authors for their efforts. Sadly, the authors do not provide a balanced perspective and
fail to a substantial degree. While they are generous in their criticisms of studies that do
not fit their own hypotheses, they are not equally critical about studies (largely those that
the first few authors are involved in) which they claim support their hypothesis.
The authors place a lot of weight on three issues: 1) Measurement of sodium; 2) A claim
that one trial demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular disease with sodium reduction,
and; 3) one analyses from a relatively small cohort where they claim that there is a linear
association between sodium measured from multiple 24 hour collections versus
cardiovascular disease.

Unfortunately all three claims are not robust or incorrect or are based on an uncritical
examination of the papers.
There is no doubt that in large studies, investigators have had to use simpler methods of
urine collection such as overnight fasting urines. The correlation in sodium estimated
between the overnight collection and 24 hour urine is about 0.70. The authors are correct
in pointing out the high end there is an overestimation of sodium excretions from the
overnight collection compared to 24 hour urines, and at the low end a (relatively small)
underestimation of estimated 24 hour urinary sodium from overnight fasting urines.
However, they failed to state that the overnight urines provided at least as good (and in
fact in some studies better) associations with blood pressure than the 24 hour urinary
collections. We don’t truly know what a “gold” standard for assessing sodium in a
population should be. Investigators have used the 24 hour urine as a reference standard
(but we don’t know if this is a “gold” standard). 24 hour urine collections have several
problems. In many individuals, complete urine collection is not possible, leading to a
substantial (as many as 20%-25%) elimination of individuals. This may lead to biases.
Further, these biases may relate to people’s occupation, habits, or clinical status. This in
turn may be related to sodium intake. Second, several studies using 24 hour urinary
sodium, as well as overnight urine sodium, have both shown a j-shaped curve or an
inverted association between sodium and cardiovascular disease on mortality. Therefore,
the authors’ hypothesis that using overnight urine collections somehow distorts the results
and leads to the creation of the j-shaped association is not valid as such j-shaped
associations have also been observed in sodium estimated from 24 hr urine collections.
Moreover, even if one wanted to use more precise estimates of sodium to plot the
association with clinical outcomes, the estimates from the overnight sodium can be
mathematically adjusted to derive corrected 24 hour urine estimates. Theoretically it is
even possible that overnight urine collection may be superior to 24 hour urinary
collections as an estimate of long term sodium intake. The reason for this is that during
the day when people consume foods, there is substantial variation in sodium levels in
blood, whereas at night there is a steady state where the sodium level in blood and hence
in urine equilibrates with that in the storage compartments. Therefore paradoxically the
overnight urine may be a better reflection of long term sodium intake rather than a single
24 hour urine (which is subjected to variations of food intake during the day). Indeed, in
some studies estimates of sodium from overnight collections have a stronger association
with BP than from 24 hour urine collections (unpublished).
Second, the authors place much emphasis on the extended follow-up of the two TOHP
trials. In this post-hoc analysis (Cook, BMJ 2007) they claim a reduction in cardiovascular
disease. This is an overstatement. There were approximately 23% of individuals in whom
information of cardiovascular disease was not available. This could lead to biases in that
those who are followed differ from those not. Despite this, there was no significant
difference in cardiovascular events between the intervention group and the control group
(p=0.19). However, after some statistical “adjustment”, the authors squeeze the results
to reach 0.04. Such results do not provide reliable evidence that reducing sodium reduces
cardiovascular disease, especially given the substantial proportion of individuals with lost
to follow-up. Given the post-hoc nature of these adjusted analyses, (there is no evidence
that they pre-specified the covariates or statistical approaches to adjust), these results
are questionable. This is a potentially misleading form of data derived post-hoc analyses
and should at best been seen as hypothesis generating, but in no way providing clear
evidence of benefit. Moreover, the only outcome which was available in the majority of
individuals in the extended follow-up was total mortality and this showed little difference
(p=0.58).

The third piece of the evidence that Cook (Circulation 2014) presents in making a case for
extreme lowering of sodium intake is an analysis of estimated sodium intake using
multiple 24 hour urines versus cardiovascular disease. In principle, obtaining multiple
measures of sodium intake should be a better indicator of average sodium intake than a
single measurement. The problem with this analysis is that the study included 4,500
individuals and ended up with only 2,275 individuals or only about 50% of the original
population. This is likely to be a biased group and so it is difficult to interpret any
associations or lack of associations with outcomes. Furthermore, the authors excluded
events in the first few years in order to avoid reverse causality (which is justifiable as a
sensitivity analysis when associations are observed and one wants to exclude reverse
causality), but they have never presented the data with information including all the
events which occurred during the entire study period. This reviewer wonders whether that
the reason for not presenting such an analysis including all the data is because the results
would be even weaker. The authors do not provide any evidence that the association of
multiple 24 hour urine collections to estimate sodium intake was superior to an estimate
from a single 24 hour urine collections vs BP or CVD outcomes. Despite all the statistical
manipulations, the examination of this spline curve (presented in one of their figures)
shows that the confidence limits around the curve crosses 1 for the most part and so the
association is not significant. Most of the statistical tests and analyses done examining the
associations between sodium intake and outcomes are not significant with fewer than half
of the analyses (Table 4 of the Cook paper in Circulation 2014) – being nominally
significance < 0.05. This is hardly robust evidence. Furthermore, none of the hazard ratios
for cardiovascular events below 3600 mg/dl of sodium intake (one of the areas of
controversy) compared to their reference group of 3600 to 4800 was statistically
significant. Therefore, the authors provide little evidence that there is a lower risk of CVD
associated with a low sodium (<3000 mg/dl) from clinical trials, or from epidemiologic
studies.
The authors do not consider that not only has the exposure have to be measured as
accurately as possible but also without bias. The paper by Cook on the epidemiologic
association is potentially biased as it is based only on about 50% of the participants they
started with. Second, this could also lead to a bias in the outcomes included in the study.
It would be reassuring if the authors provided information on the association of all
individuals (about 4500 people) vs all CVD and mortality (not just in a select subset of
participants or during select periods). Third, the study they cite is relatively small and
barely large enough to detect a clear association between sodium intake vs outcomes in
the overall population, and not at all powered to show differences between different levels
of sodium intake.
While the authors state that in the PURE study there was an association between sodium
intake and blood pressure, they failed to state that the slope of the association is very
similar to what other studies have found using 24 hour urine measurements. Therefore,
one would not expect the measurements of sodium used in PURE to be incorrect. If the
association between sodium intake from an overnight fasting urine versus BP as the
association of sodium measured from 24 hour urine vs BP, there is no reason why the
validity of the measures of sodium become questionable when one relates them to clinical
outcomes.
Furthermore, in the PURE study the associations between sodium and BP varied depending
on the level of sodium intake. In those with a sodium intake below 3 grams, there was no
significant association between sodium intake and blood pressure (despite including
>10,000 people in this subgroup), whereas there was a modest association between 3 and
5 mg/dL intake and a stronger association with BP over 5 grams per day of sodium intake.
Therefore the epidemiologic association between sodium intake vs BP also provides no
justification for lowering sodium intake to levels below 3 gm/day.

The authors cite the INTERSALT study claiming that in primitive communities the BP was
low. The problem is that the BMI and other factors (e.g. alcohol intake) were markedly
primitive different in these communities compared to the other communities. Also,
examining the urinary creatinine (provided in the original INTERSALT paper) was low
suggesting incomplete urine collection (and so the estimated sodium intake may be
unreliable in these communities. The authors fail to point out that in these communities
where the estimated sodium was low, other studies demonstrated markedly shortened
longevity and the population has marked activation of the renin angiotensin system. The
authors also failed to note that an accompanying publication from the Scottish Heart
Study in the same issue of the BMJ (Tunstall-Pedoe 2007) did not find an association
between sodium intake and BP.
The authors cite the paper by He et al (2014) claiming that there has been reduction in
cardiovascular disease in the UK between 2001 and 2011 and during the same time
sodium intakes decreased based on independent studies. Therefore the authors were not
able to directly link the changes in sodium intake and events and so their conclusions are
highly speculative. There are several problems with this paper, in that many interventions
were implemented in the UK that would have decreased cardiovascular disease outcomes
including increased use of statins, better BP control, decreased smoking, increased
consumption of fruits and vegetables, etc. Note salt intake was not measured in this
population. The authors state that because salt intake declined by 15%, the decline in
mortality is due to this factor. This is a very questionable assertion. However, in the UK,
data were reported showing a drop in sodium intake between 2001 and 2008, but not
between 2008 and 2011. Yet during both periods CVD mortality declined. This strongly
suggests that the decline in CVD mortality in the UK had little to do with changes in
sodium intake.
The authors do not emphasize sufficiently that there is a possible mechanism for the
increase in mortality and cardiovascular disease at low sodium levels. There is an
extensive literature showing an increase in activation of the renin-angiotensin system (and
other neurohormones which have been shown to increase mortality) with low sodium, and
this is a perfectly plausible physiologic explanation for the higher event rates seen at
sodium intake below about 3 gms/day.
Lastly, although the authors consider the possibility of randomized trials to resolve the
question, they quickly come down on the side that such trials are not feasible. This is
shortsighted. If in the context of randomized trials one cannot achieve the sustained
lowering of sodium that we would like to achieve, how can we expect this to occur in the
general population where the intensity of intervention would be relatively weak? An
alternative viewpoint would be given that billions of people would be affected by any
recommendations to lower sodium, an investment of a few tens of millions or even $100
million to resolve this controversy by a large randomized trial would be appropriate.
Fortunately there are at least three randomized trials of the sodium question underway at
present. The largest of this is the SSAASS (20,000 individuals) led by Bruce Neal being
conducted in China in communities with high sodium intakes. In this trial, salts with high
potassium and low sodium will replace usual salt (all with sodium). This large trial is
expected to report some time in 2020. If this trial is positive, we know at least salt
substitution is worthwhile. What we will not know is the degree to which sodium should be
reduced or whether the benefit seen in SSASS is due to potassium being increased in the
diet. Nevertheless, the results of this trial will be important as policies could be advocated
to substitute usual salt with low sodium high potassium once.
There are two other smaller trials of lowering dietary sodium on clinical outcomes that are
underway. This includes the study by O’Donnell in Ireland in over 400 individuals with
dietary salt reduction to examine the effects of progression of renal disease in people with
early chronic kidney disease. This trial is also expected to be reported in 2020. The third
trial underway is a trial of nearly 1000 people in congestive heart failure led by Ezekowitz

from Canada in which patients are randomized to usual levels of sodium intake versus low
levels of sodium intake. The results of these three studies will influence the field. Waiting
for the results of these trials would be more prudent than continued advocacy for very low
sodium intakes (using weak data and ignoring data that don’t fit in with the author s
position).
I therefore see little value in publishing this article as it is unbalanced and misleading. If
however the BMJ were inclined to publish this paper, it would be essential for the authors
to substantially revise their paper. It would also be prudent for the BMJ to publish an
alternative viewpoint at the same time. Given that several major trials will be published
soon, it may be wisest to simply wait for them to be published. All can reconsider their
positions at that time.
