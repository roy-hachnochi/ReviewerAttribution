This study describes a cohort study from family practices across the United Kingdom which tracks over 230,000
patients aged 20 to 64 who were diagnosed with depression and exposed to antidepressants, in terms of their risk for
subsequent myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischaemic attack or arrhythmia based on antidepressant
exposure, over five years.
This study represents a very large database and is an important contribution to the literature; there are, however,
some limitations.
1. Is the ratio of MI to CVA/TIA expected? Generally, the prevalence of coronary heart disease is higher rather than
lower than cerebrovascular disease. Does this ratio match with the general population? If not, comment is warranted
about how the exclusion criteria may have impacted this ratio and what importance that may have.
2. The abstract lists 25-64yo age range, looks like it should be 20-64yo.
3. Reasons for excluding angina or other non-MI diagnoses reflecting atherosclerotic heart disease should be provided.
There are many more patients with atherosclerotic heart disease (e.g. angina, require bypass/stent) that don't have a
frank MI.
4. The justification for the study is weak. Although the study is of value, the principal reason stated for this study is

that previous studies haven’t explored a younger age group. However, the literature review include studies that refer
to subjects with a range of ages but the issue of age and how it might impact on these particular findings is not
discussed.
5. Recruitment ended in 2011 and follow-up ended in 2012. Therefore, there is the possibility that a not insignificant
proportion of subjects could not have reached five years of follow-up. As new medications became available over time,
how might this have affected the chance of finding the outcome (or no outcome) with newer antidepressants?
6. The analysis explored 4 categories of antidepressants and a subsequent analysis chose to look at the 11 most
frequently prescribed antidepressant drugs. The justification for selecting 11 (As opposed to 10 or 12 or 13) most
prescribed antidepressants is not provided.
7. There is no explanation as to why "year of diagnosis" is considered a risk factor.
8. Severity of initial diagnosis was determined using codes previously published and “some additional classification by
a member of the study team”. It is possible that severity of initial diagnosis could be an important predictor. The
process of this “additional classification” is not described and deserves more clarity.
9. No justification is provided for the eligibility criteria that the diagnosis of depression must have occurred at least 12
months after registration.
10. Previous depression is an exclusion criteria at entrance. The reason for this exclusion is not provided. The presence
of a previous stroke, myocardial infarction or arrhythmia is not an exclusion criteria at baseline. This might create a
bias in that people with a previous event such as myocardial infarction may be preferentially prescribe one kind of
antidepressant when they eventually become depressed. There is an exclusion of people with one of these outcomes at
baseline but it is described in multiple different ways in different sections of the manuscript. This makes it hard to
interpret. At one point the manuscript states, “patients were excluded from the analysis of each outcome if they had
the outcome recorded a baseline”. In another place it is suggested that one confounding variable was “comorbidities at
baseline (coronary heart disease,stroke/transient ischaemic attack (except when stroke/transient ischaemic attack was
the outcome)”. and then on page 9 the manuscript states “these patients were excluded from analysis of each
respective outcome.” Regardless of the way it is expressed (and interpretation of each definition is subtly different),
there needs to be clear justification as to why a prior outcome will be included for some people but not others.
11. In general, there are many exclusion and inclusion criteria are not justified. For example, why are subjects
excluded if they received prescriptions for antidepressant more than 36 months before the first recorded diagnosis of
depression (i.e. how was 36 months chosen)? What is the justification for the categorization for the number of days
taking antidepressant and the number of days after stopping treatment - why are these ranges of days chosen? Why
are the classifications or categorization of the intensity of drug dose used?
12. There is no description of how eligible subjects would be handled if they left the practice, before 5 years; in other
words, how is this outcome coded?
13. There needs to be more description of how confounding variables were coded (as individual dichotomous variables
or as composite variables)
14. “Deprivation” was derived from patient’s postcodes, “in fifths”. Does this mean “quintiles”? Why quintiles, and how
reliable is this scale?
15. Ethnicity was categorized using “white/not recorded”. Is there evidence that this is an appropriate classification?
What proportion of the "not recorded” are actually white? Or perhaps, those that don’t record ethnicity should not be
included in the analysis of ethnicity, or included as their own group.
16. On page 7, lines 51 to 54 there appears to be a missing parenthesis and maybe missing a short description as to
why this list is included and whether these variables will be considered yes/no or some composite.
17. The main analysis is based on the first five years of follow-up. It is not clear why the cut-off was made of five
years when indeed the median follow-up was 5.2 years.
18. Rather than exclude the monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the 1700+ subjects that were treated with these
compounds, could they not be amalgamated into the “other antidepressants” class.
19. On page 10 the manuscript states that there was an increased risk for lower doses of lofepramine but the hazard
ratio and confidence interval are not reported.
20. The manuscript states on page 12 line 29 that all eligible patients were included. The more important question is
whether all patients exposed antidepressants were included. Clearly they were not, for various reasons, some justified,
some not. The most problematic limitation of the study maybe not the inclusiveness of the eligible sample but the
exclusion criteria that were applied and may limit the generalizability of the findings.
21. The manuscript seems to suggest that including only patients with a diagnosis of depression makes it easier to
separate the effects of antidepressant treatments from those of depression. But, in fact, if patients had also been
included that did not have a diagnosis of major depression but received the same medications, (for example anxiety
disorders), then it may have been possible to distinguish the effects of antidepressants from diagnosis. Furthermore,
exploring other medications that people with depression may be prescribed, for example, anxiolytics, may also have
helped to disentangle diagnosis and medication risks.
Overall the findings are intriguing and this manuscript would be a excellent addition to world literature. Nonetheless,
important clarifications are important and need to be addressed to approve this manuscript for publication.
