Stats Review:
Critical (In Abstract and Main Body of manuscript) - Whenever reporting means (Results), please also provide SDs
In Abstract - Please specify that these are number of coffees/person X years. There is some confusion here as in the
‘outcome measures’ it says ‘total coffee purchased over a calendar year …’ but then in the results these are ported as
per individuals ‘male doctors bought…’

In ‘What this study adds’ depending on editors, this could read ‘purchasing habits’ instead of ‘drinking habits’. Similarly
‘surgeons purchase most coffee’. Nevertheless purchasing can be regarded as a very good proxy for drinking (this might
be included as a limitation or potentially in the Background).
Statistical Methods:
If they are interested in pairwise comparisons, as they have several groups that can be compared they are likely to need
some kind of adjustment for multiple comparisons (if they want to do formal hypothesis testing). The option of just
presenting 95%CI does not deal with this multiple comparisons. Having said that, if their intention is just to rank the
specialties by coffee consumption then this should be ok and just use ANOVA to say that there were differences.
It depends on what they are interested in doing, formally test for differences or just present descriptive statistics of
coffee consumption.
They need to specify more clearly in the methods their unit of analysis. For their primary analysis it seems it is just total
number of coffees consumed. However, for the specialty analysis (as well as gender) it appears to be coffees X person X
year (and not coffees X year) by specialty. This is mention in the Results but please clarify in the Methods.
Same as above for the outcome of “rounds”
