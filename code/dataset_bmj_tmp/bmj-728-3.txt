This study investigated the association between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the risk
of heart failure using data from 4 population-level hospital databases. The authors did a very
thorough job. My only question is that why DB-specific results were not provided for the doseresponse analysis? Why a similar verification approach as the main analysis was not used for the
dose-response analysis?
