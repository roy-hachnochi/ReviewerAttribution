1) The overall PPV of diagnoses in the NHIS data is quoted as 83.4%. This is likely to vary considerably
depending on the specific diagnosis - can the authors tell us more about the PPV for outcomes included in
this study?
2) People with pre-existing cardiac disease in the preceding year to index date were excluded. To calrify,
were people still eligible if they had a known CV event >12 months previously?
3) For the exposure assessment, the first exposed risk period is days 1-3, but people with events on day 1
were excluded, so should this be days 2-3 instead? I think it may be better to keep those with events on
day 1, but to have day 1 as a separate category in the analysis.
4) As the authors note, there is possibly a timing issue for the recording of events like heart failure,
hypertension and arrhythmia compared with when the events were truly incident. This leads to
misclassification in a SCCS which could affect the results in either direction.
