Review of paper titled “Defibrillation Time Intervals and Outcomes of In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Retrospective
Cohort Study from the Get with the Guidelines-Resuscitation Registry”
Overview
The author examined a retrospective cohort of patients over a period of eight years. The patients who were
analysed had in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCAs) who experienced persistent ventricular fibrillation after a first
external electric shock (EES). They received a second shock within three minutes of the first one. The study
aimed to describe temporal trends in the time interval between first and second defibrillation attempts and the
association between this defibrillation time interval and outcomes among patients suffering persistent ventricular
tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF).
Title and abstract
The title identifies the study as a retrospective cohort study. The abstract is correctly structured.
Introduction
1. Page 3, line 23:
I suggest adding the reference: “Jost D, Degrange H, Verret C, Hersan O, Banville IL, Chapman FW, et al. DEFI
2005 A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Effect of Automated External Defibrillator Cardiopulmonary
Resuscitation Protocol on Outcome From Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest. Circulation. 2010. 121(14):1614–22”.
The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to compare the three stacked shocks versus single shock protocol
with 90 seconds of chest compressions between defibrillation attempts. This study included out-of-hospital
cardiac arrests and did not report any difference between the two groups, whatever the outcome.
Methods – protocol
2. Page 4, line 29:
Even if details regarding the data collection have been described elsewhere (reference 11), could you shortly
describe the practical modalities that were used to record the time interval between the first and second shock;
for example, was it a manual chronometer, or was it registered by the defibrillator? Can you confirm that the time
interval measurement modalities were similar from one hospital to another during the whole period of study?
3. Page 6, line 29:
To avoid any misunderstanding, could you explain the reason why you expressed the time intervals with numbers
(<1 minute, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes) rather than with ranges (<1 minute, 1-2 minutes, 2-3 minutes, >3
minutes)?
Patient Population
4. Could you report in the text and in Figure 1 the number of patients who received more than 2 shocks?
5. Page 5, lines 51-55:
The fact that you excluded patients for whom the time from first to second defibrillation attempt was greater than
3 minutes can be discussed. Did you collect any data about what you called “the factors of the resuscitation other
than the intended time duration between defibrillation attempts”?

Results
6. It would have been interesting to report Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves for the two groups of patients, early and
deferred defibrillation. If you think it is feasible, KM could compare either “time from IHCA to hospital discharge
(0 to 30 days)” or “time from IHCA to death (0 to 30 days)”. This would add additional interesting information on
your results.
7. Page 8, line 42:
You wrote “… and a similar increase in the proportion with 3 minutes …” Did you mean “over 3 minutes” or “2 to 3
minutes”?
8. Concerning the time from arrest onset to first defibrillation attempt, its value is different in Table 1 (“2 min
versus 1 min”) compared with the text (Page 8, line 58: “2 min versus 3 min”). The “2 min versus 1 min” seems
to be the correct value. Could you correct this?
Discussion
9. Page 12, lines 12-16:
The time interval between first and second EES is not the only criterion which impacts the patient’s prognosis.
You lacked data on aspects of CPR quality, including frequency and duration of chest compressions or
compression rate and depth. As you know, pre- and post-shock hands-off times (HOTs) also correlate with patient
outcome. Do you have the possibility to measure these HOTs?
10. Page 10, lines 25-29:
References 9 and 10 were two observational “before-after” cohort studies. Here, again, I suggest you rephrase
the sentence because of the results of the only randomised controlled trial that compared stacked shocks with
single shock (Défi 2005, Jost et al. Circulation 2010).
11. Can you confirm that there was:
- No trend in time for the “ratio of patients which were excluded all along the 2004-2012 period”?
- No trend in time for the “ratio of unknown time of defibrillation attempts”?
- No trend in time for the “ratio of time between defibrillation attempts > 3 min”?
Conclusion
This paper reads well and contributes to the debate on the right time spent on cardiopulmonary resuscitation
between the two first external electric shocks in cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest.
This paper (following revision) will make a useful contribution to the literature.
