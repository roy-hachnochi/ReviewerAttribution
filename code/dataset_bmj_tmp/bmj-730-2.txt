Dear editors,
Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to review the manuscript titled “Defibrillation Time Intervals
and Outcomes of In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Retrospective Cohort Study from the Get With The GuidelinesResuscitation Registry”.
This study was an observational study that analyzed a resuscitation registry of in-hospital cardiac arrest patients
between 2004 and 2012. There were two objectives of this study. One was to analyze temporal trends in the time
interval between first and second defibrillation. The other was to discuss whether early second defibrillation or
deferred defibrillation were associated with improved survival.
After the 2005 AHA guideline revision, minimizing the interruption of chest compressions during defibrillation
attempts has been emphasized to support a single shock after 2 minutes of chest compression rather than three
successive shocks. The result of this study may contribute to future guidelines for a second defibrillation attempt
for persistent VT/VF. However, the data for in-hospitals cardiac arrest are limited. This study dealt with an
important topic on resuscitation.
The strength of this study was that it was based on a large, national registry of in-hospital cardiac arrest. The
weaknesses of this study were that the time interval was determined from two reported times recorded in
minutes, and the observational nature of this study, such that the quality of chest compressions could not be
ascertained, as the authors discussed in the limitation section.
One of my main concerns is that if the defibrillation time within the CWTG-R is captured in minutes, the true
value of the interval between two defibrillations might be overly variable. The interval between x minutes and y
minutes were calculated as |y−x| and is provided in units of 1 minute but in reality, it ranged from |y−x| −1
minutes 1 second to |y−x| minutes 59 seconds. (True value of the recorded interval of 1 minute spread across 1
minute 58 seconds.) As this study discussed a relatively narrow range of time periods for early defibrillation and
deferred defibrillation, I think the issue of the true value of the interval needs to be discussed in detail and to be
justified.
Other comments
Page 3, line 8: As the 2015 American Heart Association Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and
Emergency Cardiovascular Care and 2015 European Resuscitation Council Guidelines2015 guideline are now
available, they need to be mentioned.
Page 4, line 12: IHCA needs to be spelled out.
Page 6, line 11: Deferred defibrillation was defined as “> 1 minute between defibrillation attempts.” whereas on
page 12, line 15 it is defined as “≥ 2 minutes”. As the time interval used in this study is the unit of 1 minute, it
represents the same value but this might confuse the readers. Please make them consistent.
Page 8, line 26 and Page 20, line 11: Please double-check the time to first defibrillation in the text and Table. In
the Results section, “median time to defibrillation in minutes, 2 vs 3” whereas in Table 1 “Time to first
defibrillation attempt, min, med.” is given as 1 for early second defibrillation and 2 for deferred second
defibrillation.
Page 25: Please reconsider the presentation of the two graphs. I think Figure 2a could contain all the information
required for Figure 2. A stacked column might deliver the same message.
