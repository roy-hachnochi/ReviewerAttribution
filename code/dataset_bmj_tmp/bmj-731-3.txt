This is an interesting study and thank all the authors for the work.
This population based study found only radioiodine scan was associated with an improved disease specific survival, no
improved DSS from follow up neck ultrasound or PET. Overall, the idea is novel, however since the study is based on
SEER-Medicare, there are several inaccurate coding which might affect the results. The authors set up criteria for
follow up imaging and adjusted some confounders, but I did not see clear explanation regarding how authors tried to
reduce the possible information bias and the findings seemed to be not solid enough to change current guidelines or
clinical practice.
The article is well written in general except I had a hard time reading the Introduction section where some grammar
mistakes (e.g. page 3 line 6) and combination of 'quotes' from different references which seemed jumping ideas. I
would expect a more fluent thought and better expression of concept for the section.
The results section expressed the findings well, but it would be better if it could be more concise. On page 7 line 3,
"Older patients HR..." please be more specific about the HR here. Page 7 line 7, "Utilization of radioiodine..." is the
analysis for this adjusted or not adjusted?
In discussion section, references are up to date. Do you think the high 5-year survival rate for DTC may affect the
results? For example, makes the DSS less significant? If the 5-year survival for a certain disease is 50%, one could
expect a more significant change, either improvement or worsening, from a specific intervention. When the 5-year
survival is 95%, the change from an intervention may be less significant.
Last but not the least, a combination of this idea and the concept of cost-effectiveness study will make the findings
and conclusion more solid.
