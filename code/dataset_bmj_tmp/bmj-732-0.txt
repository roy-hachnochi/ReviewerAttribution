I am happy with the majority of this revision, and I thank the reviewers for replying so clearly.
However, I would like them to address one final point regarding missing data. The authors now clarify
that they used the missing indicator method to deal with missing data. Even though missing data is a
small % for each covariate, it still represents a large number of people (they say: 1126 women had
missing alcohol use (gm/day), 833 women had missing BMI, 417 women had missing physical activity
(mets/wk), 818 had missing postmenopausal hormones use,141 had missing oral contraceptive use,
and 161 had missing smoking status at baseline in 1989. Family history of MI,
aspirin/NSAID/acetaminophen use, history of hypertension , elevated cholesterol or diabetes had no
missing values). Unfortunately, the missing indicator method is a very poor approach for dealing with
missing data in observational studies. Please see [1]. They say in this article that: ‘In nonrandomized
studies, the factor or test under study is often related to variables with missing values, in which case
the missing-indicator method typically results in biased estimates’ and ‘Although the missing-indicator
method was originally proposed for missing confounder data in etiologic research, its use should be
limited to randomized trials only’.
Therefore I must recommend that the authors rather use multiple imputation. I would be very surprised
if this changed the conclusions, though confidence intervals may be wider. Nevertheless, it is important
– for the robustness of the article and to ensure the quality for the BMJ reader – that the authors rather
consider multiple imputation for dealing with missing covariate data. This is readily available in

statistical software, and I envisage (hope) that it is not a difficult undertaking, especially given that I
have no further concerns apart from this.
I hope the authors find this constructive. Best wishes, Richard Riley
