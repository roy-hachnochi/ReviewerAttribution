This systematic review and meta-analysis appears to have been carried out reasonably well.
The search strategy, study identification, data extraction and assessment of bias are appropriate, and the
selection of studies suitable for a formal meta-analysis is adequately justified. Conventional, randomeffects meta-analysis has been carried out on the standardised hazard ratios.
I have just a few points, mainly relating to the presentation of results:
1. The use of standardised hazard ratios (to incorporate several variability measures) is correct.
However, the explanation and description currently provided by Table e3 is confusing. The calculation is
illustrated from the results taken from the paper by Eguchi et al (ref 52). But, this relates to ‘clinic SBP,
mean per 10mm Hg’ taken from Table 3 of that paper, and not BP variability. Surely, the ‘BPV (sd) of
clinic SBP, per 5 mm Hg (per 1 sd)’ data from Table 3 should be used instead? Also, the results for the
standardised hazard ratio per 1 sd are given as 1.44 in Eguchi’s paper, but as 1.43 in the data shown in
Figure e4 in the present paper. Why?
2. Was publication bias assessed?
3. The use of the term ‘sensitivity analysis’ to refer to additional studies not meeting the stringent
inclusion criterion does not seem appropriate, as it conventionally describes a ‘subset’ of the original
analysis.
4. It appears as though the only Forest plot shown in the main paper (Figure 2) relating to just one type
of cardiovascular event (stroke) was selected because it included the largest number of studies. I would
have thought that at least figures showing all cardiovascular events (currently Figure e4) and mortality
(currently Figure e1) should be included in the main paper. Also, it would be useful to include Figure e10
showing the results for home systolic BP variability.
5. Abstract. It is not clear why results for CVD mortality are not included here.
