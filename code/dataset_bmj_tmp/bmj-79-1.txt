This communication describes the result of a national observational study from data derived from the UK
Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) describing epidemiological features and pregnancy outcomes of

hospitalized women with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. In particular, this well-written and
well-organized communication describes clinical characterizes and risk factors from 427 hospitalized
pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 and compares them with a cohort of 697 pregnant women
who did not have COVID-19. The experimental design of this investigation is valid, statistical analyses
are appropriate, the results are summarized in 4 easily interpreted data tables and 1 figure, and the
discussion highlights the data and overall goals of the investigation. The references are as complete as
can be made given the continuous publication of new studies on a daily basis. This is a highly important
investigation reporting the largest cohort of pregnant women with COVID-19 and their clinical obstetrical
and neonatal outcomes, and will significantly add to our knowledge of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 during
pregnancy.
The authors may wish to consider the following comments and suggestions for revising their manuscript:
Pg 4 Lns 56-57. The authors state that "only a few instances of reported transmission of SARS-CoV-2
infection to the neonate.20-23". This wording may be confusing and indicate that there have been
instances of intrauterine viral transmission. Could you please consider rewording this to say (as an
example) "only a few instances of neonates who had positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 following delivery".
Pg 5 Ln 26. Methods. As obesity and overweight were significant risk factors for hospitalization of
pregnant women with COVID-19, please explain the criteria used for determining overweight and obesity
in this study population. Did you use pre-pregnancy BMI? Did you take into account variations in
gestational weight gain? Gestational weight gain does demonstrate potential variation between various
ethnic groups.
Pg 8 Ln 31. There were a total of 5 maternal deaths. Is there information available whether these deaths
were due as a direct result of complications of COVID-19? If yes, was COVID-19 the major underlying
cause of death? If yes, is there specific information available on whether these women had an immediate
cause of maternal death from respiratory insufficiency, cardiac disease, thrombosis, multiple organ
dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or other causes?
Pg 9 Lns 35-45. Six neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 12 hours of birth. Please specify (if
known) whether these infants were isolated from the mother immediately following delivery and if
skin-to-skin contact was permitted. Also, if known, please state if viral analyses were performed on
umbilical cord blood, placenta, vaginal secretions, neonatal anal swab and/or neonatal blood?
Pg 9 Ln 35. The authors may not have this information, but did any of the neonates who had positive
tests for Sars-CoV-2 have a prior test that was negative?
Pg 12 Ln 39. The authors use the term vertical transmission - this term indicates mother-to-infant viral
transmission, and is not specific for a time period. Vertical transmission can occur in utero, during
delivery via an infected birth canal, or postpartum via respiratory droplets, skin-to-skin contact or breast
feeding. In this statement, did you mean to indicate that intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission may
be occurring?
Pg 18. References #6, 7 and 8 require the left margins to be revised.
