This is an excellent, timely reflection on how the COVID-19 is likely to further accentuate social
gradients in health and on how efforts to “flatten the curve” should be adapted to reduce their impact
on the most vulnerable members of society.
I have two suggestions.
First, the comment is solely focused on high-income societies. The social consequences described by
the authors will likely be much more intense in societies where large proportions of the population live
in urban slums and are informally employed. Slum dwellers will be unable to self-isolate or practice

social distancing to any meaningful extent. Informal work, under lockdown or similar restrictions of
circulation, will result in lack of sufficient food in many households. Begging for food on the streets
had not been seen in my hometown in Brazil for many years, only to come back with the pandemic.
My suggestion is that the authors either add a paragraph on the impact of the pandemic low- and
middle-income countries or make a statement that their commentary is focused on high-income
societies.
Second, I am happy to see that the authors mention the need for repeated serological surveys, but
they then seem to focus on the application of serological testing for producing “immunity passports”,
and issue for which existing rapid tests appear to be inappropriate (see World Health Organization.
"Immunity passports" in the context of COVID-19. in Scientific Brief (WHO, Geneva, 2020). I would
argue that an equally important objective for serological surveys is to track progression of the
pandemic in different social groups (as opposed to individual-level diagnosis), a goal for which many
currently existing tests are sufficiently accurate. Such surveys are particularly important when carried
out a household level, thus avoiding social-class related selection bias associated with surveys carried
out in health facilities or using volunteers.
