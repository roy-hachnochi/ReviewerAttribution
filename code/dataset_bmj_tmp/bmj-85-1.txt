This is a very important topic to address, given the abundance of variable information circulating by
government officials, the media, and populations. The use of appropriate PPE is known to reduce the
rate of transmission, however, it is a fairly small sample size, considering the magnitude of this
pandemic, to assert that appropriate use of PPE shows the prevention of all transmission possibilities.
It’s unclear to me whether the control HCPs and patients who recovered were tested from the same
hospitals and at the same time as those HCPs who had exposure. I think to maintain the validity of the
controls, this would be important.
It is also unclear what time points in the two weeks of quarantine the HCPs were tested. In the text it
stated that the antibody sensitives would be 100% by day 15, however, the authors stated that “blood
tests of our participants were performed after over at least 8 days of isolation, it is unlikely that these
results had been a false negative.” This is a misleading sentence because on day 8 there is still a 1.8%
possibility of a false negative.
This is information that patients/carers can take up, the only concern is that it may be assumed that this
study demonstrates that PPE will prevent all transmission and may become more lax in social distancing
efforts, etc.
