Congratulation to all the authors of this manuscript for taking this arduous task of systematic review and
meta-analysis.
I do not have specific comments as the manuscript is well executed and written.
It is interesting to note that majority of the diagnostic test accuracy studies are of case-control study
design. This is also true in all diagnostic test accuracy studies on other diseases. A prospective follow-up

study design is more appropriate since the accuracy result is dependent on the duration or disease from
the time of symptom onset. Hence, future research in diagnostic test accuracy must emphasize on the
test results in relation to the progress of the disease as specific to 'days' instead of 'weeks'. The
emphasis could also be incorporated into the PRISMA-DTA (2018) or STARD Checklist (2015).
