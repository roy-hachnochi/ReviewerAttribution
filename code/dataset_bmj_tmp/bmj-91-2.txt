Thank you for inviting me to review this paper on the effects of five key distancing interventions on the
COVID-19 pandemic.
It presents actual data on the numbers of COVID-19 cases and reported deaths from 119 countries after
the implementation of five key distancing interventions – school and workplace closures, event
cancellation, “lockdown measures” and closure of public transport. All five were introduced in 77
countries. The team have looked at what measures were adopted, and how soon after the first reported
cases, and how the numbers of cases and deaths rose before and after the measures were implemented.
Its strength lies in the presentation of actual data rather than from mathematical modelling or
extrapolation from outbreaks caused by MERS or SARS, both of which are probably rather less
transmissible.
The study design is appropriate. It is well written and presented, with a clear message.
There will be minimal work for a copy editor to do.
It certainly belongs in a general journal such as the BMJ, and I imagine that will be much cited by other
authors, and will quite probably also attract international media attention. The conclusions will be helpful
to policymakers, not least when some UK politicians are openly questioning the value of lockdown
measures.
This can’t have been easy to do, and inevitably the data won’t have been uniformly robust, however
they discuss the limitations appropriately. They were not able to drill down to more specific measures
such as the widespread wearing of masks, the use of ‘phone apps to trace contacts, track and trace
systems, differences in availability and use of PPE, the numbers of available beds and ventilators, all of
which might have had an effect on both transmission and clinical outcome.

Albeit on a global scale, this demonstrates just how difficult it is to undertake studies on the efficacy of
any infection control measure, as the transmission of any outbreak is always multi-factorial and will also
be affected by things that you can’t possibly control for, including human behaviour and compliance, or
perhaps how rigorously individual state authorities were prepared to implement their various control
measures.
The authors have done a good job in distilling such a large amount of complex data into a manageable
document with a couple of short key messages, namely:
1. If the four measures (school and workplace closures, public event cancellation and “lockdown”
measures) were already in place, then shutting down public transport closure didn’t confer any extra
benefit.
2. The measures worked best when public events cancellation and lockdown were implemented first.
The first conclusion may not be so very surprising –if only key workers can go to work; you can’t go to
school, or a public event and are not supposed to leave your house without very good reason, apart
from a visit to the supermarket perhaps, where is there left to travel to? Trains, trams, tubes and buses
should have been much emptier anyway. Nonetheless, that’s an important consideration for
policymakers.
At 300 pages, it is the longest submitted manuscript that I have ever seen either as a journal EIC or
reviewer. The online supplementary material is interesting, but there is an awful lot of it, although
nothing that I would excise.
That said, I wonder whether the individual figures in S5 and S6 might be better presented together for
each country rather than each being listed sequentially? It would be interesting to be able to view the
dates the measures were introduced, cases and deaths (s5) side by side with the modelling data (s6).
