I read with deep interest the manuscript by Siemieniuk and co-workers assessing trough a a living
systematic review and network meta-analyses the potential therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection
prevention and treatments. The project is extremely timely and interesting and the possibility to consult
a constantly updated systematic review and meta-analysis bases on the latest evidences is of great
importance. In particular, the clinicians involved every day in the care of COVID-19 patients have to face
not only with the difficult of caring but also with a mounting wave of literature. The authors developed a
rigorous and methodologically consistent study and the main result that they reported is that as of June
10th none of the treatment tested in RCT have proven to be effective in reduce mortality in COVID-19
patients. Correctly, the authors provided and present the main outcomes hierarchically starting from
mortality (level of evidence ranging from low to very low). I would only suggest to follow the same
hierarchy also in the conclusions of the manuscript highlighting that no evidence of effect on mortality
was observed among the investigated therapies.
The daily evolving scenario with new evidences coming from RCTs (i.e. medRxiv 2020.06.22.20137273)
confirm that this could be the right way to assess and interpret the latest evidences.
Major comments:
- Table 1 as it has presented in the proof is not interpretable.
Minor comments:
- Page 14 line 9 “Four RCTs and 557 participants” “enrolling”.
- Page 15 line 31 “remdisivir” “remdesivir”.
- The manuscript must be checked for spelling and language errors.
