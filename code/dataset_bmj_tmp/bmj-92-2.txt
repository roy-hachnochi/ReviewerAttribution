This manuscript is well-written, the methods and analysis are robust, and the study is of great
importance to providers and policy-makers managing COVID-10 patients and populations.
Major comments
1. The discussion section should have an expanded limitations section, going beyond the limitations of
the data themselves to include the limitations of NMA approaches, use of pre-prints (not peer reviewed),
lumping of mild/moderate/severe disease severity, among others.
2. Only 2 of 18 studies had low risk of bias: the discussion section would benefit from emphasis of this
point and specifically how future trials could be improved in order to provide more robust data.
3. There are several instances of GRADE jargon. For example, page 9: “minimally contextualized” needs
a brief explanation. This is referred to again on page 2 of the Discussion, with some explanation and a
citation, which are helpful. However, an additional sentence here or int eh methods section would make
the meaning clearer to non-experts in GRADE.
4. Outcomes were selected by the guideline panel (page 7): how were they selected? Was there a
formal process?
5. Comparators
a. The first paragraph of the results section (page 9) could benefit from a sentence on the comparators
in the 18 studies: how many compared to standard/no drug care, and how many involved an active
comparator?
b. It is unclear to what degree indirect comparisons contribute to the conclusions since most of the
included studies (about 2/3s) examine the intervention versus standard care only.
c. Although in most situations the comparator is clear, sometimes it is not. For example, first page of
the discussion: “There was no convincing evidence that the other interventions resulted in benefits or
harms.” Compared to what?
6. The table (unlabeled, page 31/65) indicates a category of “most effective”: this suggests a
categorization which is mentioned in the methods section. However, there appears to be no other
mention of categories of effectiveness, but rather simply whether a drug is effective (or not), compared
to standard care. This paper should refer to what was done in the current study, separate from what
may be planned when data are more prolific.
Minor comments
1. Page 6 line 43: “…the guideline panel approved all decisions relevant to data synthesis were
approved.” Please reword.
2. Page “1”, line 38, Discussion: “evidence for treatments of COVID-19 up to June 10, 2020.” This
could be clarified as the paper is not about all treatments for patients with COVID-19, but only about
pharmacotherapeutic agents.
3. Page “1”, line 38, Discussion: “Lopinavir-ritonavir probably reduces intensive care unit length of stay
and may increase adverse events when compared to the other interventions…” The part of this sentence
on adverse events is redundant with the next sentence.
4. Page “2” line 13, Discussion: “We expect that the relative effect will not vary importantly across
methods of measurements and will an analysis using this hierarchy in the update.” This needs
rewording.
5. Page 2, discussion: “The limitations … and the desirability… explains differences”; should read
“explain”.

6. Discussion page 2 line 41: ‘We will periodically update this SR and living NMA. The changes from each
version with be highlighted to readers…” needs rewording.
7. “Remdesivir” and other generic drug names are sometimes capitalized. They should be lower case.
8. The table (starting page 20/68) spreads across numerous pages, but without repeat of row
headings/study labels across pages. These are thus very difficult to interpret as presented in the pdf for
peer reviewers.
9. How was viral clearance measured? PCR? or Live virus culture?
10. The tables and annexes are not numbered and I did not see any legends.
11. The Figures page 42-46 have no legend. It is unclear why they are oriented in different ways, with
standard of care in varying locations.
a. The significance of the thickness of the lines is explained on page 8, but not with the figure which
would be useful. For non-experts, the size of the node needs an explanation also.
12. Page 56/68: “Therapies for treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19: introduction and methods for a
living systematic review and network meta-analyses; An international collaborative project”. I assume
this is the study protocol or workplan, but it is not labelled as such.
13. The title includes prophylaxis, yet the 2 trials addressing this question were not included. The title
should focus on what is actually reported in this paper, and not what is planned for future papers.
14. The second table (starting page 47/68 of the pdf) appears to be the pairwise comparisons, whereas
the table (unlabeled, page 31/65) is the effectiveness compared to standard care, presumably based on
the NMA and not just on direct/measured data. This should be clear in a table legend, particularly for
non-experts in NMA.
