Although the authors have addressed some issues and performed sensitivity analyses in
response to reviewer concerns, there remain problems with the analyses. In particular the
use of mean consumption rather than utilising measures over time via hierarchical models,
and the censoring of patients with other first cancers, which may not satisfy the
requirements of non-informative censoring. The authors should perform the analyses to
address the outstanding concerns of the reviewers, which may affect the results and
conclusions that can be drawn from this data.
