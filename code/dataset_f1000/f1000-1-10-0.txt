 I am now satisfied with the changes that have been made by the authors, and these revisions have made an improvement from the first version of the article. There are a few other minor concerns that the author may want to be consider; 1. All the data presented in this manuscript are generated by T cell lines or T cell “clone”. D10 cells are T lymphoblasts that continuously proliferate without stimulation, thereby exhibiting cancer cell properties. It is important to demonstrate this phenomenon occuring in vivo using primary T cells. 2. It isn’t very unclear how TCR internalization was measured by using anti-TCR antibody in the beginning and the end of incubation; this could be explained better. 3. In the abstract, it would read better if the word “interestingly” was deleted from the start of the second paragraph.
