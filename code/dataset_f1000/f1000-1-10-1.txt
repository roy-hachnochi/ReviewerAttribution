 The findings concerning the role of TIM1 and domains thereof in the trafficking of T cells are original and important. The manuscript is clear and uses powerful tools. I do have minor reservations on the discussion concerning apparent differences between findings in this paper and those reported elsewhere. The authors use a simple reductionist tool kit. Normal T cells are not studied (for reasons that are well justified). Differences in the cell population used in this and the cited works may or may not prove important. Next is the choice reagents to conduct the analysis. In mouse systems there are anti Tim1 antibodies that stimulate and others that inhibit T cell activation. It would be fascinating to learn (not in this paper) whether this is due to effects on Tim1 localization in or opposed to the IS.
