 The research described in this article is interesting, mostly well done, and worth publishing. My major concerns: 1. The manuscript over interprets some of the data. 2. The polarized distribution of Tim1 needs a confirmation using primary T cells. 3. The effects of Tim1 mutations on the distribution of signaling molecules should be included to support tyrosine phosphorylation data.
