 This article takes a valuable step in the direction of improved scientific communication by making compound data sets and software, which have been created by the authors in the course of their research over a number of years, available to the scientific community in machine-readable format. This step dramatically lower barriers for reproducing, using, and building upon this research and sets an important standard for other authors who write papers about digital collections and software. Currently, the downloads are provided at the authorsâ€™ institutional web-site. Given the possibility that this URL may change, it may be helpful to assign a stable digital object identifier (DOI) to the entire collection of 30 data sets and programs; or potentially to assign a separate DOI to each data set and program, so that they can be referenced and accessed in a more fine-grained manner.
