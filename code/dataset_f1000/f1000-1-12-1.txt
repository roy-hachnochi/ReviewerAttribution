 This is a very interesting and compelling article. In a simple and extremely clear style Karin Romisch does a beautiful job placing protein export by intracellular malaria parasites into a solid cell biological context. She corrects important topological misconceptions (unfortunately common in the parasitology/infectious disease fields), acknowledges other authors with similar ideas, and overall makes a crystal clear and important contribution to our understanding of one of the most fascinating problems in protein transport to emerge in recent years.
