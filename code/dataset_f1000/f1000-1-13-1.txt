 Case reports should be used to publicise unusual or rare events that for epidemiological reasons cannot be reported in better, more informative formats such as case series and controlled trials. There is nothing new or unusual about ozone therapy for disc herniation. There is already an abundant literature, with many case series, that describes this intervention. A report of two cases does nothing to enhance this literature. The science of this intervention can be advanced only by a randomised controlled trial.
