 This is a clearly written and interesting opinion that we mostly agree with. Together with the recent studies of the CRISPR system and Patrick Forterre’s just-published provocative concept of the “virocell” , this paper reflects – and promotes – a growing appreciation of the importance of bacteriophages in shaping the bacterial (prokaryotic) world. While we believe that the relationships between bacteria and their phages are even more complex than discussed here (e.g. phage lysogeny likely plays a greater and more complex role) this manuscript is definitely a good step in the right direction.
