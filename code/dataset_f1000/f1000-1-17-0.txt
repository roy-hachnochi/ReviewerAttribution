 This is an interesting article that provides a conceptual framework for prioritizing areas for protecting ecosystem services (ES) such as water provision. The article explores similarities and differences between ES prioritization and biodiversity prioritization, and highlights several key components that need to be considered in prioritizing areas for protecting ES. Two key components are the need to consider the costs of protecting areas and the importance of considering human-derived alternatives. The conceptual framework is then applied to a case study based on water provision.
