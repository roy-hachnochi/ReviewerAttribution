 This work presents an interesting conceptual framework that researchers as well as governments or other stakeholders could use to identify priority areas for protecting ecosystem services. The authors suggest the following key elements: (1) determine the services of interest, (2) quantify the demand for the service(s) and capacity of the ecosystem to meet demand through supply of the service (3) identify the threats and level of threat, and (4) estimate the cost of protecting the service as well as any alternative means of providing the service. The authors then review the literature in which priorities have been assessed and identify which steps have been taken and which not in each study or effort. I hope this paper will increase our attention to key aspects of ES assessment that are often ignored, especially the interaction among all of these key factors.
