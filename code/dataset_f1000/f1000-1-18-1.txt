 I read this case report and found it interesting. This kind of psychiatric pathology is mostly found in countries with strong social bonds between the members of the community, including the family. I had a case of shared hallucinations between father and wife/daughters. When the father said “do you hear the noise?”, they said yes, and not only to please him. For women of this family, it was impossible to consider that the father may say wrong things. Therefore, I suggest to accept this report, with a slight look at the references #2 and #5 that should be revised and completed.
