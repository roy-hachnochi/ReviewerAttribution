Poisot and coauthors have now discussed in more detail the potential mechanisms underlying the intriguing result they have uncovered. They have also emphasised that the result is robust against the problems associated with examining population growth of cells of differing size using optical density readings. It will indeed be interesting in the future to determine the coevolutionary implications of such rapid phenotypic change despite no obvious fitness benefit (i.e. no increased resistance to phage). I have only one minor comment remaining: Perhaps I am missing something, but the legend for figure 2 states that the variable presented is the forward scatter and yet the paragraph below states that there were no observed differences for forward scatter, only side scatter. Please could you clarify?
