The authors provided greater clarity on the controls for their study, and this was my main concern with the earlier submission. Although the mechanistic details on phage exposure and its apparent effects on bacterial growth have yet to be completely elucidated, the phenomena in this study are highly interesting and readers will be intrigued by these results.
