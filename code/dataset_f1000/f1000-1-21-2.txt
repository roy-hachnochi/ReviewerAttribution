 1. ls there a subpopulation of the UV inactivated phage that are destroyed in the process of creating them, such that addition to bacterial cultures might constitute addition of DNA that can be taken up through transformation ? If so, is it possible that this transformed DNA is being used as a nutrient by the bacteria? This might explain the slight increase in growth rate of phage-exposed bacteria in the experiments. There is precedent in other bacterial systems, but I do not know whether this provides an alternative explanation in the current study. The authors should take this possibility into account. 2. It is unclear what constitutes the controls performed in this study. One choice of control would be to obtain the UV-inactivated phage, and then remove these particles via centrifugation. The particle-free supernatant would then be added to controls, so that all components (except phage presence) would be otherwise identical across treatments and controls. However, it is unclear whether this was the approach used, and therefore I am worried that the chosen control is insufficient for drawing proper conclusions in the work. Overall, the work seems very preliminary, and the data presented are not strongly supportive of the conclusions drawn.
