This second revision is fine except for the following suggestions/corrections: Reference 6 should read Chinsky JM, not Jeffrey MC. In the introduction I would suggest changing “ significantly higher prognosis ” (line 6) to “potentially better prognosis”. In the Discussion, paragraph 6; remove "really" from " Hydranencephaly has a really poor prognosis " so that it simply reads "poor prognosis".
