 This case report is interesting. Except of some grammatical mistakes, I do have one suggestion. The authors should also discuss the social aspects and the social stress which accompanies families with hydranencephalic children. It is important to induce abortion when possible in such cases since the prognosis is very poor. Early diagnosis is the most important aspect in such cases. The paper of mine, Petridis et al. (2011) deals with the social aspects of hydranencephaly and should be cited by the author.
