 This case report presents an interesting case of apparent hydranencephalic changes, in addition to more extensive developmental brain anomalies (lack of thalamus and basal ganglia). However, including the points made below would make the manuscript much more useful as an educational resource: The manuscript would be enhanced if the author’s did more than just itemize a list of associated etiologies for hydranancephaly. The authors should provide a paragraph explaining how any of these etiologies could specifically produce the anomalies observed (cerebral arterial stroke or spasm of which specific vessels) and perhaps contrast it with any syndromic or associated genomic alterations listings of similar brain findings (or at least provide evidence that they researched this aspect). I’m not sure all would accept this as a variant of the same processes that cause classic hydranencephaly since it appears to be so much more extensive anomalous formation of the final fetal brain. The authors may have to do a little more research and discussion to support their contention based on how others who have written about hydranencphaly and define the condition. There are several grammatical errors (e.g. in the Abstract “such that absent cortex” is an incomplete phrase to end the sentence) which should be addressed, and I suggest the article is proof read again to ensure it reads how a published manuscript should do.
