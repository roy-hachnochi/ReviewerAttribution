 I approve the validity of this opinion article with some minor remarks. I personally do not approve of female genital cutting as a general routine, however it is commonly practiced in rural areas of third world countries. Due to this, it is important to study how to best deal with the problem rather than totally deny it. The first degree procedure may be a first step towards avoiding further damage. I think that the final section ‘final remarks’ should be replaced with the title ‘conclusions’.
