 The response quality following high‐dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma (MM) is clearly correlated with progression‐free and probably also overall survival. Thus a major goal of all protocols for the treatment of younger patients with MM is to achieve a chest radiogram (CR). Recent data of the Spanish myeloma study group reveal long‐term disease free survival in a subgroup of patients with CR after autologous stem cell transplant (SCT). Inclusion of novel agents (thalidomide, portezomib or lenalidomide) in the induction regimens prior to stem cell harvest and transplantation has allowed to achieve better remission quality prior to and after autologous SCT and to reduce treatment‐related mortality. Recently also protocols containing 2 novel agents have been used to improve induction regimens for patients with multiple myeloma. In this study the PETHEMA/GEM group has studied and compared 3 induction regiments VTD (2 novel agents), TD and VBMCP/VBAD (an intensive regimen with bortezomib). VTD showed the best equality of remission (CR rate 35% vs 14% with TD and 21% with VBMCP/VBAD/B. Also the PFS after VTD plus autologous SCT was significantly longer when compared two both other induction protocols. Unfortunately 14% of the patients in the VTD arm developed grade 3 and 4 PNP. Thus, future studies should use either bortezomib or proteosome inhibitors with a lower neurotoxicity. In addition, the VTD regimen in contrast to the GIMEMA study was not able to overcome the poor prognostic impact of high risk cytogenetics.Thus other treatment strategies e.g. allogeneic SCT, novel IMiDs or PI should be evaluated in these high risk MM patients (17p del, 7(4;14)).
