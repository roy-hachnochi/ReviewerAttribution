 Avascular bone necrosis is a debilitating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Due to the prolonged life expectancy of SCD patients, the incidence of this complication is surging as it could be a manifestation of the disease chronicity. In this case report, The authors present a severe case of ankylosis of hips and knees secondary to SCD. Indeed, the severity of this presentation is unusual and may be partially due to lack of prevention and optimal early management. Although the clinical management of the patient was not discussed, it would be interesting to know if this patient was on hydroxyurea or on antithrombotic agents and if he was enrolled in a comprehensive SCD care facility. Moreover, since the patient has been bedridden for eight years, it is possible that thrombophilic factors may have further exacerbated the condition and its progression to multiple joints.
