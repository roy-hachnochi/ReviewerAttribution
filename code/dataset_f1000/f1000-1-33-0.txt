 This is essentially a good paper, however there are three areas where it needs to be improved. 1. There needs to be a succinct but informative overview of the marker. In addition, could the authors present a Kaplan-Meier curve of the marker in pathological samples? 2. The sensitivity and specificity ratios aren’t good enough. Despite the authors mentioning this in the discussion, both ratios ought to be well above 90% perhaps even 95% as both won’t be good enough for a screening test. The risk of missing a cancer is so huge otherwise. 3. The authors need to follow the NIH sequence of validation of biomarkers and explain how they plan to proceed with further validation.
