Overall this research article is well written and clear for the most part. I do however have 2 minor comments for the authors to think about: 1. It would be interesting to include data on the time course and extent of hemolysis as this may contribute to toxicity and also the nitrite depletion. 2. The presentation of Figure 5 is unclear. The authors should better describe and explain this figure. 2 sets of 2 peaks are seen at different times. Please explain the times shown for each peak. Please explain each peak and exactly what it is and how it was measured. It is noted that 2 samples are shown, which correspond to which peak? What is the difference between these 2 samples? How does this relate to the time shown? Were there quantitative standards that were run for HbNO and SNOHb? Could some portion of these small peaks arise from residual nitrite?
