I have reviewed the second version of the article, however I still have reservations about it: 1. Even though the authors explained why they did not randomize the work it is still something that is required for a study of this type. 2. There are only two baseline characteristics (age and gestational age) which I don’t think are sufficient. 3. I still maintain the authors should report that actual p-value. I disagree with their assertion that it would “confuse the reader with too many numbers”. 4. With regards to the newly added power analysis, I am unable to reproduce their calculation and thus I think it is mathematically incorrect. Furthermore, since they planned on subdividing the groups by gestational age, this means they are underpowered for each of the subgroups. 5. I also find it hard to believe that the data was normally distributed in such a small sample size. In the subgroup analysis, there were only a handful of patients in each arm. A t-test cannot be the appropriate statistical test.
