 This is an interesting study examining the additional benefit of transcervical Foley in second trimester termination of pregnancy with misoprostol. Overall, this study is valuable, but I have a few reservations regarding their methodology. 1. The authors should explain why this was not randomized. It seems like a relatively simple thing to do and it would improve the methods significantly. 2. The authors list more baseline characteristics. Especially considering this was not blinded, how are we to be sure that the groups were equal at baseline? 3. The authors should report the actual p-value, not just whether it was less than or greater than 0.05. 4. How did the authors determine their sample size of 50? There was no power analysis done. A skeptical reader might conclude that the study was stopped only because statistical significance was reached. 5. With so few patients, was the primary outcome normally distributed? If not, the t-test would not be the appropriate statistical test.
