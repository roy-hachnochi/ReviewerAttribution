 It is an interesting study adding to the emerging recent evidence on the efficacy of balloon catheters for cervical ripening and induction of labour. However, the above issues need to be addressed in order for the conclusions to be valid: 1. Allocation is by patient choice. Without true randomization the potential for bias exists. 2. How were the sample numbers calculated (power)? 3. Introduction of mechanical devices such as a balloon catheter through cervix into uterine cavity may lead to increased incidence of infection. Although this was an outcome measure in the study protocol, there was no mention of infection rates (whether they were the same or were higher) in the results section – this would have been important if the results are to be useful for general populations in future. Ampicillin was used prophylactically in the combined group – were the authors worried about sepsis too? 4. The age and gestational ages in comparison groups look remarkably similar! 5. Why were only primigravid women chosen? 6. The authors should avoid multiple statistical testing which makes the conclusions invalid.
