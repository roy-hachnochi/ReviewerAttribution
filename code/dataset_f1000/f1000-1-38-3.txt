 Although I approve this paper, I have a few comments: - The authors stated that “we performed a quantitative immunohistochemistry” however, it seems that they have done a qualitative assessment as quantitative immunohistochemistry is done by image analysis program which is reproducible, avoids interpersonal variations and potential bias. Furthermore, it provides quantitative data. If the authors wished to conduct quantitative immunohistochemistry then they would have to revise the statistical tests used. - It seems that all authors evaluating the immunohistochemistry results were aware of the study design. This may be a potential source of bias. - The authors used specimens of psoriasis as a positive control. Psoriasis is an inflammatory but not infective dermatosis which raises an argument against the impact of the expression of AMPs in KS.
