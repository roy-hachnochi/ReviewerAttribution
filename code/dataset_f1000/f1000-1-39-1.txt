 This article points out an unusual clinical presentation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that illustrates the heterogeneity of presentations of extramedullary disease. While the diagnosis was clear at the onset, the patient had 64% circulating blasts and the pleural effusion was unusual and required evaluation. As monocyte subtypes of AML have a propensity for tissue invasion and the core binding factor (CBF) leukemia can be associated with granule cystic sarcomas, a bit more information on the immunophenotype of the AML would have been helpful in assessing this case. Also, given the many molecular markers that define the prognosis of AML patients, more details on any molecular studies that were done, or could have been done, would be helpful.
