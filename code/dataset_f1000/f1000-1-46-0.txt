 The authors only identified 57 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) over 21 years. This must represent only a fraction of the total number for such a large metropolitan area over such a long period of time. I suspect that many patients have gone undiagnosed and this leads me to question the general applicability of some of the authors’ findings. Furthermore, the authors do not include their case definition of CVID. There are many immunodeficiencies associated with hypogammaglobulinemia that would not be classified as CVID. The authors state that they studied quality of life in these patients, but they do not report any of that data here. The humoral and cellular immunologic data should be presented in a table with mean, standard deviation, median and range together with the authors’ normal ranges. The authors speak very generally about a variety of therapeutic measures applied in addition to IgG but doesn’t provide any quantitative (or often even qualitative) report of the response (or not) to these therapies. The mortality in these patents seems high. How does it compare with published assessment of mortality in CVID? Finally, the authors do not provide any evidence to support their conclusion that “The developed approach and education of GPs has improved the diagnostics of predominantly antibody deficiencies in adults in Moscow”.
