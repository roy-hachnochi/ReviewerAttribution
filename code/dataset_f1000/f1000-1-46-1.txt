 The manuscript describes a Russian experience with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) patients. Although it is a descriptive report, there is restricted data published about Russian groups presenting primary immunodeficiency (PID) and this is a report from a State University. It helps provide an indication and raises awareness for the physicians with regards to PID diagnosis considering that 51 CVID cases were collected in 21 years of observation. No molecular studies were performed.
