 This well documented commentary goes hand in hand with the very recently published Science article (much shorter by necessity). Both pieces are raising a RED alert on the significant and PRESENT danger of the whole NIH system, which has been significantly degraded during the last decade, now literally going off the cliff. Clearly, a major reorganization is in order, and this will happen by necessity, with or without the input of working scientists. To make an analogy to current affairs, the federally funded scientific enterprise in the USA is functionally bankrupt, and the only choice remaining is between an orderly reorganization, or, a disorderly collapse. Letâ€™s hope for the former.
