The title is misleading because iron levels are not measured in this study. The summary does reflect the content of the article. However, there are serious concerns about the validity of even the limited findings related to cognition and iron status in Indian dental students. First of all, dental students as a population reflect a group of academic attainers, who have distinguished themselves sufficiently to be admitted to dental school. This is a skewed and privileged cohort to begin with, who are likely to have come from economically stable families and are less likely to have suffered from significant malnutrition earlier in life. Second, early nutritional insults affecting cognitive development can be overcome with nutritional and educational interventions, and this cohort is likely to have benefitted from these inputs. Third, the hemogloblin levels as reported (means without standard deviations) are mostly in the low normal range, with the lowest reported hemoglobin (8 Gm/DL) in 5 females who would be labelled moderately anemic. The lowest hemoglobin a male was 9.7 Gm/DL, and would not likely be symptomatic except with considerable physical stress. Fifth, the authors themselves do not have confidence in the accuracy of the methodology to assess hemogloblin. Sixth, iron levels are not in fact measured, just hemoglobin. While iron deficiency in menstruating females can explain the lower hemogloblin levels compared to males, there are many other causes of mild-moderate anemia which have not been assessed. Finally, the testing of cognitive function was by questionnaire rather than more rigorous assessment tools. It is for these reasons that I judge the work to be irrelevant to any evaluation of the relationship between iron levels and cognitive function in Indian dental students.
