 My reservations are as follow s : 1. Since children are not routinely supplemented with vitamin D, the lack of vitamin D supplementation in burn victims is not in itself an explanation for their low vitamin D levels. 2. The assertion that elevated endogenous glucocorticoids contribute to bone loss in this context, through inhibition of osteoblast survival and generation, is somewhat over-stated. Although adverse effects of glucocorticoids on osteoblast function are well described, the literature mainly applies to pharmacological doses of glucocorticoid. The evidence cited here, concerning possible adverse effects of endogenous glucocorticoids, relates to a small observational study which provides weak circumstantial evidence at best.
