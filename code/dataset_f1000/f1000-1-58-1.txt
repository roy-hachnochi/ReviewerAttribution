The current manuscript identifies new replication origins near telomeres in fission yeast. The information provided will serve as a useful starting point for future investigations. The most interesting finding is the identification of potential cis-acting sequences within subtelomeres that can cause telomeric ARS to be late replicating. As suggested by the authors, it would be very interesting to determine if those cis-acting regulatory sequences might collaborate with Rif1 to enforce late S-phase replication of telomeres in the future. Overall, the manuscript is clearly written and conclusions are supported by experiments shown. On the other hand, 2D gel data, especially Figures 6 7, are somewhat hard to understand since the signal for replication intermediates is weak and there appears to be non-specific background signals from hybridization on those gels as well. It may be helpful to provide cartoons of 2D gel hybridization signals to clearly indicate what part of the gel corresponds to replication intermediate signals.
