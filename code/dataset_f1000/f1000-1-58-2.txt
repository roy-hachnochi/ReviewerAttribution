This manuscript provides useful information regarding the mechanisms of how telomere-proximal origins are suppressed for initiation in early S phase. The authors identified two origins near the telomere and found that they are suppressed by cis-acting elements present in adjacent segments (closer to the telomere). These latter sequences enforce late replication or suppression of replication even on the circular plasmid bearing the ARS fragment containing the above two putative origins. The late replication depend on the Cds1 function, suggesting that checkpoint suppresses the replication of from these origins through the putative cis-acting “late replication regulatory sequences”. The data provided are not complete to dissect the sequences and cellular functions required for late replication of subtelomere segments, but provide useful data that can be explored for further studies. Some of the 2D data are not so clear (Figures 6 and 7) and could be redone under modified conditions that would give better separation of RIs. The analyses of ∆A, ∆B, ∆C and ∆D are a bit confusing. Although it is stated that ∆A had least effect and still is replicated late (Figure 6), ∆A is comparable to ∆B and ∆D and better than ∆C in ARS assays in Figure 5. A potential role of rif1 in the late replication is suggested in Discussion, and it is certainly of interest to see the replication timing of THF in rif1∆ cells. Figure 5 title; “leftmost 2/3″ should be “rightmost 2/3″.
