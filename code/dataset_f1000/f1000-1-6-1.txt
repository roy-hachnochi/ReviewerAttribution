 This is an interesting article with some quaint comments indicative of local community attitudes to bizarre abnormalities, which increase the appeal of the article. The author(s) should consider being more specific about the actual incidence of the abnormality itself and the actual incidence associated with twins and diabetes. The author(s) should also review the level of detail under the ‘Ethiopathogenesis’ and ‘Classification’ subheadings, as I believe that these sections should be shortened/abbreviated if it is to fulfill the criteria of a ‘Case Report’ presentation.
