 This is an interesting article. However there are a few things that need addressing: 1. There should be no judgmental statements. 2. The author(s) should not confuse between gene and chromosomes. 3. There should be more emphasis on scientific data and information. 4. If the author(s) do need to address historical data, then it should be in full. It is too bad there isnâ€™t any pre- or post-birth imaging, however the photographs presented are interesting. There also seems to be a repetition of some facts, which need to be curtailed.
