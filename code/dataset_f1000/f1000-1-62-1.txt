I don't see this study has much relevance to the field as it adds nothing to the literature in this area and is not great science e.g. the homology model is not based on a structure but just a model. The authors should have also included a c subunit analysis to check for the presence/absence of Na+-binding motifs. Overall the work is not of a standard in which others in the field can benefit.
