 I give this article an ‘approved with reservations’. The reason for this is that I found that it lacks a few fundamental aspects: What was the response after 3 cycles of capecitabine? Please remember (and eventually cite) some reports of skin toxicity as predictor of response. It would be interesting to provide a description of the inflammatory characteristics of the punch-biopsy (even with iconografic report, if available). What was the presentation of the skin toxicity? Sudden or progressive? Were some topical medications used before the appearance of Figure 1 aspects? “Palliative” is all the setting of the present clinical case and not only when the authors decided to withdrawn capecitabine. What is the reason for the choice of tamoxifen instead of another chemotherapy,i.e. vinorelbine? Radiocrem (R): please provide the active components and avoid the commercial brand. What was the duration of stable disease (“the disease is now stable”). Palmar-plantar erythrodisesthesia is not so rare with capecitabine (my group and I have reported a 8% of G3/G4 skin toxicity with capecitabine). Moreover, according to guidelines of side effects management, do the authors believe that a rechallenge with capecitabine after dose reduction could be performed?
