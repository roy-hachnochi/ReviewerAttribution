 This is a commendable work on evaluating the student feedback for role plays to identify and interpret the learning objectives for empathy, what it means to be sick in Nepal, the doctor, the patient and the doctor-patient relationship. The authors make a strong case towards the use of role plays for educating future doctors and rightly recommend that they should be more widely used in medical schools especially in South Asia and other developing countries.
