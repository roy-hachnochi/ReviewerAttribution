In the revised version of the article the authors have computed predicted values of pulmonary function indices for their study subjects and showed in Table II that this population has, on the whole, a poorer pulmonary function than predicted in both males and females (what statistical test was used to analyse this?). However, in order to make the study complete they should now compare the two groups of table III using the percent predicted values (observed/predicted x 100); the same princple should be applied to the analysis presented in Figure 1. I would be more than happy to provide more extensive advice to the authors if they wish: Skype - ben.nemery
