 The methodology of the field survey appears to have been adequate. However, the analysis is not adequate. The authors should not base their analysis on absolute levels of pulmonary function parameters. Indeed the differences observed between sweepers and loaders (table 2) and between age groups (figure 1) could simply be due to differences in sex (how many men and women were there in each group?), height (table 1 shows a 7 cm difference in mean height between sweepers and loaders!) or even age distribution. In other words, the authors should have analyzed their data taking into account these 3 factors, either by doing a multiple correlation analysis or by taking values in percent predicted (which they probably did, but they donâ€™t present the data).
