 This is a case report (two cases) reporting the application of an autologous blood product (PRP) in Glenoid Labral Tear. The recent evidence suggests that PRP, despite the great hype, is of no benefit in the management of musculoskeletal conditions. I have no doubts that these two patients have done well, but, without a control group, this manuscript only perpetuates a myth. In this respect, the authors have chosen to ignore the meta-analysis published in by Sheth et al. 2012 , and to jump on the bandwagon. In this respect, therefore, what they report is at best dubious science.
