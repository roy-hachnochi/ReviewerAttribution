 Overall, this is a well-executed study that fits the publication objectives of F1000Research . The authors report in vivo single unit recordings from cortical prelimbic pyramidal neurons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 or halorhodopsin. Although the basic premise of this article is not entirely novel and the authors refrain from arriving at any firm biological conclusions, the results raise some interesting issues. For instance, in Figure 1 and 2 channelrhodopsin-2 induced firing shows a rapid decrease in frequency (Figure 1b and 2c) which can elicit significant plasticity of the neurotransmitter release output of these neurons. Along the same lines in Figure 3, after 10 sec of green light exposure the firing frequency recovery shows significant rebound facilitation, which again could significantly impact neurotransmitter release output of these neurons. Therefore, in order to be able interpret the behavioral correlates of these activity patterns accurately, one would need to know the synaptic output properties of these neurons during and after optogenetic stimulation/silencing.
