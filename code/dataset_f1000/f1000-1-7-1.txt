 This is a useful confirmation of the optogentic control of neural activity in the rat prefrontal cortex. The basic effectiveness and characterization of channel rhodopsin and halorhodopsin have been reported multiple times, so this study mainly extends the same findings to a new area of cortex in the anesthetized rat. The study design is straightforward, the results are well described, and the findings mainly solid. So, if novelty is a low priority and the hottest new technologies (in this case optical control) are the highest priority, I recommend publication. The authors should provide a more comprehensive report of previous findings in other preparations and compare results, particularly with regard to the rebound effects. Also, shouldnâ€™t they run a light only (no virus) control to show that light itself does not drive or inhibit neuronal activity? The distinction between phasic and not is fuzzy. What exactly is phasic about the phasic cells? They should provide a quantitative characterization. The low baseline and evoked response rates are concerning. Is this the anesthesia?
