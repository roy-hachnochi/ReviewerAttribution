 This commentary summarises recent findings which point to a previously under-appreciated role of B-cells acting as innate effector cells in immunity. The authors build on the notion for a continuum of activity between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, integrated at the cellular level via B-cells. Accordingly, this commentary convincingly argues for reconsideration of the conventional view of the role played by innate and adaptive cells of the immune system.
