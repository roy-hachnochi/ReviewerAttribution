The manuscript is a general review of nano-technology as applied to THz system for medical imaging. The review could have gone deeper than just a brief summary of other works, which is useful but not sufficient. The manuscript would be much more useful and informative if the authors would include a brief and simple explanation of some important THz imaging modalities by including a general block diagram of the system. The analytical content of the manuscript could be improved substantially by including a more rigorous description of various techniques and their assessment. The entire article only has 2 or 3 very general pictures which do not describe any specific technology or approach at any depth. More pictures, plots, and tables should be added to support authorsâ€™ arguments. The conclusions are very general and only based on summary of the other articles. No analytical method and independent data and/or results generated by the authors have been provided.
