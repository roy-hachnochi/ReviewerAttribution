This paper provides an important, big-picture, integration of the fundamental role of energy efficiency in the metabolism of organisms and of human societies - a role that provides guidance towards achieving balance and stability in complex systems, be they human bodies or energy-dependent economies. Energy flow and conservation is the currency of the world's processes of neg-entropy at all scales - the counter to the universal intrinsic tendency of all ordered systems to degrade and become disordered, as energy degrades to heat. The authors have been thorough in their review and consideration of the relevant published literature from different fields of inquiry, and offer a unifying perspective on the achievement of stability, balance and sustainability.
