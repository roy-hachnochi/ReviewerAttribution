This paper, an opinion article, points out a parallelism between systems (human body, environment and industry, earth) using energy consumption as a criteria for comparison. The paper does not introduce significant new knowledge on each of these systems and their relations with energy consumption, but expresses a global frame to rethink the use of energy. It may concern the goal of optimization in contrast with maximization or minimization, quality with respect to quantity. The consequence of these considerations are in wiser design of processes: prevention for health, efficiency for devices, integration for more complex systems as factories, buildings, crops, transportation. The considerations stated by authors address some political issues that require deeper analyses, certainly not possible in this short paper. Among these: is it possible to face the healthy aging and environment/industry sustainability jointly by public and private? Is it convenient to prevent diseases rather then treat them? Will it be possible, useful and profitable to continue to waste energy in the future as we have done in the past? It could be trivial to discuss all those questions and many others, each is well known. The parallelism introduced by this paper allows a greater vision on the problem of the quality of life in a better world not only for us in the remaining years of life, but for the future generations. The opinion of the authors is an interesting multidisciplinary viewpoint that can open a discussion on the role of science in suggesting integrated solutions for those open questions.
