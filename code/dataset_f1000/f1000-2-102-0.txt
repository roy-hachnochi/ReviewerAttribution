To the Editor, First, note that it is extremely difficult to write detailed comments as lines are not numbered. Please modify the text to facilitate reviewers’ work. This is a nice review of the role of analgesia on postoperative outcome after cancer surgery. As stated by the authors, we still need confirmatory data and the present status of our knowledge only suggests a speculative effect, even if most studies concur to suggest a beneficial effect of a well-performed postoperative analgesia. It would also be important to note that all additional factors of a well-performed anesthesia (i.e. avoidance of hypotension or of hypothermia, treatment of anemia, prevention of hyperglycemia…) may also be factors that could improve postoperative outcome after cancer surgery. That said, the reviewer has several minor comments to add: Page 2, 2nd column, L12 of 1st paragraph: is instead of are (the subject of the sentence is “The production of…”) Page 2, 2nd column, L2 of 3rd paragraph: hypothalamic-hypopituitary complex/system/unit/axis… (choose one word) Page 3, 1st column, L9 of 2nd paragraph: add “reduced”? (…with invasive procedures due to the reduced need…) Page 3, 1st column, L1 of 5th paragraph: in this sentence and all along the text, use “regional” instead of “locoregional” Page 3, 1st column, L10 and following lines of 5th paragraph: paragraph unclear: reorganize sentences to present first the beneficial effects of opioids (reduced pain) and then their harmful effects to facilitate reading Page 3, 2nd column, L3 of 3rd paragraph: what do the authors mean by “protection of anticancer immunity”? Page 4, 1st column, L10 of 2nd paragraph: it appears somewhat surprising that alpha-2 agonists are promoted with some apparent strength given the fact that our knowledge on these drugs in this context are not better that for other agents. Please modify the sentence to attenuate the strength of this recommendation.
