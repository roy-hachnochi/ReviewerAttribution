This is an interesting research topic. It describes that cancer surgery induces inflammation, immunosuppression, and angiogenesis. Also these phenomena can be influenced by analgesics. As we know, Galen (Aelius Galenus) removed some tumours surgically, but he generally believed that cancer was best left untreated. The underlying mechanisms were not clear then. The research community can benefit from this well-written paper as this paper has updated the information for this topic. This paper can be improved if the mechanisms would have been discussed in depth. After cancer surgery, HIF-1alpha and MMPs may also be up-regulated. This paper has not mentioned them. Thus, it would be helpful if authors search and study more literature. I have simply searched some literature, I think the following papers should be cited: Tavare AN et al .
