The method presented in this paper depends on the assumption that reconstructing somatic rearrangement events occurring in the ancestors of B cell clones can be improved by using phylogenetic methods to infer the unmutated ancestor (UA) of mature antibodies. The methods used to reconstruct the UA are standard phylogenetic methods, but the statistical approach taken ignores biological complexities. First, the process of affinity maturation of antibodies is a selective process, not just the accumulation of mutations. Certain mutations, which increase affinity, are selectively favoured, while those that decrease affinity are eliminated. Thus, the author’s assumption of the independence of nucleotide positions in the sequence seems unjustified, as does the use of the simple Jukes-Cantor model. In addition, phylogenetic reconstruction in this case (involving short sequences subject to positive selection, resulting in terminal branches that are very long in comparison to internal branches) is likely to be unreliable. The author cites one study suggesting that ancestral sequence reconstruction may not be highly sensitive to tree topology, but the sequences used in that study may not be directly comparable to the present case. It would have been nice to see some quantitative evidence regarding the influence of tree topology on UA reconstruction with these data. Furthermore, if tree topology doesn’t matter for the results, why go through the whole elaborate process of phylogenetic tree reconstruction? In spite of these reservations, the author is to be congratulated for drawing attention to the potential value of using the information in clonally related sequences for inference of ancestral rearrangement.
