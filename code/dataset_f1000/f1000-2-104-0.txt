In this report, Varela et al . used electrophysiology to determine that exposure to uncontrollable stress, which leads to behavioral deficits relating to depression and anxiety, increased the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons of the prelimbic area of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Exposure to controllable stress, which does not produce the behavioral deficits described above, produced a more modest increase in sIPSC frequency. These data provide a clear and logical extension of previously published data from this group indicating that controllable stress increases the excitability of mPFC pyramidal neurons. Thus, the authors may further discuss the relationship between both data sets. Do the results presented here confirm the authorsâ€™ views that controllable stress has an overall excitatory effect on mPFC pyramidal neurons relative to uncontrollable stress? Along these lines, can the authors speculate as to whether control over stress directly excites mPFC pyramidal neurons, or rather prevents the enhanced inhibition of these neurons during stress exposure per se, or both? Since the standard yoked stress procedure was not used in this study, in addition to verifying that the physical properties of the controllable and uncontrollable stressors were similar as mentioned by another reviewer, discussion of previous studies from this group confirming the behavioral effectiveness of the stress procedure reported here would strengthen the interpretation of the electrophysiology data. Also, please verify the correct sample sizes as they are reported differently in the Methods and Results sections.
