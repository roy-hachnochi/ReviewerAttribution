This is an interesting preliminary report from Varela et al ., investigating spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex of rats exposed to inescapable shock, escapable shock, or no shock. Their data suggest that inescapable shock increases the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory currents, and that this effect is attenuated when shock is escapable. The methodology of the report was sound, and the data are important. Due to the preliminary nature of this report, both the rationale and the summary/discussion were extremely short; however, they seemed too short. The relevance of these data to the current ideas regarding the role of the vmPFC in mediating the effects of IS/ES could be discussed at greater length, as these data seem to suggest that inescapable shock actually enhances inhibition on the vmPFC. Beyond this, I only recommend the following clarifications: The first paragraph seems to suggest that depression and drug dependence are anxiety disorders, and that shuttle box escape time is a test of anxiety. This should be clarified. The authors should justify why neurons were recorded from layer 5/6. Given the vagaries of electrophysiology, it is understandable that the typical escape/yoke paradigm wasn't used for this study; however, an analysis showing that the average amount of shock received between the two shocked groups did not differ would strengthen these data considerably. The strategy of increasing shock intensity to maintain escape behavior does not seem standard. This is not necessarily a problem, but the authors should explicitly state that inescapably shocked rats received the same treatment. Do the authors think that the increased vmPFC inhibition is related to serotonin release from the dorsal raphe nucleus? Again, some discussion seems warranted.
