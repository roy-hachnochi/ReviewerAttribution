The logic of this paper is reasonable â€“ if rifampicin enhances biofilm formation in C. albicans , then treating medical implants with rifampicin could have unexpected negative consequences. The experiments themselves are straightforward and in general support the idea that rifampicin influences surface hydrophobicity in C. albicans , and ultimately has a moderate effect on biofilm formation assayed through essentially XTT detected activity on a plastic surface. Considerably more sophisticated assays of biofilms are possible, and a number of genes have been identified that are critical for standard biofilm formation. To really probe the impact of the drug on Candida biofilms, the authors could assess the impact of mutants on the process under study, do ultrastructural assessment of the biofilms, and do analysis of the effect of rifampicin on a variety of biofilm models. Thus, the impact of the paper would be considerably enhanced if the sophistication of the biofilm assay was greater.
