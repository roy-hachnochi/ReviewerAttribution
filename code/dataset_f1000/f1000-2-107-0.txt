The findings of this commentary are based on the estimations and calculations made by the authors of the work. The commentary itself is interesting, and helps provoke the idea that there is a higher prevalence of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in the US. However, the authors quite rightly demonstrate the potential weaknesses in the epidemiology of the disease; it is still difficult to collect data on the epidemiology of skin cancer even in Western countries. The authors do encourage prospective registries to help estimate NMSC, however as discussed, sun exposure and other factors have to be considered too in order to provide a more definitive answer for the prevalence of NMSC in the US.
