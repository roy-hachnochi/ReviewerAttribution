In this publication, Cheng and Kane mapped the gene expression profile of a Th2 cell line stimulated with cross-linked CD3/CD28 Abs in the presence of Akti1/2 inhibitor using microarray and qRT-PCR analysis. They found gene expression that is not moderately or strongly affected by Akti1/2. Akt-dependent genes included cytokines (like IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13), chemokines (CCL1, CCL3 and CCL4), and a number of genes involved in the biosynthesis and function of ribosomes. Major Akt-dependent transcription factors included members of the NFkappaB family, c-myc and their target genes. The study provides interesting and novel information on Akt-dependent signalling and Akt target genes which will be very useful for the further understanding of Akt function in T cells. In this line, previous publication by Patra et al . on myrAkt expression in activated CD4+ T cells had shown increased expression of Th1 as well as Th2 cytokines, including IL-10, IL-4, IL-13 ( Patra et al ., JI, 2004 ). Thus, the data of the current study support those previous results. The authors should include this publication in their citation list as well as other publication from the groups of P. Ohashi, C. Thompson and others with regard to Akt, NFkappaB and tumorigenesis.
