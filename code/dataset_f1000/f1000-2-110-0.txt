This article addresses if loss of TRPC4 affects self administration of sucrose and cocaine. The title is appropriate and the abstract is a suitable summary of the article. The article is clearly written, the experiments are properly conducted and the methods are sufficiently described. The data file provided is clearly laid out, and most of the relevant data is included. It would be useful for the authors to also include lever press data for the sucrose self administration task, in case there is a strain difference in responding on the active lever during the 20s timeout periods between trials. Statistical analysis of both lever press data as well as # cocaine infusions across sessions will determine if the authors claim that acquisition of cocaine self administration is reduced in TRPC4 KO rats is statistically significant.
