The purpose of this study was to determine whether cocaine self-administration of rats was altered by trpc4 knockout (KO). The title is appropriate and the Abstract is a suitable summary for this article. The article is well-constructed and clear. Outcomes from this study were important, suggesting a potential role of TRPC4 channels in neurons that mediate cocaine self-administration in the related structures of the rat brain. The study was well-designed and sensible data are obtained using a cutting-edge technology. Providing the methods and statistical results will further strengthen this article.
