The study was based on data from 100 individuals (50 left-handed [31 females, 19 males] and 50 right-handed [27 males, 23 females]). The greatest limitation of this study is the small sample size, as authors indicate; this size would be even smaller if the sample was analyzed by sex, as should have been done. The distribution of digital patterns presents sex differences in most of the samples analyzed, and so, the results cannot be accepted because they are affected by the effect of sex differences.
