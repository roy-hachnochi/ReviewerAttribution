The Authors discuss hypertensive arteriosclerosis and hypothesize on extrinsic compressive forces from the expanding aneurysm as contributing to the acute ischemic changes noted in the brainstem. It would be interesting to learn more of the clinical course with improvement in blood pressure control and particularly if there were any significant reductions in aneurismal size on subsequent imaging.
