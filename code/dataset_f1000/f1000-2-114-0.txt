In this pilot study, the authors compared 3 potential biomarkers between arterial and venous blood samples among normal and COPD patients. Although the methods as well as statistical analyses are sound, there exist some limitations, as discussed by the authors; such as, small number of samples, unclarified differences between pulmonary arterial and venous blood, and limited number of biomarkers. I believe this study becomes a milestone for the future larger-scaled study for these important topics.
