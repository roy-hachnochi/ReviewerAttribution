A web interface is presented to a protein structure based small molecule binding site prediction algorithm that was published before.The algorithm is based on matching binding sites alone with graph matching tools using an annotated set of 7339 structures. The actual method was published before and tested in various conditions. Here, a nicely designed interface is provided that works well. I would like to see more options on the JMOL interface, options to switch between different molecular presentations, as the wire presentation is hard to follow in more complicated instances. My major reservation is that certain parts, sentences and sometimes almost full paragraphs are identical to those in the authorsâ€™ earlier published paper in Bioinformatics that describes the method. Although the authors do mention that they are reiterating the description of the Isocleft program, these sections should be rewritten. It might be better if the current paper focused on the web interface and functionalities and did not try to repeat all the methodological details.
