The IsoCleft Finder web server described in this article can detect and align ligand binding sites in protein structures sharing similar chemical and geometrical properties to the query, even if they do not share homology that is detectable by sequence similarity. The server also provides p-values, which are useful for assessing the confidence of each prediction. The authors discuss a timely application of their method, predicting cognate ligands for the many functionally uncharacterized proteins with experimental structures solved by structural genomics projects. Based on some examples that I ran, the web server returns the results quickly (less than 1 minute). Overall, this paper clearly describes the IsoCleft method and web interface, which should be a useful tool for structural biologists. A few minor corrections/comments: The ICFDB data set contains some small non-biological ligands, like SO 4 and glycerol, which may bind in ligand binding pockets but not share chemical similarity with the cognate ligand. There should be a brief discussion of why these were included. The web server results page currently shows an all-atom wire representation of the entire protein, which makes it difficult to find one’s way around the molecule. I would recommend using a simpler cartoon representation of the protein while keeping the wire representation of site residues There is a typo “obtainer” on page 7.
