This is an interesting, innovative and well conducted study about the use of microinvasive (“quasi” on invasive) tissue sampling for confocal-molecular correlation performed with the new method of the sub-millimeter punch. Title and abstract are appropriate. Conclusions are justified on the basis of results of the study. In conclusion, the study really increases the chances of routine applications of micro-punches for tissue sampling for targeting molecular analysis in skin diseases.
