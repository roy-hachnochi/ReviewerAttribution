Scientific study of the ecologically interesting karst forests of southwestern China has been limited, particularly in the English-language literature, making this study potentially valuable. The comparison of in situ with common environment performance was excellent. However, major design flaws make it impossible to reach scientifically valid conclusions from this study. Most importantly, the study compares one degraded forest with one more-intact forest in order to reach conclusions about the ecophysiology of trees in degraded karst forests in comparison to intact forests. This is not possible with one forest of each type; the fallacy in this kind of comparison has been highlighted in the ecological literature for decades (sometimes called “pseudoreplication”). One cannot reach any valid conclusions from comparing trees in a single forest of one type with those of a single forest of a different type. The anova also fails to account for the nested design structure, a very common problem in the ecological literature.
