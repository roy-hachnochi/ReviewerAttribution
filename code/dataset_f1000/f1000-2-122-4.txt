The title is appropriate for the content of the article. The authors used two contrasting habitats (degraded versus well developed) and leaf phenology (deciduous versus evergreen) across many major tree species to address the ecophysiological adaptation of different tree species to habitat change. The research was well designed and relatively long-term (three year measurements) for ecophysiological study. The information presented in the study will provide significant insight to our understanding of tree species adaptation to climate change and habitat degradation. The conclusions from the study will provide useful guidance for biodiversity management and restoration of degraded sites.
