The manuscript is an excellent review of the topic and is well illustrated with a clinical photo, radiology, and histopathology. My only area of concern is that I wonder whether it was indeed necessary to perform a tracheotomy on this patient. If the glottis was visible transorally, and given the findings on the sagittal radiologic image shown, it looks like the patient could have been intubated. Also the lesion is too superior to cause true stridor. It could be argued that tracheotomy was advised because the patient would have had difficulty managing secretions and there was concern the lesion would swell or bleed upon biopsy, but it is difficult to imagine true stridor and that this patient couldnâ€™t have been intubated. The report would be improved if the authors justify their decision to perform the tracheotomy in the light of these comments Title and Abstract are appropriate and the conclusions are otherwise balanced and justified.
