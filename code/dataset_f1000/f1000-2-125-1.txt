This is an interesting and well-conducted study on the development and validation of a novel, symmetrically-reinforced Go/No-Go task in rats. The novelty of this procedure presumably rests with head fixing the animals to limit the impact of extraneous behaviour, and the configuration of the task itself, which enables several component cognitive and behavioural processes to be independently assessed. One could imagine using such a task in a variety of settings to assess attention (e.g. based on Posnerâ€™s task), inhibitory response control, and working memory. However, this is not a radically new approach; for example, head restraint is often used to avoid the use of a general anaesthetic agent in MR and PET imaging and head restraint has been used for decades to facilitate neurophysiological experiments in non-human primates. Furthermore, restraint itself is a potent activator of the stress response which may have unintended consequences for brain-behaviour relationships. It would have been interesting to compare blood corticosterone in head-fixed and non-head-fixed animals. The reported behavioural findings suggest that sucrose was sufficient as a reinforcer but crucially, how stable was performance both within and between sessions? Overall, the article is clear and concise with methods that are fully transparent. Although the Title and Abstract reflect the content of the article it would be helpful to explain the novel aspects of the present protocol.
