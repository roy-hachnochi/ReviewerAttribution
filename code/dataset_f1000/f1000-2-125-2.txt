This interesting paper describes the details of a go/no-go task designed for head-restrained rats. A detailed description about the training procedure is obviously beneficial for the biological community since the use of behaving rats is emerging in optogenetics and electrophysiology studies. I would like to ask the authors to consider the following points for the improvement of the paper. (All are “minor” comments.) 1. Go/no-go tasks have long been commonly used in behavioral psychology, and its application to behavioral electrophysiology with head-restrained monkeys is as early as in 1980s. The authors could briefly mention the history of go/no-go task in the 'Introduction' section. 2. I am not entirely sure which part of the described go/no-go task is “novel”. Please point it out clearly in the manuscript which part of this protocol is different from the conventional go/no-go task procedure. 3. How stable is the performance of a typical subject that has reached the criteria of training? It would be helpful to show the weekly or monthly performance of a representative subject after the completion of training.
