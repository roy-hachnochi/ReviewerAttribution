This a well designed study of a potentially significant and novel natriuretic factor in the urine of patients with elevated fractional urate excretion with renal salt wasting. This factor appears to have properties that distinguish it from ANP and BNP and may be entirely unique. Minor criticisms: Methodological descriptions seem to run into the results and discussion which maybe more appropriate in the methods section. For example the first paragraph under the “Transcellular Transport of 22 Na” in the results section describes the calibration of system might be more appropriate under methods. If any objective blood volume data available it would support the differentiation of the RSW and SIADH patients. The use Uosm instead of meq/L or mmole/ L for Na and K is not the usual convention.
