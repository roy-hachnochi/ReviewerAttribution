Having stated that the work makes a very sound impression to me and reflects state of the art methodology, I still have concerns about the implied meaning. The authors carefully avoid making any statement with regard to growth or productivity implications. However, why would one make such measurements if not for the implied meaning for growth and overall performance? From all what we know to date, such a link has not been shown outside horticultural conditions. It will be most unlikely that a birch seedling in the wild is carbon limited. Whatever the photosynthetic performance, such a seedling would only incorporate structural carbon to the extent nutrients permit, and these are finite per unit land area (except for N) and are competitively foraged for.
