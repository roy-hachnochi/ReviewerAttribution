I appreciate the improvements to the article done during the revision. Both the abstract and the main text now describe better where the article is going and explain the purpose of the new metric. Several minor concerns have been overcome and questionable points have been clarified. However, my main reservations largely persist. This includes: I question whether Q' R is generally useful for choosing which community partition to use. For choosing the best partition for a particular purpose, I think it would be most efficient to use the metric of choice during the optimisation and not a posteriori . In my view, a simple a posteriori metric is mostly useful for presenting and describing modularity. For this purpose, I would prefer Q R over Q' R because it makes even less assumptions. Fig. 4 still suggests to me that most of the empirical networks used here are not more modular than expected by chance (more negative than positive deltaQ values) and I am thus still uncertain how suitable the dataset is for exploring modularity. Less fundamentally, in the comparison of the different algorithms from the igraph package I am still missing the percentage of Q' R that were below 0 for the walktrap and edge-betweenness method, in order to compare it to the 8% for the spinglass method (currently it only says "several"). In conclusion, I think the metric Q R presented here can be helpful, but should be applied with caution.
