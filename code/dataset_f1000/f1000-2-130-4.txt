The aim of the author is interesting and relevant. I am intrigued by the development of a method to quickly evaluate different modularity measures, and an a posteriori method might well be a good solution. Overall the manuscript is generally well written. However, it is not clear to me how much is gained with this approach. Poisot only uses one method to detect the module configuration ( Louvain 2008 ) and one method to calculate the modularity ( Newman Girvan 2004 ). It would be interesting to explore if the Q R differs markedly when applied to the results of different methods. It would also be good to see what existing modularity measures do when optimizing modularity; do they minimize between module links? This is why Q R measures and the strong correlation in Figure 2 is not surprising. What is more interesting about Figure 2 is that it shows that below a certain value of Q (~ 0,2 ?) it is not sensible to talk about modularity even if the empirical data is more modular than a random system. In such cases, the presented method seems useful to evaluate results. Other minor revisions An earlier reference could be used for the use of modularity in biogeographic networks instead of Cummings et al. 2010 (reference 6). Cummings et al. does not handle modularity. THe author should onsider citing Carstensen Olesen 2009 . In the 'Data and analysis' section the statement starting on line six in this paragraph needs a reference.
