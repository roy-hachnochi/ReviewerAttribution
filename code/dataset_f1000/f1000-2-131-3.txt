The reproducibility of retinal thickness measurements with different OCT devices in eyes with age-related macular degeneration before and after error correction is presented. This is a topic of high interest and actuality. The title and Abstract are appropriate. "To date, no other study has examined the effects of manual correction of the thickness algorithm in SD-OCT and TD-OCT machines in eyes with AMD." "At this point, we are not aware of any previous study looking at the repeatability of Spectralisâ„¢ images in AMD." This is not really true, and I want to refer to publications dealing with this topic ( Krebs et al. 2012 ; Krebs et al., 2011 ; Krebs et al. , 2009 ). The results of these studies should be discussed, as some of the results are confirmed by the results of the current study. Most of the studies focus only on the central 1000m area, whereas in this study also more peripheral areas were examined. This should be discussed a little bit more because this might be interesting: were the failures only in the central part, or also in the periphery (the pathology of neovascular AMD is located centrally therefore pathology related failures should occur only in the central area.) It is mentioned in the discussion section, but it should also added to the methods: how many observers assessed the segmentation errors, and performed the error correction? The lack of significant differences before and after correction might be due to the small number of examinations requiring correction. The sample size seems to be quite low, was there any calculation when planning this study? A possible bias of including both eyes in a part of patients should be mentioned.
