This report describes the identification of FAM129B as a novel regulator of Wnt/Î²-catenin signalling and apoptosis in melanoma cells. The FAM129B gene was identified via integration of 3 datasets, including Wnt signaling modifiers, melanoma-associated genes and the MEK/ERK phosphoproteome. FAM129B was the only gene that overlapped with all three datasets, making it a promising candidate for regulation of both Wnt and MEK/ERK pathways in melanoma. I find this an interesting report which will provide a good starting point for further studies. Overall, the data are convincing and support the conclusions drawn. Experiments which validate FAM129B as a Wnt pathway modifier (Fig. 1-3) appear solid and display robust effects. The effects of FAM129B on apoptosis (Fig. 4b), however, are somewhat lower than expected based on the effects of FAM129B knockdown in reporter assays and on the inhibition of caspase cleavage. I feel that the authors could provide a more in-depth discussion on their findings and place them in the context of the background information provided in the introduction part; How do the authors consider this candidate relevant for melanoma treatment? How do the authors integrate the beneficial effects of enhanced Wnt responsiveness (this report) and the previously described enhanced tumour cell invasion (ref 20) of FAM129B expressing melanoma cells? It would be helpful for the reader to include a model which shows how Wnt and ERK pathways modulate apoptosis in melanoma cells and where FAM129B would be placed in these events. Also in the legend of Fig. 2a it remains unclear whether endogenous levels of FAM129B are depicted.
