This review article by Hydbring and Badalian-Very summarizes our current knowledge of microRNAs and outlines their clinical value. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of microRNA biology and target prediction and discuss the utility of miRNAs as prognostic and diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Finally, Hydbring and Badalian-Very highlight the various strategies adopted by leading biotechnology companies and the state of their current clinical trials. I have two minor suggestions regarding the biology of miRNAs that the authors may wish to include in their manuscript: A recent paper by paper by Tollervey and colleagues ( Helwak et al ., Cell 2013 ) describes that a large fraction of miRNAs bind their targets independent of seed match complementarity at nucleotides 2-7. This observation greatly affects our ability to accurately predict miRNA targets using existing algorithms. Besides the 3’UTR, miRNAs have been demonstrated to target the 5’UTR and coding sequence of mRNAs as well as other RNA species such as lncRNAs, pseudogenes, rRNAs and tRNAs.
