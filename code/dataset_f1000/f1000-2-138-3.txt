The title is appropriate for the content of the article. In addition, the abstract represents a suitable summary of this interesting work. The authors were able to successfully isolate a novel Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant defective in chlorophyll biosynthesis. Using molecular biology techniques they have provided sufficient evidence that the novel mutant is missing a CHLI1 gene and having an intact CHLI2 gene. Their results also provided evidence that CHLI1 in C. reinhardtii is important in chlorophyll biosynthesis and that the presence of its homolog CHLI2 is not sufficient to make up for the function of CHLI1 in chlorophyll biosynthesis. The growth phenotype analysis of the rescued transformants has shown clearly the role of CHLI1 in chlorophyll biosynthesis. It would be interesting to know what percentage of rescued transformants was in their complementation analysis. Overall this is an interesting article. More importantly, this work reports the first chli1 mutant to be identified in C. reinhardtii, as well as in green algae. The chli1 mutant will open up new avenues to further explore the functional roles of CHLI1 and CHLI2 in chlorophyll biosynthesis in particular in C. reinhardtii . Suggested revisions: On page 6, sentence 2 “ 5A7 lacks detectable chlorophyll, appears yellowish-brown in color and grows only under heterotrophic conditions in the dark or in the dim light in the presence of acetate in the growth media (Figure 1).” *Figure 1 should be Figure 2. On page 6, sentence 3 “It is incapable of photosynthesis and is sensitive to light intensities higher than 20 μmol photons m-2s-1 (Figure 2),” ---*can be more clearly referred to as Figure 2A instead of Figure 2 only. On page 8, Figures 5A, 5B and 5C mentioned in text actually refers to Figures 6A, 6B and 6C.
