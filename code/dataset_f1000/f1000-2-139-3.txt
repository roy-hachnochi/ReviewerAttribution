This article primarily focuses on a very interesting computational problem, namely whether the variable-rate mutation operators in a genetic algorithm offers an advantage over the fixed-rate ones. The main idea is that variable-rate operators will help algorithms escape the local optima and identify the global optimum more efficiently. The authors indeed show that this is the case in at least some of the examples they investigated. I think this is a very promising article that will generate a lot of interest in this area. However, I am a bit unsure about the method’s relevance to biology. There are some biological examples that I can think of where their methodology can make an impact but I fail to see how it can be used for “diagnosis” and “therapy” as the title states. I wish they had provided some more examples towards that direction. Finally, I would like to bring up a point that is frequently overseen in computational studies. Although in many non-biological problems finding the optimal solution is the ultimate goal, many biological problems are better served by finding a set of optimal+ sub-optimal solutions. Examples include protein and RNA folding, and microRNA and transcription factor binding sites. Perhaps the authors would consider extending their methodology towards that direction in the future.
