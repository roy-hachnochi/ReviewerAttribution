 A well written article with interesting findings I would recommend the authors alter the statement that 'high particle production was associated with older age'- the multivariable analysis showed that it was in the group aged 40-49 that was statistically significant but not in the group aged 50+ In the multivariable analysis it specifies that it took account of the medical history- did this take account of the treatments patients had e.g. inhaled corticosteroids etc? The authors state that 'measurements repeated within a session were relatively stable with good agreement between particle counts (concordance coefficient rho ranging from 0.3 to 0.65, p0.01)'. Although I agree this is statistically significant there is still a lot of intrinsic variability and this would merit further discussion in the Discussion section.
