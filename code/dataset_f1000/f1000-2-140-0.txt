This is a clear study that attempts to investigate the role for environmental enrichment in the control of experimental tumour growth. Unlike the study of Cao et al. (2010) , the authors here find that environmental enrichment does not impact on the growth of one well-characterized experimental tumour model, B16F10. The manuscript is well written and the conclusions sound. The authors thoroughly describe the similarities and differences in the environmental enrichment strategies that are employed in this and the previous studies, and provide a variety of plausible possible causes for the different findings. Overall, this study provides a warning about the generality of any impacts of environmental enrichment on cancer cell growth that have been claimed and highlights a number of potential confounding factors. While the abstract is an appropriate summary of the study, the title is very broad and could perhaps be more restricted to encompass only the data in the manuscript, which is solely derived from one cancer cell line, B16F10 cells.
