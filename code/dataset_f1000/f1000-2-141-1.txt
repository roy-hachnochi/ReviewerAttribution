This is a considered hypothesis for cellular origins of the fibro-fatty myocardial scarring underlying the poorly understood clinical disease - Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy. The authors are a group with considerable experience investigating fibroadipogenic and skeletal muscle progenitor cells. The points below address the questions posed to reviewers: The title is perhaps too strongly worded. Whilst the hypothesis is sound and intriguing, there is currently little or no data proving that the title/hypothesis is true. This is appropriately discussed in the manuscript. The abstract does represent a suitable summary of the work. The article content provides a thorough review of data supporting the proposed hypothesis. If the hypothesis were proven true this would be a substantial advance for this field and for clinical cardiology The conclusions are sensible and justified.
