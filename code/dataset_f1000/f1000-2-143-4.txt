A well written paper that proposes a new method, FRAGAL for identifying functional putative motifs within protein sequences which have been hidden from previous analyses. By splitting the sequences into overlapping fragments, this method is able to discover additional motifs. The author has tested his technique on BRC repeats in Drosophila dm BRCA2 and HAT repeats in budding yeast Utp6, by comparing them to corresponding human protein sequences. The BRC repeat has been well analysed with comparisons across several Drosophila species. However the author does not provide extensive comparison of HAT repeats in Saccharomyces species. Since the sequences of several Saccharomyces sibling species and closely related fungi such as Aspergillus , Candida , etc. are known, it would be interesting to see how conserved this new HAT repeat is within the overall conservation of Utp6. While the author establishes the advantage of FRAGAL technique, it is too early to say that this is a useful generic tool to identify known and novel motifs in protein sequences. I would request the author to run his FRAGAL code on several protein sequences with small motifs to estimate success rates and false discovery rates of his method. A supplementary table should be provided describing several sequences analysed by this method and these rates. A minor comment, Table 1 should be simplified with the two BRCA2 protein sequences presented in two sub-tables. Please explain why certain ranks are missing in FRscore and %S.
