Hu and Bajorathâ€™s update on compound promiscuity in public compound bioactivity databases is timely with the increasing cognizance of polypharmacology and its role in the efficacy and safety of drugs. The article aims to raise reader awareness and present new questions to be answered, and so the title, abstract, and content are appropriate. All data are freely available for download for primary sources mentioned. The conclusions are fair and unbiased. Additional questions do arise from this survey. First, does the average number of targets per compound differ from the median (or do highly promiscuous compounds skew the average?). Second, is it reasonable to begin distinguishing promiscuous from privileged compounds? For example, by incorporating target class information, staurosporine might be viewed differently from quercetin, where the former represents a highly privileged scaffold among kinases and the latter displays IC50 values against an abundance of target types. Third, the drug discovery field needs to understand if the "promiscuity enrichment" that occurs between the screening hits phase to the marketed drug phase largely reflects the depth of bioactivity data coverage for drugs, as drugs are highly profiled globally. The hit rates of drugs and medchem compounds across the same set of assays and targets would be needed to definitively conclude that drugs are more promiscuous. However, the apparent increased promiscuity of drugs supports the growing resurgence of phenotypic screening, the impetus for exploring compound combinations in the context of multiple genotypes, and begs the question of how medchem optimization of multiple targets should be attacked.
