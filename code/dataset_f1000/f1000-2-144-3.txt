This interesting manuscript presents a view on compound promiscuity based on in-vitro data and the number of potential targets per compound in public databases such as ChEMBL, PubChem and DrugBank. In particular the authors investigate and challenge the notion that most compounds today in lead findings are active on a large multitude of biological data. The title is appropriate for this contribution and the abstract sufficiently summarizes this study. The conclusions are balanced and justified on the basis of the data analysis; this is therefore an essential view on the number of targets. It is an interesting observation from this study that DrugBank annotated drugs appear to interact with a higher number of molecular targets compared to early phase compounds in ChEMBL or PubChem. Any interpretation of this finding should be treated with caution, but it is tempting to discuss from a partially historical view as DrugBank may be enriched with older drugs that would have been subjected to less strict requirements for in-vitro selectivity than in todayâ€™s drug discovery. In addition during and after approval, drugs may have been tested in more profiling assays as is the case with earlier screening-type substances. Following the authors, this interesting argument also supports target-specific drug discovery paradigms used in past years. However, working with public databases leads to many caveats, all of which have been pointed out earlier, e.g. incompleteness of the data matrix and differences of data from different sources. It might be interesting for future investigations to cross-check this conclusion for compounds targeting families like kinases or GPCRs. Due to the challenges of inherent selectivity in those families one could expect a larger percentage of promiscuous compounds. The same discrimination might possibly be true for smaller versus larger compounds.
