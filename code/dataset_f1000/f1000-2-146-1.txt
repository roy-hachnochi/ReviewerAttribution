This short article comes to the important conclusion that while declines in pollinator [bee] abundance at local and regional scales are generally consistent, these declines are not occurring among those species responsible for delivering the majority of pollination services to particular crops. This insight makes a valuable contribution to the recent debate on the implications of pollinator declines for food production and will hopefully spur more studies that look closely at the relative contribution of different species to delivering pollination services across different crop types, and how the abundance of these species has changed over time.
