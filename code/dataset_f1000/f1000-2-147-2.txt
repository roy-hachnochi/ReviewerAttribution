In the present report, Clutterbuck and co-workers describe the cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin in equine cartilage explants and chondrocytes. Their study demonstrates that curcumin is a potent inhibitor of IL1-induced PGE2, MMP3 and GAG release from cartilage at non-toxic concentrations. I found this article very interesting to read as it highlights important aspects of practical relevance for research on curcumin activity in cartilage. I do have a few remarks that might help to somewhat improve the manuscript. Suggested revisions The Figure legends should include detailed information on the number of technical and biological replicates used. The Methods should clarify whether curcumin and IL1 were added simultaneously to the cells/explants or whether curcumin was used to “pretreat” the cells/explants prior to the addition of IL1. In the results section the authors state: “The most apparent reduction in MMP-3 secretion was always seen at 50μM with levels near to that of the controls in all animals.” This issue is also discussed in the 'discussion section later on. However, as Figure 1 demonstrates, significant cytotoxic results are expected from applying this concentration. The results should therefore be discussed in light of this finding. A reference protein (loading control) should be included in the Western Blot images in Figure 5. Did the authors check the Gaussian distribution of the data before applying ANOVA statistics?
