This is a fantastic paper and a very important contribution to our understanding of neurodegenerative disease and the response of the brain to injury. The authors have done a marvellous job in demonstrating that the adult brain releases histone H1 that were neurotoxic. The toxicity was specific for the H1 histone, while no toxicity was seen for H2, H2B, H3 and H4. An exciting finding is that H1, while neurotoxic to cortical cells promotes the survival of microglia, and acts as a potent chemoattractant; conceptually this is an important finding. The study is well done, the conclusions are fair and balanced and the techniques used in the study are very rigorous. The final figure nicely summarizes the proposed role of histones in inducing neuronal cell death whilst activating microglia. I am confident that this study will be a much cited contribution to the field of traumatic brain injury. The work is well written and the figures are outstanding.
