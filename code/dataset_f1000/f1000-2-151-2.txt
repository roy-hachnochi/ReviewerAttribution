This article presents experiments that are very well described. The title is appropriate for the content of the manuscript and the conclusions are appropriate to the results obtained and not overstated. Materials and methods are clearly described so as the experiments can be replicated. The study could be strengthened by adding early on in the manuscript (e.g. introduction) more information about memantine, which is the NMDAR blocker used in the study.
