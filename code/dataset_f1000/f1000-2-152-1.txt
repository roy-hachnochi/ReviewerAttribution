This is a brief report depicting a mathematical model based estimation of presence of chemoresistant cells in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The model incorporates the notion of the presence of rare cells possessing stem cell attributes (cancer stem cells) among heterogeneous cells within such mass, contributing to the chemotherapeutic resistance. On the basis of genetic point mutation as a source for the resistance, the probability formula for existence of resistant cells at a tumor size was constructed. Despite some constraints, the article presents reasonable assumptions providing for the lower bound of the probability. Based on this model, many of the clinical index GIST mass has significant likelihood of containing a tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistant cell at the time of the discovery. If future clinical findings support the assumptions made, the model would demonstrate a rational for combination therapeutics. Specific points: Title and Abstract: Appropriate Article content: Methods and approaches are described appropriately and references made to the main formula utilized Conclusions: Appropriate Data: Appropriate as included Minor item: Materials and Methods second paragraph, 5th sentence should have “109 cancer cells” instead of “10-9 cancer cells are present per cm3 of tumor mass”.
