This article reports the first crystal structure of the IPI protein from B. subtilis , a family of protease inhibitor proteins with homologues across many different species. Although being assigned to the general IG-like fold, the structure shows a distinct topology, hence could also be regarded as a novel fold and a significant contribution to the protease inhibitor field. Additional studies are needed to understand the functional aspects of this new protein and structural scaffold.
