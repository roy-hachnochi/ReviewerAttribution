Thorough discussion of the inhibition mechanism and the protein's possible biological role(s) make this manuscript of interest to a wide audience. Minor changes to improve clarity include delaying (or removing) discussions of ISP in the Abstract because ISP is not the central subject of the manuscript, expanding comments on the NMR structure and possibly citing similarities beyond the common identification of beta strands, and fixing Figure 1A where greater separation between the stereo images is needed.
