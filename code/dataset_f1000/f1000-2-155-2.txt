The study is of interest as this type of data is necessary to fully understand the use of antibiotics in animal production. The manuscript is well written and easy to understand. There are a few points that the authors need to address: Methods: Please list the number of brands per category that were sampled as in Table 1. Also, please list the number of samples collected per brand. This information would be helpful and may have some impact on the data. Results: The total number of E. coli isolates collected per type or brand is not stated. It would be helpful to know what percentage of each were positive. Discussion: The first sentence of the discussion section is very inflammatory to the industry and is not absolutely true. I would suggest refining this greatly or deleting it. Similarly, the second sentence is quite definitive and implies that antibiotic usage always creates antibiotic resistance which may not be true. I suggest modifying this sentence with a qualifying word such as “may select for” or “can select for”. One variable the authors did not address is the fact that chickens produced by the same brand most likely came from different farms. Because there seems to be a large number of brands sampled, this further adds to the total number of farms that were likely to be sampled. The farm environment does have some impact on the quality of the food. Further, birds from multiple farms may be processed within the same processing plant and this too can impact the microbiological quality of the carcass due to cross-contamination. These are confounding variables that may have impacted the author’s data.
