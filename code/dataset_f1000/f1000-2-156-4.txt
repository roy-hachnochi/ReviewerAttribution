This is a good review of the published literature, but the conclusions drawn by the author are not consistent with the data presented, specifically the statement “ the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that variations in environmental lead exposure in childhood over the past 50 or so years in the USA explain, first the rise, and then the decline in crime rates ”. The evidence used to argue against this conclusion is primarily a study done in New Zealand, not in the US, plus a very limited cohort study by McCall and Land. The issue of concern is whether lead plays a role in rates of crime, and while one can argue about the percentage due to lead, the overall information certainly indicates that lead exposure is particularly important. This needs to be stated in a much more balanced fashion. Because this is the conclusion it is important that it be both balanced and supported by the data. If you discount lead exposure then there must be presentation of a credible alternative explanation, and none of the others are well supported by evidence.
