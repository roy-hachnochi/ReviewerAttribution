The article has an appropriate title, and the abstract provides adequate information about the study. The paper is well written, containing clear and balanced data about the study and related literature. Bangash et al have used a standard questionnaire to compare empathy level of first and five year medical students. They had a high response rate and have found that empathy level remains at the high level of 80%. The authors have referred to the limitation of their methodology. They have argued that this finding is different from Westernersâ€™ studies and is similar to the results of researches in other Asian countries, such as Japan and Korea. This is an interesting topic for further explorations. As Bangash et al have also recommended, it will be interesting to undertake prospective longitudinal studies and also to explore to the relationship between self-reported empathy with actual interactions with patients.
