The authors surveyed first- and fifth-year medical students in a private medical school in Pakistan with the goal of quantifying empathy according to a standard questionnaire. The hypothesis was that medical students' empathy declines during training. A high survey return rate was achieved (88%). Women scored higher on empathy than men, which fits the results of other studies. However, there was no significant difference in empathy scores between beginning and senior medical students whether viewed as a mean or as a distribution between typical, low, and high score categories. The authors discuss possible explanations for their results appropriately and do not go beyond the data. They note the primary limitations: the cross-sectional approach and the focus on one school. The authors are impressed that ~80% of the students scored in the normal to above normal empathy ranges. By contrast, I was surprised that 19-20% of the students scored in the below-normal range. After all, these are people entering a profession devoted to taking care of others! I am not aware of whether other studies of empathy among physicians or trainees show higher or lower rates of empathy than in the general population, but if so, a mention of those results in Discussion would add interest. Overall, this is an interesting tidbit of information about medical training, presented clearly and without exaggeration.
