The title of the article is appropriate to the content of the article. The abstract is able to summarize the key elements of the research including the brief overview of the study design, statistical methods used and the key conclusion. The article is well constructed and clear in its presentation. It is succinct, direct, to the point and conveys clear message. Study design has been conducted, properly measured and collected appropriately. Due diligence has been made as pointed out regarding privacy of the patients. The ethnicity of IRB involvement is also clearly pointed out. The study design and methodology has been clearly delineated. The methodology and the steps described in this study can easily be replicated in future studies. The data are presented in an easy to understand and informative way which a busy reader can easily grasp the key findings. The study presentation has included all the data that are necessary to understand the key findings and helpful for future studies. Limitations are adequately described though the fact that other possible explanations, such as medical conditions, are not taken into account. Though the data ‘look’ okay, I would recommend a review by a statistician.
