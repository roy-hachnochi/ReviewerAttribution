The title reads more like a description of an activity, suggesting that it reflects the article which reports on effectiveness of the TDP model in improving PES. In regards to the content, I would suggest that the authors explain the 'retro- pre-questionnaire' in some detail. When did they administer this questionnaire and if there is any relationship between the responses to the questionnaire and OSCE? The conclusions are sensible and balanced. The data are satisfactory to justify the conclusions.
