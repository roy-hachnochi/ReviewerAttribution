This is an interesting research study which aims to use an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in a simulated committee setting for selecting oral medications for type 2 diabetes. The study protocol is well presented and “ticks” many important methodological constructs. However, there are areas which can be further strengthened: At times, the information presented is not clear and lacks justification. For example, in page 5, the authors state that the “ these treatment-specific quantitative data (“evidence-matrix”) will be presented relative to either the comparator... ”. What is the “evidence-matrix” and how will it be presented? Similarly, in step 4, the authors state that they will “…use the standard AHP weighting to combine the results and judgements made in step three to determine relative abilities of the medications to meet our stated goals for decision contexts ”. How will the authors “combine” the “results and judgements”? What process will they use? Also, what does “ meet our stated goals for decision contexts ” actually refer to? The manuscript is littered with similar statements creating ambiguity and confusion. Simple sentences with clearer explanations may be required. Sampling – This may be buried in the manuscript, but what sampling framework will be used to identify the diabetes experts? Will it be purpose or theoretical sampling? Convenience sampling should be avoided if possible due to issues of bias. Qualitative data analysis – How will the data collected through interviews and group sessions be analysed and reported? Will it be via content or thematic analysis? Given that this research also collects qualitative data, it is important to recognise and address rigour and trustworthiness in the research methodology. Overall, this is an interesting and worthwhile study which could be strengthened with additional clarity and specific focus on key methodological issues. I wish the authors the best of luck with their research.
