It is not clear what information this report is designed to convey. PDT is not 'alternative' therapy, having been approved by the FDA for some indications and showing evidence for effective cancer control. The approach described here seems to be based on a random trial error method with no consideration for pharmacokinetics, biodistribution or dosimetry. There has been some enthusiasm for publication of negative reports so as to tell future investigators what not to do, so in that sense, this report qualifies.
