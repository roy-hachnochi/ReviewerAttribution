This is an interesting and well researched article on an important and little studied topic. I have a few comments for the authors to consider: I would find it helpful to include a brief description of the questionnaires used in the study, perhaps with a comment on their reliability and validity. In the discussion about lower limb pain you may want to mention trauma as a likely source in this population. The relatively low percentage of women in the sample limits the generalisability to women.
