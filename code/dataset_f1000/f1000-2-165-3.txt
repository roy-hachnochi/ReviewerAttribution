Tushar Ray here provides a review of his work on the possible multiple roles of gastric H/K ATPase. Ray discusses the potentially interesting role of an endogenous activator of the H/K-ATPase, identified in the last few years by his research group. Unfortunately I did not have the chance to read the recent study (submitted) where it was found that an “anti-activator antibody blocks acid secretion in histamine-stimulated glands”. Thus I am unable to really comment on this relevant point. I was a bit confused by the title, expecting to read about “altered states” in which the H/K ATPase would assume multiple roles. Also it would be nice if the author could comment on the possibility that the function and activity of H/K ATPase and of the Na/K ATPase would vary depending on the specific location of the parietal cells in the gland (i.e. more luminal or more basal), see Fujii et al. (2008) (JBC 2008. 283, 6869-6877). Minor comments: a couple of typos at page 3: 2nd paragraph “of the functional dual topology H,K ATPase”; 4th paragraph “The APM showed very high basal( Ca2+….)”.
