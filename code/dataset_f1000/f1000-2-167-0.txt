This report is very important for assessing and recognizing the present status of trauma systems in the region. I believe an analysis of mortality however, for example an investigation of preventable trauma death by trauma scoring, will give this article greater support. In addition to the evaluation of access time to the hospital and patientâ€™s satisfaction of this study, further study based on the outcome can enable the quality of the trauma management.
