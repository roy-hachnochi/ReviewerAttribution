I think this paper is a good idea, and agree that “unusual” events and anecdotes (particularly when they are brief and to the point) are not published enough. The jellyfish blooms are a great example, but dead zones and massive invertebrate changes are also. The article is well organized and to the point. I think that quantitative and experimental ecologists have been vexed for the last 100 years or so, with the daunting problem of measuring anything in nature on the scale that nature occurs. We only have samples and can only measure a small fraction of interactions over very short periods. Anecdotes and periodic observations over time could help fill out the mosaic of ecological dynamics, but we must also admit that we can never see the whole picture.
