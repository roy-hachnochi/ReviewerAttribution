Anti-RhD therapy is one of the most successful antibody therapies ever invented and still we do not know how antibodies block Rh immunization. Recently, a novel level of regulation through alterations in glycosylation patterns has been started to be appreciated. This study is a good starting point to investigate if this mechanism of regulation by antibodies is involved. The glycosylation pattern found in the anti-RhD pool of antibodies suggests that an active tolerogenic pathway is involved and encourages further investigation.
