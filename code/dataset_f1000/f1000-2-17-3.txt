I find Senn’s arguments both plausible and persuasively expounded. I am surprised that the potential confounding by study quality of the relation between acceptance rates and type of outcome has not been more widely studied, although I, like Chalmers and Dickens, am puzzled by Senn’s statement 1 that “it also seems plausible that higher quality studies are more likely to lead to a positive result” – possibly what is intended here is “more likely to lead to a convincing result either way” . The correspondence as a whole would be strengthened by distinguishing truly “negative” results from those that are merely inconclusive. References 1.
