The article entitled “ The effect of MEP pathway and other inhibitors on the intracellular localization of a plasma membrane-targeted, isoprenylable GFP reporter protein in tobacco BY-2 cells ” by Hartmann et al ., describes the use of an in vivo system to study the effectiveness of known inhibitors of MEP and MVA pathways and also to screen for new chemicals that affect these pathways with the hope of eventually being able to use them as herbicides, antibacterial/ant-parasitic drugs and as inhibitors of early sterol biosynthesis and of post-prenylation reactions. The experiments were well designed and executed and showed that this is a promising system that can be used not only for the screening of new inhibitors of the MEP pathway, but also to study the possible channelling of the intermediates to different compartments and/or to follow the interplay between the two pathways. The latter can also help with applying metabolic engineering to terpenoid production in plants or microorganisms.
