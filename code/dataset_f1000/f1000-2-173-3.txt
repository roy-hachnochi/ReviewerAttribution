This paper addresses mechanisms of glucocorticoid metabolism in various cell lines and primary lung cells in vitro. In general, the experimental approaches are appropriate and the results are clearly presented. The following minor changes are suggested to improve clarity and data interpretation: In paragraph 1 of page 4, state explicitly whether hydrocortisone was present in the culture medium of the other cell lines and primary cultures. In paragraph 3 of page 8 and the final paragraph page 9; I suggest caution in the conclusion that the results, which were obtained in an adenocarcinoma cell line, support the proposal that glucocorticoids increase CYP3A5 and inhaled glucocorticoid metabolism in vivo. In fact, the negative data for primary cells argues against the hypothesis.
