Chatterjea et al. show that TNF-alpha blockade reduced early tissue swelling in a mast cell-dependent thermal hyperalgesia model. The paper is well constructed and clear, and experiments have been well designed and conducted. There are minor questions that I mention below. Anti-TNF-a neutralizing antibody dose is mainly expressed in the article as ul/Kg, please write it as ug/Kg. Since toluidine blue staining is performed differently in different tissues please indicate pH and the time of incubation. In the Methods for TNF-a expression measurements it is said “relative transcript abundance was determined by quantitative RT-PCR” but the technique used is semi-quantitative. When explaining Figure 1A does not mention that at 30 minutes it is also significantly different when comparing the control and TNF treated groups. Please comment more on the mast cells degranulation status of figure 2. Is 60% mild degranulation for this model an expected value? Have you seen or would you expect different percentages using different C4880 doses? Pre-treatment with TNF-a antibody seems to have a small effect on MPO activity but not a significant one, probably because of the low n number (n = 3). This could be discussed as a possibility.
