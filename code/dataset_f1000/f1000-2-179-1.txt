I do not agree that, on the basis of the available data, one can conclude that there may be a negative correlation between HIPEC temperature level and survival. In other words, the authors concluded that the higher the temperature, the shorter their survival. To arrive to a such a conclusion one must conduct a comprehensive multivariable analysis using cox regression model. The only subset of patients in the cohort with sufficient sample size to attempt a minimal multivariate analysis is those affected by colorectal cancer (n=58). In the analysis conducted by the authors the main prognostic factors such as completeness of cytoreduction, PCI, age, type of perioperative systemic chemotherapy, lymph node status, presence of eventual liver metastasis, histologic differentiation were not considered as possible covariates, alongside the AUC of temperature (JCO Glehen 2004). Obviously the limited number of events (deaths) among the 58 cases would not have allowed the inclusion of all these covariates in the multivariable analysis but at least one such as PCI or completeness of cytoreduction should be considered. I would accept the manuscript only if the authors decide to take out the inferences concerning survival from the study, as these conclusions have been obtained by imprecise and incorrect analysis.
