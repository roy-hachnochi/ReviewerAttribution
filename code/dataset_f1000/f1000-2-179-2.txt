The author evaluated the correlation of temperature during HIPEC with short-term surgical and long term oncologic outcomes in patients affected by several types of peritoneal carcinomatosis. The idea is interesting, the paper reasonably well-written, and the analysis conducted meticulously. The temperature was appraised using two parameters: Tmax and AUC. The first caveat of the paper is Tmax. If there is a possibility of tissue damage exerted by the heat, the negative effect depends not only on the level of temperature but also on the duration of the exposure to hyperthermic conditions. Under 43C it is hard to observe significant tissue damage if the exposure does not last more than 30 minutes, according to experimental data. Therefore, in my opinion, this parameter is not suitable and unreliable to achieve the objectives of the study. The second weak point is the survival analysis. Important parameters such as PCI, completeness of cytoreduction, tumor grade, lymph node status (for colon cancer), and whether the tumor is primary or relapsing, the platinum sensitivity (for ovarian cancer) were not considered in the cox model. Moreover, in figure 13 the events occurred at the same time points from the surgery in all four subsets. Is that a coincidence? In the figure 14 groups 1 and 2 combined had 46 events (deaths). How could you explain if the total number of ovarian cases were 16 cases? The tables outlining logistic regression analysis could be better presented by changing the Estimates by Odds Ratio. Remember, OR=exp(B)=e estimate My advice is to reconsider the Tmax and survival analysis. Even though these parts contain the only significant correlations, I myself would take them out from the study. The correlations with short-term surgical outcome is sufficiently interesting to justify the publication.
