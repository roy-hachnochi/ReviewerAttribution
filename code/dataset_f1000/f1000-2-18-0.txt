The authors described an interesting technology consisting of seeding cells on an hydrogel made out of synthetic polymer used to manufacture contact lenses. They used bovine chondrocytes and porcine dental pulp cells and placed them on top of soft contact lenses. After a few days they observed the formation of 3D-cellular structures. Then, they cultured the constructs for three weeks. It is important to mention that the use of commercial polymers benefits the experimental setup, in terms of better reproducibility and potential production. The idea of turning this into a 96- and 384-well plate platform looks very attractive since future technologies and platforms are required in order to produce easy 3D-constructs for pharmacology, toxicology, stem cell and cancer research. I believe this is a excellent technical contribution, which is simple and feasible to be adapted to a HTS (high-throughput screening). In my opinion the work needs some more characterization at the cellular/construct level with relatively simple tests: I believe it will be important to monitor, as the previous referee mentioned, some live/dead analyses to see how the cells perform inside the construct over time. In addition, constructs could be stained with phalloidin/DAPI to assess cellular configuration by fluorescent microscopy. Also, a general morphological analysis of the construct could be performed, to see if they also form a necrotic core like the classical spheroids, as this would be important. Finally, since the authors used bovine chondrocytes I agree with the previous referee that it would be interesting to test for GAG (glucosaminoglycan) production by simple staining with Toluidine blue. In the discussion section, the authors should further explore the potential use of this technology, especially if they suggest translating it into 96- and 384-well format for potential HTS.
