The report by Florez et al. describes the use of contact lenses as a material to culture chondrocytes and dental pulp cells. The cells formed scaffold-free cell aggregates of variable sizes, which depended on the original amount of cells seeded. The cultures were apparently biocompatible, although the viability was not checked after 3 weeks of cultivation. This would be easy to confirm with Live/Dead fluorescent markers. Centrifugation is often used to form cell pellets of chondrocytes (or mesenchymal stem cells in chondrogenesis assays), so in a way this study appears to aim to replace such technology. Therefore, it would be advisable to compare the results of this technology to pellets made by centrifuging, since centrifuging as such is practically costless. Also, looking at Figure 5A, the HE staining locates mainly to cells in bovine chondrocytes, which is rather surprising. I would have expected that staining would be more like the one shown for dental pulp cells in Figure 5B. The stainings would benefit from immunostaining for type II collagen, and maybe from additional staining for GAGs by stains such as toluidine blue or Safranin O (even though hematoxylin should do the same in HE staining). The irregular shape of the aggregates makes me wonder whether the number of cells differs in parallel samples. Therefore, DNA analysis would be useful to clarify this issue. The irregularity is problematic for tissue engineering purposes (even for small constructs), but as commented in the discussion, might be useful for chemical toxicity testing. As another referee commented, the discussion in its present form is very minimal. In particular, what is required is the reasoning for why this technology is needed, and how it can overcome the present methods.
