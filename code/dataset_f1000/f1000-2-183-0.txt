This article is a case report of a man who had been suffering from treatment-resistant depression who developed symptoms of mania. The main problem with this paper is that although the patient was prescribed varenicline for smoking cessation, the report contains no information on any changes in his smoking around the time he was prescribed varenicline and thereafterâ€¦none! We are left to guess about this, and it is a reasonable guess that the patient significantly reduced his smoking. In that case why are the manic symptoms being attributed to varenicline rather than to smoking cessation? Some of the symptoms described (high irritability, decreased sleep) are known symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. There is also a lack of information on other drug/substance use that may help to interpret the patient's mood changes. For example, did he consume much caffeine? Caffeine metabolism slows down significantly on smoking cessation; could that have played a role? Overall there is insufficient provision of key information to help the reader interpret this potentially interesting case report. In addition, this report fails to cite recent key studies on large samples that are relevant to the question of whether varenicline may cause neuropsychiatric side effects ( Gibbons Mann 2013 ; Foulds et al, 2013 ; Thomas et al, 2013 ). The paper needs to be revised to include a detailed description of the timing of symptoms relative to cigarette consumption and to address any other potential causes of mania.
