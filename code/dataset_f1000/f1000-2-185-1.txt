This is an interesting study on the degradative pathway and dynamics of BOR1-GFP in transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells. The conclusions are largely supported by the provided data. I welcome its publication as it is informative and useful for the study of endocytosis in plant cells. Some minor suggestions: Add scale bars to some of the Figures (e.g. Figures 1C, 3A, 4A, 7C, 8A). Please indicate the molecular weight (kDa) of the detected proteins in Figures 1D, 3B and 5A.
