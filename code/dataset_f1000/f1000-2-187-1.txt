This article presents information on the depth-related occurrence of bleaching among 40 Acropora species around Pulau Weh, off North Sumatra. The article is providing important data. It is written in a concise way but I suggest that the authors add a bit more nuance to their argumentation. Title : The authors could be more specific regarding mentioning the selection of coral species in the title. The contents of the paper is not about a representative selection of ”reef corals” mainly about staghorn corals, Acropora species, which according to the authors “are also often amongst the most susceptible taxa to bleaching-induced mortality”. Figure 2 : The caption is confusing. It mentions the bathymetrical distribution of 41 Acropora species, and the depth range where mortality as a result of bleaching was reported to be high. The main text mentions 40 Acropora species. Does bleaching mortality in 0-2 m refer to all corals or just Acropora corals, because it seems that (almost) no Acropora corals were found here. The authors should explain that this figure represents a mix of data from 2009-2011 (0-8 m: i.e. 0-2, 3-4, 6-8 m) and from 2012 (2-27 m: i.e. 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27 m). Results and discussion: The sentence “Doubts regarding the potential significance of depth as a refuge for corals from warm-water bleaching have previously been raised because…” seems to overlook various papers that do agree with depth-related coral bleaching (e.g. Hoeksema 1991 , Marshall Baird 2000 , Craig et al. 2001 , Furby et al. 2013 ). The sentences “Our results indicate that bleaching mortality can vary considerably over a small depth range. Consequently, surveys conducted only in shallow waters may greatly overestimate the proportion of coral populations killed by coral bleaching” overlook the fact that some coral species show less bleaching on sun-exposed reef flats, suggesting that they are pre-adapted to high water temperatures (e.g. Hoeksema 1991 , Ware et al. 1996 , Craig et al. 2001 , Hoeksema Matthews 2011 ). Since Acropora corals were identified at species level in 2012, is there a way to tell whether the species showed interspecific differences in bleaching (see Hoeksema 1991 , Craig et al. 2001 , Hoeksema Matthews 2011 )?
