 I think the paper is timely and interesting, here are my comments: Page 2, column 1: "In turn, these types can be 'translated' to dynamical systems terminology." To say 'translated' is to imply that dynamical systems tools provide an alternative (and equivalent) description of the dynamics. I don't think this is correct. I think dynamical systems analysis provide a mechanistic explanation of the dynamics in the form of a description of what causes the dynamics. Also, the dynamical systems description is correct in 2D. Other dynamics may occur in 3D (e.g., canards that may lead to arbitrarily slow frequencies with an underlying Hopf bifurcation. Finally, 2D saddle-node bifurcation (away from an invariant circle) can generate type II dynamics, at least theoretically. Page 2, column 1: "Phase response curves that are always positive." Although it is probably implicit in the text that follows, it should be noted whether these PRCs correspond to excitation or inhibition. The classification of type I neurons as integrators and type II neurons as resonators is far from clear to me. In fact, I am not sure that the concept of integrators and resonators is well defined with a definition that has a broad consensus. I might be mistaken, but I think it would be better to leave all that as open questions. I'm not sure I agree with the statement in "Second,..." (page 2, column 2). I think this is true for 2D systems, but not for higher-dimensional systems. I strongly agree with the sentence that follows and I think this should be highlighted. I think that, with appropriate modifications, the sentence at the end of column 2, page 2 "As stated..." should be the first sentence in the paragraph.
