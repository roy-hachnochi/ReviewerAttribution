This paper by Uversky et al. describes the proteins involved in programmed cell death pathways (apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis). Overall it is an interesting paper deserving of publication and contains very exciting illustrative material. The authors have performed a study with a particular accent on the intrinsic disordered status of these proteins. To predict the status of disordered residues, the authors used two programs: PONDR FIT and PONDR VLXT. It should be noted that there are now programs that work with the same or better accuracy of prediction such as SPINE-D , MFDp , MD , Disopred2 , IsUnstruct (version 2.02) and DISOclust (for more details see Table 5 in Lobanov, Sokolovskiy, and Galzitskaya Journal of Biomolecular Structure Dynamics 31(10), 1034-1043, 2013 ). PONDRVLXT was the least accurate at disorder prediction according to the AUC of 14 programs that were compared in Lobanov et al.
