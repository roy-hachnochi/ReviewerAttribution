The software this article describes is well-written and of use to ecologists. The guide and appendices in this article give a good overview of the features of the package, and are well-written. The title and abstract are well-written. My only serious comment would be that the authors refer to species' taxonomy as if it perfectly reflects species' phylogeny (e.g. the end of the first paragraph in the introduction and the first paragraph in the section "retrieve higher taxonomic names"). More often than not, taxonomy does reflect phylogeny, but a sentence clarifying this distinction somewhere might be helpful. A few minor things: Table 1 - "National Center for Biotechnology Information Federhen" - the author's surname, but not the citation, is in the text; "searchbycommonname" and "searchbyscientificname" seem to be the only elements not in alphabetical order in the table. Phylomatic can now create phylogenies for mammals, not just angiosperms (e.g. "retrieve a phylogeny"). Some sentences could perhaps be linked more neatly in the introduction (e.g. " gives that name as unresolved. But Helianthus ", " moved to the cloud. Therefore there is a need ", " additional confusion. Last, name "). Similarly, page 3 has some very short paragraphs; could the descriptions of taxonstand and The Plant List be moved to table 1? "Science workflows" or "scientific workflows" (fourth paragraph of introduction)? These are all very minor points! Perhaps an example of what to type in order to add API keys into the .Rprofile would be helpful, or maybe could just be added to the help file for " ubio_namebank " as this is the function named when it's mentioned.
