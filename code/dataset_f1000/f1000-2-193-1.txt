I note that the authors preferred to retain Figures 1C and 1D in spite of my recommendation to delete them, since they have nothing to do with the contents of the article. I do not insist that they do it, but it may confuse the readers. I wonder though where did the photos of Fungia fungites were taken? I assume the photos were taken from a GBR specimen, since this species is a brooder and not a broadcaster in Okinawa.
