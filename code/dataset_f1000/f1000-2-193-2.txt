This Observation Article reports the lack of cross-fertilization between Ctenactis echinata and Ctenactis crassa , closely related fungiid corals that naturally release gametes at the same time. The authors recognise the limitations of this observation - only small numbers of eggs (100's) were observed and only eggs from C. echinata were available to be fertilized (i.e. they did not cross C. echinata males with C. crassa females) - but rightly point out that this study provides further evidence that hybridization is not as widespread amongst scleractinian corals as often portrayed in the literature. However, the analysis of reciprocal crosses and a larger numbers of eggs is necessary before it can be said with some confidence that these congeners can not hybridize.
