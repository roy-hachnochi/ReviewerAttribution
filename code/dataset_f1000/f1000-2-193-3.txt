 The title is appropriate for the content of the article. The abstract represents a suitable summary of the work. Please correct: crass to crassa , in the 3 rd line of the Abstract. Article content: The design, methods and analysis of the results been clearly explained and are appropriate for the topic being studied. Figures 1C and 1D appear to be irrelevant to the article since they show different species. I suggest deleting them. A proper reference to the statement 'spawning occurs following the full moons from July to August' (reference 8 in the manuscript) is: Loya Y. K. Sakai (2008). Bidirectional sex change in mushroom corals. Proc. Roy. Soc. Biol. B 275: 2335-2343 . Data and Conclusions: The authors note that they did not cross C. echinata males with C. crassa females; however they also did not test the positive control of crossing C. echinata males with C. echinata females (all their experimental C. echinata specimen were females). Nevertheless, this does not diminish their prediction that hybridization between these species is unlikely. The paper contributes further information to the controversial topic of potential hybridization and breeding incompatibilities within the mating systems of broadcast spawning reef corals.
