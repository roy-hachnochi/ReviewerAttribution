The article reports the identification and subsequent validation of several targets of miR-30a/mir-30c cluster using luciferase-based assays in a human embryonic kidney cell line. The use of computational algorithms to identify downstream targets may not always identify targets with biological significance. Thus, studies such as these are necessary to identify relevant downstream miRNA targets. The studies are well described, with adequate detail, and the conclusions are justified. Future studies to explore these targets could consider analyses using gene-specific 3-UTR luciferase constructs in which putative miRNA binding sites have been mutated, as well as an evaluation of their effects in the specific target cells of interest, such as hepatoblasts.
