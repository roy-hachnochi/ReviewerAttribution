This study is a follow up of their previous discovery published in Cell, 2013 . The authors have described differences between non-programmed and programmed Schwann cells in their ML-retaining properties. Unveiling these differences is an important step toward understanding how ML disseminates in the body. The experiments were nicely done and the conclusion the authors tried to draw is justified. I have one comment that must not be a big burden for the authors. This study deals with several different types of cells, donor primary fibroblasts, non-programmed Schwann cells, programmed Schwann cells, recipient fibroblasts derived from multiple origins etc. In addition, Schwann cells (either non-programmed or programmed) are considered either “recipient” or “donor” dependent on which way ML bacteria translocate. So, the story is a bit confusing for readers. My strong suggestion is that the authors might be willing to put one more figure in which the experimental scheme is summarized in a simple diagram. In this way, fewer readers would need to repeatedly read the same sentences before getting points of what authors want to describe. The authors have properly addressed the comments in the previous report, which has improved the paper.
