This would be a much stronger contribution if the authors added measurements of the critical parameters, including quality of video synchronization and loop delay. Their responses place some theoretical limits, but a measurement would be much better. Nonetheless, as a forum for publishing code that can be used by people not concerned with these details, this may be useful.
