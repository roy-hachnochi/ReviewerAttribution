The castor fatty acid hydroxylase (RcFAH12) is responsible for the synthesis of ricinoleic acid which has important industrial applications. Heterologous expression of RcFAH12 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in only 17-19% hydroxylated fatty acid (HFA) in seed triacylglycerols (TAG). In this work, the authors suggest that electron supply to RcFAH12 in Arabidopsis is limiting due to its heterologous expression and they test this hypothesis by co-expressing castor NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase (RcCBR1) and cytochrome b5 (RcCb5) that supply electrons to RcFAH12. The work is well presented and performed and indicates that the endogenous electron transfer system in Arabidopsis is not rate limiting in HFA production.
