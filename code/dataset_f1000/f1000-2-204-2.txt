This is a small but interesting paper in which the authors describe the generation of two new and more specific anti-MeCP2 antibodies recognizing the Mecp2 isoforms (Mecp2_e1, and Mecp2_e2). In addition the authors, by using these new tools, are able to revisit and confirm the recent data indicating that MeCP2_e2 is dispensable for healthy brain function, and that it may be involved in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis and embryonic development. The data and the ideas herein presented are clear and, as also discussed by the authors, there is a growing interest in understanding the functional relationship between the two isoforms of Mecp2. The approach in the antibody preparation is classical, the techniques are well accepted, the data analysis are rigorous and the results are convincing. Intriguingly, ERK 1/2 (Extracellular Regulated Kinase 1 and 2) like MeCP2 (e1 and e2) presents two different isoforms (in this case originated from two different genes) and the ERK1 isoform posses an N terminal basically identical to that of MeCP2. This data, together with the highly conserved sequence in MeCP2s and ERKs reinforce the idea that this kind of N-terminal could be involved in important biological functions. I think that further speculation on this topic could add additional value to the manuscript.
