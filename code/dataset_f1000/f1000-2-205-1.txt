Lakhina et al . examine the effect of chemically induced seizure on the expression of Lim family members and their cofactors, specially within the rodent hippocampus. Using in situ hybridization to measure mRNA levels they demonstrate that transcription of Lim, Lmo and Clim family members is altered in a field-specific manner specifically in adult but not early postnatal (P7) rats. These interesting observations extend previous work on seizure induced changes in Lmo1-3 expression (Hinks et al. ) and raise several important questions for future study: How rapid and persistent are the changes in gene expression following kainic acid administration? Do alterations in gene expression drive physical remodeling within hippocampal neurons or vise verse? Are there field specific differences in the timing of transcriptional changes? What are the functional consequences of these transcriptional changes? It is interesting that changes in transcription were observed in adult but not juvenile animals, whose circuits generally believed to be more plastic. Might these transcriptional changes be a means by which to counteract decreasing circuit plasticity in adults?
