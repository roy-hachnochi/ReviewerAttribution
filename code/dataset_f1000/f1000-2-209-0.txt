SV2 is an important protein essential for normal synaptic transmission. However, its molecular action remains unclear. Previously these researchers have identified SV2 as a ATP binding protein. In this study, they proceed to test whether ATP binding to SV2 leads to the hydrolysis of ATP. However, the evidence presented here is not sufficient enough for such a strong assertion. Main problem: Although purified SV2 protein can bind ATP, it is unclear whether it has the correct structural conformation to mediate ATP hydrolysis. To prove such a method can work in vitro , control experiments with similar purified transmembrane proteins that catalyze ATP hydrolysis should be done. Most importantly, it is unclear the local environment of SV2 proteins in vesicles in vivo , such as the concentration of ATP, pH and other factors. Therefore it will be ideal if the authors can measure ATP/ADP level in vivo in cells with overexpressed SV2 or not, using fluorescence indicators such as Perceval ( Berg et al., Nat Methods. 2009 ; Tantama et al ., Nat Commun. 2013 ).
