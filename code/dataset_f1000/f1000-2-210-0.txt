Results: part of the results is a justification of the analyses carried out and should be placed in Material and Methods. Discussion: in my view one of the most important results is the absence of negative effects of sheep on guanaco population growth rate that indeed has been cited as one of the major drivers of guanaco population decline particularly in Patagonia in the 20 century. For that reason I think authors should discuss this important result more deeply.
