I have cross checked the comments from the two original referees with the responses from the authors and consider that the authors have adequately addressed all comments. The study has various limitations, such as a limited set of predictor variables, lack of the use of a sampling technique (e.g. Distance sampling) that accounts for differences in detectability, and application of a simple regression analysis. The authors have adequately addressed each of these major issues in their response to referees - though readers should be aware of these limitations when interpreting the results of the study.
