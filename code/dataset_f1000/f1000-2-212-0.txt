This is potentially important negative data. However, the report is dependent on the quality of the IHC antibodies used to detect ephrin A2 and A5. Given the availability of the KO mice, it would be important to show that the antibodies do not stain the relevant KO glomeruli. If this is confirmed and added to the figure the report would be much improved.
