The authors analyzed the phenotype of ephrin-A2 -/- , ephrin-A5 -/- and ephrin-A2A5 double knockout mice. The authors reported that no obvious differences of the phenotype were detected in the kidney if compared with wild type mice. However, the authors showed that the glomerular size was reduced in mice lacking ephrin-A5 gene (ephrin-A5 -/- mice and ephrin-A2A5 double knockout mice). This finding is very interesting. The experimental protocols were well designed, and the analyses for phenotype were well performed. The title is appropriate for this study, and the text is well written.
