As the title of this paper suggests, it reviews the ultimate drivers of biodiversity change in agricultural systems using examples from eastern Australia and New Zealand. The authors are well-respected for their contribution to ecological research, and particularly for informing the options for the conservation of biological diversity in these landscapes. Therefore, the review is as I’d expect it to be—authoritative and conceptually sound. In particular, Figure 1 will be a useful framework to prompt discussions among land managers and other stakeholders. An example of a decision informed by the framework would be a valuable addition to the paper. More generally, however, the review paints a fairly pessimistic view for biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes and reading it left me wanting to know more about the strategies mentioned in the final sentence of the abstract. The authors deliberately reviewed the ultimate drivers of biodiversity change, because unlike proximate drivers, these can be managed—but how? For example, what ecologists might do to fill the knowledge gaps? How might the emerging carbon market be developed to benefit biodiversity and farmers in agricultural landscapes of Australia and New Zealand 1 ? What are some other examples of potential win-win farming enterprises? How might trade-offs among ecosystem services, including both ecological and socio-economic perspectives, affect outcomes for biodiversity in these landscapes? There is some evidence that traditional, as opposed to novel, approaches such as fencing to exclude livestock and unassisted regeneration of abandoned farmlands can help biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes 2 . What are the incentives for farmers to adopt such practices? These are my other, more minor points: Historical legacies are particularly important in the ancient landscapes of south-western Australia 3 4 . Land-use legacies combine with seed dispersal and recruitment limitations to form ecological thresholds to recovery 5 6 . The socio-economic drivers of land-use change are also documented for this region 7 8 . I agree that land-use intensification generally results in the loss of native species, but what about the options for biodiversity conservation at larger scales if intensification is paired with land-sparing? Indeed, the current global debate about land-sparing vs sharing would be relevant to mention here. Nested within social values and awareness are the management goals we as a society set for biodiversity conservation. I think this section of the paper could introduce some of the novel approaches mentioned in the discussion. For example, where and when might it be appropriate to consider novel ecosystems as goals for management in place of historic ecosystems? While it is probably true that agricultural landscapes are understudied compared with other landscapes in Australia as well as New Zealand, this point seems to detract from the arguably more valid point that there’s decades worth of research from which to base good decisions 9 .
