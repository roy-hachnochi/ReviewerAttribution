Bultitude and colleagues performed a psychophysical study on the perception/recognition time of composite faces before and after prism adaptation, in 64 healthy young women. Faces were composed of top and bottom halves from either the same or 2 different familiar persons. The authors demonstrate that adaptation to leftward-shifting prisms does not significantly change change the extent to which the irrelevant face half interfered with processing. Consequently, they conclude that prism adaptation does not have a significant effect on ventral stream processing of perceptual features, but appears to affect exclusively dorsal stream processing. The study results are straightforward and the discussion is appropriate. Only I propose that the authors might add some comments and discussion on their finding that rightward-shifting prisms did lead to some significant reduction of reaction time costs.
