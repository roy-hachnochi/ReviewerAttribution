In this interesting study, Bultitude and colleagues demonstrate that prism adaptation does not alter the interference effect produced by irrelevant facial feature information on facial identification performance. This is consistent with the findings of Sarri and colleagues ( 2006 , 2011 ). The study results are straightforward and the discussion appropriate. With respect to theoretical implications of the results, there remains a question in my mind about whether this study supports a selective effect of prism adaptation on dorsal processing, versus a selective effect on spatial action-intentional “Aiming”, because previous studies demonstrated that face recognition with affectively-loaded, dynamic properties may be strongly linked to the dorsal visual stream ( Schwartz et al ., 1998 ; Adolphs et al. , 2003 ). However, the current study did not use dynamic or (explicitly) emotional stimuli, so this distinction of dorsal visual processing versus spatial action processing is academic to the results at hand and the link of these results to dorsal versus spatial ‘Aiming’ function can be explored in future experiments.
