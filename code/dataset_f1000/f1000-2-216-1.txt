Yeast cells have been successfully used for decades to identify conserved genetic and environmental factors that control cellular lifespan, which often underlies organismal lifespan. In yeast, the lifespan of dividing and non-dividing cells can be assessed via measurement of replicative and chronological lifespan, respectively. It was previously shown that chronological lifespan can be optimized through appropriate buffering of the cell culture media. In this brief F1000Research Research Article, Wasko et al., investigate whether replicative lifespan is also affected by environmental pH levels. The authors conduct a series of technically sound and straightforward experiments to address this question. Micromanipulation of BY4742 cells cultured under various pH conditions did not reveal any significant relationship between extracellular pH levels and replicative lifespan. The authors were quite careful in their interpretation of the findings and appropriately acknowledged limitations. For example, possible effects related to the different types of buffering agents used were noted. In addition, clear statements highlighting that the results of this study are obtained via reliance on a single yeast strain (BY4742) were included throughout the results and discussion sections. Moreover, statistical analyses were generally appropriate as presented. Overall, as suggested by the authors, the presented data suggest that the effects of acidification on aging in yeast are likely to be restricted to non-dividing cells. I only make the minor suggestion to consider adding the word “BY4742” before the word “yeast” in the title.
