The incompatibility with older Perl versions has been fixed, and the script (v1.7) runs now on RHEL6 (Perl v5.10.1). I agree that a ROC analysis for the results presented in Fig. 6 would require subsampling of Cs to achieve a better balance between methylated and non-methylated states. It is unfortunate that the authors choose not to do that, because it limits the value of this analysis, however it should not preclude indexing of the article.
