The mapping and calling of cytosine methylation in whole genome bisulfite sequencing is a challenging task. Following sequence alignment, the localisation and scoring of reliable and quantitative positional methylation information requires a number of control functions including the detection and high quality scoring of SNVs. So far BiSNP has been used as the major tool for these tasks. The MethylExtract tool now offers a (slightly) improveed software suite compiling state of the art (BiSNP-like) features with additional QCs. One advantage of MethylExtract is that the package can be executed in a single PERL script. Compared to BiSNP, MethylExtract reduces the error rate of false SNV calling by including an optimized PHRED score and controlling for bisulfite conversion error rates. MethylExtract accepts SAM and BAM alignment files and cretaes an independent SNV output file (VCF). With SAM as an input MethylExtract runs about 2x faster compared to BiSNP. A performance test on 15x and 20x artificial test alignment sets shows a better performance of MethylExtract in comparison to BiSNP but only with respect to specificity, while BiSNP has the better sensitivity. Unfortunately the authors did not run a direct comparison on real datasets. Overall MethylExtract is a nice compilation of surely useful tools for a comprehensive and quality controlled WGBS data analysis. The key features of the package are nicely documented. I only have my doubts that conversion rate errors calculated on spiked in control DNA really generates a meaningful background correction.
