The paper by Aslam, Kishi and Tsubata addresses an interesting question about the effects of bystander stimulation through CD40L on immunological self tolerance of B cells. Previous studies from this group showed that transgene-enforced CD40L expression on B cells promoted a lupus-like autoimmunity in mice with a polyclonal B cell population. A later study showed that autoreactive B cells in a transgenic mouse with a restricted antibody repertoire biased to DNA reactivity (mice carrying 3H9-56R DNA-reactive H-chain) were promoted to central tolerance in the presence of excess CD40L, whereas 3H9-H mice lacking that mutation, while still expressing a repertoire biased to autoreactivity, failed to show a clear break in tolerance. The present study is a rather minor addition to this body of work, providing additional data on the fate of B cells expressing a λ1 light chain partner, which have high anti-DNA affinity when expressed with 3H9H. The data show that 3H9H/λ1 B cells are not rescued in their development or altered in their anatomical localization (follicular exclusion) when developing in an environment with excess B cell-expressed CD40L. The data are consistent with the earlier, more extensive study, but do provide some new information. However, the data shown have no indication of reproducibility or provide more than a single mouse per group. There is no molecular characterization of the cells to verify that the receptor expression expected is indeed confirmed. Overall, this is an incremental contribution to the literature.
