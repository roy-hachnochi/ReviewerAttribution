This is a useful study that is well executed and that makes a valuable contribution. The results are clearly described. An attempt to address the acknowledged uncertainties in this study, by measuring the levels of PACT in the critical tissues, comparison of the levels of expression of PACT to the transgenic R2D2, detecting an association between human PACT and Drosophila Dicer-2, and/or otherwise confirming function of the PACT transgene would have increased confidence in the conclusion. These measures would be less germane if the parallel experiment to rescue the function of Drosophila LOQS, which is the more likely homolog for PACT, had demonstrated the functionality of the PACT transgene. Perhaps a sentence could be introduced into the discussion that these separate experiments validated the PACT transgene functioned in Drosophila - if this was the case. I have a number of very minor criticisms that might improve the manuscript. The statement in the abstract that the primary function of PACT is to activate PKR is not accurate. As the authors themselves state the relative physiological consequence of PACT, in small RNA biogenesis or protein translation, is uncertain. This sentence might be better expressed by, for instance, writing PACT was first described to function by activating PKR. The sentence in the abstract stating that additional models are required to clarify the function of PACT does not best justify the study approach. Alternatively, describing the utility of Drosophila to decipher small RNA biogenesis would seem more appropriate. It might improve the clarity of the text if the authors selected a simpler abbreviation, rather than PACT/RAX, such as either PACT or RAX.
