Basunaid et al. report on a patient harboring a recurrent meningioma who developed pleural metastases. The primary tumour is reported to be an atypical meningioma WHO Gr II, which upon recurrence shows a malignant histology WHO Gr. III. I share the opinion of Drs Marosi and Simon about the importance of continuing reporting such clinical cases due to the rarity of such tumour entities, even though, as reported by Dr Vorobiof "It doesnt add any further information and doesnt contribute any new knowledge, neither diagnostic nor therapeutic to the current available medical literature" There are some points which should be clarified. To quote the authors: "Our patient was diagnosed with progression of a previous operated and irradiated (60 GY) atypical left parieto-occipital meningioma (WHO grade-II). Re-resection of the tumor was performed and histopathology showed a malignant meningioma (WHO grade- III). After reoperation, re-irradiation (60GY + additional 70GY) was given." Which radiation technique was used? It is not clear whether the radiation dose applied upon recurrence was only 60Gy with the boost, and if the 70 Gy is the cumulative dosage applied including the boost, or just the boost itself. I would also recommend verifying in the literature whether radiation therapy has been offered for histologically confirmed metastatic extracranial lesions.
