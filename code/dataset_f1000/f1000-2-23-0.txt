In my opinion the author of this case report describes the results well, although I do agree with Elizaveta Kon that also including MRIs would have improved the quality of the paper. The real action of PRP is still under debate, and the scientific community asks for stringent methods and careful evaluations, even for a single case study. I suggest the author increases the number of patients and improves the quality of the results in future studies concerning PRP.
