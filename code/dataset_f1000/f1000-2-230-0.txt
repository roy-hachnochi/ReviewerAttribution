The authors have discussed the pitfalls of automated GBA and ways to improve functional prediction. Automated methods for GBA are only as good as ontologies and curated reference datasets. Ontologies like GO suffer from poor quality annotation being propagated throughout their data that result in “Garbage in – Garbage out” phenomenon. A generic functional prediction is the best one can expect from existing automated methods. From my experience, I have found that accurate functional prediction requires a mix of local sequence similarity and sequence profile searches, proper sequence analysis with study of sequence and phyletic conservation, structural analysis, network studies of various data points, and correlation with experimental data, all done with a heavy dose of manual tuning. None of the automated methods of GBA give consistent accurate prediction, without manual intervention. The review laid out by the authors is a good analysis of the challenges and limitation of gene function prediction. One area that the authors do not explicitly discuss is the great difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. GBA is currently far more effective in the latter due to operons, which are not available in eukaryotes.
