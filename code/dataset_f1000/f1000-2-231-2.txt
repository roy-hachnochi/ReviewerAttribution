This paper describes a method for predicting gene function based on amino acid sequence, using a method inspired by automatic translation of human language. The idea is to break the sequence into segments, and each segment is assigned a GO term. During training the association between segments and GO terms is learned, and then this learned model is applied to new sequences. In a benchmark against BLAST performance it is much worse at identifying the GO terms associated with a protein. The defence offered that the work shows the feasibility of the approach falls a bit flat for me. It is feasible in the sense that “ it can be attempted ”. I do not find the results encouraging. I disagree with the claim that protein function prediction is " so close " to language translation, except in some rarefied technical sense. Indeed, using translation seems to be obscuring the actual task, which (in this context) is to find sequences that are similar and transfer GO annotations from one to the other. At the heart of it, that is all that is happening here. I know I am not supposed to address novelty, but I have to point out that many feature extraction methods have been proposed for sequence analysis (for example, string kernels combined with SVMs 1 ). Many methods for sequence scoring are based on methods also used for analyzing human language (e.g. HMMs 2 ), but without the baggage of “translation”. The authors do not make these connections in the introduction. In addition: The method is not described in enough detail, especially for bioinformatics researchers who may not be familiar with the translation methods (including myself). The provision of source code, while laudable, is insufficient. For example, for the segmentation method, the reader is directed to a non-peer reviewed manuscript on DNA segmentation. Why does each segment get at most one GO term? If that is necessary, it seems a big problem, since GO does not work that way. BLAST also does not have the limitations that are exposed by the requirements for cleaning described here. What makes a protein sequence “ corrupted ” or “ inaccurate ”? I do not get what the authors mean by " obviously misaligned " in comparing GO terms to protein sequences; it makes little sense and the strained relationship of the task to translation is exposed. Then authors seem to be requiring exact matches; this is also not very biological. It may be that these are fundamental limitations of the approach; if not, they must be addressed. (I did not take the time to review the source code). The results are not described in enough detail and the evaluation is weak. By optimizing the word length on the same corpus used for testing, the authors have probably inflated the performance scores, not that it helps much. The authors claim that an advantage of the method is that it always gives a prediction, even when BLAST does not. Is it really reasonable to trade specificity for sensitivity in this way? Can the authors show any cases where this yields a useful answer? Showing some cases where a correct functional annotation was found by this method, but not by BLAST, and providing some insight into why that happened, is necessary. The authors mention in the introduction that sequences that are similar may not have the same function; are they claiming that this new method addresses this? I do not think so, so it seems irrelevant. Given all these issues, I nearly checked the "not approved" box. But on consideration I think the work could be fixed up, from a technical standpoint. There are also quite a few English language errors. References 1. Leslie CS, Eskin E, Cohen A, Weston J, et al.: Mismatch string kernels for discriminative protein classification.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions The paper present a new method to predict protein function based on machine translation concepts. In this scenario, protein sequences and their gene ontology terms are interpreted as words in different languages. The idea is to find the best translation for a protein sequence, that is, its most likely gene ontology terms. The method has two phase: training and inference. During the training, protein sequences are broken into several segments and then these segments are related to gene ontology terms. This mapping between protein segments and gene ontology terms constitutes the parallel corpus and it is learned during the training phase. Next, the inference is carried out by an statistical machine translation system that translates a new protein sequence into gene ontology terms by using the collection of translated pairs (parallel corpus) learned previously. My main issue with this paper is the way how sequences are broken into segments. It is well known that some segments such as motifs and domains are essential to predict protein functions. The author must explore them to enrich their model. A second point concerning the results, they are disappointing. The method did not outperform BLAST that is one of the simpler existing method for protein function prediction. The comparison was not properly done, what is the false positive rates for both methods? Authors must compare the methods by using classical measures such as precision, recall and F-measure and a ROC curve could be plotted. Moreover, the authors did not compare their approach with state-of-art methods such as SVM and HMMs. The discussion of results is really poor, the authors did not defend their method. The training and testing strategy is unusual. 95% of the data to train and just 5% to test, the author have performed a cross validation? If yes how many folds? how many times it was repeated? It is not clear in the text. The paper is not well written and there are several incompressible parts. Just to cite some of them: "Then we use a phrase-based translation model to build the amino acid sequence to protein function translation model. (I think it is "to map" instead of "to build") Here we build three groups of gene parallel corpora. Group 1 only contains human amino acid data. (the expression human amino acid data is so unusual in bioinformatics community). The author wrote in the conclusion "Since the protein functional prediction problem is so close to language translation, translation based protein functional prediction is likely to be the most promising approach." I do not agree that protein functional prediction is close to language translation problem. There are a lot additional points, for example evolution. In my opinion, we cannot interpret proteins as words. Anyway, the results have not showed that it is the most promising approach. Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This article provides an intriguing approach to protein function prediction -- to treat the task as a word translation process. However, the results that the authors provide to not justify the statement that the approach is likely to be "the most promising approach" and are not appropriately compared with state of the art methods. Furthermore, no biological intuition appears to have informed the approach; this results in an approach that, while novel, doesnt capture some fundamental characteristics of the data. Protein sequence - function relationship : The fundamental assumption embodied by the method is that there is a strong relationship between protein (sub-) sequences and functions, as represented by sequences of GO terms. While this is likely true for some sub-sequences, it wont be true for all, as the authors themselves point out. Does the method allow for some sequence "words" to be effectively silent in the prediction phase? Figure 1 shows each word being included in some phrase which is "translated". Can some words remain untranslated? How often does this happen for this task? What about sequence words that should correspond to multiple GO terms? Is the sequence of words biologically important? The "Best BLAST" method that the authors compare with (NB: I wouldnt call that approach "search-based" as that name is extremely underspecified; rather I would suggest "sequence similarity-based") uses local sequence similarity; some regions of the sequence will not be considered. It certainly isnt obvious to me that linear order should matter at all on the output side; it appears that the GO sequences are listed in numeric order by ID and a "2-gram language model" over GO sequences should not carry any more information than a 1-gram model would, as the IDs themselves are arbitrary. This representation is not well-justified. Segmentation : The authors use a EM-based approach to drive segmentation, which essentially captures the statistical properties of particular subsequences. There should be some relationship to work on motif finding here; the authors should identify some relevant work on that topic (e.g., Tompa et al. 1 , although there are likely many more reviews available; as this is not my area specifically I suggest the authors do their own search). The authors should also compare to a far simpler segmentation approach: just splitting the sequence into words of fixed length. This is a character-level n-gram representation. Perhaps all the work of running EM (and the associated large number of data points) is completely unnecessary. (The authors would of course need to try a few different lengths for this to be meaningful.) Essentially, the strategy needs to be justified, and the impact on the broader function prediction task must be quantified. What is the relationship between the maximal word length and the number of output terms included in the output GO sequence? Is there a length bias on the output side that is also reflected in Figure 2? Again, this hinges on the appropriateness of characterising this task in terms of the translation model. Data: The authors do not clearly state whether they consider all GO annotations available for a protein, or if non-experimental evidence codes are excluded. If "Inferred by Electronic Annotation" codes are included, this means that "Best BLAST" has likely already been used to produce the annotations, which would explain at least to some extent why the performance of that method shows such strong results. Experiment details: The authors do not specify what e-value threshold they assume for BLAST. Filtering : The authors incorporate various filters along the way, and it is unclear how strongly this biases the training/test data that they utilise. The authors delete long sequences and proteins with many associated GO terms. The cleaning reduces the data set substantially, but the rationale for doing this cleaning appears to have more to do with the limitations of the approach that the authors have adopted than because of some biologically valid reason. The exclusion of such a large number of {sequence,GO annotations} pairs will certainly undermine the findings. This also applies to the deletion of the "obviously mis-aligned" sequences. How many instances does this filter? Why are these obvious mis-alignments? The number of GO terms associated with a sequence has more to do with (a) annotation bias [some sequences are far more heavily studied/annotated than others] and (b) overall progress on curating protein function information (see Baumgartner Jr. et al. 2 ). Evaluation: Recently, the CAFA challenge explored protein function prediction from sequence 3 , and in association with that there has been detailed consideration of evaluation of this task 4 5 -- the key point being that the structure of the GO should be taken into consideration in the evaluation. The authors present their results in terms of BLEU, but in their use of the unigram form, I think that BLEU simply collapses to Precision. This, then, ignores Recall completely. The evaluation presented should certainly measure Recall, and the authors should provide results that are comparable to the results of systems that participated in CAFA. They should then compare their results to the state-of-the-art methods. Summary In summary, the applicability of the method to this task should be more strongly justified and the experimental set-up (including the extensive filtering of data points and the evaluation metrics) should be more carefully considered. The authors conclusions have not been adequately justified on the basis of their results. References 1. Tompa P, Davey NE, Gibson TJ, Babu MM: A million peptide motifs for the molecular biologist.
