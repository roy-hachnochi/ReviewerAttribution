This is a well written paper describing a rigorously conducted study. The title accurately reflects the results and the abstract does a good job of summarizing the key results. It's not clear from the introduction whether patients experience attenuation of neglect only when wearing the prisms, or whether the effects persist after removal of the prisms. Perhaps the authors could add a sentence or two to clarify? My only comment on the results is that I would like to see estimates of effect sizes reported to help interpret the data. The conclusions are justified given the data.
