I find the proposal examining the association between high strain jobs and unipolar depression to be fascinating. Examining clinically diagnosed depression as opposed to self-reported depression is an important step in job strain research. My only suggestion is to be cautious about arguing that individuals with high strain jobs leads to depression. This is not a longitudinal study, and it is just as likely that individuals who suffer from clinical depression are more likely to hold jobs that are characterized by high demands and low control. Regardless, this is an important piece of research and I look forward to reading the findings.
