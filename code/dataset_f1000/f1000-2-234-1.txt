This paper presents an interesting idea, but I believe there are potentially some technical problems with it. My main concern is with Equation (4). You state that P(N) in Equation (4) is the probability of failing to detect a viable population, given that the species inhabits the survey area at a given population size, N. However, since (1 Z(N)) is the probability that the population is not viable and (1 D(N)) is the probability that the species is not detected, then (1 Z(N)) x (1 D(N)) is the probability of that the population is not viable and is not detected. I suspect what you want is the probability that the population is viable and missed, which would be Z(N) x (1 D(N)). It is also not clear to me why you dont integrate over N. If you assume that N has a Poisson distribution, then this integral should not be too hard, or at least it will be possible to approximate it (see Royle, 2004) . I think some broader discussion of this approach in relation to statistical methods for estimating detection error and estimating population parameters in the presence of detection errors would be useful. One thing that I think needs discussion is why here you focus on estimating the detection error and use that to estimating a suitable sample size. This is quite different to many recently developed approaches where the focus is on inferring the underlying population parameters from imperfect observation data. Here your focus is on the detection error itself and it is not clear why. I think some discussion of this in relation to how the data is intended to be used is important. Finally, you talk about maximising Equation (5). As far as I understand, you are not maximising this equation, you are solving it for a value of P crit .
