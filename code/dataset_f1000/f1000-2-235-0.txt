Drawing upon a systematic review of existing literature, this article evaluates the popular claim that the food sovereignty agenda will not only democratize food provisioning, but also alleviate the poverty of food producers and encourage the conservation of biodiversity in agrarian landscapes. In so doing, it represents a valuable contribution to the academic debate and carries important ramifications for envisioning and implementing future agricultures. The authors effectively deploy the concept of poverty traps to challenge the common claim that environmental degradation, including biodiversity loss, is an inevitable consequence of rural poverty alleviation, thereby contributing to a growing literature demonstrating that economic and political democracy can, in fact, promote sustainable agricultural practices (see, for example James Boyce’s work on natural assets). Their survey of the relevant literature also demonstrates how two tenants of the food sovereignty framework, small-scale peasant-based agriculture and agro-ecological practices, are associated with higher levels of biodiversity and more resilient food systems. Overall, it’s an insightful article that effectively and concisely analyzes the relevant literatures in the social and natural sciences. The title and abstract of the article are appropriate and accurately reflect the content of the paper. The article is logically structured and well-written. The analysis is impressive and draws upon a comprehensive review of the relevant literatures. It’s an important contribution and I highly recommend its indexing.
