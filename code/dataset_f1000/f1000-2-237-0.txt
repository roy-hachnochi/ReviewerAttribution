The authors present an interesting case report of chronic headache possibly related to the nasal decongestant naphazoline. They clearly and reasonably argue that naphazoline may have caused headache as a well known side effect of this drug and/or due to a similar mechanism known from other pain medications (analgesics/triptans/opioids) in terms of medication overuse headache. They laboriously explain the possible pharmacological mechanisms of action that may have caused headache over the long run, as well as early pain relief mechanisms that led to the continued intake of this drug in the first place. All this is highly hypothetical as correctly pointed out by the authors and may or may not stress the possibility of many different drugs that may cause medication overuse headache or may contribute to the development of chronic headache in particular patients. This case report provides a nice impulse for further research in this direction and emphasizes the possibility of other medications that may cause medication overuse headache beyond triptans, analgesics, etc. This case should make us clinicians more alert for these matters in order to better treat our patients with chronic headache. Many pre-clinical and clinical studies will be needed before any of the assumptions made by the authors can be confirmed or discarded.
