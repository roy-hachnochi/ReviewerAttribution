I agree with most of the responses from Gary Luck. I prefer to persist in my sixth remark on the elaboration of the Generalized Linear Model. The explicit specification of this model and the estimation results are missing. In his response the author describes the method and its results in words. I believe the paper should contain the quantitative estimation results too. In my ninth remark I mentioned the partial analysis. The author has responded by providing an array of other relevant ecosystem services for almond orchards. Indeed, a more comprehensive study will shed light on the value of other ecosystem services for almond orchards. It will also be interesting to see whether these parrots provide other ecosystem services than those for almond orchards.
