In this study Li, English et al. propose that HIDEMs behave in a very similar manner to mesoangioblasts, with regard to expression of HLA and co-stimulatory molecules, suppressive potency and mechanisms of action. HIDEMs are comparable to mesoangioblasts in their surface marker expression and that both cell populations respond to stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines consistently, with increased expression of HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, PD-L1 and low level expression of CD40. Importantly, HIDEMs suppress T cell proliferation driven by anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in a similar dose-dependent manner as that of mesoangioblasts, but with increased potency. Comparable to mesoangioblasts, HIDEMs did not alter the expression of early activation markers CD25 or CD69 on CD3+ T cells, a phenomenon also seen with immune-suppressive mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). These findings are comparable to other publications by the same group. The activation step involving IFN-γ or TNF-α is an apparent prerequisite for HIDEM suppression of T cell proliferation as neutralization of either cytokine significantly abolished the inhibitory effect. IDO and PGE-2 are identified as key mechanisms of action involved in HIDEM suppression of T cell proliferation. Following this line of thinking we suggest that other potential suppressive mechanisms should be investigated. The involvement of regulatory cytokines like IL-10, TGF-β for example should be addressed, as well as the more detailed phenotype of T cells or even the participation of T regulatory cells should be explored. The detailed study of immunological mechanisms is highly relevant and may contribute to advance our knowledge about the use of HIDEMs or mesangioblasts for the therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
