The ability to accumulate oocytes or embryos from multiple cycles before PGD is done, could be an interesting development as is suggested in this article. However, the numbers are too small to be conclusive. I agree with the remarks of the first referee, furthermore I would like to add the following points for revision: Table 1: a. The numbers of normal and abnormal embryos should be specified. b. What are the definitions of clinical pregnancy rate per patient with transfer and the pregnancy rate per patient with transfer? c. How many embryos were frozen? d. How many FETs (Frozen Embryo Transfers) were done? e. All percentages should be given using decimal points. In the discussion it is stated that a high percentage of patients had an embryo transfer of healthy embryos. In my opinion this cannot be concluded from the material presented in the manuscript. In a number of cases FISH was used on day 3 embryos, which means that not PGS, not PGD was done. This screening can only give the results for the chromosomes included in the FISH analysis, while all other chromosomes can still be aneuploid. Furthermore it is known that mosaicism can complicate analysis at day 3. Finally the information given with respect to the costs is not detailed enough. The prices of an ICSI cycle and the PGD analysis should be given in order to come to conclusions about the financial aspects of this approach.
