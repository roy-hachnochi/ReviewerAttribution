The title is fine, but it would be better if it summarized findings rather than summarized the procedures. The abstract is an adequate summary of the article. Required revisions: Methods- Generation of the list of zebrafish jogging genes: " The search identified a further 23 zebrafish genes, however manual review of these publications led to 5 being disregarded, as the evidence for an involvement in heart jogging was not strong enough ." The phrase, " was not strong enough " does not provide sufficient detail to make construction of this list reproducible. The details should be provided. Discussion- paragraph 4: " only a few of the 'jogging ortholog' genes, CCDC103, CCDC40, DNAAF1, LRRC6, NPHP3, and PKD2, are associated with heart looping defects, and thus provide evidence which suggests an involvement of these genesis left-right asymmetry determination in the heart ." First, making an assertion that genes are not associated with a particular process requires that high-powered studies were performed to reach a negative conclusion. Does the literature support this? Second, while it is true that eliminating one possibility increases the probability of other explanations, it is not very solid evidence for a particular explanation. The logic of the above statement should be better supported, or the statement should be removed. Discussion- paragraph 4: " However, there are numerous other reasons why there is a poor association of heart defects with the 'jogging ortholog' gene list. " This should be, "… numerous other possible reasons …".
