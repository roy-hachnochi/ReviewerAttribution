This is an interesting idea that uses the physical (electrostatic) properties of amino acid side chains in order to predict secondary structure from sequence, and thus assess (and rank) the quality of protein structures. The manuscript is well-written, and the authors provide comprehensive information to allow others to follow the study-design and methodology. The focus on electrostatics is important as this has been repeatedly shown by rigorous theoretical studies (work by Warshel and others) to be the primary driving force in determining protein function and most likely folding stability as well (whether directly or indirectly). As the specific methodology the authors use is slightly further from my area of expertise I cannot directly comment on this, however, importantly the source code has been made Open Access and freely available through Github. My only comment is on the second paragraph of the Discussion, which comments on the pitfalls when using an incorrect model of a protein structure, particularly when trying to calculate pK a s using continuum models which are dependent on the initial conformation. While the authors highlight a very important challenge, I would like to point out that it can to some extent be resolved by extensive conformational sampling (particularly the pK a problem, as the pK a is an average property over all possible protein conformations), which we discussed at length in a review a few years ago ( Kamerlin et al. , 2009 ). Otherwise this is a nice manuscript and a valuable contribution to the literature.
