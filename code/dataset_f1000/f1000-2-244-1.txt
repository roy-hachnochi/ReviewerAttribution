The paper reports in a very thorough and clear fashion the bioinformatic steps taken to map short reads to a reference genome of another species and call potential variants. The way the data is made available and the tools provided for such are great features in this report. Although the bioinformatics are solid and clearly described, the actual applicability and perspective for this type of approach is limited, as the authors themselves acknowledge. If anything remains to be tested it is if different parameters in the mapping algorithm, in this case BWA (e.g. -l and -i parameters), or even using another more suitable mapper (for example GEM) could either help to retrieve more variants, or reduce the FDR (Ideally a combination of both!) Overall, I agree this paper reports an interesting exercise, however other researchers facing a similar problem (lack of same species reference genome) need to take into consideration species-specific genomic features of source and reference genomes and interpret results with caution.
