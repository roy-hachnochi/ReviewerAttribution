The manuscript by Ramirez-Gonzalez et al. presents a software package to store and analyze metrics from next-generation sequencing runs. The open-source software package, StatsDB, stores statistics from sequencing reactions in a MySQL database, and APIs provide means to access and analyze the data. The StatsDB package facilitates easy querying, particularly across multiple fields from respective tables in the database. StatsDB provides modules that can be used in conjunction with FastQC as well as with other tools suited for the analysis of sequence data. From the perspective of a wet-lab genomicist, the StatsDB package seems to be a useful tool, and I can certainly see the utility in storing data from the sequencing reactions, particularly for a genome analysis center. I only have a few minor comments. Since FastQC is commonly used for the analysis of sequencing runs, and since the StatsDB package works with FastQC, it would be useful to provide a little more explicit information describing the output/types of data provided by FastQC. Some of these data are presented in the StatsDB schema, but it would be nice to add a bit more detail in this regard (possibly a very simple figure) into the Introduction. I appreciate the use case provided, but I think it would be helpful to provide an additional small example of how the StatsDB package could be useful to an individual lab that uses a moderate level of next-generation sequencing in their research (as opposed to a genome center). Possibly, a summary of the StatsDB Reporter application would suffice. It would be helpful to add a few sentences to the Introduction to indicate how other sequencing centers, etc. store output from FastQC or other similar tools. This does not have to be an extensive overview.
