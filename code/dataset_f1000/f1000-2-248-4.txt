The article is well written and describes a tool which will be very useful to the community. I only have a few minor issues: Throughout I felt that the terms used were confusing: "analysis" and "run" for example. These can take on multiple meanings in sequencing (for example, what the SRA calls a run is not what I call a run). I feel these terms need a better definition when they are first introduced, with examples where appropriate. Is it valid to still use the term "short-read" sequencers? There is a lot of technical information about the design, database and APIs, but only a single example (using Illumina data) at the end; examples using PacBio and Ion Torrent data would show the true flexibility of the tool.
