Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions are widely used for various medical indications. Since these products are pooled from thousands of healthy blood donors, it is possible to have passive antibody transfer of certain donor-related infections to the IVIG recipient. In this report Ilboudo et al. present two cases where IVIG infusions led to false positive transient hepatitis B titers and delayed the management of two critical patients. Previous reports have also indicated such an observation. Accordingly, this article serves as a reminder of possible positivity of hepatitis titers post IVIG that would resolve in few weeks. It also underscores the importance of screening for infections including hepatitis B pre IVIG infusion. This article is well written and lists the IVIG products available in the US with significant comments that can be used as a reference.
