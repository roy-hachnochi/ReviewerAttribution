The authors report an interesting case of lead poisoning following the administration of traditional remedies. This is a rather well-known situation, with several published cases, mainly occurring in the developing countries where traditional medicines are widely used. The case is well-written and discussed. I have only minor comments: Severe lead poisoning is responsible for abdominal pain which may be associated with nausea and/or vomiting but is generally preceded and associated with constipation. Was this patient constipated? Hemolysis and cytolytic (rather than cholestatic) hepatitis are manifestations of subacute (or acute) lead poisoning; could the authors comment on their finding? The clinical (and biological) course of this lead poisoning case could be better described, regarding the onset of renal complications, course of hemolysis and hepatitis, as well as blood lead concentration one or two weeks after chelation. Arthralgia and myalgia are rare features of lead poisoning, as written in the introduction section. The main implications of lead poisoning are neurological (encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy), hematological and renal (tubular nephropathy, then tubulo-intersitial and glomerular nephropathy). In adults, digestive absorption of lead is poorer (5-10 %) than indicated in the discussion section.
