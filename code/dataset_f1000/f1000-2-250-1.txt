The authors report an interesting case of lead poisoning by a Bhutanese alternative medicine treatment. The interest resides in the frequency of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a source of accidental lead poisoning, a fact most physicians are not aware of. Also, the conclusion that CAM medications should be part of treatment history-taking is important and sound advice. Minor points to be improved: The reference interval for blood and urine lead level should be provided. It would be interesting to know how the follow-up of such a case should be performed. At what intervals should lead measurements be repeated?
