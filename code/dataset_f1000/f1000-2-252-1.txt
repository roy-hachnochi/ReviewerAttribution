This project is investigating the migration and effects of rat neural precursor cells on ischaemic brain lesions using an improved method for labelling these cells in vivo using an iron based marker. The authors show that the label does not interfere with the normal behaviour of the cells, and that it allows for cells to be seen in the grafted brain. However the study also highlights that the cells have no benefit on the lesion (when grafted 48 hours after the lesion) and in addition as the vascular lesion re-organises, the iron signal can be hard to see over endogenous iron deposition. This is a straightforward study with clear data, my only comments are: What is the efficiency of uptake on the iron label into cells, in terms of how many of the cells take up the label? How stable is the iron label within the cells in vitro? Is it lost over time independent of any cell death- namely are the number of cells with a label the same over time in the stem cell cultures? What factors present in the ischemic tissue facilitate NPC migration? It would be of interest to know if transplanting the cells into the non stroked hemisphere would have allowed for better visualisation of cell migration to the lesion.
