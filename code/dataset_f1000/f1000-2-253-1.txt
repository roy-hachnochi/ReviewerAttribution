I have a few minor comments: The very small number of patients does not allow for the extraction of safe conclusions. The embolisation should be conducted by an interventional radiologist and not an interventional nephrologist, please provide an explanation as to why this occured. The literature results from conventional angiography that the authors provide are excellent, however references regarding the success rates of conventional angiography success rates in post pcnl embolisation are also needed.
