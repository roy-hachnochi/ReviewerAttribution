In general this article does make a good point that DPA may well be an important omega 3 fatty acid and provides references from in vitro studies, animal studies, and some human epidemiologic studies that DPA may have some unique, beneficial properties. However many of the studies quoted for support in cardiovascular disease confuse association with causation, and this should be noted. Moreover there is still some controversy about the extent of the effectiveness of very long chain omega 3 fatty acids in the improvement of cardiovascular health according to different health authorities. That said the article does provide a useful review that should promote more research into this potentially important fatty acid. As an additional comment there are some misstatements which are presumably typographic on the first page. The retroconversion is DPA to EPA rather than the reverse. Also there is only one elongase necessary to convert EPA to DHA.
