The clinical case is well-described and, as such, it is worthy of indexation. My major concern is the use of the prediction model introduced by Wells. Even though it has been widely used, it has a very limited value in predicting pulmonary embolism (PE). â€‹ In the reported case, the Wells score was 1.5 - indicating low clinical probability. In my opinion, instead, the clinical presentation is strongly suggestive of PE. By applying the prediction model we introduced in 2008 (Miniati et al., 2008) the clinical probability of PE would be 86%. Our model allows the estimation of the probability of PE by adding the regression coefficients that apply to a given patient. The probability can be calculated at once by using dedicated software that can be downloaded at www.ifc.cnr.it/pisamodel . I am not saying that the authors should make use of our model, but I think that the availability of other models should be acknowledged in the manuscript. Also, I may say that syncope is a relatively frequent presentation of PE even in young and otherwise healthy subjects. In a survey of 800 patients with an established diagnosis of PE (Miniati et al., 2012) the prevalence of syncope was 24%. In sum, I believe that the manuscript is of interest but requires revision.
