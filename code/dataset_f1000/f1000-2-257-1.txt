The authors present a case of pulmonary embolism (PE) presenting with syncope and hemodynamic instability. Comments: The Wells score is a validated tool to define the pre-test probability of PE before performing diagnostic tests such as D-dimer tests and CTPA (computed tomography pulmonary angiography), but not to predict outcomes such as mortality. The authors state that the Wells score "sharply increased from 1.5 to 8" after a drop in the blood pressure (BP). BP drop is not a criterion of a Wells score. Thus, the Wells score did not rise to 8, but remained 1.5, and the patient remained low risk for PE. But, the drop in BP speaks for a hemodynamically relevant PE, which can be treated with thrombolytic agents. The drop in BP worsens the outcome of the patient, but is not a reason to describe this case of PE as "high-risk pulmonary embolism". "In order to save the patients life": Hemodynamically relevant PE is not a 100% killer. Please discuss mortality rates of hemodynamically relevant PE.
