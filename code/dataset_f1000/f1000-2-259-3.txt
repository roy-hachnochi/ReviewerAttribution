This is a report of an emerging viral infection with well-documented but still uncommon neurological symptoms, and adds to the knowledge of the natural history and potential treatment of this clinical syndrome. It is clearly written and the case is described well. I have the following minor comments: The referenced Cochrane review found no evidence from randomised trials to support any form of treatment for neuralgic amyotrophy, with only one retrospective series reporting a benefit. Therefore it seems an over-statement to say that corticosteroids are a validated treatment for the condition. Are there any cases of prednisolone use specifically for HEV-induced neuralgic amyotrophy? What is the evidence of using ribavirin to treat acute (rather than chronic) HEV, which is a self-limiting infection? The authors state that 'a severely affected subgroup present with signs of liver dysfunction, as seen in HEV ' - do you mean that cases associated with HEV infection (and therefore presenting with liver dysfunction) have a more severe clinical course compared to neuralgic amyotrophy associated with other causes? Please justify the conclusion that recognition of HEV infection avoids invasive procedures?
