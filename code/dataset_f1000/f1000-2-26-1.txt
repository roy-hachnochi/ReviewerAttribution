This is a case report of acute kidney injury (requiring dialysis) after use of OSP for constipation in an elderly woman. The patient had a kidney biopsy demonstrating findings consistent with acute phosphate nephropathy. This is a valuable reminder that AKI secondary to OSP may occur independently of the indication for OSP prescription.
