 Artifact removal: Unfortunately the authors have not updated the paper with a 2x2 table showing guns and smiles by removed data points. This could dispel criticism that an asymmetrical expectation bias that has been shown to exist in similar experiments is not driving a bias leading to inappropriate conclusions. This is my strongest criticism of the paper and should be easily addressed as per my previous review comment. The fact that this simple data presentation was not performed to remove a clear potential source of spurious results is disappointing. The authors have added 95% CIs to figures S1 and S2. This clarifies the scope for expectation bias in these data. The addition of error bars permits the authors assumption of a linear trend, indicating that the effect of sequences of either guns or smiles may not skew results. Equally, there could be either a downwards or upwards trend fitting within the confidence intervals that could be indicative of a cognitive bias that may violate the assumptions of the authors, leading to spurious results. One way to remove these doubts could be to stratify the analyses by the length of sequences of identical symbols. If the results hold up in each of the strata, this potential bias could be shown to not be present in the data. If the bias is strong, particularly in longer runs, this could indicate that the positive result was due to small numbers of longer identical runs combined with a cognitive bias rather than an ability to predict future events.
