The authors present a case of XPN (Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis) that was believed to be a renal cell carcinoma based on imaging. The propensity for XPN to "imitate" renal malignancy is well established. Indeed, I wrote a case report many years ago when, in addition to the imaging apparently suggesting a renal cell carcinoma, there was an incidental small RCC in the same kidney! ( Smith RD et al ., 2000 ) It would be worth emphasizing what is unique/important about this case, and the learning message that follows. Is it the apparent vascular invasion with thrombus in the vein that the authors wish to highlight? I have a few other suggestions. In the abstract, "tumour" should be changed to "mass". The patient did not have a renal tumour in the sense of a cancer as this word is often used. , in its most frequently used sense of malignancy, may cause confusion to anyone reading the abstract, believing this was an renal cancer with tumour thrombus. I would prefer to see the creatinine expressed in SI units (umol/L) and an eGFR given as well as the units in mg/dL.
