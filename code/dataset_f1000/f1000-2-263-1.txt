 The topic of this case review is not especially novel, and the information provided is unlikely to be useful to other practitioners, as the clinical entity of XGPN is well documented in the existing literature. The background, history, presentation, physical examination, and diagnostic tests are appropriately presented. The authors have not commented on the post-operative management of the patient.
