The authors present an uncommon clinical situation where XGPN mimicked a renal tumor. XGPN is indeed a rare type of renal infection characterised by granulomatous inflammation with giant cells and foamy histiocytes. It has been shown in many case reports and small case series to mimic an infiltrative malignancy. Renal vein thrombus has also been described in many previous reports. I have few other observations that the authors may like to address. What were the findings on nephroscopy, and did the surgeon take any biopsies of the suspicious lesion? Did you noticed any xanthoma cells in the urine? The lady has a classical presentation of an XGPN (gender, obstructing middle age ... was she diabetic or immunocompromised in any way?) stone until the contrast study. Did the investigators consider a biopsy prior to planning a nephrectomy for a fair functioning kidney?
