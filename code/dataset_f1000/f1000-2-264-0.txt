This manuscript written by Smith et al. presents an R package to process IDAT files, the file format of Illumina BeadArrays. The package illuminaio fills an important gap in data processing by enabling the analysis of Illumina data without Illumina software. The gap is illustrated when the authors cite the disparity between the availability of CEL files (Affymetrix file format) and IDAT files in public data repositories. In addition to eliminating the need to use Illumina software, illuminaio extracts additional information from the IDAT files allowing improved quality control analyses and additional data correction algorithms. Figure 1 of the manuscript illustrates the simplified analysis pipeline enabled by illuminaio . The authors briefly describe the IDAT file format that was not publically documented before illuminaio . Figure 2 of the manuscript summarises the details of the file format for each of the BeadArray platforms. As such this is not just the development of a new tool, as the authors have provided thorough documentation for a widely used platform. In addition, the vignette accompanying illuminaio clearly explains the packages methods and how to use them. This package, illuminaio, has already led to the development of many new analysis packages that utilise IDAT files and the additional information they provide. In turn these packages are leading to the increased exchange and availability of the raw IDAT files in collaborations and data repositories.
