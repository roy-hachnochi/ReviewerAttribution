This is a nice review that more addresses bone loss directly following TJR as opposed to the consequences of wear driven osteolysis that can initiate many years after surgery. Nevertheless, the discussions on treatment approaches are useful. Adding that denosumab is now entering clinical trials for peri-implant osteolysis (clinicaltrials.gov) might be warranted.
