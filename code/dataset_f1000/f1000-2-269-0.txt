This interesting, well-conducted study investigated the relationship between chromosomally integrated human herpes virus six (ciHHV-6) on HIV disease severity and progression. Individuals with ciHHV-6 constitute just under 1% of the general population and a similar proportion of the 439 HIV positive individuals analyzed in this study. Due to the small sample size, only 4 ciHHV-1, HIV+ individuals were found and no significant conclusions could be drawn regarding any association with HIV disease. Nevertheless, this study is thought provoking and may provide impetus for a larger study that could shed light on this potential viral interaction in vivo .
