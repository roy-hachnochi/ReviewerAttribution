In this manuscript, Colasante et al . describe an exhaustive analysis of the membrane proteins and lipids present in glycosomes from the kinetoplastid protozoan parasite, Leishmania tarentolae , and conclude that, in the absence of obvious transporters for the major substrates and intermediates of energy metabolism, these molecules must be transported across the glycosomal membrane via pores formed by known glycosomal membrane proteins, which are orthologues of the peroxisomal membrane proteins PEX11, GIM5A/B, PXMP4, PEX2 and PEX16. The paper is well-written and the technical approach is appropriate. While one must be mindful of the adage “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence”, the comprehensive nature of the proteomic analysis in the present study provides a persuasive argument (albeit, not definitive proof) for this conclusion. As a minor point, it could perhaps have been helpful to have indicated the identity of the proteins enriched in the glycosomal membrane fraction (urea pellet) of Table 1B. It would also be good to indicate what proportions of the total glycosomal fraction are represented by the two lanes in this figure.
