 Glycosomes are evolutionarily and functionally related to peroxisomes. To fulfill their metabolic functions, the organelles communicate with the cytosol by an exchange of metabolites/products. Driven by the fact that the knowledge on metabolite transport across the glycosomal membrane and the nature of involved protein in this process is still scarce, the authors performed a proteomic approach with purified organelles. The paper is well written, the experimental design and results are conclusive. Some minor comments should be addressed: - Figure 1A: Please indicate top/bottom fractions and provide some information of the density at least of the peak fractions. Please mention in the legend how much of the total fractions was subjected to the gel. - Figure 1B: Please indicate the load. Are the membranes enriched compared to the glycosomal fraction? Please also provide more details on the experimental approach in the methods section, like volumes used for resuspension, fractions loaded on the gel, etc.
