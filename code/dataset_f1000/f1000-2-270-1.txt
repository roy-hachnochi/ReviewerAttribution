This is an interesting study highlighting the potential role of syndecan-3 in the regulation of angiogenesis. The study was well executed and the manuscript well written. The authors show that recombinant syndecan-3 ectodomain (S3ED) inhibits angiogenic sprouting in a dose-dependent manner, using ex vivo aortic ring assays. They further show that S3ED inhibits endothelial cell migration and suggest that this is responsible for its anti-angiogenic effect. This work warrants publication as it raises many new questions (beyond the realms of this project), about the non-neuronal roles of a relatively understudied syndecan. For example: What are the effects of S3ED in vivo and can syndecan-3 be targeted therapeutically? Does endogenous syndecan-3 (either shed or membrane-bound) serve a role for fine-tuning angiogenic processes in vivo ? What is the specific mechanism by which S3ED inhibits endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis? Does it involve modulation of integrin and/or growth factor receptor function? No doubt these questions will form the basis of many future studies. Minor Points: In Fig 2 it would be useful to include a representative image of an S3ED-treated aortic ring. Are angiogenic sprouts completely absent or are they just stumps? The Transwell "invasion" assays described use a very thin coating (10ul) of non-crosslinked collagen type 1 and a relatively short time period (6Hrs). Consequently, they are not a good read-out of "invasion" per se , but rather of a mode of migration. Therefore the process should be described as "migration through collagen", or perhaps "invasive migration".
