This is a well written manuscript and provides an excellent reference for sample preparation ahead of any label free proteomics experiment. The protocols in the supplementary section are very detailed making them very easy for both novice and expert researchers to follow. The manuscript basically compares three different types of sample preparation and describes the positives and negative for each protocol if applied to label free quantification of proteins. This manuscript will be a very useful reference for anyone who wishes to perform label free quantification of proteins as the authors do highlight both the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The minor revisions I would like to see are in the description of creating a SWATH ion library using offline high pH RP-HPLC. The authors mention the addition of iRT peptides to each fraction, but do not describe why they are added. These retention time reference peptides are added so that any retention time drift from the ion library to the samples can be accounted for by the software used to analyse and quantify the SWATH data. I feel this should be described, especially for novices to the field. Secondly there is a slight complication in using the term eFASP in this manuscript. A very recent publication by Erde, J. et al. (2014) uses the term eFASP to describe a method that differs significantly from the one described here. I think this paper should be referred to in this manuscript just to highlight that the eFASP method used here was based on the method described by Shevchenko et al. (2012) and not to be confused with this more recent publication. Apart from these minor corrections, I have no reservations in approving this article.
