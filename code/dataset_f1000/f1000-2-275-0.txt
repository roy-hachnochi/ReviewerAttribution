This is an interesting case that is well illustrated and has some instructive elements. My only criticism is that it is not clear why a craniotomy was done if this was a benign (albeit aggressive) tumor and a subtotal resection followed by XRT was done anyhow. Perhaps the authors could discuss their surgical decision-making in this regard. The surgical defect in the postoperative MRI also appears to involve areas that were not previously involved radiologcially.
