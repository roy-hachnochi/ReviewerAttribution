The author write that the nasal endoscopic approach is better that the classical transfacial approach because this later may leave unsightly scars with high morbidity. The emphasis in this sentence is probably excessive. The scars may sometimes be (although a good skin closure makes the scar quite invisible) but I never saw high morbidity for the scar per se . The authors write that the inferior portion of the tumor was capsulated whilst it was not the case of the portion adherent to the dura. The reported MRI images confirm this data. So, I believe that this tumor was resectable with the only infratemporal intracranial approach. Moreover, I believe that it was indicated a dural resection in order to achieve a complete radicality. I agree that the repair of the dura in that region is not easy but it is possible without CSF leakage (very rare in my experience, especially filling the dead space with the rotation of the temporal muscle or with a free flap). It is worthy of consideration that the postoperative radiotherapy is not a guarantee of success in case of macroscopic residual tumor, mainly when one is dealing with low grade tumors that often have a low radiosensitivity. The reported sentence With the addition of adjuvant radiotherapy treatment, we were able to achieve no sign of recurrence at one-year follow-up has a very low oncologic meaning. I have seen relapses of solitary fibrous tumor after 12 years of the resection. Finally, the postoperative figure 3A and 3B show a very enlarged liquor space: Why?
