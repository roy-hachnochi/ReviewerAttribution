The authors present an excellent and well-written case of a 14 year old boy who reported with features of mesenteric angina due to ostioproximal stenosis of the coeliac trunk managed by percutaneous angioplasty combined with stenting. Technical success was followed by clinical relief of symptoms along with considerable weight gain for the boy as expected. However, I wish to place a few of my thoughts and suggestions regarding this case scenario: The last line of the introduction (just prior to Case report) is redundant. Isolated coeliac artery stenosis is rarely the cause for mesenteric angina in the presence of a full calibre superior mesenteric artery. Also ostioproximal lesion is not typical of FMD which usually involves the body of an artery (Renal /internal carotid). In this 14 year old boy, having had congenital cardiac (VSD and PDA)lesions, rarely found coeliac artery syndrome might have been the cause that had given rise to the symptoms described. I congratulate the authors and suggest they also discuss the possibility or otherwise of coeliac artery syndrome in discussion which would make this a tidy and valuable contribution.
