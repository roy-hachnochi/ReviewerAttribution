In this manuscript, Hu et al. performed a series of high-quality, well-designed and properly controlled experiments in search of potential functions of the protein arginine methylase Prmt7 in adipogenesis of C3H10T1/2 cell cultures. The motivation for the experiment was the group’s previous work that identified central functions of the closely related Prmt5 in the process, which led them to hypothesize guilt-by-homology. Moreover, hints of developmental functions of Prmt7 in other systems, such as neuronal differentiation, warranted testing a broader effect on differentiation in other system. The conclusion that Prmt7 has no bearing on adipogenesis is fully justified by the clean data, which showed no effect in both loss and gain-of-function approaches. It is reassuring that the experiment was conducted by the same group that identified the roles of Prmt5 in the process, and thus the negative data are likely not due to experimental system variability. In the Discussion, the authors allow that this lack of effect may be the result of compensation by redundant methylases; this is probably an overly cautious, “just-in-case” argument, considering that even in most cases of true redundancy there are at least some quantitative effects, which is not the case here whatsoever. It is more likely that arginine methylases are target-specific and have a clear partition of labor among them. With heaps of negative data buried in the archives of many laboratories which never see the light of day, the team has to be commended for publishing their own negative data to seal the issue and allow other research groups that might be drawn to the question to steer away and focus on more productive hypotheses.
