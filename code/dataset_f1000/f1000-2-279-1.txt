This is a well designed, well conducted, and well described study from a leading lab in the evaluation of histone mediated transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis. The authors provide compelling evidence that Prmt-7 is not directly involved in adipogenic regulation using loss of function/gain of function approaches in two independent pre-adipocyte models in vitro . The authors have evaluated their findings objectively and placed it appropriately in the context of the existing literature. The manuscript and figures are of top quality and require no further modification. The findings provide information that will benefit others in the scientific community by documenting the absence of a direct relationship between Prmt-7 and adipogenic mechanisms.
