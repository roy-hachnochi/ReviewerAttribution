The paper has clearly improved in clarity. As there are no statistics or the determination of an algorithm to predict the intentionality of movement, it is still a step to obtain the goal of controlling tremor by electrical stimulation. The less clear part of the manuscript is the EEG simulation, if they do not have a neuro-muscular model of the tremor and its suppression by beta/alpha ratios is not clear how it is possible to estimate a false positive in the movement prediction. Also the EEG model is a descriptive, not a neurophysiological model. With these reserves and positively scoring the obtained goals by the authors, it is an interesting contribution to find an on-line algorithm for predicting intentional movements in Parkinson diseases.
