The presence of JCV genomic DNA in CSF is the key evidence for making a diagnosis of PML. However, from time to time in our research, CSF samples from diagnosed PML patients could be JCV negative in conventional PCR; only the most sensitive real time PCR can detect the extremely low JC viral load in these CSF samples. For this reason, I suspect that some PML patients may be misdiagnosed. The remarkable work of Dr. Martin-Blondels group will encourage other clinicians to look into a possible PML diagnosis in some neural ataxia cases when occurring in immunosuppressed patients. I have two suggestions that will improve this work: Based on my own experience, JC viral load may increase to a higher level after the PML lesions become visible. If post PML diagnosis CSF samples are available, the data of the JC viral replication kinetic in this patient will help readers gain a better understanding of how JCV replicates in this PML-IRIS patient. This patient also shows cognitive dysfunction, which I suspect may be the symptom of a newly defined JCV associated cerebellar disease called JCV Granule Cell Neuronopathy (JCVGCN). Unfortunately, the MRI of the cerebellum is not available in this paper and the authors didnt look into the presence of GCN type JCV strains. However this wont hurt the integrity of this paper.
