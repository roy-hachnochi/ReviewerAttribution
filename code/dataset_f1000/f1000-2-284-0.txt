The authors describe an interesting case study of rTMS-induced hypomanic symptoms. It is important that such cases and information be published and made public, since it might also provide us more information about the working mechanism of rTMS, and in this case suggests some overlap between ECT and rTMS. The case is well written and clearly presented.
