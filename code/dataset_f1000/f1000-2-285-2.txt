 General comments: This article provides an interesting analysis of the available data on raccoon rabies from a public health database in order to evaluate how land use impacts raccoon rabies transmission. In particular, results show that evergreen forests (likely managed pine stands) are negatively associated with raccoon rabies virus- a finding that has potential implications for habitat types used in the delivery of oral rabies vaccine. Can you justify/explain why you did backwards stepwise regression to eliminate variables versus other approaches for data/model analysis of raccoon rabies predictors? Can you find some more information from the literature for your discussion that evaluates the relative raccoon population densities/abundances in the types of habitats that you study, even if from other states, in addition to reference 19? Also, can you discuss potential differences in spatial aggregation in raccoon populations relative to the habitat types evaluated in your study? Minor comments: When describing table 1 in the fourth paragraph under Mitigating the passive public health database, change odds ration to odds ratio. I suggest eliminating the first sentence in your conclusion.
