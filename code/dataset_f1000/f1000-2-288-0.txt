This revision of the manuscript and the discussion provided in the responses to reviewers improves the original manuscript. There are just a few very minor typographical errors that could be tidied up in any future revision of the manuscript. Section: "Run-time performance" Second paragraph, "....on the value of the variable themselves," should be "...on the value of the variableS themselves," Table 4 title, "JSim Optimizers" should probably be "JSim Solvers" Section: "Some Alternative Simulation Platforms" Section title should follow the same case as other sections (i.e., sentence case). First paragraph, "..as opposed to JSim declarative approach." should be "..as opposed to JSims declarative approach." First paragraph, missing final period at the end of the paragraph. Section: "SED-ML Support" Section title should also be sentence case. "..[E]merging standard for to promote reproducibility.." - should probably delete the "for". In the responses to the reviewers comments, there is a bit of confusion on the relationship between FieldML and CellML. It is important, I think, to note that FieldML is completely independent of CellML and, for example, will not be part of a CellML translator.
