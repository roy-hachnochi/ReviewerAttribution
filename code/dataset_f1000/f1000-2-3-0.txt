It was noted that all dentin samples were exposed to sucrose solutions, fluoride and were protected by tape. Only the unexposed slabs were used as controls and none of these three conditions were controlled. A more complete picture would have been possible with their inclusion. The authors claimed “It is known that dicalcium phosphate and octacalcium phosphate can be precipitated in acidic environments whereas hydroxyapatite is dissolved.” They listed references 7 and 8 to support this statement. However, I was unable to access reference 7 and could not find supporting data in reference 8. While DCP is slightly less soluble than HAP around pH4 I would not consider that to mean that either DCP or OCP readily precipitate at that pH.
