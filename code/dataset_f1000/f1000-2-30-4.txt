 The availability of a cross-species phenotype ontology built as a mashup of different other ontologies is a great contribution to the community and results from the implementation of a well-designed integration process. The process combines knowledge from different sources taking in account their provenance, which guarantees the continuous update of the proposed ontology. The successful exploitation of logical definitions is also a very good contribution to promoting the usage of more formal definitions which I believe will, for example, help to enhance the reliability of semantic similarity and enrichment analyses.
