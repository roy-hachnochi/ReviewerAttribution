In order to contribute to a better control of postoperative pain, this is a very interesting, well described and important clinical study. There are, however, some issues to discuss: Explanation to why there were incomplete data for 9 patients. Description on how the postoperative pain assessments using VAS were performed. The rationale for using both parametric and non-parametric tests. In the manuscript the pain data (by the use of VAS and Pain Matcher) are shown as median and range, referring to that the dataset has ordinal properties, which are adequate for subjectively based assessments such as pain thresholds where the assumption of the distribution of the data is not necessary. In this case, the non-parametric analysis will give more meaning to the analysis than the use of parametric analysis that is based on data that have linear properties and that require knowledge of the data material distribution. The results are presented separate for women and men in table 1 and 2 which is very interesting since obvious gender differences are reported in threshold assessments. It would have been interesting to see separate results based on gender in table 3. The reported values of pain thresholds represent a wide range from 4-99 in men and 4-37 in women. In other studies using the Pain Matcher, the lowest level of your reported pain threshold is reported in the range of the sensory threshold assessed by Pain Matcher. Could the finding be due to the instruction given to the patients on what they were supposed to feel when reaching the pain threshold? In other words, could the sensation of unpleasantness, present before reaching the pain threshold, be a part of the results and thereby explain some of the great dispersion in the data?
