 This study is both interesting and potentially of great importance to help clinicians in improving postoperative pain management for patients. The issue however is that almost 25% of the patients originally enrolled were not included in the analysis without adequate explanation as to why this was (e.g. were they missing at random or not) nor a discussion of the fact that this may have had a major impact on the outcomes. Even though the 'data were incomplete' for these 9 patients there are methods for dealing with this from a statistical perspective that may allow a (more) complete analysis. The other option would have been to recruit more patients to make up for this loss and still meet (or come closer to) the pre-determined sample size.
