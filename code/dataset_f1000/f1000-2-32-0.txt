This is a well-written article. The authors already discuss the weaknesses of their technique, therefore I do not need to comment on this further. However, I would have liked to see some more information on the identified variants. There is no information given about the predicted pathogenicity of the identified (missense) variants. This would be necessary in order to draw any conclusion on whether the disease-causing mutations have been identified or not.
