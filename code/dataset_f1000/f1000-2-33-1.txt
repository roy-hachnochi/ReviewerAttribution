The article looks good, however a few more changes are needed. For example: The subtitle “The wrky17 mutant is hypersusceptible to Agrobacterium -mediated genetic transformation” should be changed to “The wrky17 mutant is hypersusceptible to Agrobacterium -mediated transient transformation”. In the first sentence of conclusion, “ Agrobacterium -induced genetic transformation” should be changed to “ Agrobacterium -mediated transient transformation”.
