 This is a very short report regarding a finding that may be important for some researchers. Even though the science is acceptable several things need to be changed. Genetic transformation normally refers to stable transformation. The authors have only looked at transient transformation which may or may not be stable (they could have tested this). Therefore, please change the title and the abstract to indicate transient transformation rather than just saying genetic transformation. All wild-type gene names should be in capital (e.g., WRKY17 , WRKY 11 , VIP1 etc,.). Only the mutants should be in small letters (e.g., wrky17 ). The authors mention that the VIP1 gene is induced substantially in the wrky17 mutant. However, to my eyes the induction is subtle (probably 2-3 fold). They could have done a better quantification using real-time RT-PCR. Please remove the word “substantial”. Please give the concentration of the Agrobacterium used for infection in CFU. I believe the antibiotic used should be “timetin” and not “timentine”
