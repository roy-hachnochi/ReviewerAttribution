Two well-run experiments: the first of which shows important differences not just in the rate of cross-modal vs uni-modal learning, but also in the processing speed involved in recognising these learned associations. The second experiment is an important control for the discriminability and processing speed for stimuli used in the first experiment. Together, this shows that the effects in the first experiment of learning simultaneously paired associations are due to genuine cross-modal facilitation. Other minor points: Page 4. Calculation of d-prime does not involve just the ‘hit’ and ‘false alarm’ frequencies, but also ‘misses’ and ‘correct rejections’ frequencies. Given this, it would be helpful if the authors made it more explicit how they calculated d-prime from your raw data. Page 7.In the sentence ‘No significant differences were found between MRTs for the three black symbol sets, F(2, 22) = 1.36, p .05, partial η2 = . 11.’ There is a typo ‘p .05’.
