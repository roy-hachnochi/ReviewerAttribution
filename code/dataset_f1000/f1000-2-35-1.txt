There are a growing number of protocols for differentiating stem cells into particular neural cell types. This paper demonstrates the great potential of RNAseq technologies for assessing the identities of such differentiated cells in culture. The authorsâ€™ goal is an in vitro population of 'glutamatergic cortical neurons'. Although many of the genes catalogued show the anticipated profiles across the differentiation process ( Otx2 abundance decreases with DIV while Kcnh5 reads increase), the dataset also demonstrates that this culture protocol may not be the best for 'glutamatergic cortical neuron' study as transcripts for the predominant cortical vesicular glutamate transporter gene, Vglut1/Slc17a7 , are barely detected in the differentiated cell populations.
