This manuscript makes a correlation between the antibacterial and immunomodulatory effects of LL-37 and the synthetic antimicrobial peptide WLBU-2. The authors find that WLBU-2 stimulates cytokine (IL-8) production, which is likely to impact bacterial clearance. This observation implies that the WLBU-2 is interacting comparably with receptors that respond to the presence of LL-37. Overall, the manuscript is well written, the data are well presented, and though the body of work is modest, it should be of interest to a relatively large group of researchers.
