This is an excellent case report with appropriate referencing and balanced discussion. I would have liked to see in the conclusion a comment about the lack of evidence on antenatal scanning of the patent urachus. For the reader, this would further highlight the need for the postnatal assessment of a baby with the antenatal diagnosis of cord/umbilical cyst(s), even if the antenatal scan suggested normal bladder anatomy.
