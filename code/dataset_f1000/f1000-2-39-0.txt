 Abstract: The PCR is mentioned, but not the results compared to the standard. Article content: Materials and methods: "Every slide was read for at least 10 min by two experienced microscopists …" Was this done in parallel for 2 different slides or sequentially for 1 slide? If sequentially, microscopy was done for 20 min and this could influence the results. If different results between the EIA, PCR or microscopy (CME) were obtained, was immunofluorescence microscopy used for additional confirmation of true positive results? This is not in line with the Results: The 88 specimens were examined by CME, IFM, PCR and two EIA’s. Please clarify the difference between what is stated in the Materials and Methods section and in the Results section. Where all 5 assays performed on all 88 stool samples? Results : It is not quite clear how the different assays compare to each other. Maybe a 5 by 5 table with only the positive results would give a better insight?
