The scientific community has been split in the past into those who believed the prion hypothesis and those who did not. During the 1980s and part of the 1990s, most work on the prion hypothesis was from Stanley Prusiner's group, and those who questioned the prion hypothesis were doing so largely by finding potential errors in the work of one laboratory. However, now we have hundreds of papers on mammalian PrP, including, most importantly, the demonstration that transmissible disease can be caused by a pure recombinant prion protein ( Wang et al , (2010) ), that are not from Prusiner and whose results are consistent with the prion hypothesis. In addition, work by many groups on yeast prions demonstrated the validity of the generalized prion hypothesis (inheritance mediated by conformational changes in proteins) in a more experimentally tractable system in which controls that were not possible for mammalian PrP could easily be done. So, at this point, I see no problems with the statements made in the textbooks that are listed in the Table. The prion hypothesis is as well-established, at least for mammalian PrP, as the chemiosmotic (Mitchell) hypothesis for ATP synthesis by mitochondria, which was controversial at the time it was proposed in the early 60s, but which is now the only mechanism described in textbooks. It is no longer necessary to even mention the alternative ideas from the 60s, such as chemical coupling.
