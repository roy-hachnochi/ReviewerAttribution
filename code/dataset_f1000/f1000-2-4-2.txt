 I agree with what I think is the main message of the authors, that the scientific debate should be open and should rest in facts and not in beliefs. The first point is very important and the same 'prion hypothesis' is a good example of this, as it was under attack for a long time until substantial evidence was produced in its favour. I agree with the authors in that in science one should refrain from using statements ('I believe ...') more adequate for religious or political debates, but when dealing with educational matters, simple statements need be used to convey a certain message or information. Time will tell whether these messages are correct, and the text books and scientific journals are full of information that later has been proven to be wrong, but which has been useful to stir the scientific debate.
