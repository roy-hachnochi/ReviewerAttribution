 Summary – The article is a robust presentation of current challenges in implementing strategies for effective VTE prophylaxis. I consider it an important contribution to the debate on incentivising managers of NHS Trusts to support clinicians in their bid to innovate for patient safety, or comply with national quality improvement guidance. Methodology – I have not reviewed the power calculations, but the overall approach is sound. Recommendation – The article could perhaps have benefited from additional answers to research questions 2b and 2c.
