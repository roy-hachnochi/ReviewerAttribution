 This paper demonstrates that prey heterogeneity stabilizes prey population dynamics in an experimental predator-prey system. It should, however, be noted that if this happens via the better-defended prey shunting away resources from the edible prey, then the density of the predator should be lower in the high-prey-diversity treatment. But, according to Fig 3B, this is not the case.
