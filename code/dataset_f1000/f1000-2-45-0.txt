This is a scientifically sound and clearly written article. The major conclusion, that UVB irradiation of keratinocytes has no recognizable global effect on DNA methylation, is supported by carefully designed and well executed experiments. The authors made appropriate speculations about the causes and timing for DNA methylation changes observed in human skin cancers. In view of the nature of somatic cancer development, namely stochastic transformation followed by clonal selection, it is also possible that UVB exposures cause DNA methylation change in only a small fraction of the cells, which cannot be detected with techniques that can only measure collective overall changes but not those in individual cells.
