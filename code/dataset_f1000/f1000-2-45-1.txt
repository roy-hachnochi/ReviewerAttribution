This is an interesting paper, and a good example of how apparently negative results can be important to a field. The authors establish, by three different experiments, that the DNA methylation status of human keratinocytes is not affected by UV irradiation. The results are clear from the data presented in the figures, and the authors are careful to provide bioinformatics analysis to back up visual analysis of the experimental data. This work shows that for the case of UV irradiation, the tantalizing possibility that environmental insult leads to heritable epigenetic changes is not operative. This paper represents a good benchmark for future work that investigates the same hypothesis for other environmental insults.
