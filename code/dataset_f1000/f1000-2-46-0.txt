The title and abstract are appropriate for the content of the article and the abstract does represent a good summary of the work. Design, methods and analysis are nicely explained and indeed appropriate for the topic of the study. Results are definitely important to the research in the field of hereditary neuropathies, as they give insights on the role of the NDRG1 gene in the development of a rare type of CMT (CMT4D). Having good animal models for the different types of CMT and a detailed description of their phenotype (given in the paper published in Neurobiology of Disease- PMID21303696) is pivotal to unravel disease pathomechanisms and program future therapies. The discussion and conclusions are justified. However, it would have been very helpful to the readers reporting the presence of a canine model of CMT4D which carries a small deletion within the NDRG1 gene. Canine CMT is relatively frequent and, to the best of my knowledge, this is the only model in which a genetic change has been reported.
