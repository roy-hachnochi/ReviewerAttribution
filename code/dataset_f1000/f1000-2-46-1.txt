This paper provides new knowledge on the role of the Ndrg1 gene in the biology of peripheral nerve, and more specifically in the pathophysiology of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4D (CMT4D) caused by mutations in Ndrg1 . Most importantly, the stretcher mouse ( Ndrg1 str ) provides a very useful tool to investigate in depth the myelin biology and defects associated to NDRG1 protein. From the experimental aspects, the authors show a nice and classical genetic approach to isolate and characterize the gene in a spontaneous mutant mouse, which include phenotyping, gene mapping, gene expression and molecular genetics to define the mutation. Further histological phenotypes have been reported elsewhere, as indicated by the authors ( Ref. 11- King et al . ). It is noteworthy, the finding of a more severe phenotype in the stretcher mouse than in the Ndrg1-/-, which suggests the protein domain encoded by exons 10-14 are very important in protein function (a biological aspect that deserves more attention in future investigations). In this way, the paper remains a description of an animal model of CMT4D, and I want to state the relevance to move forward to the functional role of NDRG1 in the physiology of the Schwann cell and Schwann cell-axon interaction.
