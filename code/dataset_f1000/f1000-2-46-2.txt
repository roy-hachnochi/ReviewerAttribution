The title and abstract are appropriate for the content of the article. The article is clearly written, and the design, methods and analysis are appropriate. The article shows that the mutation is due to deletion of exons 10-14 of the Ndrg1 gene, resulting in an unstable smaller protein, obtained by translation of exons 1-9 and exons 15 and 16 in frame. The functional deficits in the hind limbs appear clearly at about 5 weeks of age â€“ this represents a relatively early onset which can be compared to the early onset seen in human recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4D which shows an early onset. The model appears to model the human disease phenotype more faithfully than the previously reported Ndrg1 knockout mouse and therefore represents an additional tool for research.
