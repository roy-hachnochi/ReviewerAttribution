The discussion has been appropriately modified to take into account the suggestions I made after reviewing the first version of the manuscript. The authors have not however added in any more data or analysis of the trafficking phenotypes of the tagged proteins. I still believe that data comparing the forward trafficking and stability of the different epitope tagged constructs would be worth having. This could be achieved using Western blot / immunohistochemistry and/or live cell imaging.
