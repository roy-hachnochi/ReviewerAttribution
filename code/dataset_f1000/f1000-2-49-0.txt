This is an interesting and well conducted research study which sheds light on the patients’ perspectives of aspects of health care in an internal medicine ward. It is a well presented manuscript which is easy to read with logically presented arguments. I have two main comments. 1. It would have been worthwhile to expand on the process which led to the development of the survey instrument. While the authors provide a brief overview of the process, such as the conduct of the focus groups etc, it is imperative to provide detailed information about this as the development and the psychometric properties of the instrument can play an important role in the believability of the research findings. 2. I am not sure about some of the items in the survey instrument. For example, what does “is it a reliable department” actually mean? Reliable in term so what? Similarly, what does “is it a department with experience” actually relate to. Is it a question about health practitioners who work there or about how long the department has been in place and hence it reputation? These questions may give rise to ambiguity in the interpretation and as such influence the responses.
