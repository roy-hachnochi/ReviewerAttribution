 There is nothing 'wrong' with the paper, although this research is still quite controversial. I would still like to see the mRNA and DNA from hth individual plants to be sequenced and compared. Also, if genetic recombination mechanism is in play and if mRNA needs to be converted to cDNA for integration, one could show that some of the mutants involved in recombination or in reverse transcription would be impaired in the process of acquisition of new alleles. All the experiments were done correctly, but as I said the story is far from completion.
