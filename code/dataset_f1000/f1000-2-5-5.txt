This paper describes the occurrence of somatic sectors in hth mutant genotypes, with the frequency of rare visible sectors at a specific locus being 1/300,000. However, if there is a selective advantage during development, such sectors might be higher and could also produce clonal selected events and easily be identified by PCR. The data provide adequate support against contamination by outcrossing as a possible explanation of the results. Minor comment: should change the word 'vernalized' to 'stratified' in the Methods section, sentence beginning "Arabidopsis seeds derived from these stocks..."
