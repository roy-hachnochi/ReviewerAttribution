The manuscript is a decent, very detailed, and almost complete review. The title and abstract are appropriate for the content of the article and the conclusions are sensible and justified. However, I do have two significant reservations. Unfortunately, for a complete review of the published data concerning the topic 'botulinum toxin and pain' we found two RCTs missing: Lin YC (2010) Am J Phys Med Rehabil , Placzek R (2007) JBJS Am . Furthermore, there have been at least 3 review articles with the same topic in 2012 ( Hameed F (2012) , Cheng OT (2012) , Sim WS (2011) ), hence by reading this manuscript, little information may be new to the informed reader.
