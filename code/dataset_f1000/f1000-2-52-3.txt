This article reviews the use of botulimum toxin in the treatment of pain, rather than in the treatment of muscle contraction. This is a new area of potentially great interest and therefore the review is both timely and presents a new use of botulinum toxin to be considered. The drawback in the article is that it is a systematic review, not a metaanalysis and not a critical review. As such, it could be shortened by summarizing the studies with less detail. The greater detail in which the cases are described does not add a great detail, since they are simply recapitulations of the study, and do not tell tell us if the study is credible or not. I suggest that the author either be more concise in the summaries, or be more critical in assessing the studies. Moreover, the author includes both intra-articular injections and intramuscular injections. The intramuscular injections may have complex effects, including; analgesic effects, effects from blocking acetylcholine release from motor nerve endings, and the elimination of muscle myofascial trigger points. However, the review is incomplete. For example, he discusses low back pain with injections into the lumbar paraspinal musculature, but only gives Ney and Forster as two references. He could have included the work of Gul et al and of DeAndres et al . The title and abstract are appropriate. My comments regarding the nature of his review are given above. The conclusion is accurate and justified. There are no experimental data to discuss, since this is a review article. In summary, the topic is timely, the review summarizes the data from some but not all relevant studies and in that sense is not complete, and the summary does not address the credibility of the articles cited, and that is a weakness.
