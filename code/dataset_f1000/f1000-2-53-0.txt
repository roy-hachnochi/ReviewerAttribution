This is an interesting study, showing the role of TRPC5 channels in the forebrain, on cocaine self-administration. The experiments are described well. The dose-response curve is convincing, as it shows the characteristic inverted-U-shaped curve. In line with the journal’s guidelines, no statistical results and/or interpretations are provided for any result. However, this makes it difficult to assess the reliability of data, so my comments address this concern. An analysis of drug intake using repeated measures ANOVA with genotype as between-subject factor and days (cocaine 1-6) as the repeated measure does not yield any significant effects (effect of genotype, main effect of days, or interaction genotype x days). Only a t test on day 1 yields a significant genotype effect. I therefore understand that the authors refer to an “apparent” initial increase in drug intake (abstract). It would be important to replicate this finding in the future, to ascertain that it is a true result, rather than variability in initial intake across mice. An analysis of active/inactive hole discrimination using ANOVA with genotype as between-subject factor and days (cocaine 1-6) and hole (active/inactive) as the repeated measure yields a trend for an interaction genotype x hole (p=0.068). It therefore appears that the -/- might have better discrimination. This could be reported. The authors could also consider if there is insufficient power for this difference to be significant. The animals were trained first with saline. Could this have influenced their subsequent intake, and could the initial difference in intake (day 1 of cocaine) be the consequence of differences in the ability to switch across genotypes? From the data, it appears that not all mice were tested for initial saline intake. Could this have influenced the results? The authors should describe (methods) how they ran the dose-response curve (descending doses? Random doses? Etc…)
