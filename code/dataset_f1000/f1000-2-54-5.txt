This is an interesting case report of a somewhat novel manifestation of TB IRIS. The comments related to IRIS are relevant and of some value. Minor comments include: The discussion under management probably should at least raise the importance of continuing pathogen specific therapy and the potential role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Page 3, bottom of column 1, top of column 2 states “The esophagus in a HIV patient is particularly vulnerable to pathology.” The use of the term “HIV Patient” is awkward and the overall statement is not supported by any data or citation.
