This article is a review discussing testicular germ cell tumours and how they may be triggered with an emphasis on miRNA expression. There are a few minor grammatical and spelling errors throughout this review but these do not impact on the quality of the manuscript. I would like to point out however that my area of expertise is primarily miRNA biology and I do not have a great background in TGCT.
