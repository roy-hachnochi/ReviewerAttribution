Uefune et al. have studied if qualitative or quantitative changes in the synthetic blend of the herbivore-induced plant volatiles will affect the olfactory response of Cotesia vestali s, a parasitoid of Diamondback moth. Their experiments are clearly described, carefully designed and conducted. The results of this study show the significance of associative learning for the behaviour this wasp species. The results are also giving valuable new information of the extent to which parasitic wasps can identify qualitative and quantitative differences in herbivore-induced plant volatiles. When we know how to fine tune the associative learning in parasitic wasps that will improve the efficiency of the use of C. vestalis in biological control.
