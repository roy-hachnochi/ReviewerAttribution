This is a very nicely executed and clearly written work. The results are clear, and they support the authorsâ€™ conclusions and previously published hypotheses of proteasome involvement in cytokinin response. One potential enhancement would be to use qPCR to quantify the amount of transcripts, especially since these data represent one of the major findings of the paper.
