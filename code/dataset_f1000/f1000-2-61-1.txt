The title and abstract are easy to understand and their content is a very good summary of what can be found in the full manuscript. The methods section is operational: readers will find enough details to replicate the study. There is no overstatement in the conclusion. The data are original and quite unexpected: I would have guessed that elderly people would suffer from anaemia after a hip or knee surgery, and I am surprised that this is not the case.
