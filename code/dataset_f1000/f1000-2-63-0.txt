In this manuscript Marin and Vicente investigated the genomic diversity of V. cholerae Super Integron (SI) with the aim to identify a set of orthologous genes that are conserved and unique among and in between V. cholerae and V. mimicus SIs. While one must appreciate the efforts that have gone into the analyses, unfortunately, given the known diversity of V. cholerae SI, the number of genomes analyzed was very limited, and was not a good representative of all major phyletic lineages of V. cholerae either. Yet, the manuscript provides some valuable information about the diversity and repository of SI genes and their biological functions. The core genes estimates for SI (21 and 8, among V. cholerae and V. cholerae-V. mimicus respectively) reported in this study may not be very meaningful as the core genome might diminish or at least reduced further if additional genomes from distinct lineages are included. I strongly recommend inclusion of additional genomes at least from the major phylogenetic lineages of V. cholerae O1. The function of TA loci as an essential stress response element needs to be supported by some experimental data.
