The article, although it has a very narrow focus, investigates an interesting question about integron regions in V. cholerae that scientists have so far mostly applied to whole genome sequences: what is their pan-genome and core genome? The scope of the question is quite narrow, as it focuses on a single species ( V. cholerae ), but is certainly novel. The methods and approach used are sound and the results generally well presented. I have two major issues with the analysis: Why use only seven genomes when 200 are available? This is quite puzzling to me, as no data should be excluded if it is available. Some of the 200 V. cholerae genomes available are relatively redundant (they all belong to the 7 th pandemic group) and present little gene content/SNP diversity, but the variations they present are crucial in understanding small scale variability. Many available environmental V. cholerae genomes were also not included and should have been. The article is mostly descriptive and needs to make more informative statements about the results. What is the significance of such a small core genome? How does the pan-genome of the integron overlap with the rest of the genome? What is the meaning of the specific subset of functions found in the integron? How are sites under positive selection distributed in the integron? What genes are under positive/ negative selection? Much more can be said about integrons from the analyses performed. Basically, the manuscript is interesting but could really benefit from a broader (more genomes) analysis and a more in-depth look at the results to infer hypotheses about integrons in V. cholerae .
