In this manuscript the authors have explored the pattern of the superintegrons (SIs) in V. cholerae using the published DNA sequences of relevant strains. This study has shown the dynamic nature of V. cholerae O1 and genetic relatedness of SIs at the biotype level. Comments: Abstract: Results and Conclusions: replace the word ‘reveal’ with “describe” Introduction: first paragraph: replace the word ‘standing’ with “standby” Page 6. The role of TA gene should be validated with non-toxigenic strains of V. cholerae (e.g., sequence comparison with non-O1, non-O139 strains of V. cholerae
