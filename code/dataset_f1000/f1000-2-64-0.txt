I appreciate the effort by the authors to improve their draft following the reviewers suggestions. Although they did not address all the points mentioned, I think the current version is more consistent, and few vague comments have been modified. The additional sections provide useful information on the system that improve the understanding of the preference in position and orientation of the amphipathic segment. Regarding the extension of the simulations, although I would keep insisting in the importance of it, I can understand that the required computer power might not be accessible to everyone. They have included a sentence pointing at this factor, and as far as I am concerned, it should be enough for the acceptance of their work. I am looking forward to the extension in this topic from the authors.
