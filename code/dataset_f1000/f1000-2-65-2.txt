The results are interesting and worth publishing. I would like to make a few points, however. Reporting of methods could have been more complete, there are, for instance, no mentioning of whether any measures were taken to randomize animals to treatment groups or blind the observer to treatments. Neither is there much description of how the animals recovered after the various procedures. Applying one of several recently published guidelines aimed at improving experimental design and reporting, e.g. “Kilkenny, C., Browne, W.J., Cuthill, I.C., Emerson, M., Altman, D.G. (2010) Improving bioscience research reporting: the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting animal research PLoS Biol . 8(6)”, might have been useful. An estimate of the power of the design to detect a reasonable effect of the treatments would have been warranted given the relatively small number of animals in each experimental group. Finally, the authors consistently refer to neuropathic model readouts as pain. This is common practice but nevertheless controversial. The models nearly exclusively measure evoked responses to stimuli that may or may not provoke pain and changes in sensory thresholds or perception are not well correlated to clinical pain. A more stringent vocabulary would make interaction between different professions easier.
