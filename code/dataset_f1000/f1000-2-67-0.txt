The article is well written with an appropriate title and abstract. The methods are adequate for the aims of the study, but I would suggest that including the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) analysis as suggested by Rosello-Mora et al . 2006 , would certainly improve the manuscript. The online analysis can be found here http://www.imedea.uib.es/jspecies/index.html .The conclusions are adequate and the data sufficient to replicate all the analyses.The data are openly accessible at GenBank.
