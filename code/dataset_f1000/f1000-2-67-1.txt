 Title and abstract are good enough to attract readers in the scientific community. Genome based multi-gene sequence comparison is one of the promising tools to analyse bacterial populations. To achieve the analysis for Streptococcus , the authors carefully designed massive data genome analysis. The results are strong enough and supported by the results of the analysis. The conclusion is clear that authors proposed a threshold value on the basis of genome-based MLSA in Streptococcus bacteria.
