 The authors describe a new transduction system for E. coli O157:H7, a strain that cannot be transduced using P1. Such a transducing phage would be a useful tool. The authors make a fairly convincing case that they have indeed isolated a transducing phage. However, there are some important, missing controls, and the efficiency of co-transduction of linked genes needs to be discussed in greater detail. Specific comments: 1. Given that the impact of the transducing phage is likely to be limited to O157:H7 strains (i.e. not K-12), it is important to demonstrate transduction in O157:H7 more convincingly. Specifically, the authors should identify the specific mutation in the recipient strain and then show that this mutation is lost in the transductants. This will rule out spontaneous mutations as the cause of the phenotype. Alternatively, and perhaps more easily, the authors could attempt to transduce an antibiotic resistance gene, as they did for K-12. 2. The authors show that co-transduction occurs in K-12 between genes 14 kb apart. The frequency of co-transduction is 100% for 40 colonies tested. This is higher than I would have expected. Assuming random acquisition of host DNA by the phage, you would expect 8 or 9 colonies, on average, in which the two genes did not co-transduce. The probability of getting 40 out of 40 co-transductants would be 3e -5 . This suggests that the phage does not package host DNA randomly. The authors should discuss the significance of this, especially in light of the utility of the phage for generalised transduction.
