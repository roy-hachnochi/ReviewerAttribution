The title and abstract do not place the potentially useful study in the right context. 'Population' can have many meanings and the scope is too wide. Consider narrowing the implied scope to mixed effects PK modeling.AIC can be an excellent metric for selecting from among a very limited number of models. If used in a stepwise process it can result in all the severe problems that stepwise variable selection has. The authors need to be much more careful about multiplicity and model uncertainty. This needs to be carefully discussed, and the authors would add to the literature if they can derive the maximum number of models that can be compared with AIC before the method breaks down.
