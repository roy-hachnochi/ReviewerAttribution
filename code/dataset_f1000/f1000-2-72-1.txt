The title and abstract are appropriate for the paper. The work presented in this paper is well planned, experiments are well designed and executed, and the analyses are comprehensive and provide clear answers to the main questions. Particularly, the interpretation of the micro array data, analysis of differentially expressed genes, and reference to most significantly changed gene/gene clusters between the wild type and mutant are excellent. The conclusions are all well supported by the data and interpreted in a conserved manner. The results are novel and interesting. All experiments are detailed and clear.
