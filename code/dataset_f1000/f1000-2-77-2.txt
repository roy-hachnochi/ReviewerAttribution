The experiments presented in this manuscript appear to have been carefully executed. The manuscript is well written. However, the findings in this study appear to contradict an earlier report in which PTHrp induces proliferation in calvarial-derived osteoblasts (see Datta et al., 2007 ). The present authors do not discuss this previous result in their manuscript. These conflicting observations demonstrate the problems inherent in using in vitro culture systems for characterizing growth factor and hormone action on osteoprogenitors.
