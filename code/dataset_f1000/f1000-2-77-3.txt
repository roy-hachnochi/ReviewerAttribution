This is an interesting and well written manuscript demonstrating that PTHrP blocks the mineralization of bone nodules developing in cultures of rat neonatal calvarial osteoblasts. Although similar data have been observed with PTH, and indeed both PTH and PTHrP act via the same receptor, this study demonstrates that the calvarial osteoblasts produce PTHrP as well as expressing the receptor so that they are examining a paracrine situation rather than an endocrine one. Their results were the same whether intermittent or continuous exposure to PTHrP was utilized. Surprisingly, PTHrP did not inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity, proliferation, or apoptosis indicating that the final stages of mineralization was the point at which PTHrP was working. The authors found that BSP expression, but not OPN expression, was reduced by PTHrP, and concluded somewhat prematurely that decreased BSP expression was the mechanism for the inhibition of mineralization. There are other candidates, and the authors did not demonstrate that blocking BSP production as by siRNA would reproduce their findings with PTHrP. Thus the title of the abstract and the conclusion that BSP is the mechanism represent over interpretations. The reduction in BSP is associated with but not necessarily the reason for inhibition of mineralization following PTHrP. One would have liked to see other proteins involved with mineralization examined, and each tested for its role.
