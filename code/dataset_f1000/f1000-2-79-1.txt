The authors’ changes have made have made the paper stronger. I have provided a few minor points of feedback but think the paper acceptable as it is overall, a good feasible evaluation of an innovative online intervention. The rationale for testing iEMDR is very clear but the rationale for combining iEMDR and i-TF-CBT could be stronger. In the 3 rd paragraph of the introduction the authors cite evidence that iEMDR is as effective as TF-CBT and can be delivered in a shorter period of time. So this provides a rationale for testing iEMDR but the addition of CBT components does not clearly follow as a rationale. As I suggested previously the Klein et al . 2010 paper that includes follow-up assessment data is more relevant to cite than the Klein et al. 2009 (reference number 11) paper that reports only pre- and post-assessment data for the same trial. There is one sentence under “Adverse events” in the “Results”section that doesn’t seem to clearly follow from the previous sentence: “All three improved between post-treatment and follow-up such that no participants worsened between pre-treatment and follow-up”. However, the changes made to the “Discussion” section about symptoms worsening has made the findings on worsening symptoms much clearer.
