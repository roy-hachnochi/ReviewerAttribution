Overall, the writing is succinct and clear. The analyses are appropriate given the study design and the conclusions are justified. There are a few minor areas where further explanation or clarification is needed, these are detailed below. What is the rationale for combining the two therapies? How is iEMDR expected to add to the effectiveness of pre-existing iCBT protocols? The section on recruitment does not explain how 23 people qualified, but only 16 were enrolled. In the iEMDR Intervention subsection, the authors state, “the positive belief” but do not previously define it. Also, how many people were provided special therapist-guided EMDR? Is there conjecture about how additional sessions might have affected outcomes? In the discussion section, the authors state “these results compare favourably to a similar study...” How is the study similar? Clarifying this may help contrast your findings with the following study which used motor vehicle accident survivors. The section on worsening symptoms should address whether other similar studies have encountered the same problem? Also, is there data from the experiment that suggests which aspect of the therapy may be contributing to this issue?
