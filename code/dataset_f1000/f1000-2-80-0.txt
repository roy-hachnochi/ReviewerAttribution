The manuscript by Polunina assesses the negative association of hand washing and shower taking with the development of asthma in adults. The premise for this work is based on the hygiene hypothesis where reduced microbial exposures in early life can lead to the development of allergic diseases. While the study is interesting and shows a decreased frequency of hand washing and shower taking in the control group(s) compared to the asthmatic group, there are still some major issues with the design of the study and interpretation of the data. Most significantly, the data described in this paper was collected at a single time point and so the author should be careful not to over-interpret the findings in relation to cause and effect since it cannot be established that the hygienic habits resulted in the asthma symptoms. It is also likely that individuals with asthma may have an increased likelihood of undertaking additional hygienic habits. As the author notes, the hygiene hypothesis is complex and there are many different variables that can influence the development of allergic disease. Factors such as household size, vaccinations and diet can also have important contributions to this effect and should be taken into account in this cohort.
