The article aims to evaluate a causal association between hygiene habits (washing hands and taking showers) and the onset of asthma in adults. In the introduction, the author justifies this option by using the hygienic hypothesis theory, which according to her 'postulates that infections and unhygienic contact may confer protection against the development of allergic diseases'. In my view this is a superficial proposal because the hygienic hypothesis theory, although so named, has a much wider scope than just considering hygiene habits as a risk factor to asthma. The hygienic hypothesis theory is concerned with the maturation of the immune system after birth driven by exposure to commensal or pathogenic microbes. The origin of asthma and other allergies could be related to a failed or underdeveloped maturation of the immune system occurring mainly during the early infancy. This is not necessarily restricted to a relation with washing hands or taking showers frequently. What is the theory underlining the hypothesis on the relationship between hygiene habits and the onset of asthma in adults? Furthermore, the research design is flawed. For instance, the questions about hygiene habits are investigated at the present time, and this disagrees with Hill's criteria about the temporal relationship between causes and effects.
