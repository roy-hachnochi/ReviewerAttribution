The authors adequately addressed my critical points and introduced the necessary changes to the manuscript. In my view, this amended version is a useful study that will have a noticeable impact. I generally agree with the statement of the authors that the large changes in the fluorescence intensity could reflect some changes in the fluorophore microenvironment. However, keeping in mind extreme sensitivity of fluorescence intensity to various factors, I would also strongly recommend to use both fluorescence intensity and Î» max emission as the most reliable metrix in this case.
