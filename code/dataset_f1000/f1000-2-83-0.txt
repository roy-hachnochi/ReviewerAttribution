The manuscript by Schnermann and associates entitled, “Nephron filtration rate and proximal tubular fluid reabsorption in the Akita mouse model of type I diabetes mellitus” addresses a critical question in the development of diabetic nephropathy. To address the critical question of the role of TGF in the glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes nephropathy, the authors used transgenic mouse models. Diabetic nephropathy in human patients is a complex disease and no single transgenic mouse model of diabetic nephropathy can perfectly match the human disease. Despite these limitations, Schnermann and associates defined well the problem they addressed, and used appropriate mouse models of type I diabetes mellitus and skilled techniques. In this context, their approach is well controlled and provided meaningful data vis--vis the problem they attempted to address. Thus, overall it is convincing to this reviewer that their conclusions are valid and acceptable to the scientific community. I do not have any major issues, and only present a few minor concerns. Although, the manuscript is well written, at some critical places the use of long sentences is not advisable to convey the meaning smoothly, especially to the not-so-experienced readers and junior scientists. It is not clear to me whether +/- data presented in the Table 1 represent SD or SEM. It should be mentioned in the Table footnote as well as under the Statistics description. Although the scattered data points show the trends, however, looking at the Akita group in Fig 1A, and Ak/A1AR-/- group in Fig 1B and 2A, it is clear that the distribution is not normal. The Ak/A1AR-/- group has distinctive distributions as compared to the other two groups in these figure panels. Hence, the data presented in Figures 1 2 will be better interpretable by including parallel box plots. The box plots also provide more insights by showing the median and quartiles. The authors should consider this suggestion.
