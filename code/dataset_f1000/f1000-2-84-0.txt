The present studies investigated the effects of positive and negative allosteric modulation of mGluR5 receptors on methamphetamine sensitization. The authors conclude that “Positive or negative allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) does not alter expression of behavioral sensitization to methamphetamine”. While the data, in part, support those conclusions; the presence of an effect of 30 mg/kg fenobam on methamphetamine sensitization suggests at least some role of mGlur5 NAM activity. Evaluation of an additional NAM or a higher dose of fenobam would allow for a firmer conclusion on this point.
