Although this is a report of primarily negative findings it is not without value and should be published. The premise of the research is reasonable, the methods appropriate and the conclusions appropriate and not overreaching. Essentially, the workers have demonstrated through behavioural studies in rats that allosteric modulation – either positive or negative – of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 does not modify methamphetamine-induced behavioural sensitization. This adds to our knowledge of the effects of methamphetamine in its abuse.
