This is a straightforward case observation with a clear result and sound interpretation. I would prefer the authors to use ‘superior colliculus’ instead of ‘tectal’, since the optic tectum generally refers to the structure in non-mammalian species. Could the oscillations be due to encroachment of the lesion on the pre-tectum? (I know, it probably should be called pre-colliculus). Also, some comparison with the oscillations observed after muscimol injections in SC might be useful.
