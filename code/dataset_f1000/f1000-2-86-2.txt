The authors submitted a manuscript in which they assessed the perspectives of Nigerian secondary school students on abstinence-only sexual education. They applied a questionnaire to obtain the information. The sample size is correct and the analysis of the data is well conducted. However, my specific comments are that the title does not reflect what the authors did, as the authors did not evaluate the efficacy of abstinence-only sexual education; in fact, there is no evidence of whether the abstinence-only sexual education changes the attitudes of the students. Furthermore, the comments on religion are inappropriate because most of the interviewed students practiced only one religion. In my opinion, the following statement is strongly speculative and inappropriate because the authors did not obtain any evidence for it: “Preparing the adolescents of today to become knowledgeable parents of tomorrow can assist in creating a subsequent future of reduced cases of teenage pregnancies, deliveries, abortions and sexually transmitted infections. Whatever is wrong today can be corrected through adequately prepared adolescents who are the future of any nation.”
