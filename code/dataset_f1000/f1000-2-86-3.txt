 The title gives the impression that it refers to the entire population; however, it is true only for the youngest group - further clarification is needed. The majority of individuals in this study are Christian, so comparison by religion does not appear to be adequate. The authors need to emphasise this and may describe such findings in a single statement. The manuscript is too long, as is the introduction. It should be shortened to ensure the reader does not lose interest. Several text descriptions should be omitted as tables are self explanatory, e.g. table 1. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the data only refers to a particular group of the population.
