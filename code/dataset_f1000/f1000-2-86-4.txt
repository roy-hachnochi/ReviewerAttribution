The authors examined secondary school student perspectives on abstinence-only sexual education through the use of a questionnaire. The sample size is robust, the statistical methods are appropriate, and overall the paper is well written. Unfortunately, the title of the paper is misleading. Specifically, the authors only examined student perspectives and there were no measures of efficacy of abstinence-only sexual education. The data suggests only that students of the youngest age group are more likely to be receptive to abstinence-only sexual education but no evidence is presented on whether the students would or in fact do incorporate these messages into their lives. The authors also suggest that the data shows that there is a significant relationship between religion and student perspective; however, the numbers of students in other religions than Christianity is too small to make meaningful conclusions. Moreover, it is unclear if the students simply identify with a particular religion or actively participate in the religion. Finally, the conclusions reached and the implications for health education practice are overstated. The most that can be concluded from this study is that young adolescents are potentially more receptive to abstinence-only sexual education. It cannot be concluded that abstinence-only sexual education will be more or less effective than no education or alternative education messages in shaping student sexual practices.
