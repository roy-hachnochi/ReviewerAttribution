I do not understand either from the abstract or reading the earlier paper why this data was collected. Neither the strain collection nor the quantities calculated have any obvious special features. The information presented is of a similar character to statistics that are automatically generated for example by the pubMLST database. There is no reason to clog up the scientific literature with such reports.
