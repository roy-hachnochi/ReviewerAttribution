This is an interesting paper that aims to elucidate the contribution of intrinsic excitability plasticity on neuronal learning using computer models. The paper would benefit from presenting a statistical analysis of the learning process. What is the probability of distinguishing a learnt pattern as opposed of detecting a false positive? The fact that P noise also evokes a close firing rate response as P learn should be closely addressed. Is the output for P noise and P learn significantly different? There should be controls for having the same number of input neurons to any pattern. Otherwise, the results in Figure 6 could be due to the overlap of P noise and P learn . Does the author propose a metric by which the neurons distinguish the learnt from the noisy pattern? Figure 7 and 8 are mixed up in the text and with their captions. Please re-arrange. In the histogram of what is now Fig. 7 the author again shows that P noise is capable of eliciting a response that seems to be different from background. Is this significantly different (statistically speaking)? I think thereâ€™s a typo in Eq. 3. Although the premise of the paper is quite interesting I think the results and discussions would be much better supported with a thorough statistical analysis of the spiking response of the model.
