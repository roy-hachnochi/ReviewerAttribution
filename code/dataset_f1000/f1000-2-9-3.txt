The authors describe an interesting model that involves the ectopic implantation of tumour spheroids (N202 breast tumour cell line) into the mouse skin fold chamber. By using high quality ultra structure images, the authors describe tumour survival to hypoxia and formation of capsular vaso-mimicry as the event that determine the vasculogenic switch, 3 weeks after implantation and that facilitate metastasis. Although the work is valuable for the novelty of the process described, on the other side, it also presents some issues, for which I have reservations. The work is based only on one tumour model, the number of animals used for some of the observations is too low, the analysis is performed only by in situ ultrastructure and no quantitative data are provided as well as no information on the number of fields of view/slide analysed. Also the images shown are all in very high power magnification. It would be useful to include images at lower power magnification to have a better overview of the surrounding tissue. Also, the authors do not provide any evidence of tumour metastasis, or tumour dissemination occurring from the original implantation, but imply that the observed vaso-mimicry process could facilitate metastasis. The authors should have looked at the process at different time points: earlier and later than the 3 weeks time point selected for the study. Minor comments: the article is in general too wordy with the results often containing discussion points. Typos: in the title "ectopicly" should be "ectopically" and on page 9, "phenotipicly" should be "phenotipically".
