 The authors report here on how tumour cells survive in an ectopic environment by implantation of spheroids of N202 breast cancer cells into a mouse dorsal skin chamber. Their major finding is that the implanted tumour spheroids survived for 3 weeks without any support of the host circulatory system. They propose that vasculogenic switch and erythrogenic authophagy of some tumour cells are the key process driving the survival and growth of the tumour cells. They find that tumour cells secrete ECM component and can generate their vasculature by converting into erythrosomes thereby supporting other tumour cells. The authors propose that this process is governed by anaerobic metabolism. The limitations of this study are: 1) the study is based on in situ ultra structural analysis of tumour growth and survival. There was no metastatic response or circulating tumours in their model, hence no cellular mechanism of metastasis as the title implies. Further, the study is based on one mouse model and one breast tumour cell line. While the study highlights the importance of anaerobic metabolism in metastasis, this concept has been discussed in the literature.
