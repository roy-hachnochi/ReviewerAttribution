This article presents a study that compares three forecasting models used in healthcare.The models are based on scores for predicting cardiac arrests. The idea is useful and the theme is very important due to the huge number of people that are affected by cardiac arrests worldwide. However, there are some gaps that are crucial to validate the success of the study. The small sample is indeed the main flaw of this study and consequently, it compromises the results interpretation. It is very dangerous to take solid conclusions with just a few examples. In other words, the reliability of this study is not enough to evaluate and to compare these three forecasting models. A larger sample, as well as a more heterogeneity is demanded. The description of the models could be more detailed, in order to a better comprehension. The bibliography is adequate.
