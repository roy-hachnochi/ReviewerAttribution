This is a very lengthy review on the contributions of dissolved ions to the behavior (aggregation, membrane interaction) of proteins. It is rather long and rambling (and seems somewhat repetitive) and may be construed to some extent as “propaganda” for the author’s opinion in this case. There also does seem to be quite a lot of primary data, ie, data appearing in this review that have not received peer review in other journals. However, on balance, the review is interesting, and should spark dialogue if not controversy in the scientific community.
