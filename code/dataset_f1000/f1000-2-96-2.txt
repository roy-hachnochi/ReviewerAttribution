This is an informative review (written with the general practitioner in mind) that provides the basic information and rationale for using ITDD for the treatment of cancer pain. I have one major reservation and a few suggestions: 1. Cancer pain can be managed by a variety of practitioners; in the majority of situations it will fall under the purview of the patient’s primary oncologist or a primary care physician, who typically are unfamiliar with ITDDs. It would be very helpful, in my view, to add a paragraph that would outline in more detail when one should start thinking about referring a patient for consideration of ITDD? What criteria does the patient need to meet? E.g. life expectancy? Whom such patients should be referred to? Who will manage the pump after the implantation? How is it going to affect further treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation? What kind of treatment break one can expect? This kind of information is crucial for the treating oncologist. Some of this information is already in the text, however it would be very useful to organize it better and add some more specific and practical information. Perhaps in a form of a table? A few clarifications may be needed: Table 2: - Is Meperidine still used as an opioid in ITDD? Its clinical use, especially in cancer pain, has been basically eliminated. - NMDA receptor – consider adding Methadone. Methadone is an opioid but also has NMDA activity Page 7: - In the US, the commonly used term is “cancer pain”, instead of “carcinoma pain” Marcin Chwistek, MD FAAHPM
