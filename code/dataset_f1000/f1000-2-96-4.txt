This article gives a broad overview of the various types of ITDD systems used in the management of complex cancer pain. It also discusses the advantages, the common side-effects and complications, the technique and cost-effectiveness of using ITDD systems. Overall the article is useful in providing an understanding for doctors and nurses not familiar with the intrathecal drug delivery systems. The article is written at a basic level and although it is useful to beginners and people who are not well versed in ITDD, it does not deliver much to experienced practitioners. I have reservations as I feel that this review article would have been of a higher standard if it was more comprehensive.
