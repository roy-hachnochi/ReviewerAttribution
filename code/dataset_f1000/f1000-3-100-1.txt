This article appropriately addresses both the social system needs for spread using "spread agents" and a core technical need around identifying the common unit or slice that is involved in adoption and spread. This is important information for healthcare professionals to understand. It also explains why a "wave" approach to spread could enhance adoption over the pure diffusion method. The article does not address the "characteristics" of the intervention itself, complexity for example, nor how adaptation to sites that are somewhat different affects the success of spread. I look forward to subsequent publications that may address such topics.
