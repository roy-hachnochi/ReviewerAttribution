 English in abstract I made slight changes - below is the suggested replacement: There are several examples of successes in improving health care. However, many of remain limited to the sites at which they were originally developed. There are fewer examples of successful spread of the improvement more widely in side or outside the health systems within which they were developed. This article discusses a wave-sequence approach to spread or scale up, which enables take up of the improvement in a systematic and sequential way, using spread agents people who participated in the original demonstration sites. The paper also discusses the concept of the of a system which is useful for thinking about spread and considers a phenomenon related to the rate of adoption which we have observed in this wave-sequence approach. The title is appropriate for the article, which is well constructed and clear. The methods used as accepted methods for this type of study, and the analyses adequate. The conclusions appear sensible and balanced.
