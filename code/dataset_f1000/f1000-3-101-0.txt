The author has acted on almost all of the comments we provided and we are happy with the result. The only remaining problem is the following sentence: "It may seem surprising that most mathematical models used in the most mature domains of science do not strictly speaking deserve the label , because they cannot make predictions that are immediately comparable to observed data." In the new context where sin and cos are explained to be computable to any desired precision, the conclusion of non-computability of "most mathematical models" no longer follows. (Data measurements are also of limited precision.) This does not make the sentence false (it is now indeed very surprising), but it probably needs reformulation.
