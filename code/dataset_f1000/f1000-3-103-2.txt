 Arshad et al. present an interesting study on the haemostatic changes seen 1 year after liver transplantation. This is of particular interest to hepatologists, liver surgeons and haemostasiologists alike. The Groningen group clearly show that these patients, even 1 year after transplantation, still have high FVIII, and VWF. However they do recover their anticoagulant proteins, leading to a brisk reduction of thrombin generation upon the addition of thrombomodulin. This is a proof of concept study due to the small number of patients. There is a major confounder, as the authors themselves acknowledge in their introduction, which is the chronic immunosuppression which could be leading this endothelial activation, but nevertheless whatever the cause it looks likely that this is present and might play a part in the post transplant thrombotic events in these patients. Ideally, the authors should specify what Protein C and AT assays they used, i.e. are they activity assays? Another confounder is that some patients were on antiplatelet agents and other were not. It is not clear why the patients still had lower thrombin generation without thrombomodulin. This could be related to the concentration of TF used in the assay. Were the controls age and sex matched? Finally, despite the fact that VWF, FVIII and PAI-1 are still elevated 1 year after transplantation, looking at the TG data, the patients seem to be hypocoagulable with lower Velocity Index, prolonged LT and lower ETP. There is also a seemingly more profound effect of the natural anticoagulants upon addition of TM. So is this still a case of balanced haemostasis?
