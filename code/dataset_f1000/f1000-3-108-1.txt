This is well -presented study reporting an association between cognitive change and levels of the synaptic protein Dynamin1 in post-mortem tissue from the prefrontal cortex of Lewy body dementia patients. There is ongoing debate in the literature as to the respective roles of alpha synuclein, A-beta peptide and tau pathologies in the pathogenesis of Lewy body dementia so it is interesting to see a change of focus to the presumed anatomical basis of breakdown in inter-neuronal communication i.e. synapse loss or dysfunction. The title is appropriate, the abstract provides a fair summary of the study and the methodology is described in sufficient detail. The discussion is well written and the conclusion regarding possible links between deregulation of synaptic proteins and cognitive decline is compelling. Just a couple of comments: In this study DLB and PDD are grouped together under the heading of Lewy body dementias. For those outside the field it would perhaps be useful to provide more detail on the clinical and neuropathological (?) differences between the two conditions. A simple diagram showing the possible functional inter-relationship between Dynamin1 and CaMKII might be useful to help justify the choice of these two markers to look at synaptic function.
