This is an interesting concept paper. It touches upon two timely research problems in invasion science: (i) how to better incorporate the role of humans into invasion theory, and (ii) how to improve the predictability of the abundance of invasive alien species (instead of only occurrence). The key idea of the proposed human release hypothesis seems that land management intensity especially of abandoned or extensively used habitat can explain differences in the abundance of a species between its native and alien ranges because the abundance of the species might be reduced in the native range through more intensive management of such land and associated cutting of the species. This is an interesting idea because it states that the presence of humans and their effects on landscapes can reduce invasion spread in opposition to traditional thinking that sees human land use mainly as a driver of invasions. The authors propose for instance that differences in land management coverage and intensity might explain why Europe is less invaded than regions with a higher proportion of wildlands such as North America or Australia. The argumentation of the article fits also well with recent thinking in biodiversity conservation that emphasizes that permanent conservation intervention will in the future increasingly be necessary to maintain threatened biodiversity and ecosystem services in an era of global change; and that this will require building on synergies with other land use practices (such as weeding through agricultural practices in buffer zones around protected areas).
