This correspondence from the Baylor group accurately summarizes many of the questions surrounding the Vigen et al. article which describes an increased cardiovascular risk profile with testosterone replacement in a highly select group of VA patients. The majority of prior studies have not detected significant increases in cardiovascular risks, except for the randomized TOM trial ( Basaria et al. 2010 NEJM ), which had many of its own issues with "differences detected between the two trial groups possibly...due to chance alone." One key criticism of the Vigen et al. study, described in this correspondence, is that hypogonadism alone may portend adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes and that the T treatment group in this study had lower pre-treatment T values. This issue is most recently highlighted in the JCEM article by Yeap et al . from Australia in 2013 describing older Australian men with reduced mortality when testosterone was in mid-range normal levels. Other issues with the Vigen et al. study include the heterogeneous preparations of testosterone, and varied/unknown compliance with regimens. Only 60% of patients had follow-up testosterone labs after starting therapy which is particularly important since T response differs from regimen to regimen and patient to patient. Additionally for those who had testosterone checked, were they done appropriately in the morning or at other times? Additionally, known mean post-treatment testosterone levels were barely in eugonadal range, further highlighting possible compliance issues. Certainly, additional randomized controlled trials are required to discern whether the findings in this population are generalizable to any other population.
