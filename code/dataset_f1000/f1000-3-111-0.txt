The authors describe a case of respiratory infection leading to ARDS which they suggest is secondary to Mycobacterium abscessus infection. They make this assumption based on the growth of M. abscessus from a tracheal aspirate in addition to the lack of improvement on meropenem, improvement on tigecycline and amikacin and the radiological findings. This is an interesting case however the main issue is that the evidence that M. abscessus is the microbe responsible for the clinical course is unconvincing. A bacterial pneumonia followed by ARDS would be more likely in view of the previous history and timescale, and the radiology is non-specific as detailed by the previous reviewers. In addition the treatment regimen was short and non-standard for M. abscessus pulmonary infection and the response more rapid than would be expected. It appears that M. abscessus was obtained from a single sputum (via tracheal aspirate) sample only which would be insufficient to meet diagnostic criteria for NTM infection. Repeated growths of this organism or a bronchoscopic sample would have been helpful in this case. A history of frequent respiratory tract infections is mentioned. It would be important to know if any samples had been sent for mycobacterial culture previously and in addition the number of subsequent samples post treatment. In its present state we do not feel that the authors have convincingly demonstrated ARDS secondary to M. abscessus lung infection as per the title and would suggest that more evidence would be required before this case report is suitable for indexing.
