This case report on an ARDS probably induced by M. abscessus is an interesting clinical observation and broadens the etiologic spectrum of infections involved in ARDS. The case is in general well described and the discussion addresses the current knowledge and problems with this pathogen. However, the first reviewer Dr. Griffith has already performed a critical review of this paper and has raised strong concerns for acceptance of the diagnosis of an infection by M. abscessus . Dr. Griffith is an outstanding expert in the field of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and I do agree with most of the concerns raised by Dr. Griffith. However, the critical point of the case is whether Pseudomonas was the etiologic pathogen or not: The authors are reporting that after one week of treatment with 3 times 500 mg meropenem daily, the patients clinical findings worsen. - It would be helpful to know the body weight of the patient (sufficient meropenem doses?) and also some biomarkers of inflammation (start of therapy versus day 7), to have some additional objective data for the non-response. It would also be useful to include any data on the control of the trachea flora, concerning bacteria, on day 7. Dr. Griffith has reservations in accepting the relatively fast response to the M. abscessus directed therapy, but even in more localized M. abcessus infections the median time until sputum conversation was only 1 month ( Jeon K et al.; AJRCCM 2009 ). In summary, the authors should give more information to demonstrate that Pseudomonas was not the etiologic pathogen as outlined above. The authors should also make a revision of the paper following all the proposals of Dr. Griffith.
