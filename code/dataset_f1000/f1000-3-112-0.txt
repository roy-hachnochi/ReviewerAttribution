This work registered the disturbance caused by drift ice on benthic intertidal communities in rocky shores of Nova Scotia. The authors documented in real time the ice coverage and the latter disturbance of the intertidal algae and invertebrates. It is recommendable to measure the biomass losses if this phenomenon occurs again in the zone. The observations made here are useful to other researchers working in similar habitats, opening new questions on successional stages and the ecological role of sea ice plays on intertidal community organization of benthic communities in Nova Scotia. I suggest including a map of northern America in Figure 1, and an inset with the location of Nova Scotia and ice drift (actual fig 1).
