 This report from one of the leading institutions in airway management confirms the rapid growth in the use of alternative airway devices, especially video laryngoscopes, but emphasizes that, on one hand, the majority of patients are still intubated using direct laryngoscopy, and, on the other hand, there remains an important role for fiberoptic intubation. The report documents a large number of available alternative airway devices but does not address the issues of how many different devices are required for the potential range of airway issues and how many devices can the standard practitioner be trained to use and maintain competency in their use.
