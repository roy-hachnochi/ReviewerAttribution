This manuscript presents results from multiple experiments identifying and characterizing the interactome of NKX3.1 in immortalized human prostate epithelium (LH) and human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP). The manuscript is well-researched and well-written. This research helps to fulfil an unmet need by the research community, which is to explain the role of NKX3.1 in the prostate epithelium. In that sense, the results are timely. I have only a few comments, questions or points to the authors that need to be addressed. Explain why there are no error bars in Figure 4A? The authors mentioned that they used the package in Bioconductor to preprocess their microarray data. Please indicate the affy package version, Bioconductor version, and R version in the methods. The affy package should be cited in the bibliography with this citation: Gautier, L., Cope, L., Bolstad, B. M., and Irizarry, R. A. 2004. affy---analysis of Affymetrix GeneChip data at the probe level . Bioinformatics 20, 3 (Feb. 2004), 307-315. The authors used a heteroscedastic t-test to infer differences in gene expression in their microarray studies. In the methods, please indicate the multiple testing correction that was applied. In NKX3.1-induced transcriptional program, final paragraph: There are 331 mRNAs changed = 3-fold. But in Pathway analysis , first paragraph, the 3x dataset is 357 genes. Please explain how these datasets are different? Please indicate the kDa ladder on Figure 3B.
