Authors have extensively studied the tumor suppressor function of NKX3.1 using multiple gene expression profiling approaches with validations. Eventually, they have demonstrated the NKX3.1 interactome, which revealed a complex pattern of interactions with DNA damage repair proteins including Ku70, PARP1 and XRCC5 in addition to other transcriptional regulators such as ILF2 and BANF1. To perform their research, they have used recognized approaches for the analysis of the gene expression patterns upon ectopic expression of NKX3.1 in immortalized human prostate epithelial cells with a basal phenotype, which revealed a rapid and extensive re-programming with 158 mRNAs changing higher than 5-fold and 331 mRNAs changing higher than 3-fold. Since the data obtained and presented here is consistent with the previous reports, especially Bowen et al. as well as Erbaykent-Tepedelen et al. , suggest that the NKX3.1-induced gene signature is similar to the gene expression pattern found in early human prostate cancers. Therefore, the data give insights about the requirement of the NKX3.1 as a key driver of luminal cell differentiation, its loss allows luminal cells to dedifferentiate into a state with higher proliferative capacity leading to the increased genetic heterogenity, perhaps augmented by concurrent defects in DNA damage repair pathways.
