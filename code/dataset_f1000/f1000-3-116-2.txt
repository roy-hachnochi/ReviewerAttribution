It is an well-written and informative paper on the topic. The paper underlines the importance of physical expertise on the treatment of OA, combined with an appropriate diet in post-operative situations. Nevertheless I have serious comments on the scientific basis of the review. The review is not performed in line with a scientific accepted methodology regarding systematic reviews. The search terms only are focused on the topic OA and not on methodological terms. There are no in-and exclusion criteria for the papers formulated. Also, there is no quality assessment of the papers regarding methodological quality or a systematically presented evidence synthesis. Therefore the presentation of the results, discussion and the conclusion is difficult to interpret.
