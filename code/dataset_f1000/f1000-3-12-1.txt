The authors provide an interesting study on the detection of CTCs in the blood and ascitic fluid from a patients with advanced epithelial esophageal cancer using CellSearch. The study is innovative in terms of the application of the CellSearch detection for tumor cells in the ascites, nevertheless, it is not surprising that the number of tumor cells in the ascites is by far higher than in the peripheral blood. Moreover, the clinical value of the detection of tumor cells in the ascites is unclear, especially for patients with advanced disease. In future, further investigations which include the characterization of these tumor cells in terms of EMT markers will be necessary.
