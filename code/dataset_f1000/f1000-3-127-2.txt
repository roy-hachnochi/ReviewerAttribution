Title, abstract, study design, methods are adequate. Results are sound. Minor comments: The authors compared PENT with standard nerve conduction studies. The diagnostic criteria for CIM/CIP include clinical testing and muscle biopsy. Please discuss why you have not compared your method to the diagnostic standard. The typical patient populations on ICUs are different from the population of the actual study. Patients are often old, and show a high prevalence of diabetes, alcohol abuse and other medical conditions that predispose to polyneuropathy. This may lead to a lot more false positives when only PENT is performed. Please discuss that. Please speculate how PENT could influence the current standard medical practice.
