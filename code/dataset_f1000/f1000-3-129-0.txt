Thank you for giving me the chance to review this well-written and interesting case report with comment. The authors have made significant efforts to clarify the case, and modify their introduction and discussion points. I approve this manuscript, but I have 2 remaining reservations which I would like the authors to consider: The discussion retains two statements that should be qualified with the word "may" as the evidence for the statements are limited, namely: "Channeled VLs have a number of advantages over those with angulated blades, such as the GlideScope" - They may have advantages, but the evidence remains weak, and is likely dependent (as previously stated by the authors, to device familiarity and availability). "Channeled videolaryngoscopes are more suitable in patients with a limited mouth opening compared to traditional videolaryngoscopes like the GlideScope" - Again, they may have advantages, but the evidence remains weak. Because a device can "fit through the incisor gap" doesnt necessarily mean it performs better when placing a tube into the trachea. Again, I do not wish to hold up the indexing of this interesting case study based on pedantics but I feel we must be careful when providing broad comments that may be falsely reassuring, and lead to incorrect assumptions of the performance of one device of another.
