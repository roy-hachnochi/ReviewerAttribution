Thank you for your case report demonstrating the effectiveness of non-channeled King Vision for DLT intubation in a morbidly obese patient with predicted difficult airway and severely restrictive pulmonary dysfunction. I have a few comments and questions: Was the patient pre-oxygenated enough? Oxygen at 3L/min via a nasal cannula could provide an approximate FiO 2 of only 0.33. How long did it take from the cessation of mask ventilation until the resumption of the mechanical ventilation after intubation? In addition, could you tell me the lowest SpO 2 during intubation? As you mentioned, the patient was easily expected to be exposed to the risk of severe hypoxia due to the morbid obesity and the comorbid pulmonary disease, as well as the predicted difficult airway. Furthermore, the time elapsed for intubation with the non-channeled King Vision would be longer than that with the conventional laryngoscopy or that with the channeled King Vision (Akihisa et al. , 2014) . The effectiveness of the non-channeled King Vision for DLT intubation was well described in this report. To clear the ethical issue, however, please provide the detailed information about the patients safety.
