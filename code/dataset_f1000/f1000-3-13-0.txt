This is an interesting paper which asks some interesting questions. The methodology is well described. The title is appropriate. The abstract should be expanded to make the findings clearer. The main text has a minor problem with the use of abbreviations, this makes the paper hard to read particularly pages 5 and 6. In the introduction there is no mention of other techniques such as micro-CT, ICDAS is just ICDAS not ICDAS II. Page 4: accuracy is not the best method to use to assess the results, as it tends to inflate the results. I think on page 4 1.SWxNFNBC etc could be better explained. The Kappa results on page 5 paragraph 3 might be better presented as a table. The authors should make a stronger explanation of why they believe microradiology is in fact more valid. Perhaps the problems they suggest are present with steriomicroscopy due to training or interpretation issues. They do not mention any training only calibration, these authors must be aware that reproducibility is very different to validity. This issue should be addressed.
