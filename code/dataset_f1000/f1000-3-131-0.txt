I want to thank the authors for their thorough amendments made on their paper. While not every single response is absolutely convincing (at least to me), the overall quality of the paper is clearly above average. Importantly, all study limitations are well discussed or are expected to be implemented in the next revision. Hence, the paper can be considered a good starting point for further investigations and clearly deserves a broad audience. Point 1: Physiological parameters to be assessed may also comprise non-invasively recordable items such as heart rate, core body temperature etc. If using the filament model as one of the more invasive approaches, blood samples can also be easily collected for basic blood chemistry including pH. The state-of-the-art of filament models also includes CBF monitoring (e.g. by Laser Doppler) during ischemia induction. The animal well-being argument is not completely convincing while the missing information are a relevant drawback of the paper and neglecting such information may easily induce a bias. However, such bias is at least partially compensated by randomization and this is the only severe flaw in my mind. Hence, thorough discussion of these limitations is sufficient given the ample high-quality information provided by the paper. Randomization strategy: my comment was rather directed towards the randomization method (e.g. throwing a coin, random generator etc.), but this is a minor point. A clear statement on randomization and blinding strategies is fine. Thanks for adding this. Point 2: Still a flaw, but OK for early exploratory research. The rationales provided in the response should be integrated in the manuscript to their full extent. Point 3 to 5: No additional comments. Point 6: In figure 1 it still reads instead of 0.7.
