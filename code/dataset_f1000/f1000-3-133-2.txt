 This is a very nice explanation of why some Dictyostelium cells do not join into aggregates when the population of cells starves. Many of us have observed this phenomenon, and wondered why this happens. The explanation is that if nutrients suddenly appear while aggregated cells are undergoing development, the non-aggregating cells can immediately begin growth and proliferation, while the aggregated cells have to plod through development and then spore germination before they can start dividing. The authors show both data as well as nice mathematical models of this bet-hedging strategy. One minor correction - in Figure 1A should be . In the future, finding the mechanism that causes a small percentage of cells to not aggregate may shed light into new mechanisms of cell population symmetry-breaking and differentiation.
