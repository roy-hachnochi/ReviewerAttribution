 In this research article, the authors describe the CentiScaPe app for Cytoscape (and its web version FastCentiScaPe) for computing the several centrality parameters in networks, analyzing the elemental level importance of each node in the network, based on network topology. The addition of centralities parameters, especially Bridging Centrality and Eigenvector centrality, appears to be useful to improve metrics, to infer the informational flow across overlapping modules, and as a measure of the influence of a node in a network. The article is well written with an appropriate title and an abstract which provides sufficient details. The description of the purpose, implementation and usage of CentiScaPe app are informative and detailed for the audience. Minor comments: The example of calculating stress in the network of oncogenes in the manuscript should comply with experimental functional relevance, e.g. a decrease in bridging centrality is observed for key intermodular nodes upon heat shock response or oxidative stress, partially disintegrating overlapping modules into local communities which alters the centrality statistics of the nodes 1 , 2 . It would be good to see such implementation in the example showing applicability of CentiScaPe. I suggest the authors have a small example of the analysis comparing connected and disconnected networks, to support computation of centralities for networks with a disconnected component. It would be better to implement a user-friendly exploration of results and user registration feature instead of email authorization, in order to avoid delays in using the web version FastCentiScaPe. Correction in the name of built-in tool i.e. NetworkAnalyzer , instead of "Analyze Network" tool. Usage of appropriate words such as more comprehensive in place of more complete in introduction section. References 1.
