This paper describes the design, implementation and use of GFD-Net, a tool to assess the functional dissimilarity of a gene network and visualize information about the function of each gene in the network. Overall, the paper is well written and provides a sound improvement on quality scoring of inferred gene networks. The abstract and keywords are appropriate and the workflow is clear. The architecture section provides useful information about how the different APIs provided by Cytoscape are use to integrate the app in Cytoscape. Finally, the use cases are well presented, easily reproducible and are a good proof-of-concept for picking most cohesive functions, proving how useful the tool can be by hinting some potential usages of this app in real biological problems. As it is mentioned in the conclusion, I think that GFD-Net full potential can be unveiled by exposing the core algorithm as an API so other apps can use it in order to extract information or as a fitness function.
