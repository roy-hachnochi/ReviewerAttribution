The article describes Cytoscape.js and D3.js exporters and a code template generator. Additionally, it provides all the essential information about Cytoscape.js exporter and D3.js exporters and points interested users to the source code for its implementation. Even though there are a few points that require clarification, the tools are a nice addition to Cytoscape and can be seen as a first step in uniting present day web technologies and the more conventional desktop based visualisation provided by Cytoscape. Improvements â€‹ There is no documentation for the template generator, a README.md file with a few examples will be nice. The D3 example listed in the d3jsexporter page is very small (300 x 150) and the View Source button is not working.
