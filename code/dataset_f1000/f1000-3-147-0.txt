The app described in the article addresses a specific issue with the Cytoscape network visualization tool: drawing of multidimensional data on nodes is currently not possible by default. As such this is a very valuable addition to the Cytoscape app ecosystem. The article is well written but I do have some minor issues that can be considered for further improvement: Minor issue The implementation details are a too technical when an intended audience includes biologists (and might even scare them away). I would suggest to transfer these OSGI specific details to a supplement or add a protocol section before this section with a sample protocol (including installation details). Minor issue The current sample session file included in the supplemental data only contains example nodes. A session file or additional network showing actual data mapped on the gal dataset (as in the figure) would further clarify the actual usage of the app. Minor issue In the conclusions section references to cddApp and NCBI CDD Database are lacking.
