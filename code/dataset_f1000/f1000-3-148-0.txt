 The paper by Gao et. al . describes a Cytoscape app/plugin for cross-database mapping of gene, protein and metabolite identifiers in biological networks. For example, the app can map EntrezGene identifiers to UniProt identifiers for all genes or selected genes in a Cytoscape network. This is an important and useful application that among other application enables the merging of networks obtained from different sources (as shown in demonstration). The app is reasonably user-friendly and intuitive. Most importantly, it does not require any programming knowledge and is accessible via a GUI. I appreciate that it either uses local downloaded files for mapping (for heavy usage) or BridgeDb web services (for smaller networks). The demo in the paper worked flawlessly on my MacBook Air. Potential future improvements may include ortholog mapping e.g. from mouse to human to enable cross-species network analyses.
