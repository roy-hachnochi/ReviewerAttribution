 BridgeDB app provides Cytoscape users and app developers with powerful functionality to address the ID mapping problem in integrative data analysis. App user and command interfaces are well-documented; the workflow is functional and recommended for anyone wishing to learn how to use the app. As a minor suggestion, it would be reassuring to new users if they were able to validate the result of the workflow example in some way. This is a very useful extension of Cytoscape functionality with broad appeal.
