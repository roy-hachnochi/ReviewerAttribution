This short article clearly describes the setsApp plugin for Cytoscape and walks the reader through example analysis. It ends with a useful disclaimer that the goal of the app is to provide users with a simple workflow, rather than completely novel capabilities. The paragraph covering TaskFactory details will probably require multiple passes for readers unfamiliar with Cytoscape internals, but the major point can still be gleaned from the write-up as it stands. Minor issue: It would be easier to read if the Figures were renumbered so that they match the order of discussion in the text; now Figure 1 comes after 2 and 3.
