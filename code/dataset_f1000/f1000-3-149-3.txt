 This manuscript described a new Cytoscape App, named SetsApp. This app provides very simple function about the operations on node or edge sets. It is easy to install, and easy to use. I have only minor suggestions for revision: The operation "difference" on three sets is not well defined. This operation should be disabled when selecting three sets. If a new set has the same name with the old one, there will be a warning. This is good, but when I close the warning, my operation is also closed. It will be more convenient if this app goes back to the window of "Enter a new name for the new set". When importing sets from file: if the parameters are not properly set, the app will import nothing. It will be better if warning information tells users the parameters are not properly used.
