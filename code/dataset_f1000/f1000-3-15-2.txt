This is an interesting paper and is well written. It would definitely help future clinicians who might encounter this rare diagnosis. However I think that for the benefit of these clinicians the authors should include more details on the chemotherapy regimen, including the number of days ifosfamide was administered for and the frequency of the cycle. More details about the surgery and radiation would also be helpful.
