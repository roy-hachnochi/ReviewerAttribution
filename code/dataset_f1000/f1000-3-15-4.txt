This is a very well written article, and I think it makes a positive contribution to our current knowledge of cardiac sarcomas. The authors appropriately mention that these tumors are rare and no standard of care exists. However, this patient in the relapse setting was treated with single agent docetaxel. In phase II trials of soft tissue sarcomas, docetaxel has been used in combination with gemcitabine due to their synergistic effect ( Maki RG et al. , 2007 ). It is unclear why patient was only given docetaxel. It is however very interesting to see that patient responded well to therapy and is stable 18 months post treatment. This article may help guide therapy in these tumors.
