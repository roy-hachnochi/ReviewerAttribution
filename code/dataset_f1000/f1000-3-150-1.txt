 In this paper the authors describe their experience in the porting of PanGIA to Cytoscape 3. The paper aims to: (i) point out to the developers the main tricks and challenges to perform the porting from Cytoscape 2 to 3; (ii) describe the new feature in the last PanGIA plugin. The paper is interesting and it certainly could result in being useful to developers and users. Minor issue: The authors emphasize the novel feature allowing reproducing the results by controlling the seed of the random number generator. This is certainly an important point, however I would reduce the paragraph since it describes really basic programming stuff. On the other hand, I would stress the point that such a seed control should be always available in all the systems using randomization. Furthermore, in the running PanGIA paragraph the description of the seed setting is quite repetitive and should be also reduced.
