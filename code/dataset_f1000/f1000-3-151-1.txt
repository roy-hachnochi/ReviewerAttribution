The paper Cytoscape: the network visualization tool for GenomeSpace workflows describes the GenomeSpace app, a tool that facilitates data analysis in Cytoscape for GenomeSpace users. This is a nice try to bridge two communities: cytoscapers genomespacers. The resources and tools included in GenomeSpace are well presented, and the important data sharing possibility is underlined. At the same time, the extensive app collection of Cytoscape with its multiple analysis possibilities is very short mentioned. This could be maybe extended so that users of GenomeSpace could use Cytoscape not only to visualize their results obtained in GenomeSpace, but also to analyze their data with Cytoscape apps. But this will be probably the topic of another paper. For running the app, the computer should have enough memory, as mentioned in the article. Some GUI adjustments should be done for the different OS, for instance in Ubuntu the login dialog size should be increased, the buttons are not entirely visible at the moment. The new functionality is nicely underlined with icons, but is scattered throughout the menu. To increase the usability/visibility, after the login it would be good e.g. to add also the import/export buttons into the tool bar in top. The app performs well. It remains to the users of both communities to discover the multiple possibilities that this app offers.
