You dont really make the point in the conclusions of the key findings of this excellent work which are: It is now possible to do something quickly that before was tedious and therefore would not be done by anyone, except the most determined and experienced Cytoscape user. It is now possible to do something that could not be done before because you needed to add new functionality. I think it would be clearer that these are the main results if you add the following to the results section: I suggest that you make a before and after video. The before video is the experience of using Cytoscape, manually downloading the data from Wikipathways, failing to see the the nodes because it does not have the DelayedVizProp class etc. Then the after video shows the full experience. The elapsed time of the before video is something like 10 minute while the after video is something like 1 or 2 minutes. This will clearly demonstrate the improvement in the user experience. Please report these time numbers in the text in the results section and possibly summarize the numbers in the abstract. Of course, also post these videos to both F1000Research and Youtube as they represent the primary data of your study.
