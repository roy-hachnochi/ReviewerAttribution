 This paper is well written, clear and to-the-point. The title is appropriate and the abstract provides sufficient clarity and detail. The descriptions of the development, usage, and purpose of the WikiPathways App for Cytoscape are sufficiently detailed and informative for a bioinformatician such as myself. I cannot speak to the sufficiency of the detail of code and programming descriptions, although it seems reasonably complete. Ive tested the App as the authors have described and found it to be easy to install and use with the set of descriptions and instructions provided on the source website and in this paper. All datasets and source code are easily obtainable with the links provided by the authors. I have found one small typo in the network/pathway which I have manually changed at the WikiPathways.org site: the original network referred to the node of a gene product as "PCL", which according to the cited reference and the position in the network is surely meant to represent "Phospholipase C" which has the canonical abbreviation of "PLC", in the citation for the network and in numerous previous studies. Unless I have made this observation in error, I would recommend changing this in the network and associated figures.
