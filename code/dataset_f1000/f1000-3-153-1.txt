 In this paper the authors present the GeneMANIA Cytoscape app. It allows users to construct gene networks from a gene list. The paper is well written and complete. Minor comment: The database contains over 500 million interactions spanning 8 organisms: A. thaliana, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, D. rerio, H. sapiens, M. musculus, R. norvegicus , and S. cerevisiae. It is not clear how this interactions are obtained (literature, other database ...) More details about it would improve the paper.
