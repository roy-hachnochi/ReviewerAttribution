The authors have compiled important information based on both literature review and the analysis of guidelines and medication inserts on the issue of pre-injection aspiration once a needle is inserted in or under the skin. However, the review might be improved by bringing in a more systematic approach in which the results follow the description in the Methodology. That would lead to a consistent and orderly review of the different aspects identified. It is also recommended to include in the introduction a definition of aspiration in the context of the review. Table 2 shows several spelling errors that need to be corrected. On page 6/11 (second column, last paragraph) the sentence . the drawing up of the vaccine or medication into the syringe prior to aspiratio n . erroneously uses the word aspiration where this should be injection. A clear conclusion with feasible recommendations to come to evidence pro or con, or at least a nuancing in the pro and con of pre-injection aspiration would certainly contribute, as this is not really expressed.
