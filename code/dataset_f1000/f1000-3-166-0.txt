The case report: Pneumocephalus after epidural anesthesia is a well written manuscript. The Hypothesis is sound and the originality of the manuscript evident. The report is also relevant to clinical practice, shows appropriate methodology and is properly referenced. However, in the introduction the author states that the development of PC after spinal anesthesia is exceptionally rare - which it is not. I would omit the word exceptionally from the manuscript, as PC is often confused with post dural puncture headache and is often underreported. As the author mentioned in the conclusion section, using loss of resistance to saline instead of air is a way to minimize the incidence of PC. However the author does not expand on which technique is used the most by practitioners and taught in residency programs. Although this case report is hardly the definitive paper on Pneumocephalus after epidural analgesia, it certainly offers guidance and raises awareness on its incidence. From the case report, the author report sudden onset of frontal headache that improved within several minutes. There was no mention in the case report or the discussion on when the epidural catheter was removed and the temporal relationship with the patient occipital headaches. The signs and symptoms of PDPH and PC are the same. Are the symptoms reported by the author the results of PDPH or PC? This has not been made
