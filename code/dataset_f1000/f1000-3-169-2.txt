The link between the immune system and neurogenesis has become increasingly interesting with some papers showing positive and others showing negative effects in health and disease. It is likely that different subsets of immune cells, and different states of activation are in part responsible for these discrepancies. This short paper begins to address the need for detailed examination of these immune cell subsets by showing that systemic adoptive transfer of myelin reactive T17 cells into a mouse model with T cell deficiency rescues proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. This appears to occur without the need for direct cell contact since the majority of mice did not have significant numbers of transplanted T cells in the hippocampus. The decrease in TCRa -/- DG proliferation, though statistically significant, is rather small and one wonders whether these differences would translate into functional differences. Is there also increased neurogenesis? The paper would benefit from additional experiments showing neurogenic changes are paralleled by behavioral changes. Could it be that T17 cells migrated into and then left the DG within the first week after adoptive transfer? What are the kinetics of T cell immigration and emigration into the DG? Did you exclude the animal (Fig. 2E2) with significant T cell infiltration from your analysis? The authors present a hypothesis that T cell derived cytokines affect DG neurogenesis. It would be interesting to examine cytokine receptor levels in TCRa -/- mice. Minor Points: Please spell out TCR the first time it is used. Scull should be "skull.
