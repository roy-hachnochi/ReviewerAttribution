Study design, methods are adequate. Results are generally sound. A few claims are only in part justified by the proposed approach and controls. The importance or relevance of the myelin-specificity/reactivity in the observed promotion of endogenous hippocampal neurogenesis by adoptively transferred CD4 + CD62L high CD25 - FoxP3 GFP- Th17 cells is not fully addressed in this paper. It is in fact quite clear that adoptive transfer of Th17 cells increases BrdU incorporation (and hence proliferation) at the level of the DG of the hippocampus. What is instead much less clear, and only speculated, is that higher proliferation leads to more neurons, and that reactivity to MOG 35-55 (via the expression of the V3.2 chain of the transgenic 2D2 TCR) is indispensable for promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Main comments Newly generated neurons should be quantified. Experiments in Figure 2 and 3 should include also mice adoptively transferred with non-myelin reactive Th17 cells. This is a key aspect of this paper, especially in the perspective of proposing a mechanism of brain homeostasis that is promoted by a specific subset of immune cells acting in periphery (e.g. peripheral lymphoid tissues; as anticipated in the abstract). As such, also experiments in Figure 2B should include the very same positive controls as those in Figure 2A. Ideally, one would like to see at least what is the contribution of the Th17 cell adoptive transfer to the cytokine milieu of the host, both at the level of the DG as well as of peripheral lymphoid tissues. Minor comments Wondering whether it would read better if the characterization of the pattern of expression for cytokine receptors is showed prior to the transfer experiments. Nice to briefly show or comment on the clinical phenotype of that individual mouse showing remarkable accumulation of adoptively transferred Th17 cells in the brain (did it develop EAE-like signs?).
