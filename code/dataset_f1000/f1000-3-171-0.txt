The authors present a case of prolactinoma in a young man. The case is instructive in terms of cabergoline impact upon associated valvulopathy. Few changes are required in order to improve the presentation / educational outcomes of the manuscript. The case is a partial resistant prolactinoma, since prolactin values remained above normal level and required a high CAB dosage after 10 months of treatment. The clinical examination should specify Tanner pubertal stage at initial presentation, since it is mentioned after 2 years of treatment. What was the effect of this treatment on bone age (previously mentioned as delayed)? No data are presented about fertility evaluation / treatment. For a man evaluated between 21-25 years, this might be of importance. Concerning heart evaluation, presented at 4 years after beginning of treatment, the authors should mention if they did heart ultrasound ever before? Some subclinical aspects can be revealed by detailed regular heart evaluation, especially on patients on high doses of Cabergoline. Obviously, alternative treatments should be commented on. First and foremost surgical approach, when the tumor became microadenoma, is a very reasonable way to treat without significant side-effects. The authors should comment on this option.
