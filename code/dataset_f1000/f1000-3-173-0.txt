This paper presents a suite of Web services with which users can design and execute their own workflow for Concept Profile Analysis. The paper includes examples of running the Web services on Taverna workbench. The motivation of promoting the Web services presented in this paper is unclear to me. The abstract says, However, Anni provides no way for users to save their procedures, results, or related provenance. I guess that the authors wrote this sentence in order to explain the advantage of using the Web services over Anni. However, I am not sure whether bioinformaticians prefer the Web services to Anni in their analyses. Some may find Anni more useful than the Web services because Anni was designed to perform pre-defined workflows. For this reason, I am also not sure whether the conclusions are justified sufficiently on the basis of the developed Web services. The impact of this paper would be greater if the authors could explain the sales point(s) of this software (especially to bioinformaticians, real users) more concretely. The explanation of how the Web services work on Taverna workbench is helpful for us to understand what can be achieved by the Web services. However, this paper lacks the comprehensive detail of the Web services, e.g., what kinds of services were implemented, what is the functionality of each service, what is the underlying research technologies for implementing the each service (although software technologies such as Apache Tomcat are explained). These details may be useful for readers to imagine the possible way to integrate the Web services with other tools. Minor comment: It would be better if this paper could introduce Concept Profile Analysis (CPA) with references.
