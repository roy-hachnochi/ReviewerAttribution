Colomb and Brembs reported an important piece of information that highlights large differences in the walking trajectory of six substrains of a wild-type Drosophila strain (Canton S) in the so-called Bridan paradigm. Drawing conclusions from behavioral comparisons of strains could therefore be moot, if the tested strains do not share the same genetic background (at least for the Buridan paradigm). This report is presented in a clear and succinct way. In addition, the authors invite submission of data by other labs, and the addition of these new data will be plotted in Fig. 4. This is an interesting endeavor which nicely uses the function of this journal. One has yet to keep in mind that fly behavior can be dramatically affected by lab conditions (e.g. fly food, rearing conditions), and therefore the new data from other labs might not be comparable to the current dataset. One suggestion for the contributing labs to circumvent this caveat is to use one (or more) of the strains analyzed in this study and to check the reproducibility. In addition, I have a few minor comments that may be addressed: The authors argue that the basis of the behavioral variability is differences in the genetic background, but other reasons (e.g. epigenetic differences) can conceivably contribute to the variability as well. The authors state that there was a significant effect of the replicate on Principal Component 2 (page 3, left column, third line from bottom), but later state that ) sub-strain differences were comparable in the two replicates conducted one year apart (page 5, left column, line 5 from top). Either of the statements should be amended. in stands for analysis. Use instead of PCA analysis. My understanding of PCA is Principal Component Analysis rather than Principle Component Analysis the authors use in the paper. Use PC1, PC2, PC3 in the axes of Fig.2 and Fig. 4.
