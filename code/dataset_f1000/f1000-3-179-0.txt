The authors do not include a phylogenetic perspective of their evolutionary scenario by arguing that for instance insects use glutamate for neuromuscular junctions, while mammals use acetylcholine. Of course neurotransmitters can be co-opted to other types of neurons and contexts, but my point was different: from the existing knowledge, it seems that nervous systems evolved only once (or twice, if the authors of the Ctenophore genome are right) in animals and the conserved use of the various neurotransmitters is part of that argument. If neurotransmitters evolved as signals of their state by secreting toxic metabolic waste products, this should also be the case in animals lacking a nervous system, such as placozoans and sponges. I therefore expected a discussion of the potential role of these compounds in these animals.
