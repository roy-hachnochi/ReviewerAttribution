This is an interesting speculative paper, suggesting a novel explanation for a long-standing question: why are neurotrasmitters toxic? It applies a similar logic and rationale as in the original handicap-principle (and the extended signal selection) to neurotransmitters and their use as signalling system between neurons. As such, it suggests a nice explanation and the authors supply several examples that this approach can help explain. Yet it also suffers from the lack of more conclusive evidence, as many other evolutionary-driven explanations. I would ask the authors to suggest direct predictions that can be tested in an experimental setup, and supply few examples of putative results that might argue against their idea. If such predictions are provided, the paper will be strengthened and would constitute an important idea.
