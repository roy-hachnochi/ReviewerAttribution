Thank you for providing more parts of the data and parts of the code. I had asked for the pipeline, which includes the information on how you got from the input text to the final table. I cannot figure out from your src/ folder how I can run the pieces of code to get your table. There is a README file that lists the required packages, but not their versions. To advantage of the JVM versus non-VM code is that you could have provided simply a copy of the .JAR files to make this easier. There is a directory evaluation/ which seems to contain the main benchmarking function of a few dozen lines, and there are a few scattered main() functions probably called from some script, but I cannot find the script in the source code. Have I missed something? You probably find my comments and my interest in the pipeline too detailed, but I do not expect anyone to document the complete code. It would just be good to be able to reproduce your main table by either running a program or having a README file that tells me what to type to get the input text and how the software arrived at the main table from your paper. Anyone who publishes a mutation finder in the future has to benchmark it and you want them to use your table and rank themselves using your pipeline. Currently, to do this, I have the impression that readers will have to contact you and ask for more details. Is there any reason why you only provide data for the Variome corpus? It seems to me that to reproduce the table, one would need the data for all corpuses? I dont want to delay this manuscript further, and accept it as it is.
