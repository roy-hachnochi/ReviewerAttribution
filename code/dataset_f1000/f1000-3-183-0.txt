In this manuscript, Atarod and colleagues quantify the expression levels of two candidate miRNAs, mir-146-5p and mir-155-5p, starting from either whole blood (WB) or PBMC. Authors employ quantitative real-time PCR to measure candidate miRNA transcripts from the two biological sources. Different procedures were used to extract total RNA from the two sources, which could, at least in part, affect downstream expression analyses. The study is sound and the data are convincing and relevant for appropriate selection of the blood source from which to measure levels of miRNAs of interest. The conclusions reached by the authors indicate poor correspondence in the expression of mir-146-5p and mir-155-5p when comparing WB to PBMC as biological source. The results by Atarod and colleagues are in apparent contrast with those described in a previous study by Mookherjee El-Gabalawy. The reasoning to explain the discrepancy is convincing, and raises important issues related to technical (grade of haemolysis) and methodological aspects (statistical analysis) of the expression analysis that could undermine a correct interpretation of the data. The title is appropriate and data are presented and discussed in a concise and clear fashion. The manuscript has benefited from previous rounds of revision, addressing the main concerns raised by the reviewers. Minor points: Materials and methods section: Sample collection and storage: Authors state that, after purification, PBMCs were stored at -4 C. Is that correct? Or, instead it should read +4C? Authors state PBMC were cryopreserved by re-suspension in freezing solution containing 350 ml of RPMI 1640.. Authors should replace 350 ml with (I suspect) 350l.
