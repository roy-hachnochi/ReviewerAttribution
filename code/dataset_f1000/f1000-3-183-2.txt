This is a very interesting an important study that highlights differences in microRNA expression between whole blood and isolated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). This is of clear importance where as many authors would be using whole blood microRNA expression and then using isolated PBMCs to draw conclusions on their putative targets. There is clear differences between the two due to the fact of other sources of microRNAs in the whole blood including erythrocytes and platelets and the fact that there are also free floating microRNAs in blood also, likely encased in exosomes. This study is technically sound and I particularly like the fact that the authors calculated the qPCR efficiency. The design is also technically sound. I would suggest that the authors include a screen shot of the actual amplification curve of the No Template Control (NTC). This will confirm visually that there is no contamination in the samples with a likely CT value 37. Did the authors after lymphoprep isolation notice any difference in expression of the microRNAs before and after cryopreservation? The cryopreservation medium contains DMSO (although low) and we have found this affects certain microRNA expression patterns. Was there any apparent difference in the levels of the microRNAs correlation with age? I.e. old donors had lower or higher levels of miR-146a because they are immunosenescent (but not diseased)?
