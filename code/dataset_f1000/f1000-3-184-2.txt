This is an interesting study outlining the rising number of treatments of actinic keratoses (AK) and non melanoma skin cancers in Australia. The paper reads well and deals with an important issue. It would be useful to understand whether the increasing number of treated AKs actually corresponds to a decrease of invasive squamous cell carcinomas. If this is not the case, then the burden and cost of AK treatment may be not completely justified. This issue should be shortly addressed in the discussion. Please check in the abstract, results section, "...by 202" should read "2020".
