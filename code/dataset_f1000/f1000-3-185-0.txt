This is a great, easy-to-use, and comprehensive piece of software. I am eager to begin to use it myself and to send it to colleagues who are reluctant to run the other nestedness software. The paper is also very well-written making this field more accessible. As the authors state, many forms of biological data are organized in bipartite networks and show nested pattern. With such a software platform and clear manuscript, I hope more similarities across biological systems will be recognized and appreciated, perhaps even promoting collaborations and new theory. My one suggestion is for the authors to provide a more thorough description of what null models should be used with which data structures, sampling procedures, biological processes, ecs. This would aid the cross-system comparisons and users from finding spurious patterns.
