This article outlines a very interesting approach to using propensity score methods to correct for unmeasured confounding. That was not the aim of the propensity score, and current methods are not able to do this, so it potentially represents a considerable advance. The idea is conceptually a simple one, related to the well-established use of instrumental variables to control for unmeasured confounding. However, I have not come across this idea before, and the author is to be congratulated on his originality. Having said that, I was a little disappointed in the presentation of the method. I do not feel that I am in a position to apply this method to any of my own data. One reason that I took so long over the review was that I wanted to be certain I fully understood the method by applying it myself, but it has become obvious that I will not be able to in a reasonable timescale. Greater precision in the presentation would have been welcome, whether that was explicit mathematical formulae, or simply causal diagrams showing how the various biases arose and which causal paths contributed to which estimates. This has been done very well in some of the references. For example, the relation between bias amplification and 1-R 2 is given a clear mathematical basis in reference 4, and I would regard this as more convincing than simulation evidence. Im sure that the author would agree with me that there is a lot of work to be done on this method before it can be applied routinely. I hope that this paper does spark that research, and that the author gets the credit he deserves for coming up with this potentially very useful idea.
