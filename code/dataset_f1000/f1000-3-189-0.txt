The authors revisions improve the strength and focus of this manuscript. I only have suggestions for minor changes within the text. While mention of the longline component of the survey was removed in the methods section, there is still a reference to it in the first sentence of the results section and in figure 1. My suggestion would be to remove the reference in that first sentence as well as remove Figure 1 altogether. The key part of your paper is that these were caught in higher temperature waters; how the survey was standardized and the location of all of the non-catches is not relevant. I feel like all of the information in the two map figures could be condensed to one if the authors would prefer to keep the non-catch locations in, but I would still recommend removing the longline locations.
