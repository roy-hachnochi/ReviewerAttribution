This is an interesting article that provides additional, detailed behavioral analysis of hippocampal-dependent spatial and contextual learning and memory performance of knock-in mice that are deficient in CaMKII binding to the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptor. The current findings extend those of the authors in Halt et al . (2012) where spaced training over 6 days in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) revealed no deficits in spatial learning but did find significant deficits in consolidation of long-term memory probed several days after training in theses CaMKII binding-deficient GluN2B knock-in mice. Interestingly, here, using a more intense and demanding one day, massed training version of the MWM, the authors now detect modest deficits in these GluN2B knock-in mice, not only in memory probed one day after training, but also in spatial learning measured on the day of training. However, other single day training spatial/contextual learning and memory tests, that are both more aversive but less spatially challenging (contextual fear conditioning) and less aversive but more spatially challenging (Barnes maze), did not reveal any difference in performance between WT and GluN2B knock-in mice. Thus, an important conclusion of this study is that increased postsynaptic targeting of CaMKII and the increased level of LTP (~50%; see Halt et al.) that are achieved through CaMKII binding to GluN2B are only required for spatial learning when the task is both fairly demanding and at least moderately aversive. These findings should give the field a heightened appreciation that highly-compartmentalized regulation of signaling pathways by postsynaptic protein-protein scaffolding interactions, such as achieved through CaMKII binding to GluN2B during LTP-induction, may not be absolutely essential for spatial learning and memory in general but may have evolved to allow animals to specifically sustain optimal spatial learning and memory capabilities even under demanding and stressful circumstances. Overall, the manuscript is very well written and the data are rigorously analyzed and presented clearly.
