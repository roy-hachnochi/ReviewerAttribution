Perdigones and colleagues describe the rare co-occurence in the same patient of two X-linked disorders, one acquired the other inherited, both causing intravascular haemolysis. However how the interaction of the two disorders led to the clinical episode described in the case report is not clear because the temporal analysis of the clinical events and the associated laboratory tests are not presented in sufficient detail. Charting clinical events, labs and therapeutic interventions might make association of the heamolytic episodes with co-trimoxazole or intercurrent infection clearer. It appears that the majority of the PNH clone (in both granulocytes and red cells) is type II, i.e., only partially deficient of GPI. One assumes that this picture was obtained after the haemolytic attack. If so, it could be that type III, i.e., severely deficient RBC were indeed G6PD-deficient. Was flow-cytometry performed after Eculizumab treatment? Eculizumab would protect type III RBC from lysis and thus would allow re-assessment of G6PD activity. Minor points Was anti-CD55 or CD59 was used for flow analysis? The authors state anti-CD55 in methods but describe anti-CD59 in results. Normal ranges of lab tests need to be provided Another factor was that treatment with eculizumab, by inhibiting lysis of PNH red cells may have led to a higher level of PNH (and concomitantly G6PD deficient) red cells than would be present in untreated patients. This statement is rather irrelevant because eculizumab was started after treatment with co-trimoxazole. Need to use Greek characters appropriately, i.e., ul should be ml
