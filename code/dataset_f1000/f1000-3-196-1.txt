Telias et al. report a systematic analysis of intrinsic electrical properties of developing neurons differentiated from pluripotent human embryonic stem cells during neuronal maturation days 23-37 in vitro . Neuronal differentiation was performed by dual SMAD inhibition and differentiated neurons showed mature neuronal morhology. Current clamp recordings showed changes in spike amplitude, frequency and duration and sequential firing of multiple spikes was found by day 37. At the same time a significant increase in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneus synaptic activity could be detected and an augmentation of K + currents. The provides new information about the dynamic development of the electrophysiological properties of neurons differentiated from pluripotent cells. The manuscript is well written and discussed. The title is appropriate for the paper. The methods are sound. The following points need to be addressed: Page 3, the second paragraph; it is not clear how images are indicated (Figure 1B-MAP2, Figure 1C). The figure 4B; Is the difference of frequency between values at day 30 and 37 significant with *? The presentation gives an impression that the difference is more significant.
