 This is a prospective study over a 6 month period to identify the causative factors for delays or cancellations including time of patient arrival in anaesthetic bay, start time of operative procedure, end time of operative procedure, and time of patient leaving theatre. In terms of non-operative time, anaesthetic process comprised the largest part with 8974 minutes (33.4%). Changeover time was approximately 7%. The most common reason for cancellation was lack of surgical fitness, followed by inadequate operative time. This study sheds light for possible reasons of inefficient OR time usage in a certain institution which subsequently led to a change in their logistic planning. Similar studies must be repeated in different institutions in various countries in order to find out the common obstacles as well as possible particular local solutions that speeds up the process.
