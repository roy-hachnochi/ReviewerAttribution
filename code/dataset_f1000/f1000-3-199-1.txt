This paper describes properly the development and features of the software EpiCollect and its new version EpiCollect+. The paper describes in detail how the software works, giving a proper step by step tutorial about how to create a project, use the project, and see the charts and maps related to the collected data. As a suggestion for improving the paper, I would say that: A table comparison between different frameworks/solutions in order to have a clear idea about what makes EpiCollect+ different from other solutions. The paper should address a bit more of the new features of its new HTML5 version, giving a bit more of information about its beta version. In general I recommend this paper to be accepted and indexed.
