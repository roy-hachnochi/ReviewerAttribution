This case report is a classic “suspicious-looking-lesion-in-the-testicle” that is treated by removal and diagnosed definitively only after the fact, based on histology. The care provided was standard. However, besides learning about the existence of the lesion, there is no information in this case report that might help others PREVENT the extreme measure of radical orchiectomy for a benign lesion. What other diagnostic tests could have been done? Why wasn't partial orchiectomy considered in the treatment algorithm? The learning potential of this case is limited.
