Very interesting case report of a young man with delayed puberty and primary testicular failure, with no identifiable known cause. The only thing suspicious on their history was long-term use of methylphenidate, with no identifiable genetic cause found otherwise. The paper talks about the treatment of this patient with testosterone replacement and then reviews the limited animal data on methylphenidate and its effects on spermatogenesis. Of course, as with any case report and retrospective review, it is difficult to say for certain whether this is associated or there is another unknown confounding factor involved, so the authors suggestion that reproductive harm has to be taken into account before giving methylphenidate to children is premature at best. However, this case does highlight the real dearth of information and studies we have on medications that are widely used and their effects on sperm production and reproductive potential. While this drug is so widely prescribed we only have a number of rat studies and a primate study, all of which have limitations in their ability to be generalized to human results. As a result, this is a great case report for generating ideas, and raising the idea that maybe some things we commonly prescribe can cause reproductive effects we are unsure of, but to say there is an association, and then say that methylphenidate should be prescribed less because of this is a bit of a stretch.
