This is an interesting case report that is clearly written and documents an instance in which a persistent and treatment resistant psychotic disorder developed after taking an unknown amount of hallucinogenic and stimulant drugs. This case differs from the typical course of substance induced psychoses in that it did not resolve with abstinence and pharmacotherapy. I have no suggestions for modifications.
