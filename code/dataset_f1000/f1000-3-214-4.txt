The manuscript Scan: In silico alanine scanning mutagenesis for binding site residues in proteinligand complex reports development of a web server for performing in silico alanine scanning mutations for studying protein-small molecule interactions. It further validates the tool by taking a list of already published Alanine scanning data along with the X-ray crystallographic structures of the relevant protein-ligand complexes. ABS-Scan provides a user-friendly web interface and will be very much useful for experimentalists to assess the outcome of mutations designed to study protein-ligand (small molecule) interactions. Overall the web tool is well explained in the manuscript. My main concern is the method for energy calculations, authors used to predict the individual contribution upon mutation. It does not include waters and metals. As it is well established that many of the protein-ligand interactions are water mediated and therefore water plays very important role in determining the specificity as well as affinity. Authors could use energy function which includes waters and metals as well otherwise the current version could only be used for protein-ligand complexes in which water/metal atoms have been shown to play any role in stabilizing the ligand in the binding pocket. Thus in my opinion, I think it could be indexed with inclusion of an updated energy function. Alternatively, its sole applicability for protein-ligand interaction without involvement of solvent molecules should be mentioned in the conclusion.
