In this study, the authors have modeled the duplicated secreted virulence factors of Xylella fastidiosa (LesA, LesB, LesC), based on the closely related LipA protein structure from Xanthomonas oryzae . LesA protein can hydrolyze tributyrin while LesB and LesC cannot, although LesB and LesC both have a catalytic triad (Asp, Ser, His) similar to LesA and LipA. The authors have used a previously developed computational method by their group that suggests mutations based on the spatial and electrostatic properties of the active site residues. In this study, LesA active site was used to suggest mutations in LesB. After the introduction of these mutations, LesB shows activity upon tributyrin. This piece of work is a good example theoretically predicting functionality that can narrow down the search in the sequence space. Comments/ Suggestions: Were tributyrin hydrolysis assays done for LipA and LesA? A comparison would portray the differential effect of mutations. In figure 3(a), the third image was mislabeled as LesBMUT1 instead of LesBMUT2. What does DECAAF stands for? How the spatially equivalent residues were identified which differ in their electrostatic properties? A brief explanation about how this algorithm works would have been better to appreciate the work. The title needs to be changed as it conceptually clashes with Directed evolution used in common parlance, which is experiment based but a black box methodology. Here, they use certain available structural information and hence should not be confused with the above term.
