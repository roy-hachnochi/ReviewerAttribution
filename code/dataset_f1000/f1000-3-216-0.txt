An interesting paper and an introduction to the reviewer of the new methods of analysis of social media. The authors have emphasised the pains that they took to exclude tweets from company and financial sources. The difficulty is that one cannot be certain that what they are analysing is not contaminated by tweets stimulated in some way from particular pharmaceutical companies. There is, of course, a "newness" affect and this explains the frequency of the tweets for Aubagio and Tecfidera. If one excludes Novantrone and Tysabri, then the lowest sentiment scores are for the interferons. What I find remarkable in this report is that the highest mean sentiment score is for Aubagio, a drug which many neurologists would have less enthusiasm for, given problems in its use in patients of childbearing age. Interesting findings and nicely presented paper, but I am still concerned about the source data; are all these tweets from genuine patients?
