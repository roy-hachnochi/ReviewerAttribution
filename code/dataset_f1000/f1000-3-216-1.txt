I found this a very interesting report and feel that as the authors do that this method of analysis may provide a real world window into patient perceptions of treatment, efficacy, and side effects. It would be interesting to assess churn in the twitter responses, for example PML in Tysabri is a major issue to patients and it would be interesting to see how this has trended over time, as the period for which tweets were collected includes the period of time when PML was a major issue (newly described) and would have been a major source of negative sentiment. Similarly for the newer agents it would be interesting to track these findings over time from release date and see whether positivity or negativity changes with patient experience. This type of research will undoubtedly provide significant and important patient focused outcomes for future medication usage and tolerance studies. at considerable cost efficiency. Can the authors look at trending words in these tweets, for example PML in Tecfidera or hair loss for Aubagio?
