The authors provide and interesting study on drug promiscuity. Increasing our understanding of this important topic is of high value for the advancement of drug discovery. The current study investigates drug promiscuity over time, i.e. the number of targets reported for drugs over time. The authors conclude that this number is surprisingly low, if only high quality interactions are considered. The manuscript is well written, scientifically sound, and the analyzed dataset is made publicly available. Some points for minor modifications: When I read the title my first impression was that the manuscript compares the promiscuity of drugs with respect to their release data, e.g. "do more recent drugs show more or less promiscuity than older drugs". I suggest to change the title to better reflect that the release date of the target information is analyzed rather than the release date of the drugs. Page 4, second column: The only definition of the promiscuity rate I found in the manuscript is the following: "The total number of target annotations of a drug represented its promiscuity rate". The Wikipedia definition of a rate is "Rate (mathematics), a specific kind of ratio, in which two measurements are related to each other", therefore it appears to me that another name might better reflect the meaning of the promiscuity rate, e.g. just "promiscuity". On the other hand it is not the promiscuity which is changing: it is the number of identified interactions. Therefore another name might be even better. I did not find an activity cut-off (e.g. 10M?) used for the activities in ChEMBL. Please add this information.
