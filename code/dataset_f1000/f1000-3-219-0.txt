In order to make conclusions about the current consensus on mechanisms involved in the very broad field of aging and energetics (broadly defined as the acquisition, storage and utilization of metabolizable energy by biological organisms), the authors have utilized a novel methodology for determining what researchers regard as the top 40 relevant publications over the period of 2011 through 2013, as ascertained via a broad search algorithm and ranked by the number of citations over that time period. Their analysis of these selected papers provide an interesting selection of some ten overlapping domains, including such old timers as caloric restriction (now more accurately referred to as dietary restriction) and the new star of the field, mTOR signaling. While this approach is an important guidepost to what has been discovered and, more importantly, as revealed by their analysis, what more needs to be done, the authors are encouraged to add an interesting and potentially informative control consisting of the lower 40 most cited papers revealed by their search algorithm. Such an exercise has the potential to reveal highly novel ideas that, perhaps 10 or so years from now, could result in a new flowering of publications that might transform some segments of this exceedingly complicated family of nature-nature interactions.
