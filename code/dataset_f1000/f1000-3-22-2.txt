This is a nicely presented case report of the relatively uncommon condition of congenital elbow dislocation. The authors describe the rationale of management and the surgical technique with clarity. They also provided evidence of follow up. The discussion is nicely written, providing information regarding the background of the condition they treated, putting the reader, who is not a specialist in the field, in the correct context. I approve the articles indexation. Its current version could be further improved if the authors provided clinical pictures of the patients forearm postoperatively in different positions, indicating for example the ability to perform supination/pronation movements (if such photos were available).
