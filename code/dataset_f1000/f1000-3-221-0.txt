This is an interesting article that shows the impact of pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in a highly vulnerable population for influenza complications such as immunocompromised oncohaematological patients. The paper is well written and I would like to make some comments or questions to the authors: Did you observe any difference in time elapsed since the initiation of symptoms between those with community acquired pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) who presented with upper respiratory tract infections and those who presented with pneumonia? Previous vaccination against seasonal influenza showed that some degree of preexisting immunity to pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) strains exists, especially among adults aged 60 years. Have you found any difference in progression from UTRI to pneumonia or to death between those older or younger than 69 years of age?
