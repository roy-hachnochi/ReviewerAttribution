This is an excellent review of the literature on creatine. I think that it would benefit from more discussion on possible side effects or toxicology. There are a number of review articles that discuss both the benefits and potential toxicology that could be included. Overall the article is well written and a comprehensive review of the literature. It is interesting that such diverse effects are being seen in a wide range of degenerative diseases.
