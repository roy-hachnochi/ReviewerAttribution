This is a useful paper insofar as it seems to indicate that a short-term administration of ketamine does not improve postoperative pain control. The evidence in the literature is contradictory and more data is needed. Study Design Type of surgery and anesthetic technique were homogenous. The exclusion of prior chronic pain syndromes or use of pain medication also helps make the study population more homogeneous, although I would question whether there might be some added benefit of ketamine in patients who are taking chronic opioids. I wish the authors briefly gave the results of their pilot study, especially the standard deviation that was used to calculate the sample size. As the authors say in their discussion, 0.5 mg/kg ketamine is a relatively low dose. With a t 1/2 of 10 -15 min and an active metabolite that has 1/3 efficacy and also a relatively short t 1/2 of 2.5 h, it is questionable whether the objective of modulating the NMDA receptor response was achieved, and that is probably why there was no benefit of the ketamine administration. Maybe the authors should consider repeating the study using a ketamine infusion. Second, the administration of a continuous postoperative morphine infusion of 0.015 mg/kg/h may have created some "background noise" and obscured a difference in VAS score or difference in the amount of self-administered morphine. Article content The study is well conducted. Data is complete and well analyzed. The discussion is well conducted and addresses the study rationale, findings, and main limitations. There are a few typos: remifentanil, succinylcholine, psychotomimetic.
