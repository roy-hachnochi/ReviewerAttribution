This is a well-written review that addresses some of the key considerations in the diagnosis and treatment of ET. The authors are right to emphasize the importance of a bone marrow biopsy in diagnosis, as it is important to exclude early PMF, which can have a different disease trajectory. In addition, practitioners should also be aware of the disproportionately high rates of splanchnic vein or mesenteric thromboses, which can be a presenting symptom in these patients and should prompt clinicians to search for MPNs.
