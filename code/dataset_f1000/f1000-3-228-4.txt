In A novel mouse of creatine transporter deficiency the authors describe the phenotype of a new knockout mouse for Slc6a8 gene which is associated with a depletion in the levels of creatine in diverse organs. This phenotype is reminiscent of the CCDS1 symptomatology, therefore the main output of the present report is an increase in the number of available murine models for this disorder as claimed in the article. The paper is well written and the work is well presented, with no major concerns regarding the data as shown. Nonetheless, I miss a more complete behavioural analysis. In some cases this is not crucial because assessment of particular tasks is expected to support current findings (absence of anxiety in the open field or impaired spatial working memory in the Y-maze) although with the strength of using more dedicated paradigms (elevated plus maze or T-maze based on a rewarding system, respectively). However, it is more relevant in the case of motor and neuromuscular deficits to enhance the conclusions obtained from spontaneous activity measurements, and other approaches (accelerating rotarod, grip strength, vertical pole, etc. to put some examples) may be more informative.
