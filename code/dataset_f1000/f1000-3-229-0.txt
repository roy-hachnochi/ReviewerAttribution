In this letter, the authors describe an alternative explanation of [ 18 F]T807 PET findings in patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). A striking article by Mitsis et al. (2014) has suggested the potential usefulness of tau PET imaging for the early detection of tau deposits in patients with CTE. The authors of the letter state that tracer signals in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus might be the result of nonspecific retention of [ 18 F]T807. However, the amount of hippocampal [ 18 F]T807 retention (SUVR 1.45) was considerably higher than the values that have been previously reported in healthy controls, suggesting the involvement of the hippocampus in this patient. It is important to confirm whether the hippocampal [ 18 F]T807 retention was within normal age-appropriate levels or whether it reflected CTE tau lesions in this case. Furthermore, the current findings should be confirmed by postmortem examinations in the future.
