I thank the authors for considering all of the remarks, it was a pleasure to read the revised manuscript which, I believe, is improved. Albeit I believe this is a valuable report, I am unsure that the figures highlight the message. My (last) suggestion is use a trellis chart: if time is on the abscissa axis, and the three individual measurements (BGA, Pediasat, cNIRS) on the ordinate axis, than this should result in 10 boxes, each box showing all measurements per patient along time. I believe it will become obvious to the reader that the Pediasat measurement becomes unreliable after 8 hours, and requires calibration.
