I have read with pleasure the article by Dr Ricci and colleagues. The topic is of high interest, since SvO 2 measurements represent standard monitoring in the postoperative management of several pediatric cardiac procedures. Also, ScvO 2 is nowadays an accepted surrogate measurement of SvO 2 . Significant differences have been reported between continuous fiberoptic measurements and intermittent measurements in adults with cardiac surgery ( Baulig et al., 2008 ), requiring repeated calibration of the continuous measurement instrument. The findings here suggest a requirement for calibration every 8hrs, albeit the population is too small to allow for conclusions. I believe there is a bias in the statistical analysis, since correlations have been estimated between repeated measurements as a matter of fact, there is a temporal autocorrelation between the results of a same patient at different time points. However, this bias should result in overestimation of the relationship. The negative result concerning ScvO 2 -BGA correlation is somewhat by this bias. But one can question about the positive NIRS-BGA correlation. I understand that the population is too small to calculate correlations at each time point, or to analyse data using a mixed model for repeated measurement. Therefore, I suggest presenting the results in Figure 1 and Figure 3 separately for each patient, showing on the same graph the BGA, ScvO 2 and NIRS measurements, and allow for visual assessment of the relationship in each patient at each time point. This should reassure the reader about the potential bias due to temporal autocorrelation. Since the correlation between ScvO 2 -BGA is negative, and since the authors do not demonstrate but only suggest a positive correlation between NIRS-BGA, this should be acceptable.
