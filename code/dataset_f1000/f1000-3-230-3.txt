The manuscript aims to address the role of the proteasomal activity in aging and health span, using Podospora anserina as a model organism. The authors show that gene expression and protein abundance of proteasome subunits and proteasome assembly factor remain stable during aging and oxidative stress. The authors used strains overexpressing the catalytic proteasome subunits PaPRE2 and PaPRE3 to increase proteasomal activity, but found no difference in lifespan, suggesting that proteasome activity does not affect lifespan. The study would benefit by including proteasomal activity controls to confirm activity increase. This is particularly relevant since the positive effect of the proteasome in lifespan, senescence and healthspan has been convincingly demonstrated in other systems. The authors suggest that the reporter they use, GFP-Cl1, is processed by the autophagic machinery. It would be interesting to examine whether overexpression of this construct causes aggregation of GFP which in turn triggers autophagy that subsequently clears the aggregates which cannot be cleared by the proteasome. As the authors state in their discussion toxic aggregates could be formed and this possibility should be experimentally evaluated. For instance the authors should evaluate whether ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation) takes place, since accumulation of protein aggregates could initiate ER stress and ERAD. It is known that under various stress conditions proteasomal activity is enhanced. Perhaps the authors should try other conditions in addition to oxidative stress (ER stress, heat stress etc.).
