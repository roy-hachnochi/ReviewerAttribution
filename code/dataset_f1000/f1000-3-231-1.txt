Numerous studies have identified variation at the TERT-CLPTM1L locus in conferring an increased risk of many different cancer types. Here the authors have examined the genetic architecture of the TERT-CLPTM1L locus using sequence data from the 1000 genomes project. Given the potential significance of this locus, this type of work is important as it has the potential to identify functional variants that might not have been uncovered with the various GWAS undertaken to identify risk variants. Thus far none of the risk variants identified at this locus with GWAS results in non-synonymous protein changes, however this study provides data to indicate that some of these variants may be associated with regulatory sequences and chromatin marks. This study also identified 26 variants that result in non-synonymous protein changes in the hTERT or the CLPTM1L genes. This is a well written manuscript and the conclusions are appropriately backed up by the data provided. The title is appropriate and the abstract adequately summarises the article. Overall this manuscript provides useful information that that will underpin future work to establish the importance of this locus in conferring cancer risk. I have no major criticisms of this work; however I recommend that a more rigorous statistical review, than I am able to provide, is undertaken of this manuscript.
