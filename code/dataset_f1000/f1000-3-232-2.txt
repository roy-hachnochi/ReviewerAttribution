This opinion article gives Dr Voskuils view on commercial antibodies and how researchers can make best use of them and potentially avoid a lot of frustration at the bench. He bases his opinions on his extensive experience of commercial antibodies gained during his time as Chief Scientific Officer of Everest Biotech. The article is wide ranging and gives many useful pieces of advice that I hope will help researchers and prompt some interesting discussion. I was pleased to see the fact that many suppliers will offer the same antibody (OEM) and the fact that properly citing antibodies is important, were both covered. One area that could have been covered in more detail is that the three dimensional structure of the epitope is important, both when the antibody is raised and in the applications that are being carried out, for example denaturing conditions in western blotting and native folding in IPs. However, no article can cover everything and this one is already wide ranging, so I dont think it is an essential correction. There were a few small issues that could be corrected/changed if a revised version is produced. I would have thought tween-20 should be referred to as a detergent rather than non-polar? In table 1, reduce the lysate this could be clearer, does it mean add the reducing agent just before loading or reducing the amount of lysate? page 5, to put it simple should read to put it simply Given this is an opinion article, it might be good to have a box summarizing Dr Voskuils experience (which is extensive) to explain to readers why he is qualified to provide the commentary.
