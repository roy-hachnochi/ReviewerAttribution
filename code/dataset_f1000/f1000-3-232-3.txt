Apart from research funding, difficulties in finding good research antibodies is probably one of most limiting and disabling factors in life science research. The opinion article by Dr. Voskuil contributes with important insight into the research antibody industry. In particular, I think that most scientists are unaware of the reselling and relabeling of commercial antibodies that apparently is common practice in the industry. The article also meticulously puts forward a set of guidelines for validating the use of research antibodies, which are of broad interest to the scientific community. It was a pleasure to read and I recommend it for indexation.
