This is an interesting and informative paper on the concept of PAINS (pan-assay interference compounds), compounds that have apparent activity in multiple assays, but in fact produce false signals due to non-specific interactions or interference with the assays. As indicated by Baell and Walters (2014) in a recent commentary, PAINS can lead to confusion and wasted resources. In this paper, Bajorath points out that promiscuity, one of the characteristics of PAINS, can also be due to the ability of small molecules to specifically interact with multiple targets, which provides the molecular basis of This paper highlights the difficulties that may be encountered in distinguishing between these two possibilities.
