The authors of this study should be praised for approaching the matter of behavioural fatigue from such a refreshing angle. As such, their experience was an innovative activity. Technically, the paper is well written, although I feel that perhaps the initial sections focusing on evidence regarding hand hygiene campaigns was too long, considering the overall extension of the paper. Likewise, the authors may have been able to benefit related from including some existing evidence from other fields related to overcoming behavioural fatigue. Whilst the authors indicate that their intervention managed to increase compliance in 2 areas from 10% in 2012 (mentioned in " ...improvement was noted in all the 19 clinical areas except for two where together there was a decline in compliance from 42% to 10% ") to 95% in June 2014, it would have been extremely useful to see the decay rate of such boost (I accept that the authors highlight as a limitation of their paper the need to see the longer term impact of their intervention, but I feel that as the problem they tried to solve was related to compliance fatigue, we would have benefited from examining how well their initiative fared). But these suggestions should not impact on the merit of the paper, which is showcasing an innovative approach focused on maintaining engagement with desired hand hygiene behaviours.
