The changes made to this manuscript improve its quality. However, the experiment added to independently validate the ability of qACE to quantitatively assess the levels of target cleavage by miRNA is not appropriate, involving a published experiment that analyzed distinct plant materials relative to this qACE analysis (Arabidopsis vs soybean). A true validation experiment should involve an alternative method such as Northern blot analysis to analyze the relative abundance of full length RNA and cleavage products within the same RNA preparations that were used to obtain the qACE data reported here.
