 Technical comments: The that the method can reliably quantify miRNA target cleavage products is based on inferences from previous reports - that increased cleavage is expected when the corresponding miRNA is over-expressed, and that reduced cleavage is to be seen in miRNA biosynthetic mutants such as hen1 . An adequate validation should however include an independent methodology, such as regular northern blots for miRNA targets. This is easily done when choosing targets that are reasonably stable. Quantification of the resulting bands (full length and cleaved) will serve as an independent proof of concept. It would be helpful to add a couple of words during the results section about the design of qACE primers and to what extent they require optimisation (overlap adapter/target). Sort of a guideline. Also, the RCT value should be explained a bit better during the results section. Stability of miRNA target cleavage products is an issue - sometimes they are easily detected, sometimes they are not. This is mentioned in the discussion, but should come up before as it is a major point of consideration for the design of the experiments. Materials and Methods: What tissues were used for RT experiments? Which primers were used to over-express miR164 in soybean? Other: I somewhat disagree with the statement quantification of the extent of regulation of specific target genes by miRNA is crucial for proper understanding of their biological roles. To investigate the biological roles of miRNAs, quantifying (and spatially/temporally visualising) target protein levels is very important. Quantifying the extent of miRNA-directed cleavage contributing to target protein levels are however very interesting for mechanistic studies of miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Sentences are sometimes phrased very generally. Since miRNA-directed cleavage is not a main issue in animals, can come up already in the beginning of sentences.
