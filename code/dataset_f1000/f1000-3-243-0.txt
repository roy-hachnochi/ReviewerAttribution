This observation article is very well written in a format that is accessible to both general and specialist audience. It describes some novel observations about malaria infection rates in different vector species in Guinea-Bissau. In particular it reports the some how unexpected high infection rates in Anopheles melas and A. pharoensis , thus suggesting Plasmodium falciparum -malaria transmission potential outside of protection (i.e. bed nets). Details about the circumstances of the finding and evidence of the observation are properly provided. The manuscript appropriately cites relevant bibliography in the field. Figures and tables are informative and helpful. Methods section is well organized and nicely descriptive. As observational article it looks perfectly adequate to the journal purpose. I have only a very minor concern: in the Introduction (line 8) Plasmodium malaria should be re-written as Plasmodium malariae .
