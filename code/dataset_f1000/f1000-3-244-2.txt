This article, by Howatt et al. validates an antibody to ARID1A in murine FFPE samples, is a good example of the correct validations procedures that must be met when validating an antibody for use in tissue sections. Issues are relatively minor: What was the rationale for a starting concentration of 1g/ml for initial validations? There is a focal region of the KO epithelium which clearly appears to be positive. The authors would need to explain this. Can the authors please add more discussion of the nature of the staining of the stromal cells. Do they consider this to be non-specific? Is such staining of stroma present in human tissue sections? Control slides, omitting primary antibody, were carried out during the cell line phase of the experiments. Were such slides run on the murine tissue sections and can the results be included in the data. I note that the stromal staining was still present at selected concentration of 0.5g/ml (dataset f)
