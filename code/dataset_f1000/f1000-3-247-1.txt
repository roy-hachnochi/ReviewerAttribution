This study is an interesting first approach to understanding the factors that affect the ability to recruit sessile benthic organisms after disturbances in an intertidal community. Petzold and Scrosati address the issue concerning the role of larval supply and its relation to phytoplankton abundance, which leads directly to considering that a bottom up mechanism may be acting in these communities. Furthermore, the idea that began the work is clearly stated and the theoretical context is appropriate, as well as the statistical treatment of the data. Although a more deep and permanent approach to the problem requires the carrying out of further studies, perhaps with the incorporation of field experiments, this initial statement is correct and I recommend its indexing.
