Software technical notes are useful contributions to the literature and the state of the art but difficult to review. One ends up assessing the functionality of the software and how readily it can be used for the purpose intended. Does it afford a useful extension to the state of the art, or can it mislead? Can it be readily implemented in workflows or websites (in this case). In general this is a very welcome contribution. The software is easy to incorporate and provides a useful way to visualise sequence alignments. Having said that, there are minor quibbles, the most serious of which is the display of dotted residues. This is of interest where there are a few specific changes and makes them very easy to spot. However, the implementation in this software appears to be somewhat counter-intuitive. The usual method is for differences to a consensus to be shown, with sequences that are identical represented by the dots. In the implementation in the paper, the dots refer to it being the same as the residue above, where all the meaning is lost if colour is not shown. That is somewhat of a caveat emptor , but care should be taken to ensure that such a representation matches the convention expected by the user. It would be useful also to include some form of export for a visualisation, either through a direct export or through integration with a more powerful package such as Jalview. In summary it is a useful tool for representation of short alignments and as such will no doubt find utility, I can certainly see uses for it.
