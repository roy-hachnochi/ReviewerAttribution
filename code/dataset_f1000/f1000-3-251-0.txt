This publication is scientifically sound and has potential utility for those interested in identifying possible target binding sites and for molecular modification studies e.g. site directed mutagenesis. It would also have been useful to test other computational methods besides PAGAL or even describe the pros/cons of these. Could they be used in consensus to improve predictions? Perhaps the authors can comment on this. I would clarify that our docking and pharmacophore computations (Ekins et al ref) only suggests FDA drugs chloroquine/ amodiaquine may bind VP35. It is clear from the x-ray structures in the PDB that several drug-like molecules can bind. We also have yet to verify our predictions but thank you for citing this. This study does make you wonder too what else could be done computationally for Ebola research, what should be most helpful for drug discovery? Probably a logical step might be to identify potential binding locations on the alpha helices for small molecules and possibly dock compounds at these sites. The authors clearly describe their approach and present results which can be tested by them or others in future. With limited published scientific knowledge on the Ebola virus it is important that such computational approaches are used.
