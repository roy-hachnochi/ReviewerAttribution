The authors suggest that they can identify alpha helices and predict their propensities to be targeted by small molecules. Their test case is the small Ebola virus genome, where several crystal structures are available. First they compute the hydrophobic moment of identified helices with their previously published program PAGAL and classify them based on hydrophobicity, positive or negative charges. They conclude that helices with unique feature values are involved in host protein interaction. Page 4: It is not correct to state that this helix is disrupted by a neutralizing antibody derived from a human survivor . HR1 or helix 1 from Gp2 is split into 4 small helices in the native GP structure and antibody binding prevents its refolding into the post fusion conformation represented by the Gp2 structure. Now one can argue that small molecules could interfere with the formation of the triple stranded coiled coil formed by HR1 in the post fusion structure. This needs to be clarified in the text. Next they identified a charged helix in Vps24 that interacts with karyopherin. Why was this chosen? Because of the available structure? This helix contains only two charged residues and would not fall under the classification of carrying a high charge! The third helices described in detail are from Vps35 and the authors identify several helices with carry charges, but no clear targets are discussed. Page 6: The authors make a connection between the number of acidic residues in a helix from Ebola Vps35 compared to Marburg Vps35 and the frequency of outbreaks, which is a complete over interpretation of their data. In summary the manuscript describes an interesting approach to identify or validate potential drug targets. However, the authors need to be more cautious in interpreting their results. Without any experimental validation their approach to link helical properties to protein interaction propensities is extremely weak.
