This is an interesting paper, and as stated, it would be useful to see the methodology repeated on larger datasets to increase the power. One small point - the authors say that their inability to find an acute increase of gastrointestinal events in the first-treatment time window may be attributable to insensitivity of claims-based coding to identify symptoms of gastrointestinal disturbance. Could this also be because they were only looking for the outcome as a primary diagnosis, and GI disturbance may be consider less important? Would it have been possible to use prescribing of certain therapeutic agents as a proxy of GI events
