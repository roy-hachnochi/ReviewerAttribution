Overall Comments: This study explored methods for evaluating ADRs in claims data using an example of effects of AChEIs treatment on Dementia patients. Overall, the study is very well done. However, there are a few issues that need to be clarified as following: While identifying patients with first incident course of AChEI therapy, did the authors apply any criteria for dosage, strength, or duration of the incident treatment? What was the index date for the treated group? The authors explicitly refer to the index date for the untreated group, but not for the treated group. Why did the authors choose "death" as one of the outcomes? Was it based on any prior evidence in the case of AChEI therapy? On page 5, in the last paragraph of left panel, I am not sure what exactly the authors are trying to say in the following sentence: "Clinical endpoints were intended to measure increased health care utilization associated with specific diagnoses." It may be helpful to clarify it. The authors have done well to balance measured confounding by using propensity score methods. However, there may also unmeasured (unobserved) confounding in clinical settings that may have implications for some of the results (e.g. the inability to find some of the ADRs). In future studies, methods to control for unobserved confounding (e.g. instrumental variables) may also be used. While discussing (page 11) reasons for inconsistencies in the results from the two study designs, the authors speculate that their "inability to find an acute increase of gastrointestinal events in the first-treatment time window may be attributable to insensitivity of claims-based coding to identify symptoms of gastrointestinal disturbance." The authors attribute similar reason for failing to find evidence of psychological disturbances. It would be helpful if the authors could provide an example of insensitivity of claims-based coding to identify symptoms in a disease state.
