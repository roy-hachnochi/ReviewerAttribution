The manuscript is thorough, and uses an array of approaches to tackle the issue of the regulation of SNCA expression, an issue that regrettably has received little attention, despite its obvious importance. This analysis will undoubtedly be very helpful to the scientific community. We have some minor comments: For the in silico analysis with MatInspector they used the two elements with the highest activity in the luciferase assay (the I12 and D6). However in Figure 2 the D3 element had even higher activity and was not used in the analysis. Explain why? For the luciferase experiments they measured the luciferase activity after 24 hrs after transfection. Why so early? Did they check later time points? Usually 36-40 hrs are necessary for pGL3 vectors. Regarding the possible involvement of GR in SNCA expression, it may be worthwhile referencing the paper by Park et al. (2013) .
