The histology of the lymph node in Kikuchis disease can usually be easily differentiated from most known infectious conditions in the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy, but not from that seen in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Even if we accept the histological diagnosis based on lymph node pathology, this does not necessarily explain the whole clinical picture if other more probable diagnoses have not been ruled out. Beyond the fact that the child fulfilled four of the American Rheumatism Association (ARA) diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), they tested positive for anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, which are highly specific for SLE. The diagnosis of superior vena cava syndrome was based on clinical manifestations (dyspnea, facial puffiness, throbbing headache and venous congestion of the head and neck region with conjunctival congestion). However, chest CT was not performed. Considering the fact that the child was definitely suffering by cardiac tamponade, which could also be manifested with dyspnea and congestion of face veins, I am not persuaded about the co-existence of SVC obstruction. In this specific clinical text this diagnosis should have been confirmed by chest CT. In conclusion, after reading this case I was rather convinced that it was a case of SLE complicated by cardiac tamponade, effectively responding to corticosteroid treatment.
