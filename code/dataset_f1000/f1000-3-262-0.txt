The paper suffers from one principal weakness, all other concerns being met. The author has significantly improved the quality of the manuscript by the addition of extra data and also modifying parts of the manuscript. As was pointed, the author needs to provide some data with regard to the precision of the docking procedure. The lack of this information remains the only lacuna in the manuscript. The author could consider taking crystal structures two homologous proteins complexed with the same ligand. One of the proteins could be homology modeled using the other as a template and the ligand docked by DOCLASP. This computaionally modeled protein could then be superposed onto the crystal structure and the RMSD calculated between the ligand atoms from the in silico model and the experimentally derived crystal structure.
