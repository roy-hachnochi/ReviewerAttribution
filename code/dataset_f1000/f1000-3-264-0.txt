This article describes the molecular characterization of the diversity of PorA, fHbp, NadA and NHBA vaccine antigens in 31 serogroup W Neisseria meningitidis strains (21 carriage and 10 disease strains, isolated from Ghana and Burkina Faso between 2003 and 2009). The article is clear and well written and provides information to help guide vaccine development for serogroup W meningococcal disease in these countries. Some comments and questions include: Only 10 serogroup W disease isolates were investigated. How many serogroup W cases were there in this region between 2003-2009, and how many have there been post MenAfriVac implementation in 2010? Is there any reason to expect a change in serogroup W epidemiology post MenAfriVac implementation, given that the total number of serogroup W cases has increased, as well as the variability of meningococcal epidemiology? It is stated that a stop codon was identified among over half of the nhbA genes sequenced and was associated with a lack of expression of NHBA protein. Where is the premature stop codon located in the subset of nhba genes ? Was expression examined by Western blot? I could not access sequence data from the file Supplemental file. Sequencing analysis of fHbp , porA , nhbA and nadA genes from serogroup W strains.
