The manuscript titled "Safety, efficacy and utility of methods of transferring adhesive and cohesive Escherichia coli cells to microplates to avoid aerosols" by Bryan Ericksen reports a safer method for transferring certain strains of E.coli. Though this report may generate some interest the E.coli community, this paper will lack the diverse readership. Being a very focused Method paper, it is good to seek journals which reports methods. As the load of microorganisms are very different in different countries, to adapt this technique for any lab will not be possible. It is good to have a lab standard using this technique and it will be restricted to that lab. Finally this entire concept is very qualitative.
