 General comments Osteomyelitis of right clavicle in an imuunocompetent individual is a rare entity that too by an opportunistic bacterium like Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Here the authors report osteomyelitis of medial end of clavicle caused by P. aeruginosa in an immunocompetent individual with IgA nephropathy. The case is interesting and it highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis of such cases and initiation of appropriate antibiotics. Specific comments It is not clear if the patient had any history of trauma or any invasive procedure on clavicle? Ultra sound guided aspiration was done in another hospital that did not yield any bacterial growth. Could infection by P. aeruginosa be iatrogenic because of earlier aspiration procedure? P. aeruginosa was found sensitive to cefoperazone and sulbactum but what about the sensitivity to other antibiotics. Authors should provide the antibiotic profile of the isolate. Could it be possible that IgA nephropathy and marked renal failure led to immunosuppressed state precipitating osteomyelitis?
