Two very recent landmark large-scale studies show that loss-of-function mutations in APOC3 are associated with lower levels of plasma triglycerides, and carriers of these mutations have a reduced risk of coronary heart disease in European and African individuals. Tang et al . performed a timely replication study in 4,470 Chinese individuals. Unexpectedly, no loss-of-function mutations identified in the European and African populations were found in the Chinese population. This important study not only highlights the difference in genetic susceptibility to cardiovascular disease in different ethnic populations, but also suggests that APOC3 variants are not applicable to the Chinese population to predict risk for ischemic vascular disease. APOC3 may still be an important regulator of lipid metabolism in Chinese, and novel variants of this gene remain to be identified in this ethnic population. Consequently, the authors need to change their conclusion from Therefore, APOC3 may not be an ideal predictor for risk of ischemic vascular disease in the Chinese population to Therefore, APOC3 variants identified in the European and African population may not be an ideal predictor for risk of ischemic vascular disease in the Chinese population.
