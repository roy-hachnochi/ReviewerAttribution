I think this article makes many good points, and I also agree with the other critiques. However, I do see danger in full transparency. The problem is that significance of study can be subjective and used in a biased way to sway readers towards a view of greater importance, in order to achieve a good standing with the authors. At this point in time, it is important for editors of other non-transparent journals to remind reviewers of the key aspects of this oath to critically read the paper and make constructive comments as best as they can. Editors need to use their power to delete inappropriate reviews or reviewers.
