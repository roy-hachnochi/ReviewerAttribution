Data sharing is critical for decreasing duplicated work and increasing the possibility of comparative analyses. Researchers and practitioners will be able to develop diverse thinking and design appropriate collaborations based upon existing data. Data sharing will also allow others to validate one anothers discoveries so as to encourage research accountability and transparency. Stuart Lawson and Ben Meghreblian made a great effort to open their data on the subject of journal subscription expenditure. Their research design for collecting such data looks sound. People can expect to examine their data and make possible comparisons across libraries. While using their data, one needs to be aware that journal subscriptions are very complicated in library practices. Many variables may potentially affect the pricing and make comparisons tricky. Furthermore, their published data are aggregated, preventing users from drilling down through detailed numbers. However, it is a good start. We look forward to reading more data published for free access.
