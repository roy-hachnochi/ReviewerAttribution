The authors have collected a set of data that is likely to be very useful both to researchers who investigate journal pricing and to librarians who want to know more about what others are paying when they make their own bargains with publishers. The methods of collection seem sound and the work appears to be carefully done. There is one thing that I would like to see clarified. The report states the amounts that are paid to each publisher, but do not make it clear whether all of the reported institutions are buying the same thing from the publishers. For example, Elsevier markets a "Freedom package" which includes a published list of journals constituting most, but not all, of the journals they publish. They also market a "Complete package" which does not include the entire Freedom package, but basically a set of journals to which the university has previously subscribed. Elsevier also separately markets the Cell Press journals, a "clinical medicine package", a series of monographs called "advances in ...." Some of the contract totals that I have seen include all or some of these. Similarly, Springer sells not only its journal package, but also a large number of textbooks and monographs. Some libraries total expenditure with Springer may include these. It would be good to know if your totals are just for the journal bundle. With some of the other publishers, it also is not entirely clear whether the totals reported are from libraries that do not subscribe to the publishers entire journal bundle but only to some limited subset. Once again, it would be good to have this clarified.
