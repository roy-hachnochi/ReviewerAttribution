The paper by Caminsky et al. is a welcome and timely review of the complexities of pre-mRNA splicing, the relationship between splicing mutations, detection thereof by IT and/or laboratory, and new challenges posed by next generation sequencing. It is a rather lengthy and somewhat intimidating review, and I can imagine that many readers, even interested ones, may not make it all the way to the end, certainly not in one session. On the other hand, the review paper is likely to reside on the desk of molecular laboratory directors and and other genetics professionals with an interest in the molecular aspects of genetics. The review is well written, and the order to topics discussed is logical. Maybe the introduction to splicing is a little short, e.g. little space is dedicated to discussing the spliceosome. The review of the various splice software, and the technology underlying these was in depth. The relationship between IT predicting splice mutations and laboratory studies to confirm the actual results of aberrant splicing was very well done, and the discussion of NMD and other causes of technical issues relating to demonstrating mutant mRNA resulting from splicing mutations was delightful. The discussion about laboratory standards (also related to ACMG recommendations) regarding splicing was excellent. Lastly, the discussion of the impact of splicing mutations and IT in the era of large datasets, including NGS was concise and accurate. In summary, this review ought to be mandatory reading for all genetics professionals in molecular laboratories, incl. those involved in whole exome/genome sequencing. The figures were well-selected, and the tables were helpful. One minor remark: I would mention PLP1 as the gene associated with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (p6, R, middle para).
