The authors have addressed points #1 and 4 from my previous review, but the following issues remain. 2. The paper still needs copy editing to reflect standard written English. The last 2 sentences of the Introduction provide an example. Comma placement: Do the authors mean that video game play reduces Internet use, or do they mean that MPH is given for both ADHD and video game play? "found reduce" - "found to reduce" Here is one potential way to edit the last sentence (insertions marked with bold; deletions marked with underline and subscript). "Despite the risk of Internet addiction , we hypothesize that good use of these new technologies can be useful to develop as new methods of cognitive training useful in to treat ADHD an d Internet addiction." 3a. The exercises comprising "ADHD Trainer" are not described in any detail beyond listing the categories of mental functioning that each task is thought to reflect. For instance, what task is used for "Attention"? Has this implementation of the task been validated elsewhere, or adapted with unpublished modifications from a published task? And so on for each of the categories listed in the Table. 3b. As with any method, the authors need to provide some kind of information about where the reader can obtain "ADHD Trainer". I have one additional comment that I forgot to add to the previous review. 5. The authors should acknowledge, perhaps in Conclusion, that behavioral interventions other than ADHD Trainer itself may account in part or in whole for the clinical improvement. Other interventions the child received include the following. "The patient was only allowed to play with" ADHD Trainer. "The patient had to use the app every day at the same time." The patient had to meet "the other targets that were assigned in therapy" including a "progressive reduction in the number of hours to play other games" and limiting other game play to once a week.
