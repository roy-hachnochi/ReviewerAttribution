This is an interesting case report on the usefulness of cognitive computer training for a child who is diagnosed with ADHD and concurrent videogame addiction. The rationale for the study, methods and findings are fine but I would like to make some additional comments. First, the usefulness of treatment of ADHD and internet addiction by using methylphenidate was reported by Han D et al., 2009 , please add it to the introduction. Second, what evidence have you got that the child is not addicted to the educational game? Third, 4 hours of play of a videogame post-treatment is still a lot, this should be mentioned as a limitation. Fourth, why were the Conners ratings after treatment for parents and teachers lower compared with pre-treatment? Fifth, the authors should be commended for the use of advanced computer games for treatment for ADHD. There are other tools for this purpose that are worthwhile mentioning such as ONTRAC ( Mishra et al., 2013 ) and the game reported by Prins PJ et al ., 2011.
