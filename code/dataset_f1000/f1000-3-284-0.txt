I think this is a controversial area whereby it is not possible to evaluate the effectiveness of PRP specifically on the patients improvement in symptoms. We all have patients who respond in some way to a change in treatment, behaviour or management which do not work again when trialed. There are too many confounding factors here that make this observation uncertain, for example the patient could have got better without treatment, the needling could have caused the site to bleed and the clotting could have healed the defect, fluid injected itself could have caused it to heal, the US scan is not confirmation of neotendon as organised scar can have similar appearances and a biopsy would have to be performed to confirm. Many different possibilities exists that without proper study and experimental design means that this is an interesting observation which may be biased and incorrect. Based on the literature published in this field to date, it cannot be supported to change clinical practice without a proper randomised control study based on significantly higher patient numbers. I know that this practice goes on in many sports clinics at much financial gain to independent practicing sports clinicians.
