The author presented the outcome of one case of tendon healing, followed for one year, after PRP injection. First I would like to comment on the terminology. "Tenotomy" may be a misleading term. Tenontomy means "cutting a tendon". Is this what the author did? Or just an injection. This needs clarification. Furthermore, one cannot prove that it was the PRP that aided tendon healing, or the injection itself. Thee are various good quality randomized studies that showed no difference in the outcomes of PRP versus placebo injections. These should be cited in the discussion. A single case is not even indicative of the effectiveness of PRP. In theory PRPs may have anti-inflammatory and reparative properties, may have shown "promising" results in the lab, but their clinical effectiveness is questioned and controversial. Taking into consideration that their use is financially beneficial to doctors and the industry, their use cannot be widespread, unless good quality evidence is available.
