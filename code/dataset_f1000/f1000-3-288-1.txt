The authors describe their studies of the effects of UV-irradiation on the expression of beta defensin on human neonatal foreskins treated and cultured in vivo . After finding variable responses between donors which did not correlate with skin phototype, they investigated the possibility that beta defensin expression was affected by culture conditions. They found that there were no differences between mock- and UV-irradiated samples. We have seen similar changes in genes of interest in the mock-treated tissues using ex vivo skin cultures. This study is valuable in that it highlights the need to include proper controls in this system. I have several additional minor comments to make about the manuscript and data: The protocol for mRNA isolation notes that tissue is ground in trizol and RNA is purified from the aqueous layer. There will not be two layers until chloroform is added and this should be included in the protocol. Figure 1 claims to represent degree of skin pigmentation +/- SEM but there are no error bars. The qPCR data shows Ct values as high as 32.9 for beta defensin, with almost all of the time=0 samples above 29. Many qPCR assays are not linear in this range. Did the authors do an examination of the performance of their primers in this range? Although these high Ct values make me a little skeptical about the absolute values of the fold change reported in figures 2 and 5, I am nevertheless persuaded that the differences between mock- and UV-treated samples is negligible as the authors conclude.
