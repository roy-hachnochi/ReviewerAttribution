The authors attempt to establish a skin explant model to investigate the effect of UV exposure on the expression levels of b-defensin 3, an antimicrobial peptide that also binds to Melanocortin 1 receptor and attenuates downstream signaling. They find extensive variability in the expression levels of b-defensin 3 in the UV-induced samples and cannot demonstrate that is in in fact up-regulated. They do show some minor increase in b-defensin 3 expression over time that is independent of UV irradiation and suggest that this may be due to a wound healing response to the skin excision process. The authors should have included in their analysis a few more genes known to be upregulated after UV exposure (for example, MC1R) both in keratinocytes and melanocytes. This way, they would have been able to define whether their culture system was improper to study b-defensin3 regulation specifically. In the mock irradiated experiment they should have also looked at levels of IL1 and TNFalpha to support their hypothesis that b-defensin 3 increases as a result of a wound healing response. In the paper by Glaser et al ( 2009 ) where b-defensin 3 was reported to be up-regulated after UV exposure, the authors used explants of adult skin. Is it possible that newborn and adult skin (perhaps based on the anatomy or level of cellular differentiation) respond differently to UV exposure that could explain the disparate results?
