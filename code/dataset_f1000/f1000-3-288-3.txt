The study by Horell and DOrazio aimed at addressing the production of BD3, a MC1R antagonist, in neonatal human foreskins, using skin explants, and its possible regulation by UV irradiation. The authors did not find a correlation between the pigmentary status of the skin and BD3 production, or a consistent effect of UV radiation. However, they noted altered production of BD3 over time in the skin explants, which they attributed to a wound repair-like reaction, or to inadequate culture conditions for the skin explants. They concluded that the use of foreskins in organotypic culture is not an appropriate model to assess BD3 production. It is not clear from the report exactly how the skin explants were maintained for the duration of the experiments. Were they maintained in a humidified incubator at 37C? Was the culture medium changed daily? Obviously, the culture conditions can affect the viability of the explants. Did the authors check on the viability of the skin, especially at the end of the experiment (e.g. by examining the histology after HE staining)? This is important, and the "health" of the skin can explain the erratic production of BD3. If the viability of the skin is compromised, this will have a generalized effect on its metabolic state. Since IL-1 is known to stimulate BD3 expression, did the authors check the levels of IL-1, particularly after UV exposure? If the change in BD3 production is due to a wound healing-like response, the authors might have to consider cutting the foreskins into equal parts at the beginning of the experiment, to avoid taking biopsies at different time points. It could very well be that the experimental conditions are responsible for the unexpected results that were obtained. So the conclusion that using foreskin explants is not an appropriate model might not be necessarily true. I suggest that the authors submit this report as a "methodology" report, after investigating the concerns raised above.
