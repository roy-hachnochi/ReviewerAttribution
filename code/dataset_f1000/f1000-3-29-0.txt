This short research paper presents the results of a survey of wildlife reintroduction practitioners. The paper is well-written and the results have relevance to future studies, but I suggest several revisions to further improve the paper. In the Summary, the authors state that the results provide insight into areas of conservation leadership and management, although the article really only focuses on reintroduction programs specifically. There are many ongoing discussions in the wider conservation management arena about leadership and evaluation of success and it might be important to give the paper some more context in relation to those ongoing discussions (e.g. by referring to Black Groombridge 2010 Conservation Biology, several publications related to the CMP Open Standards http://www.conservationmeasures.org/initiatives/standards-for-project-management , Manolis et al. 2009 Conservation Biology ). Also, further discussion on what sorts of responses to other questions resulted in a perception of "success" in a given program would greatly strengthen the claims of the paper. To do this the authors could add a correlation analysis among variables, or, perhaps the authors could detail a few case examples? Minor comments: In the Methods, it is stated that the survey was sent to practitioners worldwide, but of the 17% that responded, was there bias in terms of the countries respondents represented? A bit more elaboration on the potential of bias in the survey results (both geographic and other kinds of bias) would strengthen the paper. It would be very informative for future studies to include the survey instrument itself as an appendix. Table 1. It might be more informative if values in this table were represented as percentages or proportions to better illustrate the claims in the discussion section about how partnerships are "very limited" or "very few" with businesses or other reintroduction programs.
