This is an interesting short note that addresses a useful question. While it is true that environmental factors play a key role in limiting the success of reintroduction programmes, management and leadership factors could also be an important issue. This note sought information on this issue through a survey of people involved in reintroduction programmes. I think the two key conclusions from this survey are useful, that there is a lack of long-term experience amongst those undertaking reintroduction programmes, and that there is a lack of formal evaluations of these programmes. This latter point also links to the observation that there is a lack of linkages between different organisations and different reintroduction programmes. There were, however, some issues that I felt did require further attention: I was unclear what the focus of the survey was - was it just in the USA or was it wider? This should be clarified. Was there a bias in the responses in that perhaps only those that had been involved with more successful reintroduction programmes responded? The survey results indicate success rates of around 60% which is much higher than the 26-32% cited in the Objectives section. This should be discussed further. I would also have liked to have seen more discussion in the conclusions on how the results of this survey might be used. How might these results be taken up and used to improve future re-introduction programmes? I also felt that the paper had too many figures and wondered if some of these could be removed with just the key results presented in the text (or perhaps tabulated). I thought the abstract was a good summary of the article, but was unclear what the difference is between extirpation and extinction.
