This is a very interesting investigation on protein ligand interaction in iNOS. It is well written and informative. It should be indexed, and requires only minor revisions. p.6 text: In substrate free iNOSoxy-CO, recombination is already maximal at 4 K and extends to ~70 K. What does this mean? What is a maximal recombination? Suggestion: there is already substantial recombination at 4 K and the process extends to 70 K. p. 6 text: A population transfer between photoproduct states due to CO rotation 32,51,52 is apparent from the mirror-imaged dashed and solid contours at 2131 and 2144 cm-1 at 12 K. Just write a sentence or two why that is so. The non-expert reader should not read the literature for this. Figure 3, caption: there is a mix-up with panel numbers. The case for a 5C and the 4C (naked) heme is well made. This is a very interesting result and merits closer investigation by X-ray structure determination.
