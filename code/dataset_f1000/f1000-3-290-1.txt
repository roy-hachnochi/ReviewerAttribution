It is investigated how ligands NO and CO dissociate and bind to inducible nitric oxide synthase. The applied method is FTIR difference spectroscopy, in particular low temperature temperature derivative spectroscopy, most appropriate to elucidate details of the process. The binding route has been clarified and compared to related ligand binding heme proteins. The results are important in characterizing the enzyme. As I understand, the task of the referee is primarily to judge the soundness, the technical quality of the work. There is absolutely no problem in this respect: the method is appropriate, executed perfectly, the conclusions are well supported. I suggest indexing without any modification.
