I read the paper of Qinyi Xu et al. entitled "Countries Biomedical Publications and Attraction Scores" with great interest. Authors evaluated biomedical publications of all countries based on the PubMed and performed great job on different criteria to assess changes during different time periods based on the country of affiliation of the first authors especially during the five-year time period of 2008-2012 versus 2003-2007. The study is an addition to the literature and fruitful. I would recommend reading the paper to all medical scientists in the world. However, there are some concerns. PubMed is not the only search engine to be evaluated. There are other valuable sources such as ISI, Embase and Scopus which may change the results of the study. We would know that there are many journals indexed in the above-mentioned search engines especially written in the developing countries. On the other hand, quantity evaluation does not show the real scientific situation of the countries. I myself prefer the citation without self-citation for the best index of quality assessment. Other indices such as H-index reveal the mixture of quantity and quality assessment. The affiliation of the first author is acceptable, but not ideal to show the comprehensive situation of the countries. All authors affiliation or at least first and corresponding authors affiliations are better replacement in the future studies. Authors mentioned that they reported original articles. Therefore, they deleted reviews. However, I would recommend not deleting the review articles unless simultaneously deleting letters and correspondences.
