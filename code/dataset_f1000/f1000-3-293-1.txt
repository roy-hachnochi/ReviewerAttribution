The authors have extended prior clinical observations of RPE rings associated with resolution of sub retinal neovascularization in young patients and now find 3 unusual cases of similar findings in patients with AMD. These findings represent astute clinical observations and the combination with possible cellular pathophysiology and potential implications for treating AMD make this a worthy manuscript for consideration. The title and abstract are appropriate, the writing is clear and succinct, and the observations will be of use in the field. In my own observations I concur that the presence of RPE rings is a likely correlate of CNV regression.
