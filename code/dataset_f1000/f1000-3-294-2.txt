In their Research article "Characterization of the truncated hemoglobin THB1 from protein extracts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ", Johnson Lecomte describe the structural properties of a truncated globin, purified by traditional biochemical approaches, from the extracts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with the aim to correlate the recombinant protein previously studied by biophysical techniques with the protein expressed in its native environment. The report is comprehensive and up to date and will certainly become a key reference in the field. The topic is of interest to many readers and to my knowledge has not been covered by many articles. This article highlights the similarities and differences between recombinant protein over-expressed in Escherichia coli and native protein. Although extensive research has been conducted to investigate the physiological function of truncated globins, knowledge of their functional role is limited by the lack of facile methods for in vivo studies. Consequently, the most telling insights into the physiological role of these proteins have arisen via classical approach on the recombinant protein. As the authors note, potential correlation between recombinant and native proteins may help to formulate plausible mechanisms for the function of these globins, and this is a particularly interesting highlight of this work. The paper is short but very well written, with a balanced view of the literature and makes for interesting reading. I have no comments to offer as to how to improve the paper and recommend indexing as is.
