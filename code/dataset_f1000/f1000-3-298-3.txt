This is a descriptive paper analyzing pH fluctuations in the tissue culture media for the micropropagation of Douglas fir, and assessing the effect of MES, a commonly used compound in tissue culture media, for stabilizing media pH. Parameters such as the effect of incubation time (days) and dark/light in the presence or absence of MES were studied, in addition to the morphology of explant (buds) in MES + or - media. As expected, MES was found to be useful in stabilizing pH in different conditions and therefore recommended for the Douglas fir micropropagation media. This paper could be useful to the horticulturists, especially those working on micropropagation; though, the findings of this paper, in my opinion, are common knowledge in the field of tissue culture. I have one major criticism on the experimental design and data analysis, which compels me to approve this paper with reservations: only one concentration, 2 g/L, of MES was used throughout this study. No reasoning was presented towards selection of this particular concentration. MES is used in many tissue culture media at different concentrations. While the authors shy away from making any conclusions (regarding the role of MES), they suggest MES played a role in stabilizing pH. This conclusion cannot be substantiated without a dose-response curve and determination of optimum concentration. A minor criticism that I have is related to description in materials and methods. The tissue culture media used through out this study is simply referred by the acronym, mDCR. But no description of this media given is given, only reference provided. Whether it is MS/B5/N6 based media is not clear from this paper, and which other compounds are present in this media is not described.
