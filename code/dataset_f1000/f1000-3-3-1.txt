Dr. Desai has written an article regarding novel ways to increase the number of unfilled Nephrology fellowship positions. This is a well written piece by an author who has a track record of interest and research in this area. His paper is timely, coming at a point where interest in the specialty is at an all-time low, and new ideas are sorely needed. Specifically regarding his ideas: Combined critical care fellowships: this seems a good idea on the face of it. However, do we have any evidence that trainees want to pursue a combined fellowship like this? Programs exiting the match: While this will certainly help some programs, it is not realistic that competitive programs would ever consider this. I personally think this is a good idea, as having been trained abroad where fellowship is longer I can see advantages to increased experience before exiting training. However, trainees on the most part would likely not be keen on this, and it may further decrease interest. Decrease the number of positions. We certainly want quality applicants and it is not in anybody's interest to have substandard candidates getting positions just because there is a lack of demand. However this does not address the fundamental problem of why trainees are not choosing Nephrology. Overall, this is a well written and thought-out article coming at a time of critical need for innovation to publicise Nephrology to trainees. While not everybody (including this reviewer) will agree with all the ideas in the paper, we need outside-the box thinking and innovative ideas so the editorial is welcome.
