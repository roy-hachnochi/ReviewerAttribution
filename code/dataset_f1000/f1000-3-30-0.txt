The authors addressed post-fire nutrient availability in a subtropical forest. They found that the forest wildfire resulted in a significant loss of most soil nutrients. Throughout the whole manuscript, however, the authors mainly described the results rather than mechanisms. In fact, there was lack of direct evidence to explain their findings. They pointed out that very few studies have evaluated post-fire effects on soil micro-nutrients, but did not show why they did this work. "very few" may mean that this work is not important, or it has been very clear. Hence, the major concerns are related to the novelty and the mechanism explanations. Others: I am a little curious that the abstract mainly described the results without conclusion. In the "site description", 3.99 mm for mean annual precipitation? Table 1, please show the sampling time, and better to unify the unit (e.g. N and P). The authors mentioned element contents (such as SOC),the term "content" means stock. So it is better to show the responses of total soil nutrient stocks to fire for the whole soil layers. Repeated-measure ANOVA can be used to examine the overall fire effects on soil nutrient dynamics over the study period.
