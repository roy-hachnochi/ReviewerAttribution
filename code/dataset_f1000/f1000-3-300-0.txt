Readers of this opinion piece will appreciate its ability to locate and reflect on much of the recent literature dealing with the extent and perceived impact of scientists outreach behaviors. That literature gives social media only a glancing blow, so the authors are correct to note that we know little about scientists use of social media and about perceived and actual outcomes of such use. We do know that social media use is growing among scientists, and mainstream empirical studies - which typically generate snapshots in time that wont become available in published form for months (or years) - will have a hard time staying on the front edge of such changes. McClain and Neeleys analysis leads me to suggest that scholars pay particular attention to the impacts of social media outreach on scientists careers. While we know that rendering ones research publicly visible via such traditional means as mass media stories has a salutary impact on the number of citations to that work in the peer-reviewed literature, we are just beginning to track the impact of scientists "unmediated" signaling via tweets, blogs posts, etc. Some recent work found that TED talks did not appear to make much of a difference. But a very recent article in Journalism Mass Communication Quarterly ( Liang et al ., 2014 ) did find that, among a sample of nanoscientists, tweeting was associated with more frequent interactions with reporters and other non-scientists and that those interactions were then linked to enhanced scientific impact. I would implore the authors to "step away" from the acronyms. SOSM (science outreach via social media) deserves a quick burial. As is the case with so many acronyms, it obfuscates rather than clarifies.
