We are happy to see that our comments have been considered to be useful to the authors and appreciate the additional experimentation that was carried out in response to one of our comments. We do realize, of course, that molecular modeling by itself would not provide definitive answers to the working hypotheses put forward by the authors in relation to the binding pockets of AaegOBP1. Moreover, given that modeling is not an area of in-depth expertise for the specific group and that solid answers may eventually only come through X-ray crystallography, we feel that the authors have exhausted their capability to interpret fully their carefully documented observations. We would therefore encourage them to pursue a future investigation on this very interesting matter in collaboration with another relevant group. At the same time, we approve the indexing of the paper in its revised form.
