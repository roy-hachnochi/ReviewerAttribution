The study is well conducted. The data support the conclusions. We don`t know anything about the long-term results. For this issue it is necessary to perform long-term studies. L-Arginine supplement was used in sport, but its positive effects on it are not sure 1 . Plasma nitrite levels were elevated compared to placebo during acute supplement in 5 km runners. We don`t know the long-term effects in patients with diabetes or patients with CAD over the years. But some cited studies in this well conducted study are promising. I think, because of the financial problems we dont will have a well performed double blinded long-term study in the future. It is therefore quite beneficial to have a well conducted study, especially about possible adverse effects. It is interesting that lowering of blood pressure showed negative effects, but maybe the underlying mechanism in patients with metabolic syndrome might lead to other effects. If it is possible, it would be necessary to get a grant for a long-term study, because the adverse effects are low and possible positive effects might be significant. The problem is that physical activity and healthy life style in general is more important as all supplements. There is a great desire in patients for taking supplements or pills as a solution for their problems and diseases, because then there is no need for an individually effort of the patient itself. I think it is important to mention this. Further studies should be carried out comparing the effects of supplementation of L-Arginine and physical activity in patients. But we have to start somewhere with research and this study is one of the first well conducted and transparent studies. It would be nice if the author can discuss the problem physical activity 2 /life style 3 and supplements in the discussion section. Socioeconomic differences might play a greater role as supplement with L-Arginine 4 . References 1.

The conclusions presented are justified based on the results, and the data provided is sufficient.
