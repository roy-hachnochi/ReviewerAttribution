In teleosts, the pallial telencephalon undergoes eversion during its development rather than the more common evagination that occurs in other vertebrates. These differing modes of morphogenesis have made it difficult to resolve homologies between pallial domains in teleosts and other vertebrates. This paper describes the pallial expression of zebrafish orthologues of genes that have helped to define pallial sub-domains in other vertebrates. The methods are clearly described, the data are of high quality and the discussion of results are balanced and informative. The authors acknowledge the limitations of using gene expression patterns and suggest additional experimental approaches that could be used to address the validity of hypotheses raised in the discussion of the data. There is a great deal of information of use for comparative neuroanatomy studies and some observations challenge current models of teleost telencephalic organisation. The expression analyses suggest that pallial sub-divisions show considerable variation from rostral to caudal telencephalon and it will be interesting to study how such organisation arises during development. I have no revisions that I consider to be essential. I think that Monica Flogueiras concern about the summary figure potentially being misleading could most simply be addressed by adding a question mark after the suggested homology term.
