The third version of the paper from Middelveen et al. , "Culture and identification of Borrelia spirochetes in human vaginal and seminal secretions" represents a well designed and nicely executed study strongly supported by multiple results that were obtained by three independent laboratories. The impact of the presented data is significant as it highlights the alternative way of the distribution of the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto spirochetes, rather than the traditionally accepted vector-borne way. The well balanced study presents the cultivation of live and replicating spirochetes from genital secretions, confirming the possibility of person-to-person transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes. Supported by multiple techniques, the obtained results are clear, consistent and confirming. The authors do not bring the conclusion or speculate that spirochetes transmitted from person-to-person might trigger Lyme disease in humans, as this postulation needs to be deeply studied. However, confirmation of the fact that live Borrelia are present in semen and vaginal secretions of patients with Lyme disease and can be cultured in active and replicating form from them is the first and significant step in analysis of person-to-person transmission of the causative agent of Lyme disease. This may be one of the reasonable explanations of the increased numbers of confirmed cases of Lyme disease worldwide, in addition to the others that are not discovered yet.
