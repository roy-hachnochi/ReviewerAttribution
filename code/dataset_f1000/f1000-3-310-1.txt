First of all, let me congratulate the team on a case report that is well written and a patient that was well managed. This report again highlights the fact that displaced clavicular fractures can lead to vascular complications, either thrombotic or bleed. These complications may lead to greater morbidity or even a life threatening event. It needs a high index of suspicion to recognize these injuries, more so because timely intervention may save someones limb or life. The authors have recognized the injury early and managed it aptly. Endovascular repair of vessel injury is now standard of care with sophisticated stents and procedural advances. Subclavian artery dissection with thrombosis in the false lumen has been managed as per evidence base.
