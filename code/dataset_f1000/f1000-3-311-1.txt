The overall technical implementation of the software appears to be sound. I am not familiar with arthropod marking and tracking methods, thus the article could be improved by briefly outlining these methods in the introduction as to better align with the purpose/design of the Ant-App-DB. The paper does adequately explain methods and provides description of the underlying software framework through the use of figures and descriptions. There are some issues that the authors need to address before indexing: "dot Net framework" = .NET Framework Figure 4 caption needs to be reviewed as it has several typos "Figure 2(b), Figure 2(c) etc..." Figure 7 is difficult to read. It may be better to print on an entire page. What is "(S-Figure 2li)" pg. 10 The discussion reads as a rough draft as there are several run-on sentences and typos. For example, "Several of Ant-App-DBs features compare favorably with other currently available solutions........ efficient insect monitoring such as 2-8 ." Is not a good style. Providing some examples of how these systems all compare would strengthen this discussion. see pg. 12. The authors need to be careful with their subjective statements such as "Moreover, Ant-App-DB is more user friendly that (typo) other applications....." See critique #5. A more thorough review of existing systems is really needed if you are going to make these statements. pg. 12.
