This case report does an excellent job of highlighting the deceptive nature of LNVUC and the clinical importance of early detection. This aggressive and rare subtype of urothelial cancer can very easily be mis-diagnosed as a low-grade urothelial tumour. The article identifies the key demographic risk factors seen in LNVUC (male, heavy smoker, age- approx 60yrs) and highlights the clinical factors that point towards an aggressive pathology (upper tract dilatation, rapid regrowth). Early recognition is vital in allowing prompt radical treatment. In our unit we have also had a very similar case of a bladder tumour which on resection was found to contain discohesive nests of invasive urothelial carcinoma. This patient also underwent radical cystectomy and final histology confirmed T3 disease. As LNVUC can cause a diagnostic dilemma, we would be interested to learn if any immunohistochemical studies were carried out and what these showed.
