Nested variant of UC is indeed rarely reported. It is however, not certain whether the actual incidence is low or it is less frequently recognized. The estimated incidence is 0.3% ( Hong et al., 2007 ). Authors have correctly recognized the disparity in clinical parameters (Significant exposure, 40 pack year history, industrial exposure, large bladder growth and obstructive uropathy) with the pathology indicating low grade cancer (pTa LG).Most of the recognized clinical indicators of nested variant including male gender, age above 50 years, ureteral obstruction and cystoscopy showing tumor slightly raised and erythematous or nodular were present in this case. I have few queries on which i request the authors to comments Tumor is known to have aggressive behavior, however, growth in 4 weeks needing 90 minute resection is rather surprising. Were any cold cup deep biopsies taken at the time of initial resection in view of the significant clinical findings of aggressive UC. Were biopsies from the bladder neck, prostatic fossa or para collicular area taken at the time of initial resection.
