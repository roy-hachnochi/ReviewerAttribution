This report describes a 5-month-old patient with rare Gollop-Wolfgang Complex (GWC) disorder. The patient exhibits typical phenotypes of GWC disease, such as ectrodactylyl of the hand and bifurcation of the femur. The etiology of GWC remains unknown. However, the patients parents are second degree relatives, and other reports have described GWC patients in consanguineous families, suggesting that this disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The manuscript is well-written, and I suggest it is indexed in current form.
