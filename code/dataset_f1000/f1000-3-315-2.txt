I fully agree with the first reviewerss comments. This paper deserves indexing as it is a very rare disorder. However, the following sentence (in the discussion) should be deleted: "This type of skeletal dysplasia with limb deficiencies could be the result of spontaneous gene mutations and chronic exposure to a toxic substance or infectious agents that results in the disruption of normal skeletal development." The main conclusion of this report should be that the occurrence of Gollop-Wolfgang in a consanguineous family brings further arguments to support autosomal recessive inheritance.
