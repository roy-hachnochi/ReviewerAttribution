This report describes a child with a typical presentation of Wolfgang-Gollop complex. The eitiology of this condition is still in doubt although some familial recurrences suggest a genetic cause. The statement in the abstract that a spontaneous mutation is possible owing to parental consanguinity does not make sense and should be deleted. In this discussion there is also a suggestion that consanguineous unions should somehow be discouraged. This is inappropriate and a breach of reproductive autonomy. Such a statement should be removed. Consanguinity is not the strong risk factor for congenital anomalies as the authors imply, conferring approximately a 2 fold enhanced risk of such problems. This assertion needs to be rebalanced.
