This is a well-written and well thought-out protocol for an exploratory (or pilot) approach to the use of the PATCH intervention in critical access hospitals. There are just a few additional points of clarification that would further strengthen the paper. During Phase II (post-discharge phone education sessions), what happens if patients cannot be reached? How many attempts are made to reach each patient? At what point of non-contact is the patient excluded from the study? The authors might consider adding a third column to Table 1 Data Analysis which could describe the data analysis procedures used to analyze each variable. In Figure 1, where is the description for Level 2 Building Knowledge, Skills Confidence that matches the other Levels in the figure?
