This is an excellent work, well justified and adequately addressed. However, some points should be met: Study design: References are needed for interventions. More details are particularly needed for the major PATCH intervention. Figure 2: Why not add the number of patients for each step, since the study is already over? Statistical analysis: Why adjust over baseline value of the measure in question only? Adjustment over other baseline variables may also be needed in case randomization did not succeed to equilibrate them. For readmission, we think that Cox regression model would be more adequate than KM analysis. One more point: In several locations in the manuscript, the authors say it is an exploratory work. Why? What is lacking?
