This manuscript introduced some novel ways to connect the current West Africa Ebola outbreak to the standard SI model. However, the author routinely assumed that the infection rate is a constant which more or less causes the exponential growth profile even when indications suggest otherwise after the month of October, 2014. The key to better modeling any infectious disease and especially in severe ones like Ebola, is to appropriately model the infection rate which is really a function of individual behavior. Arguably, individual behavior is often strongly correlated to the total cases reported. I suggest that the authors take a look at the paper by Chowell et al. below which implicitly incorporated such observations. One can show by a direct differentiation of the logistic model in the paper by Chowell et al . to find out that I/I is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the total case reported.
