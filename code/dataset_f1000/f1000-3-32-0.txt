This is a well written and interesting case report. There are few remarks. Abstract: The phrase “palms and soles” is better than “palms of the hands and soles of the feet”. Cutaneous findings: One of the violaceous palmar papules shows a central umblication! Is it a perforating lesion? Perhaps you can add a little comment on it. Diagnostic tests: It was a good to exclude STDs, namely syphilis by serology as tender violaceous papules of palms and soles are important clinical feature of its secondary stage. The histopathology photo is of insufficient quality and the described findings of GA are difficult to confirm. Treatment and follow up: As the authors mentioned, the patient is a farmer. Was it better to apply the potent steroid once at night and under occlusion for better compliance and efficacy?
