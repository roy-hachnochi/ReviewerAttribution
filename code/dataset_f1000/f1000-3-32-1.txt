The authors have submitted an interesting, relatively novel, and clinically relevant case of acral papular granuloma annulare (GA). I cannot independently verify the diagnosis of GA based on the photomicrograph provided. An image obtained at higher magnification may be required to clearly demonstrate the granulomatous inflammation and necrobiosis. In their Discussion, the authors describe the clinical and histologic differential diagnosis for acral GA. It may be helpful to emphasize some relevant clinical aspects, including the association with pain (beyond tenderness) and arthalgia mimicking rheumatologic disease, and a possible correlation with systemic malignancy ( Barksdale et al., 1994 ). Idiopathic palmoplantar hidradenitis might be reasonably considered in the clinical differential diagnosis; in this regard, since neutrophils were present in the reticular dermis in this case, it may be helpful to document that eccrine glands were uninvolved to eliminate this possibility from consideration. As for any case report describing treatment of a disorder whose natural history is to wax and wane, it is uncertain whether the relationship between treatment and clinical improvement is causation versus mere correlation.
