I appreciate your work and thank you for your effort. However I have some considerations to be clarified. The manuscript needs a light sub-edit for the English. The authors made the final diagnosis only with the clinical findings. However, there were not any photos that confirmed CdLS. If possible, the autopsy photos should be added to the manuscript. The manuscript could be accepted after minor revisions.
