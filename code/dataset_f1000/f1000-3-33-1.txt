The authors have responded appropriately to the earlier comments except in one instance. It may be due to language differences but the term "unreliable" should not be used to describe the genetic tests referred to in the paper. The tests are "reliable" if performed properly; in that they do or do not demonstrate a copy-number change (if by microarray) or a point mutation (if by some means of genome sequencing. What the authors intend to say is that a negative test (i.e. one that does not demonstrate a molecular change), is not equivalent to ruling out the clinical diagnosis. So they might simply say that the molecular tests are only "conclusive" in about 60-70% of the clinically recognized cases.
