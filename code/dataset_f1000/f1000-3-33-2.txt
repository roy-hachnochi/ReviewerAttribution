I agree with the report and comments of Dr Jinglian Liu , who has also reviewed this article. The case report is interesting in its detail of the prenatal ultrasound examination and observations, but completely fails its responsibility to connect those observations to appropriate use of contemporary molecular diagnostic opportunities. As such, this article fails the medical community by not accepting the opportunity to connect their useful prenatal morphological observations to detectable objective molecular findings.
