The data set described by Hu et al. is a large set of carefully curated small molecule matched-molecular pairs (MMPs) with high-quality activity data derived from ChEMBL. The set includes examples of structure-activity cliffs, as well as matched SAR-transfer series, both of which are important in the development and validation of activity prediction algorithms. The availability of the MMP data set will be very valuable to researchers that are focused on methods development. The data should also be of interest to those interested in fundamental questions about molecular activity (e.g. questions about the independence and additivity of activity changes that are linked with substituent changes).
