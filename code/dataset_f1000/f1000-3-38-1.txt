The article has been improved since the original submission. The purpose has been clarified somewhat. The literature review has been expanded although there is still no discussion of Neuhaus and Webmoor who have already proposed similar guidelines for Twitter research, nor the BPS guidelines. With so many sets of guidelines, it is difficult for a researcher to know which to follow. It would be nice to see a concerted effort (see my next paragraph). I still have concerns about the appropriateness of this particular venue for developing guidelines. The authors suggest the use of the Twitter hashtag "#TACTICS" for discussion, but such a generic hashtag is not particularly useful. https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TACTICS just brings up tweets about sports and marketing strategy. I believe that some sort of more focused discussion, e.g. at a workshop, perhaps under the auspices of a relevant professional society, would be more appropriate. Since some people seemed to find the list of references in my previous review useful, here a couple of more recent ones: The Horizon Digital Economy Research Institutes (Nottingham, UK) response to a UK parliamentary select committee on social media analytics: http://drdrmc.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/ethics-and-social-media.html A talk by Dan OConnor of the Wellcome Trust (again, UK) on ethics and social media research: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VbQcYt0bkw Given that this document is by definition a work-in-progress, I keep my decision the same.
