The author has proposed a method of using CNS drugs as leads and developing them into candidates for non-CNS target. The logic behind the approach is to tailor the attributes of a) molecular weight, b) lipophilicity, c) molecular complexity, d) number of rotatable bonds, e) number of H-bond donors and acceptors and f) polar surface area that are in consonance with values appropriate for non-CNS agents. He has illustrated his point with fluoxetine as an example. This is an idea is worthwhile looking at, but the final test would be to see some real applications of the approach on some established CNS drugs and their activity on some non-CNS targets experimentally established.
