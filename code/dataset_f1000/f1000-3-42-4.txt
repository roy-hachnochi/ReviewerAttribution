This is an interesting and useful article that explores the implications and lived experience of people dealing with the challenges of a debilitating chronic disease (COPD). This is not a "sexy" area of health care research but it is an important one as COPD substantially limits life in both quantity and quality. As such it is a worthy area of investigation, as the aim of this article is to identify how to improve the delivery of service for a sometimes overlooked patient group. The article is well presented and reflects a high level of attention to detail in design and analysis. The research team has identified an appropriate method of investigation which is sufficiently novel to generate new knowledge that will potentially inform clinical practice. Details of the data collection and analysis processes are well presented and the data are discussed comprehensively. The research team acknowledges that there are limitations in the study in terms of the level of participants, and the level of geographical specificity of the study. Whilst this is a sensible approach such caveats should not detract from the potential value of the study for practitioners who deliver such programmers. Finally, the conclusions are well balanced and insightful with a clear pathway to future research identified.
