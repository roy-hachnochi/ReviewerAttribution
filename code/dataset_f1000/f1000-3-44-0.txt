This web tool article describes a component of BioJS, a javascript library of reusable components for the presentation of biological data. This particular tool, PsicquicGraph , is a web component intended to visualize molecular interactions from PSICQUIC servers. PSICQUIC servers offer a standardised method for accessing proteomic interaction databases. From a biologists point of view, PsicquicGraph and the BioJS initiative are extremely positive as it will allow for the retrieval of information from various databases in a seamless manner. Technically speaking, PsicquicGraph cleverly takes advantage of BioJS, Cytoscape.js as well as MILQ by providing useful interactions within all these modules. The links provided in this article allows access to decent documentation of the tool and also provides a useful working example. Improvements I consider that this article could be improved by listing the 28 databases that the authors claim to have registered with PSICQUIC and making them available in this article. That would allow the reader to easily figure out how important this standardization is. I spent some times trying, but I was not successful in recreating the example in the window mode as advised by the authors (I tried Chrome, Firefox and Safari). I was thus not able to experience the demo example completely, which is bad for a web tool.
