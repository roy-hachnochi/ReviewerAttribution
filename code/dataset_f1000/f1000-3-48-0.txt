The article is very well written and tells a nice story, with compelling real-world examples. The software should have scientific impact by providing a convenient overview of matrix data, along the lines already suggested by the authors, and certainly by saving other scientist/developers the need to develop such functionality. The software fulfills a need for an easy to use widget for heatmap rendering and there is no doubt that this is a valuable contribution to the BioJS collection. However, I believe It would help many readers if the article placed the software in the broader context of similar offerings, so it would be good if the article enumerated these, perhaps as some sort of "feature matrix"? I appreciated the test server very much and encourage the authors to support this service in the future and further develop the functionality. Please note that examples of the CSV format are needed (at least I could not find them).
