This is an interesting article and piece of software. I think it contributes towards further alternatives to easily visualize high dimensionality data on the web. Its simple and easy to embed into other web frameworks or applications. Minor revisions a) About the software 1 - CSV format . It was hard to guess the expected format. The authors need to add a syntax description of the CSV format at the help page. 2 - Simple HTML example . It will be easy to test HeatmapViewer (HmV) if you add a simple downloadable example file with the minimum required HTML-JavaScript to set up a HmV (without all the CSV import code). 3 - Color scale . HmV only implements a simple three point linear color scale. For me this is the major weakness of HmV. It will be very convenient that in the next HmV release the user can give as a parameter a function that manages the score to color conversion. b) About the paper 1 - Introduction (4th paragraph) : There are many alternatives to explore a dataset using heat maps. The author only cites two and its not clear if you refer to or alternatives. I think that you have to emphasize the strengths of HmV in comparison to other alternatives (in my opinion, one strength is that it is a good lightweight alternative to embed heat maps in a web report). Example of alternatives that I know of (but Im sure that there are many more) are: http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea (desktop) http://jheatmap.github.io/jheatmap/ (website) http://www.gitools.org/ (desktop) http://blog.nextgenetics.net/demo/entry0044/ (website) http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.histogram2d.html (python) http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html (python) 2 - Predicted protein mutability landscape: The authors say: Without using a tool such as the HeatmapViewer, we could hardly obtain an overview of the protein mutability landscape. This paragraph seems to suggest that you can explore the data with HmV. I think that HmV is a good tool to report your data, but not to explore it. 3 - Conclusions : The authors say: ... provides a new, powerful way to generate and display matrix data in web presentations and in publications. To use heat maps in web presentations and publications is nothing new. I think that HmV makes it easier and user-friendly, but its not new.
