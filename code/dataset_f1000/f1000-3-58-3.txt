This is an interesting case of a patient with co-existing acromegaly and primary aldosteronism attributed to a Conns adenoma. Although the biochemical confirmation of primary aldosteronism relied only on a Captopril test and no adrenal vein sampling took place, the improvement of the blood pressure control and the resolution of hypokalaemia following the removal of the adrenal mass support the diagnosis of Conns adenoma. The authors attempt to provide a pathophysiological link between the two conditions. Their thoughts are very interesting but the option of a mere coincidence also needs to be mentioned.
