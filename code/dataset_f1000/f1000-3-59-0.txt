The revised manuscript is much improved, and the authors have satisfactorily addressed all issues of concern. I especially appreciate their thoughtful analysis of the implications of their findings regarding the effects of pruning/tree poaching, highlighting the complexity of the tradeoffs involved. Likewise, the revised discussion of the role elephant disturbance likely plays in the species interactions is nicely balanced and compelling.
