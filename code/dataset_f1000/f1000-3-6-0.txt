The revisions and responses by the authors are fair, given their constraints as outlined. The new work with DASH is exciting. I would still like more thorough related work - ISATools and Ontomaton are in this space and should be discussed. Rightfield does work with an archive system (the SEEK) n the same way that DataUP works with dataONE and will work in DASH approach. see doi:10.1007/978-3-642-41338-4_14
