This is an interesting article dealing with the characterization of a fluorinase from Norcardia brasiliensis. This research was obviously carried out independently and met publishing scientific standard, so it deserves publication in F1000Research, although similar work has been published ( Deng et al ., 2014 ). This work mainly focused on the comparative studies on the fluorination of SAM to form 5-FDA by two fluorinases NobA and FlA. Most of the experiments were well executed, except for the kinetic determination for these two enzymes. I suggest the authors reinvestigate the kinetic parameters, since it was not appropriate to determine the Km for NaF with a concentration of SAM at only 0.4 mM (the author stated that Kms for SAM of FlA and NobA were 0.2 mM and 0.4 mM, respectively). A saturation concentration is normally around 5 X Km.
