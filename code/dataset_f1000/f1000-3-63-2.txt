This is an interesting area of study and a timely one. I have only a couple of comments to make the article clearer: Central neural changes following hearing loss have been described using many different animal models and include changes in tonotopic maps, increased synchronous firing patterns and increased spontaneous firing rates" This statement focuses on the side effects of cochlear hearing loss, but there are many changes as well such as reduced sensitivity, loss of inhibition (positive and negative used in the same sense as in schizophrenia, not to imply good or bad). The first paragraph of the Introduction is couched in terms of tinnitus, but this article has nothing to do with tinnitus since the authors have examined changes after loud sound but not measured tinnitus, and the link in the Introduction to tinnitus is reported in one brief line. This is not a compelling argument. The demonstration that neural activity increases in the paraflocculus in cases of some behavioural evidence of tinnitus is not an argument that the cerebellum is involved in the generation of tinnitus, as is implied in the first sentence of the paragraph other brain regions are likely to be involved in giving rise to the eventual phantom auditory perception. The evidence that the authors cite in the rest of the paragraph shows that the paraflocculus gets auditory input, not that it modulates auditory input or percepts as needed for the argument that paraflocculus activity is linked to tinnitus. More compelling is the more recent Brozoski et al. (2013) article which reports that blockade of NMDA receptor activity in the paraflocculus reduces tinnitus, but the authors dont cite this. Finally, it is unclear to me how many animals contributed the various data. The authors report n=4 per group in the Methods, but the Table presents data for 4 shams and 2 mechanical trauma animals, and Figure 2 does not cite the n for each group.
