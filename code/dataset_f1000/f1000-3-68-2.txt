 Summary In this paper by Liu et al. a relationship between alpha-synuclein accumulation, motor deficits and expression of dynein in the nigrostriatal pathway is described. The study used transgenic mice overexpressing A53T aSyn similar to the M83 line and age matched Wt littermate controls. A behavioural deficit was confirmed in the Tg mice using a modified open-field test. The Tg mice showed reduced exploration and increased latency to get down from the starting platform. Mice were then sacrificed and tissue was prepared for western blot of dynein and immunohistochemistry of dynein and aSyn. The results showed decreased levels of dynein in the striatum and increased levels in the SN, both from western blots and histology. Furthermore, the authors showed that dynein levels were reduced in neurons with higher level of aSyn. Comments The number of animals used in each analysis needs to be provided along with the degrees of freedom for each statistical test performed. The staining in Fig 3, panel F has much more background compared to its counterpart in panel E. Please confirm that cases from different groups were all stained together to rule out any histology related confounds. The results from Fig 3 panels I, J and K are taken from a single region of a single case. Random sampling within the region of interest should be performed on each case (compared to Wt controls) to arrive at any conclusion. Optical density or fluorescent intensity measures should be obtained in the process to provide a quantitative assessment. The co-staining in Fig 3, panel K should include TH to know that the neurons being analyzed are SN dopamine neurons as alluded to in the conclusion.
