The ability to compare multiple computational methods across a series of consistent, high-quality datasets is critical to the progress of computational chemistry and cheminformatics. In the past, each paper published in the field seemed to present yet another new dataset. This dataset heterogeneity made it difficult, if not impossible, to objectively compare methods, and impeded the progress of the field. The availability of large repositories of carefully curated data is critical to the progress of the field. The datasets described in this paper will provide an invaluable resource for future studies. It is refreshing to see the emergence of platforms like ZENODO dedicated to hosting this data.
