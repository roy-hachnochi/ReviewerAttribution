The paper has been revised based on the concerns addressed by previous reviewers where clarity has improved greatly. A few minor points as follows: The title could be improved to highlight differences in transfer of learning from artificial to natural environment instead of focusing only about rotated visual environment (artificial environment), as the title appears misleading. The use of the keywords, such as environment adaptation and skill learning could better highlight the content and outcome of the paper as author has done extensive analysis on the interactions of the two environments. There is no mention about the follow-up study (8 participants) in the abstract, which is could be interesting to put forward the intention to study generalization and the outcome. In terms of future work, as this study focused on simple task, the next question will be on complex task. Authors could elaborate further on the hypothesis of the learning systems for more complex tasks and proposition on how the dynamics of the movements can be learned.
