This is a report of a very interesting case of a heterotopic intrarenal adrenocortical oncocytoma. As the authors stated this may be the first reported case in the literature. The major concern is the appearance of the mass in relation to the kidney at figure 1, exactly at the location of left adrenal gland. The authors stated that they performed a retroperitoneoscopical enucleation and, intraoperatively, the mass had a very thin, poorly defined pseudo-capsule which was adhering to the renal parenchyma as well as to the macroscopically inconspicuous adrenal gland. These observations raise the possibility that this mass was in fact arising from the adrenal gland itself and not from a heterotopic location within the kidney. A tumor of 4.5 cm located intrarenally would be difficult to enucleate without interfering with any renal parenchyma and therefore vascular structures - causing bleeding. The provided histopathological figure displays only diffuse sheets of oncocytic cells without any evidence any surrounding renal tissue. I would recommend a repeat discussion with the pathologist to see if this not really an adrenal oncocytoma, which would be still a rare entity, albeit with more than 50 cases reported in the literature.
