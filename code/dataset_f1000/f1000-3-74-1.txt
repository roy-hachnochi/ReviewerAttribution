This is an interesting paper where the authors have examined the hypothesis that the stx-carrying prophage upon induction in vivo are required for the development of HUS in the murine model. Eukaryotic host cells would transduce these phages, leading to increase of Stx production in the target organs. This would explain why very small numbers of bacteria are sufficient to cause HUS. The authors have also examined the anti-bacteriophage effects of chitosan in vivo and in vitro and demonstrated that chitosan has strong inhibitory effects on STEC bacteriophage and suggest that it could be a prophylactic for the prevention and treatment of HUS patients. In general, the presented study is conducted straight forward, is written concisely and the applied methodology is adequate. I recommend indexation of this article without changes.
