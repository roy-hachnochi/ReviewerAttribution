I consider the authors have satisfactorily answered all my comments and that the manuscript is acceptable. Should the phrase: T he fact that only partial protection was observed in mice infected with the E. coli C600TOX:GFP strain and subsequently treated with chitosan may be due to the short half-life of the compound . instead be: The fact that only partial protection was observed in mice infected with the wild-type EHEC EDL933W strain and subsequently treated with chitosan may be due to the short half-life of the compound ? The authors should indicate the concentration of DNAase used.
