This article is well written but needs a few additions to improve it: Please elaborate on what CD 123 is, and how it is used for diagnosing HLE. It is not common knowledge and should be expanded upon. It might also be worth commenting on this paper by Miyashita A et al. (2013, Acta derm venereal ) in which the authors showed patients with CD123 positive cells responded better to treatment than patients with low CD123. Do you think any of this could be supported or refuted by your cases?
