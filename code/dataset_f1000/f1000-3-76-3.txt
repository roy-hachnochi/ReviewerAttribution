This report describes a case of hypertrophic lupus erythematosus based on clinical and histopathologic criteria that is negative for CD123 and elastin elimination. Negative data is important. However, as the emphasis is on the lack of CD123 and the lack of transepidermal elastin elimination, it would be good to show the negative results. For the CD123 stain, it would be good to show a positive control to make sure that the antibody really worked.
