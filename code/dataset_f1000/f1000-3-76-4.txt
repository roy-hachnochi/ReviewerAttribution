This is a case of hypertrophic lupus erythematosus that is described as unusual in pathologic presentation. The title needs to indicate absence of transepidermal elimination of elastin. It is currently unclear if transepidermal elmination of elastin was present. The order of treatment described for HLE is confusing. One would start with hydroxychloroquine, then add quinacrine to hydroxychloroquine, with topicals as adjunctive therapy. Oral retinoids, thalidomide, and immuosuppressives would be options. Given that frequently there are multiple lesions that may actually koebnerize in a surgical scar, one would not include surgical excision as an option. The report cited in favor of TNF-alpha inhibitor is on ustekinumab, which is not a TNF inhibitor. This needs revision. Information about the antibody used for CD123 staining, as well as whether frozen or fixed tissue was used, is important. Anti-CD123 staining is not as good on fixed tissue. Were there any positive controls stained simultaneously?
