This cross-sectional study of trials registered on Clinicaltrials.gov found that changes in primary outcome are common and are associated with industry funding. The study was appropriately done and reported. The reasons for the changes in primary outcomes and the explanation for the association with funding source are not clear, but it seems likely that changes to the primary outcome might be important for the sound interpretation of results.
