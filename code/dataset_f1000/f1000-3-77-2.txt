This is a well written, competently undertaken, cross-sectional analysis. The study finds that changes to primary outcomes listed in a trials register, at any stage of the trial, are clearly associated with industry funding. Studying the extent of the changes in two disease areas is a practical way used by the authors to assess the changes and their significance (extensive in some 8%). The authors point out that there are many reasons for changes from the initial study protocol. No information is given on ClinicalTrials.gov on the reasons for changes and thus they have no explanation for their results. The authors suggest that industry funded trials are more diligent in reporting changes to protocols. This is a possible area for change which has been provided in this article.
