The value of single patient case reports to the scientific literature is debatable. Other than facilitating the documentation of rare conditions or experimental techniques, they are usually just articles of interest. Having said this, this well written article describing an odontogenic cause of refractory left maxillary sinusitis does highlight the importance of a broad differential when treating patients with sinus symptoms. My only criticism is the imaging provided and its purpose. The arrows used to highlight the foreign material, particularly in the coronal CT scan, appear to be pointing into space. Furthermore, there is little evidence of mucosal inflammation or osteitis, that one would expect to see in a patient with a foreign body reaction with symptoms of nasal discharge. Nevertheless, the significant improvement the patient experienced on removal of the retained gutta-percha does suggest that this was indeed the underlying cause of her symptoms.
