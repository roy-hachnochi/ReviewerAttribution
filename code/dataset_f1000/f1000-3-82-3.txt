 This study examines the immediate and long-term cognitive effects of a 20-day visuospatial working memory training program in a small group of 10-16-year-old boys (N=14), in comparison with a passive control group (N=15). The intervention group showed improvements in visuospatial n-back task (training task) and an auditory n-back task (transfer task) that were significantly greater than those observed for the passive control group. Gains in the auditory n-back task were sustained at a three-month follow-up assessment. Measures of fluid intelligence, inhibition, processing speed, and other working memory tasks (letter-number sequencing task) did not show transfer effects at any time point, as judged by significance testing. The authors show differences in the degree of improvement on the transfer task as a function of training gains on the n-back task (steady vs. unsteady performers). This study adds to a growing body of work establishing the boundary conditions of cognitive training effects. Limitations of this study include a small sample size, the absence of an active control group, and the failure to report on the motivation ratings gathered at each session, which could help to clarify differences between the steady and unsteady performers.
