This is a very useful paper on Gamma Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGT or just GT) - a test used in many liver transplant units and in hepatologist outpatient clinics. Its main use is the proposed correlation to liver damage - may it be cholestasis (often in combination with ALP elevation), rejection or infection. It is also used in alcoholic abuse monitoring. The early kinetics after liver transplantation are less known, and this paper gives valuable information regarding this. The authors found that livers with longterm function had an early raise in GT levels, not indicating signs of liver damage, while late raised levels showed the more expected liver damage as reason. Possible causes for early elevated levels are discussed, and a very relevant review article written by Whitfield (2001) is recommended. Title: The title reflects the take home message. Abstract: I think the abstract should stress the connection to oxidative stress mentioned in the review article more, since this seems to be a very plausible mechanism. Methods: The study is well conducted and patient selection well explained. The validity check of the findings by excluding NAS and cholestatic patients strengthen the results. Conclusions: The conclusions could merit from referring to the correlation to oxidative stress more. It is not proven that higher early GT actually protects the liver - it could be a surrogate marker for a liver in less oxidative stress.
