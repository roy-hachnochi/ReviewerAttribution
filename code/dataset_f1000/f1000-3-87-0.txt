Maganty and colleagues provide a timely and interesting report on a rather controversial topic which has been the subject of a number of recent, large, population-based, retrospective studies that have received media attention. The role of testosterone replacement therapy in worsening cardiovascular disease remains unanswered, and will likely require extensive, well-matched, randomized, placebo-controlled trials to prove its effect - whether protective, or aggravating - in cardiovascular disease. The authors, however, provide a well researched review of the putative mechanisms underlying this possible, though unproven, relationship. While the thromboxane A2, monocyte activation, polycythemia vera and obstructive sleep apnea pathways proposed are plausible, there is - to date - no clear evidence that any of these contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in men. Platelet activation and increasing atherosclerotic intimal plaque would be interesting topics for further research in testosterone replacement therapy, and will help to better elucidate this issue.
