This is a comprehensive summary of the potential mechanisms (i.e. platelet thromboxane A2 receptor, monocyte adhesion via endothelial cell vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, increased hematocrit level) underlying the possible association of testosterone supplementation therapy (TST) with cardiovascular outcomes. The discussion of possible mechanisms is important in light of recent questions about the cardiovascular side effects of TST, with studies showing both decreased and increased cardiovascular and mortality risk. An ideal study would be prospective and include additional measurements of hematocrit (or TXA2, VCAM1 for example) which could be related to cardiovascular outcomes and help to better select which men may derive the most benefit and least risk from TST. Additionally, a recent by Yassin et al. 1 adds more data for the safety of TST (intramuscular testosterone undecanoate) in older men with late-onset hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction (mean age 59 years with mean treatment duration of over 4 years). No cardiovascular side effects were noted during the study and there was improvement of metabolic syndrome-related characteristics including obesity, blood glucose, cholesterol, and BP. Subjects were mostly were overweight or obese, and a minority had baseline cardiovascular comorbidities (12%), DM2 (31%) or HTN (45%) issues (which are similar to - or increased compared with - the baseline characteristics of the Finkle et al. study 2 reference 23 in the article). In the future, more studies are needed to confirm these findings, especially investigating the mechanisms by which TST may affect cardiovascular outcomes. References 1.
