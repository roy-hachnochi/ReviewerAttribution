The subject (impact of the frequency of supervised training) is clinical relevant and not sufficiently evaluated. They have used a real-life study comparing two hospitals with identical rehabilitation except for the number of supervised trainings twice or three times a week. They have discussed the limitations and strength of this design. They have included enough patients to test for relevant differences between these two programmes. The patients have been adequately characterised at baseline, and the authors have used relevant outcomes. They write that median attendance was 13 (maximum 18 sessions), but I cannot find data on difference between the two programmes. Information on home training is also welcomed. They have used proper statistical analyses. It is well written, and data are discussed sensibly in context with other studies.
