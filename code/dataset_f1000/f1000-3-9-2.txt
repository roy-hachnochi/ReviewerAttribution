This manuscript is very well written regarding a strong, well thought out research design. The research is cutting edge and moves the knowledge regarding possible genetic factors influencing intrinsic exercise capacity in active mice. Chromosome 14 is an important participant in this phenotype and the authors do an excellent job utilizing chromosome substitution to continue pursuing their research interests. Minor comments: The authors point out in the first paragraph of the Results that body mass was less in the B6.A14 mice compared to the B6 mice. Could the authors perform a simple regression to assess the influence of differing body mass on intrinsic exercise capacity as a potential confounding factor to their findings? The third sentence in the second paragraph of the Results appears to conflict with the previous statement regarding differences in work with sex in the F 2 generation. If I'm reading these two sentences incorrectly I would ask a clearer statement be made to help the reader understand the sex-related difference in work with these F 2 mice. In the last few sentences in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion the authors present an interesting discussion regarding the different QTLs on chromosome 14 that may be playing a role in the male vs. female F 2 mice and intrinsic exercise capacity. More discussion would add to the major findings and future directions for readers. This is a difficult research issue and a bit more discussion would direct the readers towards an appreciation of this position. Possibly a better transition to the argument provided in the following paragraph would assist in the interpretation of the authors' findings.
