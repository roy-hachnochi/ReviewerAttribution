This article presents a short summary and review of recent work on circular RNAs and on competing endogenous RNAs, which can sequester and microRNAs. A point made by the authors is that both sense and antisense RNAs from the same genomic region can act as miRNA sponges and that linear transcripts from the same regions that produce circular RNAs can themselves sequester miRNAs. Overall, I found the article to be provocative, though not novel. During the past several years there have appeared a number of papers describing circular RNAs of various sorts (for example, stable introns and circles resulting from splicing events commonly promoted by strong secondary structures flanking exons). There has also been a wealth of published work suggesting or showing that abundant RNAs can bind miRNAs and thus reduce their availability for the regulation of some mRNAs. Thus, this paper breaks little new ground, though it does point out that many genomic regions express both sense and antisense transcripts, and each of these can affect miRNA availability. To me, the area covered by this paper is a very interesting and important one, and it is of value to present and discuss new concepts in gene regulation. Thus, I think this manuscript would be improved by: More clearly summarizing the ceRNA field. Discussing a bit more the well known fact that sense and antisense transcripts are commonly expressed in cells, though not necessarily from the same locus at the same time. Mentioning the several ways that stable circular RNAs can be produced. Finally, discussing the issue lacking from the current version that, in order to effectively act as a miRNA sponge, an RNA must not only be stable, but also in the proper cellular compartment and containing a molar concentration of miRNA binding sites that is high enough to sequester a biologically significant fraction of the endogenous miRNA of interest.
