The paper, based mostly on expert opinion, identifies and discusses challenges to marine conservation planning in the Coral Triangle a region where, despite pressing conservation issues, conservation planning has had relatively limited influence. The paper provides insights to inform management actions in the Coral Triangle that may also prove useful to other regions facing similar challenges. Though the paper is of an acceptable standard, the authors may want to consider the following points: Introduction It would be beneficial to provide more details about what conservation planning is and why it is needed, and the complex setting (environmental, socio-economic and political) that characterise the Coral Triangle (see Fidelman et al. , 2012 1 ). These would help contextualise the challenges identified in the following sections; many (if not most) of the challenges result, to some extent, from the complex nature of large-scale marine areas such as the Coral Triangle. Planning across governance boundaries This section addresses the problem of fit and scale; and would benefit from drawing on the corresponding scholarship (see e.g., Young, O.R., 2002 2 ). The authors may want to consider replacing the heading Planning across governance boundaries with Addressing the problem of fit and scale or something along these lines. Conclusions It would beneficial to generalise the discussion beyond the Coral Triangle; that is, most of the challenges identified are also true to other regions, particularly large-scale marine regions. Insights from the paper would also be applicable to those regions. Other comments Some of the suggested actions to address the challenges identified are challenges themselves (e.g., legal reform, integration across governance levels, institutionalising conservation planning etc.). This is because we live in an increasingly complex world where (borrowing from Dietz et al. , 2003 3 ) ideal conditions for governance (and for that matter conservation planning) are increasingly rare. That is, many of the challenges identified in the paper are facts of life; accordingly, the real challenge is to find innovative ways to navigate such challenges. Last, we address related challenges to the Coral Triangle in a recent article Fidelman et al., 2014 4 which the authors may find relevant to this paper. References 1.

It summarizes valuable lessons learned from an extensive, not to mention expensive, conservation effort in a critical biodiversity-rich region of the world, the so-called "coral triangle".
