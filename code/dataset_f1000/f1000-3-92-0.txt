The authors clearly showed that mice avoid the smell of urine of Toxoplasma infected rats more than the smell of urine of Toxoplasma free rats. This effect was observed with both fresh and old urine samples, suggesting that non-volatile components of urine were responsible for the phenomenon. Authors used the correct experimental setup and correct techniques, including the statistical methods. I see just one potentially important problem, namely a rather common problem of pseudoreplications. Authors used urine sample mixtures originated from just two Toxoplasma infected rats and from two Toxoplasma free rats. Theoretically, existence of one abnormal urine sample among four samples could give a false positive result of a study. To avoid the problem of pseudoreplications, authors should use urine sample from different rat for each mouse. It would be interesting to test also the reaction of mice on some Toxoplasma infected and Toxoplasma free members of some non-predator species. Without doing this it could not be decided whether the mice avoided the smellier predator or the parasite. (Of course, the former explanation seems to be more probable.)
