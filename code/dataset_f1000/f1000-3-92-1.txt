This paper describes an interesting result - that infected rats were more aversive to prey (mice). The authors have previously reported that infected male rats produced urine marks which were more attractive to female conspecifics. They postulated that infected male rats may produce more male pheromones to attract female conspecifics, which could also act as kairomones to repel rats prey, e.g. house mice. Although the authors did not chemically analyze the contents of the pheromonal components, at this stage their behavioral tests reliably supported their conclusion. They should add some references to show the rats pheromone identification.
