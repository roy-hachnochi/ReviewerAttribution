This is certainly an interesting study. The characterisation of lysosomal-SR junctions is novel and conceptually important. The data look convincing but I would recommend the authors to further expand the structural part of the study. It would perhaps be useful to further verify that the organelles participating in the formation of the contacts are indeed lysosomes and that the junctions are not simply the result of accidental collisions of the two organelles. Identifying/visualising tethers between the organelles (by analogy with tethers between mitochondria and the ER 1 ) would be particularly advantageous. Modelling part of the paper is also useful. In this respect it would be valuable to clarify the Ca 2+ buffering capacity of lysosomes (and its possible effect on the outcomes of the model). One could also perhaps consider measuring this important parameter using isolated lysosomes. References 1.

It is increasingly apparent that ... Continue reading READ ALL
