The authors introduce the multiplex shRNA screening approach as commonly used currently to find new drug targets or other similar applications. They also provide a literature overview on the relevant bioinformatics tools used in this context. With rapid improvements in the shRNA technology, data analysis methods for this are high in demand. The manuscript provides a good framework for analysis of data on pooled shRNA screens. There is a strong need to have such user friendly, open-source programs dedicated to analysis of shRNA screens that can easily be used by experimental biologists. The manuscript provides a coherent platform that nicely incorporates analytic tools for the current requirements of the RNAi or other similar functional genetic screens. As part of the review process, we have analyzed our own data using the software and found it fully functional and very easy to use. Based on our experience, we recommend the manuscript for indexation.
