This is a well written paper describing a potentially useful application for the analysis shRNA-seq screening data. It includes a brief description of this relatively novel technique and some competing methods as well as a description of the method used in this implementation. The authors are to be commended for providing a wrapper for Galaxy which will make it very easy for biologists to access the method in a reproducible analysis environment and this seems likely to improve the real availability and eventual impact of their work.
