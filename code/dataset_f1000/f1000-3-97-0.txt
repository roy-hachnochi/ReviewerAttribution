There are two comments I have regarding the submission: In the case description, the authors mention mobilization of the foot by a physiotherapist was not possible. Can they be more specific as to why that was the case? In the Discussion, you mention that 9-49% of CRPS patients suffer from movement disorders. What is your source for that figure?
