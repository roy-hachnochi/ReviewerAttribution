This is an important report for the neuroscience community regarding huge data sets recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and dorsomedial entorhinal cortex of behaving rats. Because the authors have already published a number of papers with the data sets, I have no doubt that this paper and their shared data will contribute to the further advancement of this field. This manuscript is clearly written in details. This article can be improved by clarifying the following minor points in the section Data collection and cell-type classification: 1. Cluster quality It is not clear whether the quality of single units was assessed objectively, for example, by measuring isolation distance. 2. Cell-type classification Because now researchers including the authors can classify cell-types optogenetically, it would be better to comment on potential pitfalls of the classification procedure used here. For example, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that some of neurons can be interneurons.
