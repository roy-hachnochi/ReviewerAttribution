In this work, Mizuseki et al. provide valuable information on their large-scale data sets of multi-neuronal and local field potential (LFP) recordings from the hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1) as well as the enthorhinal cortex across the layers (layers 2, 3, 4, 5 etc.) of behaving rats. These data sets have originally been used for a number of their excellent studies for past ten years. Here, they fully summarized the experimental conditions and results in individual recording sessions very clearly for any users to plan to analyze the data. It will be a really useful treasure map for all hippocampus researchers. I have one minor comment. While they showed the number of isolated neurons in each brain area of each animal (Table 2 to Table 4), it is not clear yet how many neurons, at most, were recorded simultaneously. Some people will probably want to analyze spike activity in a population of many neurons. The data would be more available for the higher-order spike analysis if the authors added additional information on the best (or first choice) data set with a sufficient number of well-isolated neurons in the same brain area.
