This technical report is very interesting. Although the author used a simple experiment to demonstrate slime production, further researches need to done to evaluate such studies. In a clinical microbiology laboratory, this technique might well be of great use to preliminary identify, if a microorganism has the potential to form slime or bio-film. This may help us to analyze the reason, if any, in case the patient is not responding to the antibiotic (s) currently being used Drawback of the study includes, uncertainties about exactly what causes such observations under this special staining modification. Also it is unknown if the smear preparation has to be taken from broth or from the colonies. In case of colonies, what should be exact method to pick, since while routine smear preparation might interfere in the demonstrability of the slime, and you can almost never see biofilm, This character is demonstrated by bacteria only when there is a demand, example, while the bacteria is inside human, fighting immune system to establish and cause infection. I appreciate the attempt of the author, though!
