This is a good article that describes a new method to demonstrate E. coli cultures. The physical (laboratory) technique is well described and can easily reproduced. The virtual images, segmentation methods and colony identifications are good in principle, however, they could be explained more in detail. Especially detailed discussions of Regions of Interest (ROIs), segmentation algorithms, and potential expansion to improved interpretation could remarkably improve the reader's interest. Here are some articles mentioned that describe and discuss these aims and algorithms: Kayser, K., B. Molnar, and R. Weinstein, 2006 1 Kayser, K., et al ., 2016 2 Sharma, H. et al., 2015 3
