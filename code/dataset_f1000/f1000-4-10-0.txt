This paper includes several interesting ideas (e.g., how different response categories by subjects allow to know what is salient in the test image, using spatial heterogeneity areas as the basic image processing strategy). However, in its present form it could not be accepted by a standard peer review based scientific journal. Among several problems the following stand out. The language is poor; the manuscript should be thoroughly edited by a native speaker. Authors should carefully and convincingly persuade a reader why their study is valid for real face perception. As it stands now, they artificially create an image of some object (e.g., face) with spurious new visual characteristics, then they use these images for a perception task by human subjects and then they generalize for normal visual perception. It seems they do not study real perception of untransformed objects belonging to certain category, but study perception of specific artificially created stimuli. In the Introduction (e.g., first two paragraphs) needed specific references are absent. There are many minor points to be corrected (e.g., kd pro cd, Procedure too vaguely described, etc.)
