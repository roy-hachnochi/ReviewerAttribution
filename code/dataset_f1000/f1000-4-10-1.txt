The manuscript represents very interesting study on second-order visual filters that determine perception of face feature. These filters are associated with second-order neuronal populations that combine the outputs of striate neurons coding the primary visual features. The authors assume that second-order filters represent the mechanism of salience map formation. This map constitutes the basis for the recognition of human faces. I recommend this article for indexation. However the manuscript needs to be slightly corrected before indexation. What is the difference between abbreviation cpi and cpd ? Sometimes author use the term spacial frequency and sometimes the term spatial frequency . It seems that the next two sentences represent the result of splitting of whole sentence: Wherein, the system of decision making can not use all available information. Elaborations will be made until specific visual task will be resolved .
