Tsakiridis and Wilson present the evidence that single cells from a neuromesodermal axial progenitor (NMP) population produced in vitro from mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) can give rise to both neural and mesodermal cell descendants, and are therefore truly bipotent. In earlier work they had demonstrated the existence of NMPs in the posterior aspect of the developing early somite embryos, and characterized these NMPs as being T Brachyury/Sox2 double positive. In more recent experiments they and others succeeded in defining high Wnt and high Fgf signaling conditions to culture EpiSCs into a cell population wherein more than half the cells are NMP-like. However, it remained to be proven that an individual NMP-like cell expressing both T Brachyury and Sox2 is able to generate neural derivatives (expressing exclusively Sox2), and mesodermal derivatives (expressing exclusively T Brachyury). It is what the authors achieved in this report, by elegantly making use of EpiSCs derived from T Bra Gfp transgenic embryos. By fluorescence activated cell sorting applied to these EpiSCs cultured in NMP-promoting conditions, they could purify the T Bra positive NMPs and analyze their clonal descendants. They clearly obtained neural and mesodermal descendants from single NMP clones, and could demonstrate that the environmental culture conditions influence the bias of individual NMPs to differentiate into cells with a neural versus mesodermal fate. The experiments are well designed and executed. The methods are well described, and the results are clear, thoroughly analyzed and discussed appropriately. The data in this manuscript convey a clear message that represents an advance in the field.
