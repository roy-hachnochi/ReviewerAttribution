Michael Wang and co-Authors report a case of severe non-immune mediated hemolytic anemia occurred during an episode of acute E and B viral hepatitis in a patient that is not G6PD deficient. Unfortunately the manuscript does not provide strong evidence that the patient is not G6PD deficient. In fact, the Authors have measured G6PD level (the level is not shown) only during the hemolytic episode when reticulocyte count was high (201.1 10 9 /L): it is well known that high reticulocyte count can mask the deficiency of G6PD. In order to prove that the patient is not G6PD deficient the Authors should show G6PD levels measured before the hemolytic episode or they should show that at DNA level the patient carried a G6PD mutation know to be associated with G6PD deficiency. In addition, a more extensive workout for inherited hemolytic anemia (pyruvate kinase deficiency, etc.) would be a good addition. Minor Points Abstract. The abstract reports no data about the actual clinical case. Conclusion. This is a summary of the literature poorly related with the findings from the reported clinical case.
