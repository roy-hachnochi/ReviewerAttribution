Arber Kodra et al. presented a case of KS that involved the pulmonary in a HIV negative patient. This patient has past medical history of NHL and cutaneous KS. PCR for HHV-8 in BALF showed 5800 DNA copies/ ml and bronchoscopy showed diffusely hyperemic and edematous mucosa of lower airways. The authors claimed that this patient’s pulmonary symptoms were likely due to disseminated KS and the useful of PCR for HHV-8 to diagnose KS in a BALF sample in a case when bronchiscopic biopsy was not safe. KS is thought to originate from HHV8 infected lymphatic endothelial cells. HHV8 is recognized as an essential and necessary factor in the pathogenesis of KS. However, not all HHV-8 infected individuals will develop the disease. The authors examined PCR for HHV-8 in BALF sample; however, it will be more convincing if the author could provide pathological results to demonstrate the patient pulmonary symptoms were likely due to disseminated KS. In this case, the past medical history of this patient was significant for Non-Hodgkin’s Follicular B-Cell Lymphoma. NHL may also lead to nodular opacities throughout both lungs. The abnormal cells of KS form purple, red, or brown patches, plaques or tumors on the skin. It will be better if the authors could provide some pictures of cutaneous lesions. It is a little puzzled that the “lung were clear to auscultation.”, whereas CT scan showed pleural effusions on both lungs.
