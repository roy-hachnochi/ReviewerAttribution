The authors set out to create a framework to easily access data from a large number past DREAM challenges and assess new predictions for these using appropriate the evaluation metrics defined in the respective challenges. My main reservation is that I find that the DREAMTools package is, contrary to what the authors claim, of little use at the moment. Perhaps in a future where the official DREAM challenges make currently open challenges available via DREAMTools, this will be more useful. At the moment, any group interested in benchmarking their prediction method for a particular challenge can easily access and download the data as well as implement the evaluation metrics. I have have not judged the technical aspects of DREAMTools but I note that the difficulties is installing the software experienced by Konrad Hinsen points to the fact that is it of limited usability at this moment. In summary, I believe that DREAMTools can be approved in the off chance that new DREAM challenges use the package but at the moment it is difficult to install and of little use.
