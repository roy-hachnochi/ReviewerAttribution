This article describes a software tool that implements in a transparent and reusable way the scoring of DREAM challenges, covering 80% of the challenges that have taken place. The tool thus ensures replicability of past challenges and also permits researchers to use them in evaluating their future work. The software is fully open and well documented, conforming to the highest standards of open science. The article is clear and explains both the motivation for and the design of the software in sufficient detail. Unfortunately I did not succeed in installing and running the software following the provided instructions (see https://github.com/dreamtools/dreamtools/issues/60 and https://github.com/dreamtools/dreamtools/issues/59 for the details). These issues seem minor, but prevent a full evaluation at this time. This is my only reason for approving this article with reservations.
