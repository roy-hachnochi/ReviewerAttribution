Current manuscript by Veljkovic et al., deals with the identification of inhibitors against Ebola virus infection. Authors took advantage of existing approved and experimental drugs and, based on in silico analysis, proposed ibuprofen as a potential candidate for prevention and treartment of Ebola virus infection. EIIP and AQVN calculation, previously described by authors, was employed to define ibuprofen as the best candidate against Ebola virus infection. The manuscript is adequately presented and can be considered as acceptable for indexation. Minor points: Ebola virus infection is initiated by interaction between the virus glycoprotein GP1 and its cognete receptor(s). Putative receptor binding domain of GP1, key residues involved in GP1 protein folding or structure and a putative receptor binding pocket has been proposed and mapped to the N-terminal 150 amino acids of GP1 (33-185 residues). Authors should include in the discussion as how interaction of ibuprofen with GP1 (residues, Thr 338, Ser 340, Gln 344 and Ala 415) will influence the receptor binding domain.
