It is crucial when a chylothorax is being either medically or surgically treated to state the volumes of chyle that are produced on a daily basis. This dictates further management. The authors fail to provide that. The thoracic duct passes from the cysterna chyli directly into the right pleural space. Anatomically, there is no communication between the right pleural space and the left pleural space. While a left sided chylothorax is possible after surgical intervention due to disruption of the left pleura, idiopathic chylothrorax is normally right sided. The authors fail to provide an explanation of how chyle from the thoracic ductâ€™s main trunk tracked into the left chest. Supposing that the leak into the left chest was from an aberrant or side branch that originated at point below the right pleural space, how did the authors identify that? Locating the thoracic duct main trunk is feasible surgically, but locating a side branch proves impossible surgically even with prior localisation by means of lymphangiography. I presume that the thoracic duct ligation was done blindly at the level of the hiatus. The authors highlight two methods for the management of chylothorax. These methods have been well established and the report itself does not add any new material to what is already known from the literature.
