Review of regionReport: Interactive reports for region based analysis. This short software tool article describes a new R package, `regionReport`, available from Bioconductor that generates HTML reports which allows users to explore genomic regions and quickly scan quality control information. The reports also provide provenance of code used in the analysis, including detailed session information to facilitate as much reproducibility as possible. The paper/report clearly describes functionality of the tool, potential use cases, and details on installation and operation. Suggestions for improvement Given that you are describing an HTML application, it would be really helpful to include more screenshots/figures rather than just the one, and the workflow diagram. Most readers are unlikely to install the package immediately (see further comments on 3) and so it would help to make the value proposition clear. I would also suggest annotating these figures highlighting the key parts. Happy to approve the narrative itself after this revision. Given that the package primarily generates html based reports, it would be of great value to have these files in the `gh-pages` branch of a GitHub repo, such that reports could be automatically made available under `https://USERNAME.github.io/repo/file.html` much like the page that describes the supplementary material. One way to easily enable this would be to use the functionality in the `git2r` package (disclosure: I am a coauthor on the package) to programmatically create a new branch (if it doesnt already exist), generate the report, then add those files and push to GitHub (assuming the same folder in under git revision control). Obviously I am not expecting the authors to add this suggestion to the current version of the package, but as something to consider for future versions. Reduce the number of dependencies. `locfdr` is no longer on CRAN. On a slightly slower than normal connection (currently on travel) it took a fairly long time to track down and install all the dependencies. Id recommend moving non-essential dependencies to suggests and using something like this to selectively install packages as needed using `requireNamespace(pkg, quietly = TRUE)`. It was disappointing to go down a rabbit hole of dependencies and still not be able to install and run examples. However, I found the report examples posted online (here: http://leekgroup.github.io/regionReportSupp/bumphunter-example/index.html and here: http://leekgroup.github.io/regionReportSupp/DiffBind-example/index.html) extremely useful. The use of Twitter bootstrap also adds a layer of a familiarity that I found extremely useful. It would be nice to have the package generate a direct link to the bib file under the bibliography.
