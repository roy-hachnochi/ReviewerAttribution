This is an interesting approach to possibly differentiating between the functions of this group of proteins. A fundamental question that arises out of this work is why do hemoglobin proteins inhibit E. coli growth? The growth differences between the rice Pgb1.1-transformed line and the rice Pgb1.2 line is particularly interesting. I would be cautious, however, in attempting to interpret the results with respect to the proteins possibly behaving as oxygen carriers/transporters. My concerns are based on the following: Why would a unicellular organism without mitochondria require an oxygen carrier since oxidative phosphorylation occurs on the plasma membrane? If plant phytoglobins have an oxygen carrier function would you not expect the two class 1 phytoglobins to have the same effect since they both have similar oxygen binding characteristics? Why would you anticipate that Pgb1.2 might participate more in NO scavenging than Pgb1.1 in E. coli if they both have similar configurations in the heme pocket? Is it not the class 2 Pgbs that are suggested to possibly being less amenable to NO scavenging? Is it possible that the expression of the class 2 protein is interfering with some function of the native flavohemoglobin in E. coli? Although E. coli does not have a true nucleus, is it possible that the protein is specifically interfering with transcriptional/translation functions in the chromosome, e.g., the N-end rule pathway as one possibility? My other comment concerns the terminology. The individuals who work in this area agreed to forego the use of the term "nonsymbiotic hemoglobins" at an international meeting in 2014, replacing it with "phytoglobin", since the original designation does not appropriately describe the protein. I would hope that the authors consider modifying the manuscript to ensure that the name change becomes recognized in the literature.
