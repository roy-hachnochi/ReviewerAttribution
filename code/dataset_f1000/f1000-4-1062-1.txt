This is a potentially important protocol for sequencing viral genomes using an adapted nucleic acid bead capture method. The results are impressive and I think the technique is likely to be useful to many who are undertaking viral sequencing. The article is written well and I believe acceptable for indexing in its current version. I have a number of suggestions that may improve the utility of the article to readers: I would appreciate a longer description of the NEBNext protocol - I assume this is first strand cDNA synthesis using random hexamers, but this would be useful to spell out. The main innovation is the use of IDT xGen Lockdown protocol, but the protocol is not described in much detail. I would appreciate a flowchart or textual description of the protocol, because I would like to know how long it takes, what steps are involved and what equipment is needed to carry it out . The costs of the per-sample sequencing is given, I would like to see this broken down by component. I have a major issue with Figure 2 as presented, due to the use of multiple Y-axes which I think makes it very very hard to interpret. Please split this out into panels with enrichment and unenriched data presented separately. Also please decide on consistent use of scientific notation or regular numbers (I prefer the latter). In fact rather than reporting read depth it would be more informative to report as a fraction of the number of reads from that barcode. I'm afraid I can't get on with the "ve-Seq" name, because I read it like "negative-Seq" each time! The authors might consider a more informative and easier to communicate name. The authors may consider citing some of the recently published pan-viral capture papers such as VirCAP-Seq 1 and relating ve-Seq to this technique. References 1.
