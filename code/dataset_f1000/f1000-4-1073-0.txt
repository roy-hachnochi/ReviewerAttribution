This is a well done study with appropriate analyses. It is timely and of interest. It is limited (as appropriately acknowledged by authors) by the small number of studies and the large impact of one study (King). There is a very good discussion of different theoretical models. It would be worth also highlighting in the abstract their analyses of telomerase itself, not just the TL/telomerase ratio. They present a secondary analysis without Wikgren. This was a post-hoc decision, but this is acknowledged, and the main findings of the meta-analysis include that study. The only real issue: There should have more discussion of the role of moderators (although this information was not available across all studies), e.g., age, sex, illness (medical and psychiatric), medications, education, SES, as well as MRI field strength, etc. Indeed, the authors reported that only marginal effects were seen when adjusting for hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and smoking status. This should be given more emphasis.
