The current systematic review and meta-analysis of works evaluating the possible link between leukocyte telomere length and hippocampus volume is robust and thorough. It provides a useful quantitative analysis of the current research data and also evaluates potential theories on underlying mechanisms. My reviews are often more lengthy but I think this present work is comprehensive and I really do not think I have a lot to add. We were intrigued by existing studies but were worried about potential for bias in existing studies. A particular cause for concern was the small sample size of the studies and relatively modest size of the association being studied. This article gives concrete analysis to support this and determined the power of studies with a sample size of 30 to show an association was only 10%. As mentioned in this rather comprehensive work, some of the work stated that their findings were hypothesis generating and the associations tested were not stipulated at the outset but rather emerged in subgroup analysis. Thanks is still owed to these smaller studies for pioneering the ideas underlying this work. We were rather fortunate to have as a partner the Dallas Heart Study which made our work possible and are grateful for their support.
