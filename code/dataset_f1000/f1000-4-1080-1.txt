This article provides a useful workflow on detecting differential binding in ChIP-seq data with examples and codes from R packages and other softwares. This paper will help researchers on analyzing their ChIP-seq using R. However, it would be better if there was more description on the methods used in the workflow. “Reads are first aligned to the genome using the Rsubread package ( Liao et al. , 2013 ).” Please describe what algorithm is used to align the reads. "Technical replicates are merged together prior to further processing." What does merged together mean? Concatenate? Or average? Or pick one randomly? "Ideally, the proportion of mapped reads should be high, while the proportion of marked reads should be low." Proportion mapped is those reads that can be uniquely mapped to the genome? "Thus, the marking status of each read will be ignored in the rest of the analysis, i.e., no duplicates will be removed in downstream steps." I believe generally people exclude duplicates in downstream steps? "By default, windows with very low counts are removed to reduce memory use." What is the definition of very low counts? =1? If it is described by the section filtering windows by abundance, please mention it. bins - windowCounts(bam.files, bin=TRUE, width=2000, param=param) filter.stat - filterWindows(win.data, bins, type="global") min.fc - 3 keep - filter.stat$filter log2(min.fc) summary(keep) ## Mode FALSE TRUE NA's ## logical 906406 663218 0 hist(filter.stat$back.abundances, xlab="Background abundance", main="", breaks=50) threshold - filter.stat$abundances[1] - filter.stat$filter[1] + log2(min.fc) abline(v=threshold, col="red") In code above, where is the background? I assumed it is filter.stat$filter[1]? However, it looks like the filter is background + log2(3)? If it’s at least 3-fold background, shouldn’t it be filter.stat$filter[1]*3? Figure 2 doesn’t make sense. Why is there windows with 0 abundance? Normalizing for library-specific trended biases. Figure 3 only shows log-fold change between mature B and pro-B but there is more than one sample in mature B and pro-B. How do you apply the normalization? Do you take average of all mature B samples and average of all pro-B samples and then do the loess normalization? ## Gene nWindows logFC.up logFC.down PValue FDR ## 6 Ldlrap1 19 11 0 0.224741404877 0.2705479855 ## 7 Mdn1 29 12 11 0.000004447727 0.0001347924 ## 8 Pydc3 8 0 6 0.051183399851 0.0781822366 ## 9 Wfdc17 6 0 6 0.000069604922 0.0008738790 ## 10 Mfap1b 19 1 10 0.107116609335 0.1440819313 ## 13 Gm15772 30 12 7 0.085543435687 0.1192823092 How do you interpret this results?
