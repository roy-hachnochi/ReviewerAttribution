After publication of an article by Gao and colleagues earlier this year, several published results dealing with the role of ABP1 in auxin signaling and plant development became a matter of doubt. This also concerns the embryo-lethal phenotypes that have been attributed to a loss of ABP1 function in abp1-1 and abp1-1s alleles - quite the opposite of the wild type appearance of the likely abp1-1c and abp1-TD1 null alleles, described by Gao and colleagues. These contradicting results predict off-target effects that would cause phenotypes associated with abp1-1 and abp1-1s, and the authors of this study attempted to identify such targets. From the results presented in this manuscript it appears that functional disruption of the BSM gene, located proximal to ABP1 , is responsible for abp1-1 / abp1-1s embryo-lethal phenotypes. This is indicated by genetic complementation analyses, demonstrating that neither abp1-1 nor abp1-1s complement segregation of bsm1-1 embryo-lethal phenotypes, when analyzing progeny of crosses. On the other hand, when introducing bsm1-1 into abp1-c1 and abp1-TD1 , the authors observed complementation of embryo-lethal phenotypes. This provides genetic evidence for a scenario in which phenotypes associated with abp1-1 and abp1-1s result from disruption of the BSM1 locus. This is an important and timely report, summarizing experiments that certainly will contribute to our understanding of ABP1 function in Arabidopsis . Specifically, it finally establishes an off-target candidate locus, responsible for abp1 mutant phenotypes that have been an integral part of a number of published studies. With respect to the title: "early abp1 mutants" sounds a bit ambiguous. The authors might consider "original abp1 mutants" instead
