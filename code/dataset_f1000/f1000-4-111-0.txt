The authors report a rare case of severe symptomatic hypercalcemia as the initial manifestation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated with massive pulmonary alveolar calcification which was diagnosed several months later. The case is well documented and image findings are striking. This case report may be useful to alert pediatricians for the diagnosis of malignancy and also favor an early investigation of metastatic calcification of soft tissues in patients with such a severe degree of hypercalcemia.
