This article submitted by Colleti and colleagues from Santa Catarina Hospital, So Paulo, Brazil, provides an interesting case report of an unusual entity, namely pulmonary alveolar calcification. The report is well documented and the conclusions not overstated. However, additional data, if available would be of interest. Specific comments regarding the manuscript are noted below: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, not acute lymphoblatic leukemia. At the time of initial presentation, what was the calcium x phosphate product? If the tumor burden was high and ongoing lysis of leukemia cells was occurring, serum phosphate might also be expected to be elevated and contributing to the calcification of soft tissue. Did the patient present with hypertension? Was a shortened QT interval noted on the admission EKG? Did the medical team specifically inquire about a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia? At the time of initial presentation, did radiographs demonstrate any evidence of soft tissue calcification? Was calcification of the lungs present on admission; was nephrolithiasis present? The CT scan reproduced in Figure 2, also appears to demonstrate calcification of the heart and great vessels, as well as severe osteopenia of the lower thoracic vertebrae. Did the patient exhibit any structural cardiac problems, such as calcified valve leaflets by echocardiography? Did the patient exhibit any neurological findings attributable to thoracic vertebral osteolyis? Although biphosphonates represent the safest approach to therapy for this patient, is there any role for calcitonin, mithramycin, and indomethacin? It is probably worth mentioning pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis as well as the SLC34A2 gene mutation in the Na/PO 4 co-transporter, as other causes of pulmonary alveolar calcification. Given the appearance of thoracic CT imaging, longitudinal pulmonary function testing is probably warranted for the patient presented.
