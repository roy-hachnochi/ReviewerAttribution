The studies in this article demonstrate that the requirement of Cu becomes minimal with increasing concentrations of resveratrol in mediating DNA damage to plasmid DNA. These results are in line with previous reports where copper-resveratrol complex was shown to induce oxidative DNA breakage in plasmid DNA as well as in human peripheral lymphocytes. The article is well written, however, it can be enhanced by the addition of a paragraph on the bioavailability of resveratrol. This is especially important given that the doses being used to show DNA cleavage are quite high to be pharmacologically achievable. Will such high concentrations be achieved in vivo ? Also is there a saturating concentration where the role of Cu becomes insignificant and resveratrol alone induces oxidative DNA damage. Addition of these points will certainly enhance the readability of the manuscript.
