The topic of this paper is very important and has interesting implications for the purpose of using resveratrol as chemopreventive agent. In fact the authors rightly refer to the paper by Azmi et al. where the problem of the potential breaking activity of resveratrol in human lymphocytes is addressed. However in my opinion the interpretation of the results of this manuscript is not always supported by the data presented. Referring to figures from 1 to 4 the authors state: “with successive increases in starting concentration of R-Cu to 500μM, 1mM and 5mM, DNA cleaving activity was progressively enhanced such that complete cleavage was achieved at successively higher ratios of R to Cu”. This is partially true in the sense that starting from the ratio R-Cu 1:1 the cleavage of supercoiled increases until 1:0.01 with the highest dose of resveratrol (5mM). At lower ratios no cleavage/degradation is observed. In other word it seems that the cleaving activity is due to resveratrol concentration increase rather than the ratio R-Cu. In fact the authors confirm this reading of the results (“The data also show that the extent of cleavage/degradation is positively correlated with the starting concentrations of R and Cu”) but suggest also “the existence of a paradoxical synergistic relationship” (even in the title) that is not at all supported by the data. The word “synergism” does not seem appropriate. As far as eukaryotic genomic DNA a similar behavior is showed: the cleavage/degradation of DNA is evident from ratio 1:0.2 to 1:0.002,not at lower ratios. I suggest: To use (certainly in the title and throughout the text) a less demanding word than “synergism”. Furthermore a synergistic effect would require also a statistical evaluation. To provide an explanation and/or an interpretative hypothesis about the showed effect present only in the middle ratios. To provide a more accurate description of figure 7, 8 and specially 9.
