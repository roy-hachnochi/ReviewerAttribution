The presentation of the research work is satisfactory with citations of the literature. Authors should consider citing some recent references starting from 2010 onwards. The study design is technically sound. The design of experiment used is appropriate in establishing the model for the variables involved. The methods used in data collection of proximate composition, mineral and phytic acid contents were outlined and explained in detail for replication by others. The statistical analysis was done appropriately to establish the interaction effect of the main factors and generate prediction equations for the responses. All the data have been provided in tables and figures. Superscripts have been indicated to show the significant differences among the samples. The conclusions drawn have been summarized clearly and are adequately supported by the results. The following should be addressed: Discussion on crude fat: The sentence : “Rice varieties Edeget, Nerica-4 and X-jigna had no signifcant effect on crude fat content (P0.05)”. Comment : the less than sign should be changed to greater than (). Discussion on protein content: The sentence : "The analysis shows that the protein content is signifcantly (P0.05) increased as the proportion of teff increased”. Comment : The sentence should be changed because from Table 1 the protein content increased and decreased as the proportion of teff increased. An appropriate reason should be given to explain this trend. Discussion on Phytic acid : The sentence : "There was a signifcant (P0.05) differences in phytic acid content among the blended products” Comment 1 : The sentence should be changed to read as follows: "There were significant differences (p0.05) in phytic acid content among the blended products". Comment 2 : In all three rice varieties, decrease in teff content of the blends resulted in decrease in phytic acid content. The reason(s) which could account for this trend should be explained.
