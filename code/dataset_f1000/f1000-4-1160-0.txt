The authors concentrate on their core message for better characterization and documentation and for shifting toward renewable reagents. It is important to note that more characterization would be better but demanding the inclusion of assays of limited predictive power would increase the cost of antibodies without substantially benefiting the end users. "Moreover, we are not convinced that the development of special conditions by each lab is an advisable development, because in many cases these may not be fully documented which - again - would undermine reproducibility. While it is self-evident that the researchers are ultimately responsible for the validity of all their results, lab internal quality certifications in our view are not the best way to proceed in an ever growing experimental field." This is not what meant in my review. Instead, I mean that what an end user studies would always represents novel conditions (different cells, different culture conditions, different number of cells, etc.). So, strictly speaking, there is no guarantee that even a highly validated antibody functions in the actual experiment. The field would benefit greatly by establishing better internal controls that are included in each experiment, particularly for ChIP.
