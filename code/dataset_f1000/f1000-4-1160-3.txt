Antibody reliability in biomedical research is of utmost importance. The quality of these reagents in chromatin biology applications is of particular concern given their position as essential tools for most techniques characterizing the cellular abundance and genomic distribution of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs). I agree with the Kungulovski and Jeltsch that increased accountability needs to be demanded from companies who sell histone PTM antibodies, and their four recommended quality control measures are reasonable expectations. In addition, it should also be noted that the practice of retaining catalog numbers for new polyclonal antibody lots is unacceptable and misleading. Moreover, and particularly in light of the increased awareness of antibody concerns in the field, experimentalists and epigenome consortium leaders (e.g., ENCODE, BLUEPRINT) should be more rigorous in their own evaluation of histone PTM antibodies when choosing a reagent for their study. Antibody specificity data and lot numbers used should also be standard requests from journal editors and reviewers. Accountability clearly needs to come from all parties if we are to continue benefiting from the use of these affinity tools in chromatin research.
