This Opinion Article introduces an interesting hypothesis connecting ammonia with ALS. The article initially begins with a discussion about the variety of etiologies of ALS and how their disparate onset and pathology is an unexplained area in the field. His main argument is the liver may be a locus for the variety of etiologies and specifically, hepatic steatosis is a unique link to motor neuron diseases, including ALS. This Opinion Article is replete with references supporting each of the statements from skeletal muscle to the various metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis and glycogen metabolism), to the deficits in vital organelles (e.g. lysosomes and Golgi). The latter part of the review introduces the role of calcium binding proteins and how ammonia dyshomeostasis contributes to neurodegeneration. The only shortcoming is the discussion on the mechanism of ammonia which mainly focuses on the in vitro application and exposure to ammonia; no chemical mechanisms following ammonia’s path of chemical reaction using labeled material is cited. While it is not the role of the Opinion Article to present these types of experiments. The lack of these cited references does weaken the hypothesis of ammonia’s connection to ALS. However, this article provides an interesting area of reading that may open new avenues of experimentation for researchers that are focused on understanding the connection between ammonia and not only ALS, but other diseases such as HD and PD.
