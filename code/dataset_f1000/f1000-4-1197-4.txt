The authors reported a case of S-M grade 5 AVM successfully treated by microsurgical resection. I have some questions about as below. How did the authors measure the size of AVM. How did they distinguish hematoma from AVM? Was the AVM alone really above 6 cm in diameter? The authors should show the image such as T2-weighted images of MRI or enhanced CT clearly indicating the size of AVM. Was the AVM really located in the eloquent area? The authors should show the location of nidus clearly. I think not nidus but only hematoma was located in the insult. Magnification of figures 3 and figures 4 was too high. The authors should show angiograms of A-P view and lateral view with less magnification. Why didnâ€™t the authors perform preoperative embolization? I think it would be helpful in cases of high-grade AVMs.
