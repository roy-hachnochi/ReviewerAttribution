Well written manuscript regarding a controversial yet very important topic: the management of axial low back pain. Comments: I am assuming people with a history of surgery were excluded. Is this an appropriate assumption? How long had these people experienced low back pain? Did they have pain every day or exacerbations? Myofascial manipulation requires the treating provider to be experienced with the evaluation of the patient that then directs treatment. How did you attempt to standardize this?
