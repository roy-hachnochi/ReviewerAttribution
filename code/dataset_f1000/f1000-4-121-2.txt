In this paper Gilad and Mizrahi-Man reanalyze a high-profile dataset from the ENCODE consortium that was used to argue that gene expression levels are more similar for different tissues from the same species than the same tissues from different species, a somewhat counterintuitive result that contradicts earlier claims (including those by Gilad). The main result of this new work is a simple observation: in the original experiment described in Lin et al ., samples from the same species were run in the same sequencing batch. Since there are well-known batch effects, this is poor experimental design that calls into question the claim by Lin et al . that data clusters by species, since the data could instead by clustering by sequencing batch. There is always a bit of a challenge in figuring out what to do with an observation. As the authors point out, this aspect of the experimental design effectively renders the data useless for asking questions about the relative contribution of species and tissue to gene expression variation. Yet it would seem like too light of a paper to simply say "The original authors messed up. Their claims are therefore invalid. QED." So this paper contains a few analyses designed to ILLUSTRATE the point they make. They are not exactly results, since, once you realize that batch and species are completely confounded, correcting for batch will inevitably remove the species signal. In this context, its a bit weird to present such an analysis as if it is a result, but I dont really see a way around it, and the authors are forthright in pointing out that their main observation is that the data from Lin et al are useless for addressing this issue, and that they can make no claims, even after correcting for batch effects, about what the data actually do say.
