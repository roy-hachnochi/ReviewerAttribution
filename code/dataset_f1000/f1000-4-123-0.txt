Dr Venkatraghavan and colleagues have undertaken a cross-sectional observation study in a tertiary centre in Toronto, evaluating the utility of a raised Neutrophil:Lymphocyte Ratio as a biomarker for risk stratification in the perioperative period. A raised NLR was compared with conventionally accepted risk assessment tools such as the ASA physical status and the RCRI scores. Multivariate regression analysis was done to investigate independent predictors of a raised NLR. The authors found that a raised NLR was associated with malignancy, congestive heart failure and polypharmacy. A relationship between raised NLR and 2 cutoffs and increased ASA physical status and RCRI scores was observed. Several possible opportunities of improvement of the manuscript may exist: This is a novel study investigating raised NLR and perioperative comorbidities and conventional risk stratification tools. Most readers would not be familiar with the biological plausibility of a raised NLR and perioperative outcomes. More details may be included in the introduction and discussion to make this clearer to the readers. Dr Peter Nagele and colleagues published a landmark paper correlating a raised High-Sensitivity Troponin T test and perioperative outcomes in Nagele et al (2013) . This publication should be referenced together with other biomarkers in the introduction and discussion such as the BNP and CRP. The authors have chosen to represent the association between NLR and ASA physical status and RCRI scores in the form of Odds Ratio. I wonder if correlation statistics and/or Receiver Operating Characteristics at various cutoffs may be utilized and represented in the results as well? All in all, Dr Venkatraghavan et al have undertaken an interesting study which answers a novel and fairly important clinical question. I would like to congratulate them on a stellar effort.
