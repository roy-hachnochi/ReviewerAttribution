I would like to thank the authors for this excellent revised version and for having addressed all my previous comments. This paper present a very useful toolkit for assessing different spatial scenarios of fisheries management, including the creation of marine protected areas. The proposed case study on Atlantic cod illustrates the potential of the toolkit and the results are discussed thoroughly. The sensitivity analysis shows the importance of some parameters for the model results. In particular, it shows that when minimum age of catch is increased by one year, the Status Quo scenario produces a higher NPV than does the Targeted scenario. This seems an important result: if I understand correctly, it could imply that setting a higher age at catch would ensure an optimal management of the fishery and achieve better economic results than creating MPAs according to a targeted scenario. This might discourage further developments and extension of the current MPA system. However, as the authors state in this article, there are multiple benefits associated with the creation of MPAs, such as the ease of implementation relatively to some fishery regulation (would it be possible to set precisely a minimum age of maturation?) and compliance (would it be easy to control that the minimum age is respected?). I think that the final decision process will be complex and beyond the scope of this case-study presentation, for which the authors have already provided an ample discussion. Some minor points: In the “Population dynamics” section the term “fisherman” is used as singular (twice) where it should be plural (“fishermen”), please check and correct. Table 1. It seems that the legend has a mistake for the moratorium part? At least, it should say that “moratorium” is a percent occurrence probability (if I understand correctly) Thanks for this useful and nice contribution.
