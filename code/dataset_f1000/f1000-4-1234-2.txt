This paper reports a quantitative tool that can be used to analyze the economical impact of different network designs for marine protected areas. The framework is quite flexible and will provide a useful toolkit for discussing the pros and cons of different designs. That said, I feel that it considered very little discussion regarding other potential algorithms and also how to consider multiple species at the same time. In particular, would the authors suggest to model different species separately and then build a consensus across different MPA designs? Some discussion on this issue would be particularly important. Another issue is environmental heterogeneity. I think it would be important that the authors at least discuss how environmental heterogeneity should be taken into account in designing MPA across different scenarios. Large habitat heterogeneity within a given area or across areas would certainly lead to different design decisions than small heterogeneity. How does the matrix and quality of corridors should be considered. In sum, I think this is a much needed tool but the authors need to provide some additional information on how they see it being applied considering multiple species and environmental heterogeneity.
