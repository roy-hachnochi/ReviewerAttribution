Peer reviewing an article on the pitfalls of peer review reminds you of the responsibility of an act that, due to time pressure, we often do less proficiently than we should. In addition, if the author of the manuscript happens to be a friend, you get directly confronted with the essence of the topic. Can we be impartial about the work of friends and direct competitors? My own opinion is that we ought to if we want to be credible as a collective; but we need to be transparent about it. In more practical terms, as van Gunsteren puts it, finding peers in the same field of expertise both with no connection and in no competition with a given author could be an arduous task. If we talk about an opinion article it is even questionable that the reviewer should prescribe the author any changes (assuming the article is void of nonsense, excess of commonplace arguments or bad writing). Opinion articles are probably the most personal form of scientific writing, their only requisites being the ability to provoke thought and generate discussion on a topic of interest. The article by van Gunsteren fully complies with these principles. It also has a wider focus than recent articles on peer review, thus including the evaluation of publications, projects (ex-ante, but a similar discussion would be valid for ex-post evaluations), institutions and researchers. The discussion of the four levels of peer review is illustrated with examples, understandably centred on the author’s own experience. Some of the examples would seem anecdotal wouldn’t we all have similar experiences to tell. In summary, a concise, easy-reading article worth adding to recent discussions on an evaluation system that while far from ideal is still the best we have.
