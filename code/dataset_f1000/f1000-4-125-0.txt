This study relates to antibody specificity for the characterization of ABCB9 (transporter associated with antigen processing-like (TAP-L)) expression. The methods and results are explained in detail and the abstract and title are appropriate for the study. TAP-L knockout/wild type heterozygous mice from a commercial source were crossed to obtain homozygous TAP-L knockout mice. TAP-L deficiency in the knockout is confirmed by PCR. Cell lysates from bone marrow-derived dendritic cells of wild type or TAP-L-deficient mice were subject to immunoblotting analyses with a rabbit polyclonal anti-TAP-L antibody from Abcam (http://www.abcam.com/ABCB9-antibody-ab86222.html). An expected band at 84 kDa is seen. However, similar sized bands are seen in lanes containing lysates from either the wild type or the knockout mice, suggesting that the tested antibody is not specific for TAP-L, at least based on immunoblotting analyses. The commercial vendor should take note of this study. The commercial link also indicates immunoprecipitations and immunohistochemistry as tested applications for the antibody. These applications could also be tested using the knockout cells as negative controls. While the study correctly emphasizes the importance of relevant controls prior to the use of commercial antibodies, it appears that a number of TAP-L-specific antibodies are available from different commercial sources. It would be useful to the reader to know which of the commercial antibodies are in fact specific for TAP-L.
