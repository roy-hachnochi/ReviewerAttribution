This in an interesting antibody validation article showing that a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide (475-525) within the human TAP-L transporter (84 kDa) apparently cross-reacts with another unknown protein of similar size within TAP-L deficient murine dendritic cells. Since mouse TAP-L has a decent homology to TAP2 (77.5 kDa) and TAP1 (78.9 kDa) the authors should precipitate mTAP1/2 and perform a blot with this polyclonal antibody to prove or disprove that the reported cross-reactivity is to TAP. Please follow this link to view the homology of mTAPL(a.a. 475-525) with mTAP2, and with mTAP1: https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/supplementary/6535/041aa8a5-5260-4b06-929e-b91f6b3c51e9.tif
