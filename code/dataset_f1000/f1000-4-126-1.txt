This is an interesting article that makes a solid case for teaching developmental biology via practical classes employing a range of different species and using a number of different technical approaches. It is clear that the students would gain a lot of valuable insights and depth of understanding of developmental biology by this approach. Actually seeing embryos is something that is likely to grab the imagination of most students. I would ask for a bit more information on some aspects. Could we have a clearer idea of the assessments used? What exactly were the three pieces of course work? I would also like more information on how well the course worked. Were there some areas that were more successful than others? Were some aspects of the course more difficult for the students to master than others? What aspects of the course were most engaging for the students?
