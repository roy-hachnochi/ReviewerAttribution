Upon my query as to why the authors did not utilize anti-human IgA for their assay the authors now responded by saying that they did indeed use this reagent and that the original description was in error. Now that I can understand how the test was conducted I still find the raw data quite uninterpretable. To be fair to the authors I do not feel I should contribute further to the peer review of this article.
