In this submission the authors wish to evaluate the efficacy of using a protein (Ag38-rec) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis to determine whether it can be used to differentiate between pediatric patients who have TB from those suspected of disease. The use of salivary IgA is a promising non-invasive approach for testing pediatric patients. They conclude that the approach may be useful for identifying presumptive infected patients. Unfortunately the submission suffers from two major flaws that prevent any confirmation of these conclusions. Firstly, no data was presented to show the purity of the Ag38-rec produced in their laboratory. Secondly, the rationale and reliability of the method used to determine the titer of salivary IgA was not understandable to this reviewer such that it is impossible to evaluate their results. It is unclear why they did not utilize a more traditional method 1 of using anti-human IgA antibodies in the Elisa. References 1.

I have put some more explanation for Fig 1. Concerning the second question. Truly we do not know the exact answer, it also wonders us, because our preliminary experiment using checker board demonstrated that saliva from TB and healthy children produced a significantly different immune response against Ag38rec (Fig.2). Furthermore the PPD we used as positive control also showed the similar result compared to our antigen. We exclude the possibility that the problem is due to the non-specific criteria during TB screening (such as lymphadenitis, fewer and coughing) because we also performed Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and X-rays that showed 100% positive for all TB suspected children. Unfortunately we did not perform TST test and X-ray for healthy children, since there was no indication that they were sick. So the most likely reason could be that due to impurity of our Ag38rec protein that consequently did not recognize salivary sIgA consistently. Your third question concerning the number of sample we used. There were 26 six samples, it is just that, due to the limited number of hole in the apparatus (92), we can only load 20 samples in each run. The rest of sample (6) we loaded in the second run.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This manuscript covers an important area of novel diagnostic tests for paediatric TB. They highlight the well known challenge of obtaining appropriate specimens for identifying mycobacterium tuberculosis in children with PTB. The authors report on the use of an in-house sIgA assay for diagnosis of pulmonary TB in children. It is not clear if the sIgA assay has been standardized or validated, so I asked a microbiologist to also review the manuscript. The authors found no difference in the sIgA assay between the children with PTB and those without TB. If the sIg A assay was clearly described and validated, the findings may have provided useful information for future studies. However, the methodology of the assay has major limitations. Co-reviewer: a microbiologist comments The results are still not well presented to trust the conclusions. The details on how the optimal concentrations of Ag38-rec, PPD and volume of saliva was determined are missing yet the are needed to yield confidence in the author's procedures. Whether the second purification step of protein Ag38-rek was optimized after the failure of the purification kit remains unclear. The use of PPD as a positive control and a comparator is not clear. Results of the dot blot are very subjectively interpreted yet even the criteria is not clear to ensure reliability. Generally, I find the methods and results are not well presented to enable critical understanding of the findings and relate them to the conclusion.

I apologize for the late response. Concerning your comments, here are my answers: We have made several changes in Results. The optimization of the amount of Ag38-rec to produce the strongest immune response to sIgA was conducted using checker board containing several concentration of Ag38-rec i.e 500 ng, 250 ng and 125 ng. We provide figure 2. What we meant in the sentence …”the best concentration of Ag38-rec …….with 25 ul saliva”, is that we used 25ul saliva in all concentration of Ag38-rec in checkerboard, but we did not make any optimization in the amount of saliva used in this experiment. Because it was already done in previous experiment (Tri Yudani et al, 2014). Actually the correct amount is 50 ul. But I have made correction. The purification of protein did not fail. We used IMAC (Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography) kit. It is very straightforward method for protein purification. We did not do any improvement after second purification step, we have just followed with dialysis step after protein was eluted from the kit. Dialysis belong to the purification procedure, that is why we did not verify the result of dialysis process in SDS PAGE to avoid unnecessary wasting of Antigen 38. PPD (purified protein derivative) used in Tuberculin sensitivity test, a screening tool for tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculin sensitivity test. That is why PPD is commonly used as a positive control in testing for new protein used for diagnostic agent. (see Chan et al. , 2000) The Corel Draw graphic suite X4 (Corel, USA) program was used to interpret the color range of the blot(s). The gradation of color was quantified to numerical value using Corel Photopaint 11. As standard we used PPD. Positive and negative value was based on the cut-off of the median value of the positive control (PPD) after reaction with saliva of the TB group. A dot was regarded as positive when the value was below the cut-off point and as negative when the value was higher than the cut-off point. A positive result was defined as a dark blue or dark purple spot (50%) on the blot. View more View less Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed. reply Respond Report a concern

Now that I can understand how the test was conducted I still find the raw data quite uninterpretable.

After I checked the serological test, I found a mistype concerning the secondary antibody I used in DotBlot method. Truly, instead of mouse anti- Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ag38 monoclonal antibody (AbD, Serotec, England, cat.no.0100-0519)[T1] I used Anti-human IgA (alpha-chain specific) alkaline phosphatase conjugate (SIGMA, USA.Product.no.
