Overall this is a thorough review of the current accepted treatments for childhood/pediatric SLE. Data provided was fair and balanced with a good overview of the current literature. First paragraph of introduction could use supporting references. It would be helpful to clarify which studies included pediatric patients throughout (it is clear in the cytoxan section but notably absent in the azathioprine section). Additionally, the corticosteroid section includes recommendations on dosing schedules but is lacking references. Similarly, the Adjunctive Therapy section could also benefit from additional sources. There was a recent study (published after this paper was submitted) on maintenance therapy that would be appropriate for inclusion: Tian SY, Feldman BM, Beyene J, Brown PE, Uleryk EM, Silverman ED. Immunosuppressive Therapies for the Maintenance Treatment of Proliferative Lupus Nephritis: A Systematic Review and Network Metaanalysis .J Rheumatol. 2015 Aug;42(8):1392-400. In "Less Supported Therapies" section, it would be useful to know cause of fatalities in study that was concluded early due to deaths. In conclusion, this is a well-researched review with a good summary of the available data. Additional sources could be added to assist the reader looking to do further research, but the article as it stands will provide a useful resource for those looking to learn more about this topic.
