The author has provided a review of proliferative nephritis in childhood SLE, the aim of the review was to concentrate on the pediatric data where available. Comments: Introduction References are left out from the introduction; the first 4 paragraphs are making statements essentially without any references. In para 3 the study cited, authored by Mok et al ., is primarily in adults and that needs to be clarified. Para 4 line 4: add in "based on a few" Corticosteroids Remove the 2 s in lines 4 and 5 of para 1. Reference the statement on alternate day dosing and reduced side effects. As the aim of the paper was to outline studies in children, I would expand the studies referenced regarding pediatrics in this section They have been reduced to a paragraph. Refer back to pediatric vs adult outcomes in these studies and if they differ. Azathioprine The authors have failed to mention studies done in children with AZA some referenced below: J Rheumatol. 2014 Oct;41(10):1998-2007 Immunosuppressive Therapies for the Induction Treatment of Proliferative Lupus Nephritis: A Systematic Review and Network Metaanalysis. Simon Yu Tian, Brian M. Feldman, Joseph Beyene, Patrick E. Brown, Elizabeth M. Uleryk and Earl D. Silverman J Rheumatol. 2002 Dec;29(12):2635-42. Longterm followup of childhood lupus nephritis. Hagelberg S, Lee Y, Bargman J, Mah G, Schneider R, Laskin C, Eddy A, Gladman D, Urowitz M, Hebert D, Silverman E. Please also reference the ACR article on using AZA as maintenance. Rituximab Mention that children will need to be revaccinated, particularly against pneumococcus. Belimumab Specifically address the efficacy of belimumab in proliferative nephritis in these studies. Adjunctive Therapy First word, first line is In but should be An. Conclusion Regarding the statement in last paragraph (life expectancy in proliferative LN) reference this and compare results between adults and children.
