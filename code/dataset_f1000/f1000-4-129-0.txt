This paper discusses how open models may be adopted by a traditional professional training ecosystem - the one of food safety. It explains the basic concepts around open models, explores examples of relevant open cases, and recommends some open policies that the particular ecosystem should follow in order to become more open. It also examines two specific cases of food safety training stakeholders: one in China and one in Colombia. I found very interesting the fact that different types of open practices have been examined - including open data, content, government, software, hardware etc. This is providing a wide range of tools and interventions that can be adopted by the stakeholders in such an ecosystem, so that new business models may be explored. On the other hand, I believe that putting everything on the table in the case of such a traditional training market may be too radical and in a way intimidate stakeholders. I would find it useful if the authors could reflect on this concern, possibly elaborating a bit more about a potential strategy that someone should adopt to introduce such novel models in a traditional training ecosystem. For instance, elaborating a bit on the Innovators and the Early Adopters that can help introduce such a radical innovation in the ecosystem, using ideas from approaches like the ones presented in the classic book Crossing the Chasm ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm ). Overall, a very solid submission and a novel contribution that provides some insight in the way that openness can be introduced in training markets.
