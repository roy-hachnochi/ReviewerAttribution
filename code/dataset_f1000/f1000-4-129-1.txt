This is a concept paper proposing an "open ecosystem" approach for the World Bank-led Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP). The title and abstract accurately and succinctly capture the aims of the paper, in which the authors advocate compellingly for abandoning current business practices and replacing them with open models across multiple strategies and tactics for the GFSP, with the aim of improving the ability of GFSP to meet its goals. Through relevant case examples and a thorough elucidation of open strategies (in Appendix A), the authors build the case for their argument. The authors make their case for content re-use by articulating how the GFSP will build on the efforts in China. Modification and re-use are key attributes of openly licensed content that have been well demonstrated and are documented in Appendix A. However, the case studies would benefit from sharing outcome measures, if available, from previous efforts that are relevant to the GFSP, such as demonstrating how open practices in the China example have magnified the reach of the training programs compared with proprietary approaches. Overall, the authors recommendations follow logically from their analysis. The recommendations, while targeted at a specific World Bank effort, are generalizable, thus making the paper relevant to a wide audience.
