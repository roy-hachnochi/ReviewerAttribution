This manuscript deals with the possible alleviative effect of pan-neural supplementation of the longevity-related, pleiotropic deacetylase SIRT1 on a mouse model of MPTP-induced parkinsonism. The present work was totally based on negative data. However, the entire experimental procedures are sound and the anatomical results obtained are well presented. Since the present work has a potential to provide a certain contribution to the progress in Parkinsons disease research, this reviewer recommends that the manuscript may be accepted as it is.
