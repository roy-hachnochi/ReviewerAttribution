The manuscript provides very useful data for researchers aiming to analyze whole mosquito genomes; especially when sequencing is still expensive and having a reliable DNA extraction protocol is essential. The abstract, justification, protocols and results are very well described. Some comments: Did the preservation of individual mosquitoes – 80% alcohol or -20C– affect the DNA yield? I am not sure if this was an additional variable. Please clarify. Mention the number of specimens you used for each combination of lysis and extraction methods. Table 1: Do ‘X, 2L, 2R, 3L, ..chrM’ columns correspond to mean coverage’s? Please add a brief description of these terms in the table legend. Discussion: the statement ‘the amount of magnetic beads…had little effect on DNA yield’. This variable was not mentioned in the methods section. Please add, mention specific bead amounts tested, sample size and statistical test. Table 2: Please mention in this table (or table 1) what ‘Mt, 2R….X’ stands for. Are ‘Mt and chM’ mitochondrial DNA? Table 2: State the difference between A. gambiae 1 and A. gambiae 2 groups. Table 2: There are significant differences between the genotype-calls in the WGA and original DNA. Would you suggest having a third method to validate your genotypes? Maybe regular DNA sequencing. I think this could add to your discussion. Table 3: Add a column with your sample sizes.
