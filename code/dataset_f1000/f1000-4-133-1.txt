I would like to thank the authors for their specific responses to my initial comments and for clarifying many of these concerns with substantial changes to the text of the submission that both clarify the purpose of the study and add to the data collected. My initial review focused on three main areas for consideration by the authors: Conclusions based on the survey/interview of a single academic entrepreneur; Expansion of perspectives on reasons for innovations not being commercialized and; Increase engagement with academic entrepreneurs on campus that have been both successful and unsuccessful with bringing their ideas to market. With the new submission, I believe the authors have addressed my three suggested areas of focus. It is now much clearer to me that this work was a supplement to an initial study performed to understand commercialization on campus. Through edits to the manuscript this rationale/purpose is now understood as a follow-up rather than a total brand new analysis. As such, there was a certain methodology that was being continued from the initial work that clarified the they were focused on as being faculty members that have successfully commercialized research. The study also increased the number of individuals that were interviewed from a single individual to multiple on campus allowing for a broader set of perspectives than initially obtained. Further, the authors did add focus on the limitations with the study based on design and purpose allowing the reader to more clearly understand the approach. In conclusion, I would approve publication of this new version of the manuscript. The only additional recommendation I would provide from a practical perspective is that when presenting these findings to the university administrators, the authors should also offer some solutions to the issues they have uncovered. Problem solving will be viewed more favorably than purely problem identifying.
