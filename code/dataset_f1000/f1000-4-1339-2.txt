In this manuscript, results of an ICSI programme in Khartoum, Sudan are reported. The amount of new information is limited: as indicated in the discussion, a host of published papers already concluded that maternal age is an important factor determining the success of ICSI or IVF procedures. The manuscript might be improved on the following aspects: There is hardly information on the male partners. Data on hormone levels and sperm quality might be as important as the data on hormone levels, endometrial thickness and age in the female partners. There is no information on sperm retrieval, ICSI procedure or embryo culture. On page 3, right-hand column, line 6 "HCG"should probably read "FSH". What happens when pregnancy results are normalized for numbers of embryos transferred? Can the difference in numbers of pregnancies in the different age groups be explained on basis of this number? It might be better to replace "ovum" (line 2 under Discussion and Conclusions) and "ovums" (line 2 in right-hand column on page 6) with "ova".
