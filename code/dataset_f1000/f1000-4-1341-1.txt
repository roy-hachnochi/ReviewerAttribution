The study is well designed and the results are convincing. The authors mentioned that the time period of data collection is from 2004 to 2008 which means 5 years (year 2008 is included). However in the table and figures the mentioned period was from 2004 to 2007 which means 4 year. Perhaps authors need to clarify this issue.
