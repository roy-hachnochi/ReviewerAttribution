This is a good Ab validation study, where the authors testified multiple established Ab purification strategies in an autoimmune disease model. Non-specific proteins present in an autoantibody product could potentially affect its usage in many aspects. For example, the authors pointed out that pure autoantibodies can be more efficient in the study of both autoantigens and anti-idiotypic antibodies, although neither were further characterized. As this article mainly validated and discussed purification strategies, it will be more straightforward to emphasize only on Ab production, but not characterization, which was not the focus as I can tell.
