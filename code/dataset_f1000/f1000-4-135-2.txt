This article describes simple purification methods of highly pure antibodies from supernatant of human monoclonal B-cell cultures. However, all of the methods are already known. They are not new. One good thing that this article is showing is an example for the purification grades depending on the purification methods and culturing condition of the cells with and without FCS to avoid contamination with bovine antibodies. In my opinion, the abstract is not appropriated and overemphasized with points that are not directly related to this article. Characterization of the antibodies is weak. For the sentence on page 2 at the end of second paragraph “Utilization of impure GAD65Abs in the generation of anti-Id Abs and determination of their protective role in T1D pathogenesis may lead to unconvincing or inconclusive results.”, the authors have to explain with citations, why the purity of the antibody is important, and how the impure antibodies lead to unconvincing or inconclusive results.
