This is a thorough discussion of using 3C for metagenome reconstruction. I was a little surprised by the elaborate review-style article together with some experimental data but I think it works well. I agree with the points made by the other reviewer (Mick Watson). It would be nice to see more complex metagenomes tackled! One final suggestion - the reference to graph genomes is poor and rather insufficient - there's been a lot of recent work in this area. I refer you to Dilthey et al, 2015, Improved genome inference in the MHC using a population reference graph for one reference. References 1.
