Liu and Darling present an excellent review of the application of 3C capture techniques to metagenomic data analysis and I recommend indexing. There are two issues I would have liked to have seen discussed/presented more: Often metagenomic samples undergo bead bashing in order to disrupt the gram+ cell walls, and this often results in highly fragmented DNA. It would be interesting to hear the thoughts of the authors on how this might affect the results from 3C capture techniques. Figure 1 shows a beautiful reconstruction of 4 genomes. However, many real environmental samples contain 1000+ genomes. The authors discuss this in great detail, and the problems that ensue; however, synthetic metagenomes exist consisting of more than 4 but less than 1000, and I wonder why nobody has applied 3C techniques to those synthetic communities?
