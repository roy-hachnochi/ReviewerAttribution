The manuscript is well-written, and will be acceptable after a few minor suggestions are incorporated: The abstract should contain more information on the results of the paper. I would rather like to see (in the abstract) how much light your pyrosequencing has shed on the origins and processing pathways of fine particles. In the discussion section, the authors write “[…] to our knowledge, this is the first study to document Cryptomycota in streams (Jones et al., 2011).” – the authors could highlight recent reports on Cryptomycota from fresh water bodies. In the conclusions, the authors write “In other words, it is not possible to deduce the origin of the stream FPOM by looking at taxonomic composition of its mycoflora.”. This is a possible contradiction with the last sentences of the abstract and discussion sections? These suggestions are also available as an annotated PDF .
