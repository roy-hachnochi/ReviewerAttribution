In this paper, S. Stuart and colleagues present an elegant and thorough protocol for testing visuo-cognition during gait. Authors aim to examine the contribution of cognition and vision in gait in Parkinson's Disease (independent roles and interaction between both functions), and the role of visuo-cognition in gait in Parkinson's Disease. The novelty of current study is taking into consideration the combined and interactive impact that cognitive and visual function impairments have on gait in Parkinson's Disease. To date, previous studies in this field have investigated the independent contribution of cognition and vision to gait in Parkinson's Disease. The described experimental design, including controls and methods, is totally adequate. Although the current version does not report the results, my expectation is that this study, once complete, will impact the field.
