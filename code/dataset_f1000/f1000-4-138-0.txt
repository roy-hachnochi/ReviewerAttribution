This paper deals with Bacteriophages as a model for carbon regulation in aquatic systems. The increase in inorganic carbon content was 60-70-fold in samples with bacteria and phage, and 50-55-fold for samples with bacteria alone being reported by the authors. The authors presented their experimental results quite well enough, that can be easily understandable to the readers. This manuscripts meets the necessary standards for this journal. The authors should pay attention on few of the concerns enlisted below. This manuscript should be acceptable after the changes suggested herewith. The figures (3 and 4) are not mentioned in the manuscript text, The discussion part may be elaborated to have much clear idea of the present work and its impact. Please consider to use abbreviations instead of full forms, wherever necessary, e.g. 2 h instead of 2 hours in Materials and methods section, and instead of in "Results" section. Please follow the reference styles with the journal guidelines. e.g. Hiroshi Ogawa et al. , ....should be corrected as Ogawa et al ., followed by reference number in superscript. Reference number 3 is missing in introduction. References should be arranged in proper sequence. Please check all other references. Authors should elaborate the Results section, as results of Fig. 1 to 4 are not discussed. I suggest author to overcome short details in this particular section.
