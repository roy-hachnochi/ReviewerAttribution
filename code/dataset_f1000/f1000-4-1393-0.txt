Gibb et al . have made an important contribution to our understanding of the population health impacts of food-borne chemical exposures. I noted one minor data gap in the description of the approach taken for the dioxin analysis. In contrast to the other chemicals assessed, the authors did not report the disability weights (DWs) for dioxin outcomes in the main text; they are found only in the Supplementary material. My main questions, however, relate to the conclusions. I feel that two of the paperâ€™s bottom lines (on raising awareness of the impacts of food-borne chemicals and the need for better exposure data) deserve additional attention. On raising awareness: after reading the article, I was looking for some further characterization of the burden estimates. The estimates do seem substantial but what is the appropriate context for reference? The authors make reference to a Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment assessment that made some comparisons of disease burdens for both chemicals and infectious agents in foods (listed as reference #12 Van Kreijl et al 2006). Perhaps that approach or some comparisons of the reported burden estimates to the total burden of the outcomes assessed could be made. Some further characterization of the burden estimates would assist the effort to raise awareness in the public health community. On better exposure data: The main text of the paper focuses largely on the outcomes or health effects related to the chemicals. Little is said about the exposure beyond an understanding that most exposures come from food. Description of the types of exposure data represented in the literature underlying the analysis would better set up the call for biomonitoring at the conclusion.
