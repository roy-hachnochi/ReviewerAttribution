In reading the manuscript, I initially thought that the authors had demonstrated that their modification of a technique for proteomics was a modest improvement over previously published methods. However, when I opened the supplemental datasets, I found some issues with the data. For example, in the FASP A10k data, there are 1199 proteins listed as but 401 of these were identified from a single peptide, and 5 identified from peptides. How can a protein be identified without at least one confident peptide? Some laboratories that perform proteomic studies require 2 or more distinct peptides for a positive identification; some require 5 or more. If the latter, only 332 of the 1199 proteins would make the cut-off. In addition, there are columns in the supplemental dataset with no data (log precursor, fraction of the total signal, Apex retention time). Whats the point of including a column with no data? The supplemental datasets are not helpful in understanding the results, and should be modified. The main issue is whether the increased number of proteins reflects a real improvement in the technique, or just more noise in the system that gives tentative identifications that may not be real. In looking through the supplemental data, it was not clear to me that this is the case. At a minimum, the supplement needs to be edited and proteins based on peptides should be removed. This will change many of the other figures/tables, which should only reflect proteins identified from 1 or more peptide! (2 would be preferable, but is not acceptable)
