The manuscript by Lynch presents an R app ‘Crambled’ to ease the determination, in whole genome DNA sequencing experiments, of cellularity in tumour samples or to show the presence of sub clones in cellline samples. A shiny app displays an image of the behavior of heterozygous SNPs according to read-depth and minor allele frequency, and overlays that with the theoretical positions of chromosomal aberrations at user- defined cellularity and single copy coverage levels. The image can be produced, starting from BAM-files, by the accompanying functions of the app. The manuscript is written clearly, and describes the functionality of the package well. I have not tested all functions of the package, but the R code is understandable and straightforward. The functions are commented throughout. As described in the paper, during the use of the shiny app, it is important to have an idea of the cellularity of the sample. Just playing around with the sliders does not converge to logical solutions easily. The example case 1 illustrates the usefulness of the app because it shows clearly that one of the cellularity solutions is to be preferred over the other. I would like more guidance on how to get the cellularity estimates. The references 5-9 seem to be geared mostly towards array type of data. It would be a good addition to provide a preferred solution in the workflow description. It would be good to mention the values for cellularity and single copy depth that were chosen for figure 2. In conclusion, the manuscript presents a tool that is useful in the assessment of copy-number aberrations. There are a few minor details that could be improved.
