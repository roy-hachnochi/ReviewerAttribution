Non-syndromic cleft of the lip and/or palate (NSCL/P) is considered closely related to genetic and environmental factors. As a key gene in the metabolism of folic acid which is associated to high risk of NSCL/P, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1) polymorphisms rs 2237225 (c. 1958GA) may be associated with the susceptibility of NSCL/P. However, controversial conclusions on this association have been reported by different groups. This paper conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of eligible case-control studies which is necessary before we go forward to larger sample size studies. This paper is scientifically sound, clear and well-organized. However, these following revisions may make it more interesting. Page 6, Figure 1, Eligibility section, the number of full-text articles excluded with reasons should be 5. The lack of folic acid will result in many health problems such as neural tube defects, macrocytic anemia, mental depress and so on, not only NSCL/P. MTHFD1 is important in the metabolism of folic acid. Why is it suggested that MTHFD1 polymorphisms may be associated with the susceptibility of NSCL/P, but not neural tube defects ( Meng et al., 2015 ) or other diseases ( Weiner et al. , 2014 ; Silva et al. , 2011 )? It is mentioned in the Discussion section that controversial results about the MTHFD1 polymorphism rs2236225 (c. 1958GA) have been reported in different articles. A brief description about the controversial results and their conclusions will make the discussion more interesting. MTHFR, MTR, AND MTRR which are involved in the metabolism of folic acid are reported to be associated with high risk of NSCL/P. Why MTHFD1 which is also involved in the metabolism of folic acid shows no significant association with susceptibility to NSCL/P? Its due to the sample size or the limit of technique, or it is the truth? A brief discussion on this will be interesting.
