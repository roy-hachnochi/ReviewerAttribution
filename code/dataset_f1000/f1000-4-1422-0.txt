The authors have adequately addressed most of my concerns with the exception of the issue of re-evaluating the standard methods used for establishing food safety thresholds as applied to cannabis. The problem is with the use of the word "re-evaluate". The authors are suggesting that the negative results they obtained using cell culture-based platforms in samples that were positive using their more sensitive molecular amplification indicate a possible limitation of standard methods as applied to cannabis. This may or may not be true. The concern I have is whether their technique is overly sensitive based on current limits used in the food industry. It may be that use of molecular DNA amplification methods indicate the presence of several toxigenic species of fungi and other pathogens in food but at such low levels that standard culture-based methods would not detect them. In this case there would be no need to re-evaluate the use of standard methods that establish safety thresholds. In short, without some type of calibration between the author's technique and traditional methods there is no way of knowing whether their sensitivity is too high or traditional methods used in the food industry are somehow not capable of detecting pathogens in cannabis preparations and therefore need to be "re-evaluated".
