This is novel case report of a 14 month old with NPA who is undergoing an anesthetic. The manuscript is generally written, a few missing articles were noted, but the substance of the article is sound. The report is supported by appropriate references from the literature and the case description is succinct but complete. A modest improvement might be made by including the clinical presentation of NPA (what to be concerned about) in the introduction which would serve to focus the reader on the subsequent anesthetic management.
