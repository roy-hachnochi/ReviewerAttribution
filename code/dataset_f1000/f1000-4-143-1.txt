This paper asks a very interesting question and uses a well-established motor learning paradigm in an attempt to answer it. I do, however, have concerns about the data and how they are interpreted. The low number of Ps is problematic. There is not enough consistency in either the control group or the concussion group to reach a reliable conclusion regarding the presence of a "deficit". What do the authors believe is being measured by "Direction Error at Trial 1"? It is likely that if a P is complying with instructions, they are more likely to be affected by the rotation on Trial 1. The graphs in panels a and b need to show the same scale for the control and concussion groups. The use of the word "deficit" in the title is not justified. The authors have acknowledged that they cannot make direct comparisons between groups, and using the word "deficit" is highly suggestive that the performance of the concussion group is significantly and/or clinically different from the controls. The authors have not demonstrated that. I think this is a very interesting topic and a great start. I think more data is needed (i.e. more Ps are necessary) before differences in learning following concussion can be claimed
