This manuscript provides evidence that for studying brain diseases, the use of animal models for brain connectivity analysis is opening promising avenues. In an animal model case study, the authors analyze here in the same brain the transition from health to disease. Their methodology reveals an important link between molecular and large-scale brain imaging. Despite the convincing results the authors obtain, the reader should be aware that these results, although methodologically consistent, are in need of further validation, as they are based on an isolated one-animal study.
