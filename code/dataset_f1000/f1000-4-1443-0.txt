This article describes very well the current state of bioinformatics Linux container adoption and arising problems. It offers solutions to these and also describes real-world use-cases with an existing integration into systems like Galaxy. Especially interesting is the rich annotation system, that involves ELIXIR ontologies as well as the ELIXIR registry. This is needed and a big step forward. Personally, I would like to see stronger collaborations between the mentioned other registry and Docker-build projects. I still feel we have a lot of redundant work inside of the bioinformatics community. For example I think it would be relatively easy to configure travis in biodocker to push automatically into BioShaDock, if biodocker counts as trusted partner. On the other hand biodocker can profit largely by the rich annotation system. The manuscript is well written and I would encourage everyone to participate in this project. I certainly will.
