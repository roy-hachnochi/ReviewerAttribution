This research note presents a very brief summary of a QTL analysis based on a phenotyping assay of dauer formation (at food exhaustion) in C. briggsae AI-RILs. The main issue here is the low reproducibility of the phenotyping assay across replicates and blocks. Given this problem, it appears rather surprising that some significant QTL were picked up. Further assays would be required to validate these, and this might be worthwhile doing (given that reproducible assays can be developed). If I understood correctly, adjusted or unadjusted numbers of dauers were used as trait values – why not rather use the proportion of dauers (or number of dauers adjusted by population size) for mapping? [higher densities are expected to increase dauer formation] What is the relationship between proportion of dauers and population size? Can the variability in dauer formation be explained by variability in population size? Does mapping of population size give the same QTLs? Figure 1 shows how strong replicate and block effects are, just by looking at the parental lines, AF16 and HK104. Does an ANOVA analysis of these data (or the RIL data) actually reveal a significant genotype effect (so far, only block effects are given)? What are the heritabilities? How does this QTL analysis in briggsae compare to the QTL analysis done in elegans (N2xCB4856) – number of QTLs, regions? In summary: it would be useful to add some more info and data analysis to this note. Additional comments perhaps mention that the lines used are advanced-intercross recombinant inbred lines (AI-RILs) the authors mention 451 markers but I had the impression many more were generated in Ross et al. 2011
