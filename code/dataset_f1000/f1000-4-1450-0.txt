This is a thoughtful article from the patient care point of view that is focused on the best interest of patients. With the increasing incidence of PML with natalizumab, I agree with the author's opinion that routine JCV antibody testing should be required in the TOUCH program. I also agree with the the author that the JCV antibody testing will be a part of the whole clinical picture in deciding whether or not to continue natalizumab treatment for any individual patient.
