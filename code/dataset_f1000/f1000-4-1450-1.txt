I have read the revised version of Dr. Avasarala and I think the reasoning behind the article is sound. For absolute patient safety it is necessary to check a patient's anti-JCV antibody status and most physicians follow that rule. However, I stand by my opinion that there are singular cases, where a patient might not want to know their status, because a treatment with natalizumab is the only choice they have and they do not want to be worried, if they have to be treated with natalizumab anyway. I acknowledge that for some the personal choice is not as important as the overall patient safety, but for me it is. Additionally, the introduction of the JCV serology has not lead to dramatically reduced PML incidence rates and almost all current PML cases have had their status checked before - and opted to continue their treatment. I do not see this changing with mandatory status assessments and would still state that the test needs to be available for everyone who wants to use it. As the prerequisite for this availability is the perfectly educated physician, I would argue that the initial prescription of natalizumab might be restricted to specialists, who have that education. This might already be enough to erase safety concerns and make an addition to the labelling unnecessary.
