I think that advocating to legislate science that is admittedly not yet accepted as useful is not such a good idea. Changing the goal to driving data collection to decide risk stratification that avoids PML might be a good idea. TOUCH was not created to provide risk stratification, but to help assure early diagnosis. If there is any enhancement, it might be better to advocate for frequent MRI which do appear to improve outcomes for PML. To date, there is no prospective evidence that antibody monitoring prevents PML, and indeed if anything the evidence is that it does not, since cases continue while it is available. I would suggest re-working the recommendation to a program that helps prove if antibody data actually can help physicians prevent PML. I recommended removing the distracting paragraph about JC DNA. I would recommend including frequency of imaging as part of TOUCH since it appears to help make earlier diagnosis and improve outcomes. I think questioning whether TOUCH is effective at present is realistic.
