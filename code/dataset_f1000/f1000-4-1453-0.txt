The manuscript has been moderately improved by last two revisions. My main concern was that the work was not significantly new although it was claimed so. Authors tried to tone down their claim of novelty during the revisions. Authors added more comparisons and improved the readability of figures. While I am not fully convinced on the current version of the manuscript, I believe that the tool still could be useful for the community as it combines several features together.
