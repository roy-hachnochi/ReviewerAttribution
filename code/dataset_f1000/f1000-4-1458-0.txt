The paper presented by de Moraes Arantes et al . corroborates those of others that suggest the potential significance of pretransplant TREC levels on, infection, GVHD and survival outcomes after allogeneic transplant. While very interesting, it is difficult to make firm conclusions considering the fact that there are numerous potential interactions that could influence outcome. For example, age, use of TBI and cell source have themselves been associated with risks of acute and/or chronic GVHD. An older patient might be expected to have lower pretransplant TRECs because of age. A younger with a non malignant patient might be expected to have higher TREC's because of age and lack of prior treatment. Although not shown, use of bone marrow is more likely in children than in adults. As many of these issues are not random, it is possible that these intriguing findings are not related to pretransplant TRECs but to some other factor or group of factors. Still, the data argues for larger studies as the relevant technologies are more readily available today.
