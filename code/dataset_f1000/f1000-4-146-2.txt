 Title Please specify which kdr has been genotyped. Abstract The abstract provides an adequate summary of the article. Please insert that you collected just site in Tanzania at Dar es Salaam. Moreover, you have 14 sampling sites in the Comoros according to Table 1. Please specify that you refer to Anopheles gambiae (Coetzee et al., 2013). Introduction Please explain your interest on CYP9K1 gene and add citations. Add references on insecticide resistance surveillance in Mozambique if any are available. Add the objective of the study (gene-flow of continental versus island). Minor comments: In the 1st paragraph, the last sentence change to . In the second paragraph substitute citation with numbers. Methods Study design and methods are quite well explained. Please specify how many larvae and adults have been collected from 13 locations from the three islands, and give more details in the results section. Modify Figure 1 according to Table 1 (Figure 1: image on the right side: you have missed out the number 14 and the number 15 is in a different location to that stated in Table 1. Therefore the number 15 in Figure 1 should be changed to a 14 and number 15 should be added at Dar es Salaam, Tanzania). In the table you list 15 collection sites but here you cite only 14. Results Please specify the statement malaria vectors in Comoros appear to be genetically predisposed to insecticide susceptibilityand add more details and references. Correct the citation Kabula et al. 7 to Kabula et al. 4 The samples in Mozambique seem not related to the study since only A. merus or A. arabiensis have been found. The discussions are balanced and justified based on the results obtained, even if continental sample (Tanzania) is very small.
