The paper describes a defined study which is informative and useful, and addresses an important need. It is clearly written and easy to understand. As a suggestion, the authors might consider showing the data for the quantitation which states "each 700 mg CN cigarette contains less than 0.4% (~3 mg) THC and ~11% (77 mg) THCA by weight". This is just a suggestion. Otherwise, the paper should be indexed as it now appears, in my opinion.
