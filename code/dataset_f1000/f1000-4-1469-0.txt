The relatively recently described complications of nosocomial infection, thrombosis and multi-organ failure that are caused, in part, by allogeneic red cell transfusion affect 1-2% of transfused patients, at minimum (1-4). These are severe and life threatening acute morbidities that are rarely mentioned in current textbooks and reviews, but well characterized in randomized trials of restrictive transfusion practices (2,3), autologous transfusion (5) and leukoreduced (1) transfusions. Thus mitigating the side effects of transfusion includes strategies such as restrictive red cell transfusion where validated in randomized trials, universal leukoreduction of transfusions, and implementation of blood management programs including techniques for minimizing the need for allogeneic transfusion. Such techniques can include various types of autologous transfusion (normovolemic hemodilution, cell salvage) and minimization of iatrogenic or surgical blood loss, as well as anemia management and pharmacologic approaches that mitigate anemia and thrombocytopenia. There is also preliminary data that removal of supernatant from transfused red cells and platelets may benefit patients undergoing cardiac surgery (6) and those treated for acute leukemia (7). Animal models support these possible benefits of washed transfusions (8). In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that ABO non-identical transfusions interfere with normal hemostasis, increase bleeding and mortality in hospitalized patients (9-13). Use of ABO identical transfusions is associated with reduced transfusion reactions, lung injury, alloimmunization and death in epidemiologic observational studies. While these data are still preliminary, they derive from multiple institutions and clinical settings, and have credible mechanistic explanations. ABO identical transfusions may be one key strategy to improve clinical outcomes in the future. (14) References 1.
