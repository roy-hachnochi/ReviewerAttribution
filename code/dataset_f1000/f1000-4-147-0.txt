The authors did a good job revising the paper, but they seem to have misunderstood my first comment about the block structure. My concern was not that the monkeys could have anticipated the block transitions (which I agree, the task design and data convincingly rule out). My question was whether, once they deduced that there had been a transition, the monkeys could have simply *switched* between the relatively few contexts they had over-learnt. Abrupt switching can produce a shallow change slope on average, if the switching happens at different points on different sessions. Given the weight that the authors put on a trial-by-trial learning mechanism, it seems important to consider and rule out alternative models.
