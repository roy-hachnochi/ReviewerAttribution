The paper by Kubanek and Snyder presents interesting data and modeling on matching behavior. They find that animals match in a learning task where the animals should infer which of two targets will deliver the larger reward on each trial. They find matching behavior in the animals. The behavioral choice strategy of the animals is modeled using a simple value integration algorithm. The algorithm accounts well for the choices of the animals. They also show that the algorithm can significantly outperform the animals if it over-matches, i.e. if it picks the better option more often. The main difference between the improved algorithm and the animals behavior is the decision noise or beta parameter. They then develop a second model which assumes that the noise in the animals choice behavior is driven by limits in their population code for value. The paper is well written and the study has been carefully carried out. Overall, this is nice work. I would make one comment on the final conclusion, that the noisiness in the animals choice behavior is driven by noise in their population code. Specifically, how can this hypothesis be differentiated from the possibility that the noise in the animals choice behavior is a strategic choice? In other words, is the animal limited by noise in their population coding, or are they exploring for other reasons, including perhaps satisficing? Would their decision noise (the beta parameter) be the same in another task in which values have to be learned, but under different conditions?
