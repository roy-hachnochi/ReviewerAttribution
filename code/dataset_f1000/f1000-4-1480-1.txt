This proof-of-concept clinical study reports that the peri-HCT administration of a neutrophil-derived protein, BPI, that has endotoxin-neutralizing and antibacterial properties, is well-tolerated and may hasten platelet engraftment and reduce regimen-related toxicities. They did not measure circulating endotoxin levels or inflammation markers (e.g. sCD14 or CRP) to support the rationale for this study, although they do cite a publication by one of the co-authors (Ref 3) that supports this hypothesis. They may want to cite earlier studies by Jonathan Cohen that shows anti-endotoxin antibodies prevent acute GVHD in a murine model.
