This paper is light on new results, so I'll focus my review purely on the conclusions mentioned by the author. The author makes a single statement in the Conclusion section, that "Factor analysis of allele frequencies is a promising method for detecting signals of recent selection on polygenic traits." I don't see how that can be gleaned from this paper at all. The author has provided no justification for the method that he is using here, or in his other papers that he has cited in this manuscript which also use factor analysis. I was amazed by this but realize that the journal "Mankind Quarterly" isn't exactly known for its rigorous review of technical methods in genetics. For this present manuscript to have any utility to the community I would suggest that the author back up and demonstrate that his ad hoc method has adequate power for use in empirical studies. In particular the author should compare the power of his method to the approach of Berg and Coop (2014) 1 , which is been both mathematically justified and well characterized by simulation data.

I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to state that I do not consider it to be of an acceptable scientific standard, for reasons outlined above.
