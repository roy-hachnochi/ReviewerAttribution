The only major thing that, in my opinion, stands between this manuscript is the availability of the R scripts used to produce the data tables (especially given the difference between corr and rcorr). I looked for any linking to or availability of these scripts in in Piffer 2013 or 2014a-d, and could not find it. Without these scripts, I do not think this work can be considered reproducible. Two additional (minor) revisions are as follows. First, the phenotypic data in table one seems to reply solely on Wikipedia. It seems likely that the author could find additional height information beyond Wikipedia. Second, the last four paragraphs of the article could be combined into one.
