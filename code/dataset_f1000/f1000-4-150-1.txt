The paper potentially provides important information about the relationship between activation level, knowledge, self-efficacy and self-management behavior in the rural population with heart failure to inform future interventions. I have several minor comments that the authors may consider in the revised version: Abstract: The authors may consider adding sample size, and several basic characteristics of the study population (mean age, sex distribution, etc.) in the abstract. Since the sample size of the study is relatively small (n=101), and the authors stated that the distribution of the patient activation score was skewed (page 3, last paragraph), they may consider reporting medians (inter quartile ranges) in the tables and text in addition to means (SDs). Statistical analysis: The authors mentioned Chi-square, Anova, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare patients characteristics across 4 activation levels, but it is unclear where the results were reported in the results section. In table 1, patients characteristics for all patients were presented (not according to activation levels) and means (SDs) PAM score by patients characteristics were reported. The authors may consider stating clearly in the statistical analysis how they treated the activation score (the main outcome of interest) as continuous or as categorical variable or both approaches and report the results accordingly. Discussion: The author wrote the distribution of patient activation scores in our study was not different across various socio-demographic groups except for educational (page 5). This may be due to small sample size issue; the study may be underpowered to detect potential differences (e.g. the mean activation score difference by race/ethnicity was 14 (58 vs. 44), however the difference was not statistically significant). This is one of the study limitations.
