This paper is based on the premise of there being two kinds of ecological intensification. One focuses largely at the field scale, and emphasizes technological improvements (including agrochemicals and GM crops), whereas the other focuses beyond the field scale, and emphasizes ecological interactions (e.g. pest control, pollination). The paper attempts to reconcile these two perspectives. The rationale underpinning this paper, to my mind, is interesting and worthwhile. Indeed, there are strongly contrasting approaches, and seeing how they can be reconciled would be useful. I believe this paper can make an interesting contribution, but the current version does not live up to its promise, namely to reconcile the two paradigms presented. Below, I explain why. The paper mixes up food security and food production. The focus is, however, only on food production, and hence the word food security needs to be used far more carefully and/or not at all. Food production is a necessary but insufficient prerequisite for food security. The introduction lacks a clear outline of the structure of the paper. This makes it difficult to follow the argument. The first half of the paper (up to page 5) was clear and easy to follow. After this, however, I feel the paper needs to be carefully re-written. It is not clear to me how the two perspectives actually are to be reconciled. Figure 1 is confusing. It shows multiple production possibility frontiers (if that is what they are – it is not explained very clearly), and open and filled dots. But it’s unclear what these are. What is the present state of a system, and what needs to happen to move from one PPP to another? The explanation given in the text and the caption is insufficient to make sense of this figure. The figure is somewhat overloaded. Figure 2 is even more confusing. It contains far too many concepts and ideas in the one figure. Also, some of the details are counter-intuitive – why does biodiversity correlate with temporal scale? Why is the temporal scale associated with a patch minutes to days? What is a patch – why is it smaller than a plot? Why are there three curves for beta-diversity in the right-hand diagram? How do the small diagrams relate to the large one? Most importantly, what does this figure suggest regarding reconciling the two paradigms? Despite trying quite hard, I am afraid I simply could not follow this figure. One page 7, top, right column, the authors state that farmers are keen to adopt high-yielding technologies. This is overly simplistic, and depends very much on the context. In general, the paper does not pay attention to resilience vs. efficiency issues, which are important in the context of comparing the two paradigms. Smallholder systems in poor countries, for example, may be designed first of all for resilience (so there is enough food no matter what happens), and second for efficiency (so that there may be a surplus, for example to sell). Related to this, ideas of variability are missing. E.g. in Box 1, there are limitations to yields from water deficiency, but these also vary unpredictably in some systems. Such variability has typically been minimized by technological systems, whereas agro-ecological, diversified systems are more likely to embrace variability as something natural and not necessarily bad. On page 2, it could be mentioned that diets have been simplified by focusing on a narrow set of crops only. See deFries et al. 2015, Science 1 . In summary, then, I believe this paper requires major revision before I would consider it “acceptable” for a reputable international journal. To my mind, the clarity of figures, the overall argument, and the second half of the manuscript need to improve substantially. I hope my comments are useful in providing some pointers where the most important changes are needed. References 1. DeFries R, Fanzo J, Remans R, Palm C, et al.: Global nutrition.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Whatever merits this paper may have are undermined by its pejorative application of “simplicity” to “ecological intensification.” Much of industrial agriculture may indeed be “techno-simple” (few crops, uniform application of high rates of fertilizer, etc.) and “externalize a range of environmental costs.” But precision farming (sometimes called “ecological intensification”) is much less simple to implement – Cassman (1999) focuses on its challenges, rather than claiming that the approach is fully developed – and reduces those environmental costs. Yet, as written, this paper attributes simplicity and environmental costs to “ecological intensification”, rather than to the simpler but more-harmful methods this approach it is intended to replace. For example, “ecological intensification” is blamed for “reducing crop diversity” (p. 2-3). If the intent is reconciliation, as implied by the title, I would suggest “technological sophistication” and “ecological sophistication” as descriptions of these two approaches. The article raises the issue of space and time dimensions of biodiversity, making some important points, such as the challenging need for cooperation among farmers to address landscape-scale diversity. These issues aren't really explored in enough depth to be useful, however. For example, a one-sentence treatment of “cover crops and intercropping” describes them as “simple” options, vastly understating the challenges they can pose for farmers. Similarly, although Thies and Tscharntke (1999) did indeed show that “landscape structure is highly influential for mobile arthropod species in farmlands”, they also found that increasing noncrop land to 50% of total only reduced crop bud damage from 28% to 18%. With benefits this small, what would be the overall effects of taking 50% of ag land in a region out of production? Would the net reduction in production lead to price increases, undermining food security for the urban poor and stimulating clearing of forests for agriculture elsewhere? Although I endorse the stated goal of this paper, it would need to be completely rewritten to make a significant contribution. In particular, it would need quantitative data on actual outcomes (such as increased yield or reduced pollution) and not just proxies (such as more-abundant beneficials) resulting from precision farming or from increased biodiversity at different scales.
