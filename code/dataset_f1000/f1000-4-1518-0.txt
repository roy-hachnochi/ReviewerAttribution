This project uses mRNA sequencing to monitor changes in gene expression in a human kidney cell line in response to direct hypoxia (5% O 2 ) as compared to treatment with 300mM CoCl 2 , frequently used as a surrogate for oxygen depletion. The results are very clear-cut: monitoring several genes known to be key hypoxia regulators shows CoCl 2 to be more effective than oxygen depletion but in contrast, monitoring a much broader gene response showed O 2 depletion to have greater effects. This contrast led the authors to concentrate attention on several specific biochemical pathways: a) glycolysis/gluconeogenesis is strongly activated in hypoxia (as expected) but not following treatment with CoCl 2 ; b) the reverse is the case for glycine, serine, threonine metabolism which is strongly induced by CoCl 2 but not by hypoxia. These last examples make clear the non-equivalence of CoCl 2 treatment and real hypoxia and this article therefore issues a strong caveat regarding the use of the inorganic surrogate. It is most certainly worth publishing for this reason alone. Since hypoxic conditions in tumours are taken to be predictive of a poor clinical outcome, the authors tested whether the direction of changes in the transcriptome of their untreated and hypoxic cell lines mirrors the difference between tumours and their normal cell counterparts. Hypoxia scores from mRNA expression data were somewhat (but significantly) elevated in recurrent/progressive patients.However, this difference does not (unfortunately) appear to be sufficient to use clinically (if I am understanding their intentions correctly). The upshot is that the authors do not mention this comparison in their Discussion. On practical matters: they might expand the caption to Fig 1. In A) I assume the three tracks are biological replicates: if so, write it. In B) a fuller explanation of the X-axis ‘Index’ would be helpful. Check on the printing of ‘300mM CoCl 2 ’ (in Methods, bottom of p2).
