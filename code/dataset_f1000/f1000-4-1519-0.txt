The present study outline by Gulati et al. aims to evaluate the incidence and relative risk of ICH after parenteral anti-thrombotic drug use. The aim is meritorious since very little data of these are known 1 . Mostly the question of prolongation of anti-thrombotic therapy after ICH have been discussed 2 . The presentation and discussion of the strengths and limitations of the proposed study is adequate and well organised. The only alternative to the present design would be a prospective trial but, given the limitations, the proposed retrospective study will be able to make a reasonable estimate of incidence and relative risks.

Many patients are prescribed antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a particularly feared complication as it is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. These therapies are most frequently used ... Continue reading READ ALL
