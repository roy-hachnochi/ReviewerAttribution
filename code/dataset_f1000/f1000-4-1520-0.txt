The authors fill a void in the computational biology toolkit, as I am not aware of a software package for performing inference on nodes, only packages for structure learning. This important functionality is a useful contribution. My main critique is on the usability - if this is meant to target biologists, it would be helpful to make the file formats very simple, in particular most biologists use Excel for their data, so it would be helpful if they could specify the model and the data in a csv or txt file.
