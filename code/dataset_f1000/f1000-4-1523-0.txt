The article "Deep sequencing revealed molecular signature of horizontal gene transfer of plant like transcript in the mosquito Anopheles culicifacies" provides an interesting point of view regarding the controversial topic of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from plants to mosquito. The article is generally very well written and provides compelling evidence about the presence of plant-like transcripts (PLT) expressed in the tissues related to sugar feeding mechanisms. I am impressed by the number of validation experiments such as RT-PCR or immunoblotting. These add compelling evidence about the presence of PLT in the tissue of Anopheles culicifacies (Ac). The bit where I am slightly puzzled about is the data deposited in SRA. It refers to transcriptome sequencing using Illumina (Illumina HiSeq 2000), (Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx) and some metagenomics analyses using (454 GS FLX+) and (Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx) . The study does not have sufficient information for me to be able to know how this data was used and contributed to the overall analyses and results. Also, in the transcriptome sequencing assay I do not see any replicates. Why did you just do 1 run of the RNA-seq transcriptome? I do not see anything related to the bioinformatics analyses related to this transcriptome analysis neither the metagenomics analyses. There are also a number of questions I have: - Where are PLT likely to be located in the tissues they are expressed in? Plastids? Is there a possible mechanism the authors propose regarding how the HGT might have happened? - The presence of plant-like transcripts does not preclude that HGT happened - please could you explain why you think this might be the case? Do you see a reason why PLT tend to be restricted to tissues exposed to feeding? - The supplementary document appears to have the right margin skewed to the right, making it slightly uncomfortable to read the document.
