Xu et al . report experiments on the reception and behavioral response in the southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus to enantiomers and analogs of 1-octen-3-ol. Specifically, the authors find that the maxillary palp receptor Or118b is especially sensitive to the R(-) enantiomer while the antennal receptor Or114b mediates stronger responses to the S(+) than to the R(-) enantiomer. The authors show that both enantiomers repel female Cx. quinquefasciatus , as does a racemic mixture. Females in which the maxillary palps have been ablated are similarly repelled by racemic 1-octen-3-ol, proving that the maxillary palps are not solely responsible for the response to this chemical. The paper makes an important contribution within the context of the literature on insect reception of 1-octen-3-ol, which is an attractive kairomone for several haematophagous insects. Experiments are compelling and the conclusions follow from the data. I have only a few minor suggestions: Could the authors please provide more detail on the stimulus method in the oocyte recordings? How long was each stimulus pulse? Black lines above traces sometimes indicate the timing of the stimulus pulse, but this is not the case in Figure 4. Legend of Figure 4: please check the concentration range (to 100 micromolar). Legend of Figure 5, below the title of the legend, starts with "CquiOR118..." instead of "CquiOR114..." Please indicate the meaning of the error bars in the figures (standard deviation or SEM or CI?). While the reader can infer that Or118 was identified by BLAST as an ortholog of Or8 from An. gambiae , it is not obvious how Or114 was identified. Could the authors perhaps include a paragraph on the bioinformatics that underlies this work? It is interesting that 1-octen-3-ol repels this mosquito species, but is attractive to several other species. Is there a possibility that 1-octen-3-ol could be attractive for Culex quinquefasciatus when combined with other chemicals?
