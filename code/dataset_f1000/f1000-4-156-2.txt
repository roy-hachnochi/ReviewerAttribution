I very much enjoyed reading this article. And, I believe it makes a significant positive contribution to our understanding of mosquito responses to volatiles associated with hosts. I believe the title and abstract are appropriate for the publication. With regards to the experiment design, were the trials conducted on the same day from the same population of mosquitoes (could there be a generation effect)? Would the authors consider using logistic regression to analyze the data? Such an approach would determine if there is an interaction between dose, response, and trial? Furthermore, was there much movement between the treatments (i.e., were mosquitoes flying from one treatment to the next)? If so, how did these responses vary across concentrations? These data would determine if there was increased activity as a response to the treatment. Another interesting aspect of the study would be to look at the raw data in conjunction with percent response as these data would also lend towards appreciating the compound "exciting" the mosquitoes. The discussion and conclusions are well developed. One aspect that would be important to consider is the relationship between the volatile and its source (most likely a fungus) as this compound operates similarly to quorum sensing molecules (concentration of the compound dictates "behavior" of the microbe). By building a bridge between the role of the compound with its source, one would be able to tie together the ecology of the mosquito with the source (i.e., microbe) and host health. Such an approach could provide greater explanation as to why certain doses are attractant while others are repellent.
