The authors detail studies aimed at understanding the olfactory detection of 1-octen-3-ol in the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus . Behavioral studies showed mosquitoes to be repelled by high concentrations of 1-octen-3-ol. An odorant receptor (OR) identified in the maxillary palps responded selectively to ( R )-1-octen-3-ol in a manner similar to ORs in other mosquitoes. However, when the palps were ablated, the repellent effects of octenol at high concentrations remained. The authors then demonstrated a second OR expressed primarily in antennae that responded to high concentrations of ( S )-1-octen-3-ol. The involvement of this antennal OR in the repellency of octenol at high concentrations is postulated. This is an intriguing paper that expands our knowledge octenol reception in the southern house mosquito. Since the antennal OR postulated for octenol reception is activated only at relatively high concentrations (10 -5 M and above), it would be interesting to discover its natural ligand.
