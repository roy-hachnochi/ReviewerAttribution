The paper is concise and clear, providing evidence that medical students from Collaborative Project to Increase Production of Rural Doctors (CPIRD) tract finally watched up with medical students from local direct admission and national admission. There are some points to improve the quality of this paper: The text explaining the CPIRD programme in paragraph 3 of Introduction is not accurate. The obligatory service period of service is still kept constant at three years not six years as written. The One District One Doctor (ODOD) programme coerces 12 years of obligatory service. Methods section should explain clearer on selection of students especially about drop-out between years. Its unlikely that there were no dropouts during the 6-year MD programme. How the study handle this issue? What bias is likely to occur? Please discuss. The GPA presentation in figure 1 shows that students of the national tract best performed since the first year, but table 2 and text in result section explained that students of direct tract best performed. Please check. Table 3 shows very high fail rate of step 3 exam as compared to others. There is no explanation how the systems interacted with this high fail rate.
