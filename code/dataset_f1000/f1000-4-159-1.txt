The authors describe an interesting case, with a positive outcome despite some delay in diagnosis. The title and the description of the case are all well written. However, the discussion and the conclusion require more work. This case brings up an important and not so rare clinical scenario in Paediatric Critical Care, i.e. the difficulties inherent to extrinsic airway compression by a tumour. The authors, on their discussion, should take advantage of this case and discuss the approach to airway extrinsic compression, the use of extra-corporeal life support (ECLS) as a back-up plan, who should be present in such situations (ENT, anaesthesia), etc The clinician could barely secure the childs airway, and the child survived and was able to have the teratoma resected. But it could have been a disastrous outcome. There are protocols for such scenarios, and they should be mentioned and described for the reader to be prepared when facing with similar situations
