Coletti et al described in a case report of severe acute respiratory distress by tracheal obstruction due to congenital thyroid teratoma. This case report adds knowledge to the literature, not only by tumor description, but also the clinical management of the case. Tumor description is interesting, however I believe that the authors should also discuss in this article the clinical management of malacia in premature, since this is very common in neonatal clinic. I believe that this discussion would make the most interesting article and is also an opportunity to develop the discussion of the article, which I believe is short. For this reason there are some points which need to be considered and are necessary clarifications Add data: The patient was born with what gestational age? After birth was not performed control with imaging for the mass? What are the results of thyroid hormones tests after birth? The staff investigated other causes for laryngeal stridor before discharge? Suggestions: The discussion could discuss the differential diagnosis of stridor. The staff not investigated a patient with stridor, attributing the malacia. Many patients in neonatology have stridor and I believe that this article could show that there is need for investigation in stridor, because sometimes the differential diagnosis can be serious pathologies. Case reports are interesting, but I believe it should have a good discussion of the various aspects involved in the pathology, in which case I would like that you develop the discussion and mainly develop the discussion about the differential diagnosis.
