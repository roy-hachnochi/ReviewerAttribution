This article is a retrospective case series reviewing the use of ketamine as an adjunctive sedative agent for patients requiring ECMO support due to cardiopulmonary failure. The authors reviewed patient characteristics including concurrent sedative, analgesic, and vasopressor infusion requirements as well as RASS scores both before and after initiation of ketamine infusion. The authors defined what they considered to be a clinically significant changes in the doses of several agents including fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, and norepinephrine. While the majority of patients had a clinically significant decrease in the doses of both vasopressors and other sedative/analgesic agents, these changes were still quite small. The authors rightly note that they are not able to make a causal associations given the retrospective nature of their data, but their inferences are sound based on pharmacologic and physiologic principles. This case series demonstrates that ketamine appears to be an adjunctive agent that can safely be used in patients on ECMO and may have the benefit of decreasing the requirements for other sedatives and vasopressors, as well. This article is well-written and this topic warrants further investigation in a prospective manner.
