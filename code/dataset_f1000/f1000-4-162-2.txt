This review is well written and give us a comprehensive updating on magnetic resonance imaging in NPSLE. Only few minor suggestions: Introduction - Authors say that "reliable methods for diagnosing NPSLE are also unknown...". This is essentially true, but they could quote the recent contribution by Bortoluzzi et al . (2015), dealing with the development of a new algorithm for attribution of NP events in SLE. Conventional MRI, page 2 - "DWI sequences". Please specify the meaning of DWI. Conventional MRI, page 3 - "total corticosteroid". Cumulative is better.
