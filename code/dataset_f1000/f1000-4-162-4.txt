 Title and Abstract : The title is quite generic and perhaps the description of old and new techniques should be emphasized. Article content : Design, methods and analysis are well explained and appropriate, however the use of nanoparticles (e.g. SPIONS) should be mentioned among the new MRI techniques.    Conclusions :  The conclusions underline the need for MRI imaging in symptomatic neuropsychiatric SLE, although a standardized consensus still lacks. It should be more evidenced, however, the utility of a complex diagnostic algorithm, including neurophysiologic study of the brain or lab tests, beyond the solely use of MRI. Data : Methods and indications to a specific procedure are well described ; MRI findings are reported according to pathologic or clinical pictures.
