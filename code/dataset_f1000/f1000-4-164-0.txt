This retrospective study looked at the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) patterns in a small number of pediatric patients with Lupus (SLE) but not nephritis compared to a larger cohort of patients with similar casual blood pressure findings but without SLE. The study design seems appropriate, however the lack of racial/ethnicity information in the comparison group makes it difficult to know if this comparison is entirely appropriate. The Lupus group had 70% African American or Hispanic patients, which are groups whose normal ABPM data are not known and may not be represented by the normative data by Wuhl. Potential matching by age, gender, and ethnicity may have lent more strength to this comparison. However, the findings of reduced nocturnal dipping in 90% of the SLE group is fairly significant and definitely bears reporting. The authors are quite clear that their small numbers make it difficult to find statistical significant factors within the SLE cohort to explain these findings and that a larger study in this population is merited. The discussion about possible effect of corticosteroids, added in the revision, is one factor that certainly needs to be investigated further. Additionally, the presence of proteinuria in 20% of the SLE patients is somewhat curious as they may have some residual effects from their nephritis which would possibly also manifest with changes in their diurnal BP pattern. However, these are exactly some of the questions should be uncovered in the discussions of a "pilot" study such as this.
