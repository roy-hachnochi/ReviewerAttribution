This is a retrospective study looking at nocturnal blood pressure dips in paediatric patients with lupus. It is descriptive in nature and looks at small numbers as it is a single centre review of a relatively rare condition in the paediatric population. Though the paper shows a statistically significant nocturnal dip in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to the controls it is unable to dissect out demographics or other characteristics that could be used to explain this because of the small numbers. This is an important question as blood pressure will have an impact on long term effect of this condition and potential development of renal disease beyond lupus nephritis. The paper offers no opportunity for mechanistic explanations for the observations because of the retrospective nature and small numbers as recognised by the authors. The statistics are also limited for the same reasons. I feel the paper should be published however to highlight the issue and also to provide a platform for the authors to raise awareness to the issue and enable a multi centre prospective study of the same question dissecting out demographics (age stratification, ethnicity), other co-morbidities (this would be more of an issue in an adult population) and to test out the mechanisms of this process potentially examining vascular resistance and flow mediated dilatation. It would also be of interest to see the effect of treatment on this phenomenon in a longitudinal fashion.
