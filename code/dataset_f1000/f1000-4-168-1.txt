Recently there has been a lot of interest and effort in curating databases and providing MMP information for analysis of various properties by both academic and industrial groups as noted by some references below http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci5005256 http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm400223y http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm500317a Further, a few companies have started providing content and are in the data-provisioning business accessing corporate information through consortia like the one below from Medchemica: http://www.medchemica.com/index.html http://www.astrazeneca.com/Research/news/Article/260613-roche-and-astrazeneca-launch-medicinal-chemistry-datasha Or developing capabilities to use such information in drug discovery applications such as NextMove: http://www.nextmovesoftware.com The data note and open access data submitted here from the Bajorath Group based on their comprehensive work using 2D and 3D activity cliff information provides a wealth of information that directly will address many questions that medicinal chemistry project teams typically tend to ask. Very relevant, timely and valuable effort that should be communicated broadly to the research community.
