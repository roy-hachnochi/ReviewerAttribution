This is a report of an exceptionally unusual presentation of a parturient with multiple trauma needing urgent neurosurgery. The authors do a thorough review of important aspects of parturient physiology, as well as the medical and surgical considerations involved. Still, the authors seem to have followed the typical care of any neurosurgical patient for this procedure and were just serendipitous in having a Jackson-type operating table with an open suspended sling that prevented any untoward pressure on the fetus or fetal circulation while in the prone position. If a more unique approach to neurosurgery or neuroanesthesia in the parturient was introduced and proven successful, this report would have much greater value to its readers. The main scientific point is that the positioning and monitoring of a non-pregnant patient for neurosurgery serves well for the polytrauma pregnant patient for many reasons as well described, though not directly. Also missing is the inability to easily monitor the fetal status intraoperatively, and the inability to perform emergent cesarean delivery in this position if fetal distress occurs in a viable fetus. Are there modifications in the anesthetic or surgical approach that could accommodate these factors?
