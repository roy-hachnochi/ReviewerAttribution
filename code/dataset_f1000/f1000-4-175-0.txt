The authors highlight an important report of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) in a patient on nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy for more than two years. The median duration to the onset of nevirapine-associated SJS is two weeks, thus the case report stimulates exploration of the relationship between sudden rise in plasma nevirapine concentration and increased risk of SJS. However, it was not clear whether the authors performed any formal adverse drug reaction causality assessment, even though they stated that the reaction was "probable".
