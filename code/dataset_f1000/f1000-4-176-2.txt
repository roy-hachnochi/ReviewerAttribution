This short review by Gyanesh Singh​ et al . provides useful and up-to-date information on the roles of mtDNA in disease. Abnormalities in mtDNA may affect all organs of the body, but cause symptoms primarily in tissues that are dependent on high energy production. Deficient mtDNA maintenance contributes to conditions as diverse as normal aging, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The authors should give more precise and explicit reference to the repeated assertion that "mtDNA repair pathways are inadequate" (e.g. in the Abstract and Conclusions sections), or moderate these statements. The statement reads as indicating that even when the mtDNA repair mechanisms function normally, they are inadequate. Is there direct evidence for this? On p2, the authors correctly point out that it is difficult to distinguish the effects of genotoxic agents on mtDNA, "as agents that damage mtDNA also damage nuclear DNA". The authors should reference work on transgenic animal models with damage specifically in mtDNA (e.g., Trifunovic A et al 2004 Nature ; Lewis W et al 2007 Lab Invest ; Lauritzen KH et al 2010 Mol Cell Biol ​). Typography: in "NAD+" the "+" should be corrected to superscript. Please check the text for grammatical errors, e.g., on p2 "...the only DNA polymerase known to be present in the mitochondria, have low frameshift fidelity, and, is believed to...": "have" should be corrected to "has".
