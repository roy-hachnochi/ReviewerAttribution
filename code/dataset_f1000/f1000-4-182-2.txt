The article offers a concise, brief summary of an important topic. The following are minor revisions that will improve the manuscript Changing the terminology "schizophrenic patients" to "patients with schizophrenia" or "individuals with schizophrenia". In the abstract the objective states the aim is to report on the costs of schizophrenia across different European countries, yet the results states "18 billion euros worldwide." Given that the manuscript reviews economic studies in Europe, it should be modified to focus on European findings. The last few sentences in paragraph 3 of the introduction describe limitations of this review; these sentences should be described in the methods section. It is not completely clear to me what the authors are referring to when they mention "other data" that could not be compared. A paragraph following the introduction or within the introduction detailing the types of costs that are typically measured in these type of studies could replace table 1. Detailing the types of costs that were measured in the different studies would be a valuable contribution to Table 2.
