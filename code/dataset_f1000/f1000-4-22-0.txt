This article shows that the previously observed structural and functional features of trHbO, using its G8 mutants, can be duplicated in trHbN. As such, the critical role of the G8 residue and LT and STG8 channels, and E7 gate in functions of trHbO as well as trHbN is demonstrated. Some technical questions to be answered are: In Fig. 2, the identical concentrations (5M) of trHbNs are used. However, values of Absorbance of Figs. 2A (an estimated value of A=0.05), 2B (an estimated value [extrapolated to t = 0] of A=0.55), and 2C (an estimated value of A=0.25). Why do such large discrepancies in As exist among Figs. 2A, B, and C, though sample concentrations are identical (5M)? Why is the noise level of the trace in Fig. 2A is much smaller than those of Fig. 2B and 2C, though the latters have much larger A values of 0.55 and 0.25, respectively? The interpretation of the results of the Fig. 6A experiments is not convincing, because not enough data are presented. The NO decay assays were performed under the background of rapid spontaneous decay of NO (approximately 5.4 M/100sec) to determine [NO] (between with and without trHbN) = approximately 0.5 M. Kinetic curves shown are extremely smooth to indicate a very large time constant of the NO assay instrument. Therefore, quantitative assay of [NO] from the time courses of kinetic curves are unreliable. In order to prove the proposed one-cycle hypothesis, why didnt they measure [NO] values as a function of [trHbN]? From these reasons, the error bars in Fig. 6B seem unusually small. Are these differences in the NO decay rate (X-axis), shown in Fig. 6B, statistically significant? MD analyses are done under the condition of a single molecule of CO binding to trHbN or to its mutants. Since the hemes themselves in trHbN and mutants have low-affinity for CO, though the apparent affinity for CO of trHbN is known to be high, which I believe, binding of a single molecule of CO to the heme of deoxy trHbN is an energetically unfavorable up-hill process. How are the energy levels of the initial stage (deoxy trHbN + CO), relative to the final stage (trHb: CO) 1 shown in Fig. 4B, determined? Are they initially assumed? Or they are results of MD analysis? Shouldnt the MD analyses be done under conditions where solvents contain large numbers of CO molecules, rather than a single CO molecule, thermodynamically speaking?
