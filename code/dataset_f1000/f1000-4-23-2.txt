The authors studies the raclopride binding (displacement) in groups of subjects (normal and Tourette syndrome). They studied the effect of levodopa infusions and of a placebo. The subjects were studied at rest. Basically, they found that in Tourette syndrome, dopamine release was smaller (reduced) than in controls, in midbrain (approximately substantia nigra/VTA) and in parahippocampal gyrus. This is an interesting paper and the methodology is adequate. The subjects are studied at rest, this may underestimate the dynamic of dopamine release and it would have be more interesting to study this phenomenon during a task. The groups are very small, and the effect in Tourette syndrome may also be different according to the characteristics of the patient (with or without additional behavioral disorders). Nevetherless, the study is consistent with the presence of abnormality of presynaptic dopaminergic pharmacology in Tourette syndrome.
