 The first sentence conveys the wrong message. EPEC does not cause 1 million deaths but as quoted reference 1, it causes an average of 79000 dealth/year. The overall deaths due to diarrheal diseases are about 1 million/year. The authors should first outline the mechanisms of EPEC induced diarrhea including recent work on NaCl absorption than focus on tight junctions. The authors should refer to the recent papers on EPEC effects on tight junctions e.g. Glotfelty et al. Cell Microbiol. 2014
