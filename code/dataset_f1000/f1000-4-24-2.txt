Prechl and Czirjak present an attempt to synthesize several aspects of lupus pathogenesis. In many respects, the opinion article reviews well known territory and the novel aspect is that the authors seek to include a role for complement C1q in the processes of transendothelial transport and paracellular leakage. These events could be compromised by the reduced levels of C1q that are associated with lupus or with DNA-anti-DNA immune complexes (IC). The proposed hypothesis is appealing because it may account for the early steps in pathogenesis. It may also provide a convincing connection to sites of vascular disease and IC deposition. One aspect that is not thoroughly covered is the deposition of C1q at sites of endothelial discontinuity. These are presented as areas that arise from the apoptotic death of endothelial cells which could expose underlying ECM. However, previous reports of apoptosis in a continuous endothelium revealed the rapid displacement of the dead cell by surrounding cells in the cell layer. This needs to be discussed more fully. In addition, the primary references describing the role of C1q in endothelial healing and renewal are sparse and incomplete. Possibly, the involvement of C1q in angiogenesis could be related to the proposed process but the connection is not clearly developed. Overall, the opinion piece could be streamlined by focusing on the innovative concept of C1qs role in regenerating endothelial gaps. Minor comments: Figure 1 shows brackets that do not make sense mathematically. Why are genetic factors shown in purple? "Endothel" should be endothelium. Figure 2 is a bit busy and difficult to deconstruct. Also the color of arrows is not explained. Figure 3 is confusing as to what factors make the three colored ovals merge and overlap.
