This is a nice concise case report to increase our awareness of the availability of the new non-invasive tool (RCM), which can aid in early diagnosis of melanoma and hence, reducing the number of benign lesions excision especially for patients with atypical melanocytic nevi syndrome. The knowledge added is limited but useful for other practitioners. The title, abstract, article content and overall discussions are appropriate with good confocal and dermoscopy images attached. However, it would be nice to have histological images for correlation as well. The conclusions are sensible and balanced as well. However, it is important to indicate in the case report that the RCM is a useful complementary tool but should not replace clinical judgement on the necessity to closely monitor nevi and still offer excision if in doubt.
