In the current manuscript, Rongxia Liu et al investigated the influence of the plant-derived natural product capsaicin to overcome restenosis by using a vascular muscle cell model (VSCM) in vitro . The manuscript is well written and conclusion is precise. The experiments are straightforward and the presented cell-based model is adequate to investigate such question. Nevertheless, before indexation the comments below have to be improved in a revised version of the manuscript. Major Comment: Main text: The authors mentioned that paclitaxel and rapamycin are used as standard drugs to inhibit VSCM proliferation. For pharmacological testing, it is essential that the authors should compare the investigated capsaicin to a standard therapy (positive control) to get an idea about capsaicins bio-activity. Minor Comment: Abstract: The authors have to depict more clearly why it is important to investigate new natural-derived compounds to overcome stenosis.
