The database developed by Blanc and colleagues is an excellent and valuable resource for researchers working on S-palmitoylation. The database allows to visualize and compare 19 proteomics datasets published in the last few years for protein S-palmitoylation. Proteomics data often generate some false positive hits and SwissPalm-mediated improvement of confidence will help scientists interpret the results of these proteomics studies and could also use as a reference database for future proteomics studies. The other tools added to the database (multiple alignments of orthologous proteins and their isoforms, site prediction score from CSS-Palm and PalmPred) are also valuable. The database interface is well described in the paper. As a result, the database is easy to use and the data easily extracted from the website. The comparative analysis of metabolic labeling and hydroxyl amine-sensitive enrichment methods should encourage researchers to employ both methods for high-quality proteomic analysis of S-fatty-acylated proteins.
