The authors describe a software package for interactive (via a shiny webapp) genomic analysis. By running R behind the scenes, this software addresses a common challenge in genomic data analysis -- the transition from simple initial analyses (typically performed by a novice user) and more complex later analyses (typically performed by an advanced user). When the initial analyses are not easily examined / reproduced, the advanced user often must start from scratch. The AGA software will hopefully address this issue. The title of the article is currently too broad -- the software is only able to handle Affymetrix expression arrays, Illumina 450k methylation arrays, and normalized RNA-seq gene counts. However, I trust that the authors will expand the functionality of the software to handle many other platforms and types of genomic data. My primary criticism of this work is that I was unable to successfully use the package. The package depends on a large number of other packages (shinyIncubator, googleVis, and heatmap among others). In particular, I was unable to install the heatmap package. Additional instructions on how to obtain / install all of the required dependencies should be added to the user manual. I also have a few minor criticisms of the article: In Figure 1, the gene names are not legible due to over-plotting, and the column names are truncated. The citation for the fRMA method is incorrect. The correct citation is: McCall MN, Bolstad BM, and Irizarry RA (2010). Frozen Robust Multi-Array Analysis (fRMA), Biostatistics, 11(2):242-253.
