The authors have described Automated Genomics Analysis (AGA), an interactive program to analyze high-throughput genomic data sets on a variety of platforms. The software is implemented in R with web app using Shiny. Specific comments are noted below: cBIOPortal is listed as an example for reducing cost of genomic analysis using AGA. cBioPortals purpose is to help researchers mine analyzed results and it is available for free for non-commercial use. cBIOPortal is not in the same class of software as AGA and is an inappropriate comparison. Title needs to be changed - current AGA software supports expression and methylation analysis only. The title is very broad, especially given that there is not support for genomic variant analysis in the software. Describe any quality checks performed on CEL and idat files briefly beyond batch correction. How does the software deal with missing values? Address scalability. How does the software scale for large studies?
