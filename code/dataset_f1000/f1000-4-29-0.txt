This is an interesting paper that utilizes alternative methodologies for protein-protein docking. Especially determination of energy responsive residues- hotspots for binding- based on elastic network model deserves attention as it has been previously assessed in terms of ligand binding by Tuzmen and Erman (2011). However, the peptide docking procedure, which has detected a six-residue long peptide located on an unstructured loop, is a non-standard approach as far as to my knowledge. The authors need to discuss why they have preferred such a technique for their problem and specifically used six-residue peptides. More details on the docking procedure/steps and efficiency would also be helpful. Further validation of the resulting complex by a standard protein-protein docking algorithm would also be welcome.
