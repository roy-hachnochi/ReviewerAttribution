This research proposal has dealt with interesting topic, and expects to conduct a comprehensive and systematic study that is able to understand the factors associated with CRC screening of rural area residents based on this. Especially, I think it is great meaningful in that it will carry out with quantitative and qualitative approach together. The overall configuration is well described, but there are minor problems to be improved. The authors described that " Existing studies have shown inconsistent findings and fail to address how contextual and provider-level factors impact CRC " in the Background of the Abstract. However, Background in the main manuscript could not clearly show and organize that there is no consistency in the existing research results in detail. In Background, It would be better to explain how considering the patient, provider and county level factor together could improve CRC screening rate or why the comprehensive consideration is so important in CRC screening rate improvement. " No. Clinic in County in Figure1 seems better to be modified as No. of Clinics in County. In Figure 1, the education variable is included only on the provider factor, but I think it is also an important variable as the patient factor. There are only two quantitative variables in socio-economic indicator of county level: poverty rate and % uninsured. Are these two variables sufficiently able to reflect unique characteristics of the rural area? It seems to require a detailed explanation for the abbreviations used in the Figure 2. I think the biggest advantage and characteristic of this study is to perform quantitative approach and qualitative approach together. It would be better to describe in detail how you will conduct integration and linking of two research methods. Instead of just a parallel listing, specific plans for organic connection and interpretation of the results from two methods should be presented.
