The correspondence article Further available immunization option to prevent pneumococcal disease from Vojtek Hoet provides relevant information regarding one of the currently available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. This information was missing in the review article (Recent advances in our understanding of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection ) written by Feldman Anderson. The correspondence article is well written and should be considered for indexing. I have only minor comments: In the second paragraph, when mentioning that the PHiD-CV vaccine is currently licensed in more than 125 countries, the authors should make clear that the vaccine is licensed for active immunization against invasive disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM) caused by S. pneumoniae in infants and young children up to 5 years of age . In the third paragraph, when mentioning that the PHiD-CV vaccine is a worth-while alternative to the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV13, the authors should add: in children younger than 5 years of age . In Table 1, when showing the different study results observed with the PHiD-CV vaccine, the authors should specify which results are vaccine efficacy data and which are vaccine effectiveness data .
