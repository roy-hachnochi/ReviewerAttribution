I read with great interest the letter of Vojtek and Hoet. Well done and necessary. I have some remarks and suggestions: In the abstract the term is not clear to all the readers. The exact date of approval would be useful because it could inform the readers that PHiD-CV has a long and great history. Page 2: is not clear (see above) Page 2 , second column, third line. I would add evidence based before informed choice in order to stress the big amount of available rigorous data. Page 2, 11th line: I would say proves its beneficial impact It should be underlined that PHiD-CV is approved for use in children younger than 5 years of age (that could be one the reason why it was not quoted in the paper of Feldam which focuses mostly on adult/elderly patients) In the table I would add before or . In the current version one may read minus 3 plus 1 and may misunderstand.
