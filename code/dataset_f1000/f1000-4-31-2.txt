The authors data will add value to Drosophila population genomic resources. I see no technical flaws in the manuscript. If the authors see fit, they could a bit more context to the data. For example, they could note that a mosaic of homozygous and heterozygous regions may be expected from the isofemale line genomes. Optionally, they could also briefly put these three populations in historical context (i.e. that the species originated from sub-Saharan Africa but perhaps not western Africa specifically, that it expanded out of sub-Saharan Africa with a population bottleneck, and that North American populations are thought to have both European and African ancestry). The France and Ghana samples sequenced here may prove useful for identifying population ancestry in North American and other admixed populations. Trivial edits: Methods paragraph 1: each isofemale lines (delete final ) References - from title of Lack et al. 2015, delete second . Update precise author information.
