I would welcome more information about the original networks, which were generated out of text/data mining. In particular, I would like to know what keywords were used to fetch the source articles (a set of genes/gene products, e.g. AQP5, MUC5...; a list of pathologies and synonyms, e.g. COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorders, early-stage COPD; a list of chemical compounds...) , what search engines were used (e.g. PubMed), what collection (MEDLINE, PubMed Central full-texts). Additionally quantitative details would be welcome also: how many abstracts or full-text articles were collected first?
