Sengupta et al. submitted a research article reporting novel CSF biomarkers of Japanese encephalitis (JE). JE is a leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. However, there are still many gaps in our understanding of the pathogenesis of JE in humans. Early diagnosis based on reliable biomarkers is essential to identify the status and intensity of JE infection. Here, the authors compared CSF proteomes from ten patients with JE and ten patients with another form of acute encephalitis by 2D gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry. The analysis identified elevated levels of vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), fibrinogen gamma chain, fibrinogen beta chain, complement C4-B, complement C3 and cytoplasmic actin in CSF from JE patients. This indicates blood-brain barrier disruption, and the DBP also represents a novel and mechanistically important CSF biomarker of JE. The exact role of DBP in the development of JE will be investigated is further studies. The manuscript is well written, easy to follow, and provides very important data to all interested in the mechanisms of pathogenesis of neurotropic flaviviral infections. I fully recommend accepting the manuscript for indexation. Minor comments: I would be interested to know more details on the other forms of the acute encephalitis involved in the study. In the next studies, it would be interesting to compare different forms of encephalitis more specifically, like JE vs. TBE, JE vs. herpetic encephalitis, etc. In the next studies, it would be useful to investigate the biomarker levels in individual patients or to make more pools for each group. In case of one pool investigated, it is not fully clear if the levels of biomarkers are increased in all or most of the patients or if there is just only a strong production in one patient.
