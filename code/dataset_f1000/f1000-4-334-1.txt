The manuscript entitled Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers of Japanese Encephalitis by Sengupta and colleagues reports their novel findings unique biomarkers for an important disease wherein encephalitis caused by Japanese Encephalitis Virus causes almost 15,000 deaths every year. Currently the JEV infection can be diagnosed only by using serology and clinical symptoms. Therefore there is an urgent need to identify biomarker(s) for this disease. They used cerebrospinal fluid from 10 JE and 10 AE patients and performed 2D and mass spectrometry on these samples. They observed 6 different proteins that were significantly increased in JE patients. They also found that IL-1 and TNF- were also significantly elevated in JE patients. Their further analysis indicated DBP as potential biomarker in JE patients. Both the Tables and 3 figures are necessary and results in these items support the conclusions very well stated in the manuscript. This manuscript would be extremely useful to the people involved in the general area of JE research and particularly to those involved in diagnostics. The manuscript is well written and this study provides a very important and significant advancement in the field.
