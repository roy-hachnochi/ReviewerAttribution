This paper is a significant addition to our knowledge in JE encephalitis and have identified markers using proteomic approach that would also suggest damage to the blood brain barrier. The experiments carried out support the conclusions. I recommend indexation. The DBP as marker will need more JE and non-JE cases to confirm - so they must indicate that possibility.
