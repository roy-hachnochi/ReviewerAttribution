The authors have been very responsive to the comments. My statements before stand about the overall value of the paper. There is some idiosyncratic use of English, including the concluding statement about being able to "tailor ourselves into adopting other viable options." One could rewrite it as: "So despite having limited resources, we can explore viable options."
