The study provides an interesting approach to the evaluation of divergence between the phage genomes. I'm not an expert in this area so come into it with a more general view. I found the revised paper clear and well explained in terms of approach. I agree with the first reviewer that the authors have perhaps been selective in just showing data from a select choice of k- mer values. Expanding the results to show the deviation across the full range of k tested, even if just in summary, would be interesting, though there would be a disparity between odd and even values of k as there are no palindormes with odd k . A minor issue with regard to the present publication, but which might be worth consideration for future work, is over the TUD metric where the authors compare the observed frequencies to the expected. It is not clear from the study as to the variation one might see in a null model. If TUD is the test statistic of choice, a significance value for the deviation from expected should be deteminable empirically by modelling TUD, e.g.where there is a randomly assigned sequence of nucleotides corresponding to the genome of the organism. This could be done by shuffling the whole genome, taking a large sliding window and aggregating these scores (with or without shuffling etc.) A discussion of the significance of the deviation from expected (or the lack of appreciation of it) is worth including into the paper. It is nice to see the distance measures, but without an estimate of the significance of the deviation from expected values, it becomes difficult to assess the significance of the deviation between genomes. It may be the case that using a significance measure as the distance (a Z-score or equivalent) may produce a different clustering.
