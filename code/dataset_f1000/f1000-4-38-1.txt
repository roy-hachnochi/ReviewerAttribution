The authors have searched a collection of compounds for a common pharmacophore directed against Ebola proteins, and detected 55 hits. These were filtered by an experienced medicinal chemist using well-established techniques and intuition to provide 16 legitimate compounds that may serve the Ebola research community as a publicly available resource. This is an excellent example of the power of shared, collaborative research databases providing valuable resources to the research community.
