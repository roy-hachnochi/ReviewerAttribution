The study by Comba et al . 1 suggests a critical period of prenatal development (PND) in rodents during which neuronal mossy fiber growth in the hippocampus is associated with the emergence of spatial behavior. The researchers emphasize the PND 15-18 month period where this growth connecting the dentate gyrus to the CA3 cellular field is most prominent. It is also noted in the introduction that such grow may be related to the finding that neurogenesis-based processes specific to the hippocampus are also associated with the emergence of spatial learning. The researchers describe a behavioral typology control in their research design to dissociate effects based on non-cognitive motor demands from true cognitive information processing, which was supported by their data analyses of place learning in the Morris water maze versus spatial exploration in a dry land task (with swimming being more difficult than common ambulation). Despite the difference in motor demands, there was a common emergence of spatial behavior proficiency on each task at PND20. The researchers also found that enhanced mossy fiber projections, revealed by synaptophysin staining in the CA3 region, preceded the emergence of spatial behavior. Developmentally-dependent functional changes in cFOS positive cells were increased in all hippocampal subregions measured, while training-dependent changes were restricted to the CA3 and CA1 regions for groups trained in the water maze. The researchers conclude that mossy fiber connectivity along with enhanced function of the hippocampus precedes the emergence of spatial behavior at PND20, confirming their hypothesis of a sensitive period for hippocampal growth and the emergence of cognitive-spatial function. This research is very important and exciting when considering past studies of place learning ability in adult rats and research attempts to dissociate motor performance from true cognitive processing. In previous water maze studies of latent learning 2 , 3 using passive placement on the goal in the water maze to view distal cues to form a cognitive map of the environment, mixed results and individual differences seem to obscure matters 4 - 8 , leading to one interpretation that movement and cognitive mapping may necessarily occur simultaneously, a finding that has been replicated in humans using a virtual version of the water maze 9 . Hence, for the water maze at least, movement through the environment seems to be an important constraint on highly proficient spatial learning and navigation. The use of a separate dry land task by Comba et al. with less motoric demands seems to be in agreement with the difference in motor demands between the original rodent version of the task 10 requiring swimming and the human virtual version 9 using minimal hand/finger movements to navigate. The role of dynamic movement during spatial tasks and the motoric demands have been topics of intense interest with the role of the hippocampus as a substrate for cognitive mapping 11 , 12 , path integration 13 - 17 , or the conductor of a symphony of dynamic movement and mapping 18 as part of a larger neural network of brain systems 19 have all been hotly debated theoretically over the years. The separation of cognitive and motor performance associated with developmentally-specific changes in hippocampal circuitry by Comba et al . is an exciting finding that may have important implications for a central role of the hippocampus in cognitive-spatial information processing as it emerges early in development. Consequently, the behavioral typology issue in the Comba et al . study, along with other aspects of their research design, is of critical importance in assessing the emerging role of the hippocampus in cognitive-spatial behavior. The following matters should be considered by all interested in this fascinating area of research in general, and in the Comba et al . study in particular. Specific Considerations The level of spatial proficiency in escaping to a hidden platform for PND20 rats given only 8 trials in the water maze is not comparable to the asymptotic level of escape latency performance ( 10 sec) observed in most water maze studies after considerably more extensive training. The one day water maze training paradigm is likely tapping into ventral hippocampal function in which the animals are just approaching the general location. After more training, dorsal hippocampus forms a more precise representation of the location. The authors should discuss this work 20 and an analysis of their data (dorsal versus ventral) would be of interest. On a related matter, escape is not required, and exploration of an object at a novel in the dry land task is very different from the typical water maze procedure, involving the presence of a local cue or familiar beacon (with different motivation). Some might argue that the lack of spatial proficiency in the water maze is a flaw or weakness of the study; however, given the focus on the emergence of spatial behavior, and that well-learned escape responses are dependent on other brain regions 21 , 22 that contribute/correlate with movement parameters 19 , it seems reasonable to expect less performance-wise using the escape latency measure than what is typically observed in most studies of this type. Consequently, spatial bias on a probe test might be considered as an alternative measure in future studies as it does not depend on a well-learned escape response that may be less hippocampal-dependent and more closely approximates the dwell time that is measured on the spatial exploration task. The object/place task is interesting. Integration with ideas about direct versus indirect measures of memory and the role of the hippocampus in one versus the other, and how these ideas relate to their different measures on this task would be of interest 23 . There are other obvious differences between the two tasks. Water maze for example is not disrupted by disorientation procedures but a dry-land version of spatial localization is disrupted by disorientation 24 . This work suggests that the representations are different as well, not just the behavioral topology. This should be discussed. The number of rats in each group for the water maze task is quite low (n = 5/group). A statement on the standardization of immunohistochemical procedures would be reassuring for those not familiar with the specific techniques used. Also, the use of an unbiased stereology technique should be considered. It appears that different behavioral procedures may have been conducted at different institutions. A statement on the time of day of testing and other procedural controls would provide reassurance that there are no threats to internal validity. More information on the recording and quantification of exploratory behavior (e.g., video recording, tracking, and interrater reliability) would be helpful for assessment and replication. It is interesting that the researchers note that PND18 rodents traveled a longer distance in the novel relocation task then the other groups (even though apparently PND20 rats exhibited more exploratory behavior). This finding may warrant further discussion to support the argument that both tasks assess potentially related cognitive functions. Reassurance that no statistical assumptions were violated (e.g., spherecity). Tukey HSDs are specifically based on studentized q related statistics but t-tests were reported. Though this may have been simply an alternative method (e.g. regression-based) to report the Tukey post-hoc results, possibly Bonferroni t-tests with separate mean square error denominators may be optimal for potential corrections to assumption violations.
