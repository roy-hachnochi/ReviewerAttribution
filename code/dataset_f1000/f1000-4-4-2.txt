This paper reports essentially a single finding with a single system and therefore it is important that it be viewed as motivation for further investigations rather than as strong support for a particular membrane fusion model. However, I believe the authors have adequately conveyed these limitations in their response to the earlier reviews and in the revised version of the paper.
