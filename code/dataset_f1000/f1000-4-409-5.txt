This article attempts to define common definitions for inter-changeable terms used in science communication through a literature review and survey of science communicators. It is a timely article, as this is a much sustained debate in both academic and practitioner circles, and relates to discussion in the literature about funding, incentivising and rewarding science communication. More particularly, it links directly to efforts to define the of science communication through processes such as the Research Excellence Framework and the Public Engagement with Research agenda. The article is well grounded in this literature and refers to many of the current debates in this field. The article uses survey results to move forward the debate on these definitions, attempting to find consensus amongst science communication practitioners. However there were only 47 participants involved in the survey, which is a low sample size. The authors acknowledge this point however, and also note that it may be useful to repeat the survey with researchers and professionals who dont consider themselves science communicators. Despite these limitations, the survey results indicate that while 66% of respondents state that their definitions match those of colleagues, the resulting qualitative data indicates wide differentiation. These results are presented through Wordle diagrams. While these are visually interesting, further qualitative thematic analysis, along with matrix analyses for coding frequency, could also have added to the results. Percentages are given for word frequency, but a methodology for how this was obtained would be useful. The resulting concluding definitions are a useful addition to the field, but still produce considerable overlap between activities. The article notes that further work is needed, and I would concur that this is a topic ripe for more in depth research.
