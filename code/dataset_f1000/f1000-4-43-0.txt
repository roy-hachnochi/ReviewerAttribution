The manuscript describes a proposed SMS-based system to use in locations where Ebola virus disease (EVD) is occurring to help direct possible cases to the nearest treatment centre that has beds available at the time. This is an interesting and useful idea and would work well in Africa where mobile phone technology is widely available. The manuscript is well written and the idea is presented well.
