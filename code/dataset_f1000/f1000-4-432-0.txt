Î™ have to admit that the authors of the paper improved significantly the quality of their work. I am very glad to see that the performance oriented issues have been adequately analysed and presented. The paper presents in detail the whole workflow of the experiments and the quality of its outcomes without leaving any doubts on the capabilities of AGRIS.
