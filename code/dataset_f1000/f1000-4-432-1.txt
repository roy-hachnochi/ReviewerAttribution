The manuscript is improved, I appreciate the authors' response to my comments (and those of the other referees). I have no real objections, however as I read the "checklist" for referees, may I suggest: - the title may be too generic for the specific contribution provided? Also, I know complete reproducibility is a Nirvana state, hardly ever attained in practice, but I appreciate the SW source code is available. I haven't checked but are you confident that anyone other than the authors can do anything useful with it?
