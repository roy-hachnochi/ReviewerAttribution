The paper has been modified to take my suggestions into consideration. The authors strongly took care with a more delicate explanation for the quality of proposed functionality, i.e., recommendations of web resources for an AGRIS article. They also revised the whole description of their thoughts on the paper in an acceptable way. This paper, as a software tool article, is acceptable to be indexed.
