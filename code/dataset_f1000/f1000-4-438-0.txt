The article presented here Villain of Molecular Biology: Why are we not reproducible in research? deals mainly with the issue of non-reproducibility of research citing many examples including the example of DNA structure elucidated by Watson and Crick. I feel this is very serious issue throughout the world. The author claims only about 10% research paper work is reproducible. However, keeping the recent development of genetic engineering and its product (used in day to day life e.g., Insulin, BT Cotton, and many more..) in mind, I think this figure should be more than that mentioned by authors, even though the authors are very much correct about the reproducibility of scientific work. Overall the manuscript is written in a very systematic way which fully justifies the title of the manuscript. In my opinion the manuscript is adequate for indexing.
