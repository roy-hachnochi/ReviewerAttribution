This is very interesting and well presented study; however the data does not support the title and conclusions at all of the present study. For this reviewer it is unclear what is the functional implication of females having an increased capacity for recovering from cancer state, given that there are non-significant differences in terms of pain behaviors and bone degradation between females and male rats. I think the authors are overstating the results and the results are not properly interpreted. Additionally, the authors have not considered that the loss of bioluminescence signal over time may due to gender-related differences in terms of bioavailability and excretion of D-Luciferin. In fact, the authors are strongly recommended to present the in vivo quantification of bioluiminescence signal after i.p. injection (as presented in figure 1B) in both females and males. Finally, a histopathological analysis of the bone is strongly needed in order to suggest that females rats are recovering faster than male rats.
