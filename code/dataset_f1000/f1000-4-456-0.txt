 Title and Abstract : The title and abstract is well formulated and indeed representative for the rest of the full text paper. Being an opinion article, it is made clear from the beginning including the abstract - that no new original data are presented; rather an experts summarization of available evidence regarding the use of suvorexant. Article content : Dr. Kripke provides a very thorough review of available literature, both published and unpublished reports, with regards to various aspects of suvorexant. Existing evidence (or lack thereof) of both efficacy, side-effects, risk/benefit ratio, comparisons studies etc., are clearly presented, and the conclusions drawn from these reports are well-balanced. Conclusions : The conclusions are very clearly stated, yet sensible, balanced as well as justified on the basis of the available data regarding suvorexant. I consider this an important contribution that will improve our understanding, and provide a solid scientific foundation useful for both clinicians and researchers alike.
