 In the Introduction you write: “Our study is a further contribution to this line of research, but for the first time within the social neuroscience and the GQT framework.” I do not understand why you think that you for the first time link GQT and social neuroscience. You only did an experiment of the type many others did before in a very similar way. Therefore, please omit the second half of the sentence. I do not understand the meaning of this sentence and the NT seems to be strangely introduced here: “It is important to point out that our experimental design is by its nature not able to distinguish between classical and non-local interactions even if the GQT implies a “no-signal-transfer (NT) theorem” that is only an acausal correlation between two complex neurophysiological observables of two entangled subsystems of a total global system.” My suggestion to indicate the limitations with respect to the GQT is: “It is important to point out that our experimental design is by its nature not able to distinguish between classical and non-local interactions. As in quantum physics, also here a Bell-type experiment would be necessary to distinguish between classical signal transfer and nonlocal correlation. Instead, here we only looked for correlations similarly to other studies of this type (see References)."
