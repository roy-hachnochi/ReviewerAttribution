Thank you for the improvements and adding the list of studies. I still have some concerns which I think should be regarded in order to be scientifically correct. They refer to your responses on my points raised above: 2. I still do not see all preconditions for the applicability of the GQT fulfilled. As you do not show that you should not state that "this relationship constitutes an entangled state". The GQT cannot be applied to any complex system. There are complex systems that behave just classically when split up into parts. Further, the random generator experiment of Walach can be connected with GQT as it analyses the matrix of physical and psychological variables and thereby excludes a signal transfer. In this aspect, your experimental design is rather of a classical nature and its non-local entanglement nature cannot be proven with it. Therefore, again, I suggest you to be more careful in the introduction. 3. Again, why did you choose the bands 1-16, 8-16, 8-12 and 9-10Hz? Why not the standard EEG bands? Or have you analyzed the other frequency bands? Then, it would be honest to report also the other frequency bands and correct for multiple testing. Searching for the highest effect in the data and reporting only this is statistically invalid. 6. If possible, please provide a mapping or some information showing the spatial distribution of the effect. Should be no problem as you have the data and the algorithms.
