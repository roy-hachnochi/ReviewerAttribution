 The work is interesting and well done, in terms of the experimental work and data processing, both part of EEG signal processing and a statistical approach. The abstract describes very precisely the content of the article. The addressed research stage is clearly exposed and has direct addressability with the experiment described in this article and it is well supported by bibliographic references. The analysis method of ERP (The GW6 method), used to extract useful information from the noise, seemed to me very appropriate in the context of the uncertainty of ERP occurrence in the EEG recordings of the receivers. Also, statistical analysis is well designed and properly made, it allowed the exclusion of chance from investigated phenomenology. The effect size in such experiments is small or very small, being on the border of chance. Therefore, it would have been appropriate to make a comparison with the effect size obtained in other experiments of this type. The results are well supported by the experimental data and the processing methods. I think that the authors provide sufficient data to replicate the experiment without having great difficulties, which supports the scientific nature of the research. Also, I say that I agree with changes made at the suggestion of one of the referees. For future research I think that generating a baseline obtained from experimental sessions in which any (no) stimulus will be applied, It would be more appropriate than the method used in this experiment.
