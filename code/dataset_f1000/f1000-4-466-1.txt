I think that this is a useful paper. Here are some minor comments You do not mention anything about multiple comparisons for the thresholding. I understand that these visualizations are mainly for obtaining a better understanding of the brain activation, but it would still be nice to mention the problems of multiple testing. For cluster level inference, I prefer if a cluster p-value threshold is used, and not an arbitrary cluster size like 400 mm 3 or 50 voxels. Cluster p-values can be obtained through parametric methods (Gaussian random field theory, available in SPM and FSL) or non-parametric methods (permutation testing, available in SnPM, FSL and BROCCOLI). I know that a very common approach is to use a cluster defining threshold of p = 0.001 or p = 0.005 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons), combined with an arbitrary cluster size threshold of 10 voxels. Such approaches should in my opinion be avoided, since the method is ad-hoc; it is impossible to know what the (corrected) p-value is for the combined procedure. The following paper may be of interest: Choong-Wan Woo, Anjali Krishnan, Tor D. Wager, Cluster-extent based thresholding in fMRI analyses: Pitfalls and recommendations, NeuroImage, Volume 91, 1 May 2014, Pages 412-419, ISSN 1053-8119, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.12.058 ------- You may mention two additional pieces of software, pysurfer and MevisLab. Pysurfer is a python tool for visualizing cortical surface representations https://pysurfer.github.io/ MevisLab is a free software that can be used for image processing and visualization. MevisLab includes functions from the libraries VTK and ITK, and it is easy to setup more advanced volume rendering pipelines, where you for example have several volume renderers, clip planes and more advanced transfer functions. http://www.mevislab.de/ ------- You do not mention anything about visualization research regarding fMRI. A more advanced way to visualize brain activation is to treat the activation as a light source in the anatomical volume, making the activity "glow" from the inside. You could include some of the following papers. Nguyen, T.
