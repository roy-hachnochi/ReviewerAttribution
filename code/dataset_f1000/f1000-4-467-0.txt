I have following points that should be clearly described: Fig 3 and 4 show surgical views. Authors must state with symbols (asterisks etc) to show what level of surgical work. We would suggest a detailed axial and sagital view of the MRI for the detail level of lumbar canal compression. EDB is sensitive for L5-S1 radiculopathy. Authors must verify it with EMG modality.
