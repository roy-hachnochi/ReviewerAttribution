The paper describes identification of putative CENP-C proteins in fish and points to the presence of CENP-C motif in M18BP1protein of many vertebrates but not mammals. CENP-C is an essential protein in building centromeres that interacts directly with CENP-A, epigenetic mark of centromeres, and its underlining DNA. Lack of conservation between CENP-C of different species has been attributed to adaptive evolution of the protein. Great evolutional variability has made it difficult to identify CENP-C proteins based only on simple sequence homology search. The author has noticed the lack of annotated CENP-C protein in fish and undertook an effort to use targeted database searches to identify putative CENP-C proteins. The paper fills in the gap of knowledge in the field. It presents interesting and valuable findings but I suggest a couple of changes that would help improve it. The central region of the human CENP-C should be labeled as 426-537 and not 426-552. For references see Caroll CW et al., 2010 1 ; Kato H et al. , 2013 2 ; Falk SJ et al ., 2015 3 , Falk SJ et al ., 2016 4 . The author couldn’t identify CENP-C motif in the putative proteins in fish but has instead identified a region that is more similar to the central region. Here previous findings on the role of central region and CENP-C motif should be clarified, emphasising that central region specifically binds CENP-A nucleosomes (which targets it to the centromere) (References: Caroll CW et al. , 2010 1 ; Falk SJ e t al . 2015 3 ) while CENP-C motif binds both types of nucleosomes non-selectively (H3 and CENP-A) with lower affinity (Kato H et al. , 2013 2 ). This can be followed with an exception in the chicken system, as suggested by the previous reviewer, Tatsuo Fukagawa. In this context, I find the absence of CENP-C motif less surprising, since the major function of CENP-C protein (its association with CENP-A nucleosomes) comes from central region anyway – making identified candidate proteins very likely fish CENP-C homologs. Subsequently, identification of the CENP-C motif in M18BP1 proteins is also less surprising knowing that it might just be a nucleosome binding module. In my opinion, region that has similarity to central region should be named “central region-like motif” instead of “cupin-proximal region”. I find this name very confusing. Minor comments: For the more lay audience, specify that teleost is the most populated branch of fish phylogenetic tree In figures 1 and 4, make a distinction between fish and other species, and indicate amino-acid specifications within each species protein like in figures 2 and 3.
