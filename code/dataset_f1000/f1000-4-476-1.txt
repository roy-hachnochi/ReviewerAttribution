The authors have come up with a useful plug-in for cytoscape. Different algorithms have been implemented to reduced a cluttered network to a more meaningful one. Such efforts are welcome and potentially useful especially for those working in network analysis and visualization. The manuscript can be enhanced by considering the suggestions below: 1. Include a schematic figure to illustrate the points mentioned in the Introduction for the benefit of a wider audience or non specialist users like experimental biologists. 2. It will be helpful to intended users like experimental biologists if different algorithm choices were explained in terms of what they mean, in which case it is advised to use which particular algorithm etc. 3. The authors mention that different sessions may lead to different trees. What are the potential pitfalls of this in generating results and possible different interpretations. Please discuss this aspect. 4. How do the authors define genetic distance? It is not clear. Is it based on correlation value of expression of genes? Please elaborate. 5. Figure 5, "MST on world network" - how to use a weight; for ex., effective distance between cities that is a measure of air-connectivity can be used to depict realistic distance than physical distance. 6. More discussion on interpretation of figures 6,7 and figures 8,9 will be helpful to the readers. 7. What is a way to verify that the solution is actually what it is supposed to be?
