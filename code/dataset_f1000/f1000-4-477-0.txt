In their manuscript entitled “SLiMScape 3.x: a Cytoscape 3 app for discovery of Short Linear Motifs in protein interaction networks”, Olorin et al. have described the use of their updated SLiMScape plugin (Cytoscape 2.x) as a SLiMScape 3.x APP (Cytoscape 3.x). The effort made by the research group to actually update the plugin for use with the latest version of Cytoscape is commendable. They have also added new tools to the updated APP. The integration of some of the SLiMSuite tools with the Cytoscape network analysis platform is likely to be of potential importance in the discovery of SLiMs. We believe that the manuscript is suitable for indexing. However, we have the following general queries: Are there any other APPs or plugins available with Cytoscape with similar utility? If yes, then has the performance of SLiMScape been compared with those? On pg.4 of the version 1 of the paper, the authors refer to the “SLiMSuite documentation” for the complete list of commandline options. It would be good if the link to the documentation be added somewhere in the manuscript.
