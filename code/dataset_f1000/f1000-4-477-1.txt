SLimfinder is one of the state of the art linear sequence motif discovery tool. The idea of short linear sequence motifs is intuitive, has been demonstrated as a binding mode for many domains and may govern PTMs to some extent. However, because of low sequence complexity, it is very hard to find motifs de novo in a reliable manner, i.e. statistically sound manner, and it is thus beyond the scope of non-motif expert biologist. Cytoscape 3 was a major change in network analysis. APPs are required that run easily and reliably and on a solid algorithmic basis, which are often computer intensive. This manuscript reports the update of the SLIMfinder plugin to a SLiMScape APP and provides a very detailed description how to use it and a test case searching for FBXW11 and BTRC WD40 domain binding motifs de novo (within the space of their interaction partners from INTACT). This is a very useful report for a very useful tool and the nice documentation, including the available cys sessions, will stimulate its use. Two minor points: Praxis of storage of data on the external server is a little unclear, I guess quite some potential use may find an option to make sure data are removed after analysis / after some time quite important. In practice output files will be renamed by the user, but it is always nice to give unique name to files that are exported e.g. coupled to jobID or something systematic, so that many outputs can be saved e.g. as batch and then processed with a script. If all are than this may get tedious.
