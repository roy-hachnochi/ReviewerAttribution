NetMatchStar improves the previous NetMatch tool, a Cytoscape app developed by the authors. It has more functions (e.g., supporting approximate querying with wild cards) and runs faster. It shall be interesting to users who are looking for tools that are able to find all the occurrences of a query graph in a network and check for its significance under different null models. The manuscript has detailed description and evaluation results.
