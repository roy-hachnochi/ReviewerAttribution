This is a different take on the approach to therapeutics for Ebola. The idea of using non-antivirals as potential therapeutics has been broached before, and it is natural to extend that proposition to Ebola. The authors provide a good summary of some candidate agents and the laboratory evidence to suggest it might be worth a try. Although the mechanistic explanation is not available, one mechanism which is common to some of them is by their effect on cell membrane transport through pores. The use of this class of drugs would also largely overcome some ethical issues which pertain to experimental drugs. Of course, in practice, the conduct of clinical trials would be more challenging than might appear. The finding of appropriate cases and controls, and the fact that mortality seems also largely determined by early access to supportive measures like re-hydration- these will complicate the ability to detect an outcome difference. On the subject of re-repurposing of drugs, we note also that some non-Ebola antivirals might be re-purposed for Ebola e.g. favipiravir, which has been approved for influenza in some countries.
