Thank you for responding to our comments. We just have one concern remaining, in reference to the following discussion: In our initial review we wrote, "On a related note, later in the sixth paragraph of the Database evaluation and implementation section, the authors state that There is also a limit on the amount of data that can be retrieved at one time from eUtils. NCBI recommends that no more than 500 publications be retrieved from a single eUtils query. The citation given is http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25498/ . However, this citation does not directly support this assertion. You responded: "Our apologies for the wrong citation. In Building Customized Data Pipelines Using The Entrez Programming Utilities ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1058/ ) under the Handling Large Datasets subheading, it is stated that large lists should be split into smaller batches of around 500 records. We have updated the manuscript to reflect this change." However, the new citation you provided refers to uploading UIDs, not downloading retrieved data. While it may be necessary when using Scopus, it is not necessary when using eUtils to modify queries so as to retrieve records in small batches. The actual maximum number of records that can be retrieved by a single query is 100,000, as indicated at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25499/ : "Increasing retmax allows more of the retrieved UIDs to be included in the XML output, up to a maximum of 100,000 records." One of us (M.B.) has used eUtils within the last year to download many thousands of records at a time, and can personally confirm that this is indeed possible.
