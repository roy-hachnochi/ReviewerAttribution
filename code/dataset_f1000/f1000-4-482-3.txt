The App is very useful and easy to use. As the article highlights It is very important to have a tool allowing the user to create animations from static frames of a network, and there are no other Cytoscape apps with the same characteristics of CyAnimator.

Minor changes: The sentence about the future implementation of the maps in the implementation section should be moved to the conclusions session or to the supplementary materials. So the reader can concentrate on the current features of the app. Similarly, the last sentence of the conclusions sounds better as "The ability to save the key frames of an animation as part of a session will be added .....".
