The report is insufficiently well written for me to evaluate the importance of the suggested tool. The current version of this article is unclear as to (1) the functionality provided by mp, (2) the intended usage model of mp. It also (3) conflates an overly-detailed example with the main paper. Is mp merely a translator from a .R format to multiple text document formats? Does mp perform any processing of the input data? Does mp provide stylistic control of the output from within a particular .R file or only through configuration variables? I dont fully understand the usage model. Is prose written within the .R file itself, or in the automatically generated .org, .Rnw or .tex files? If the former what markup syntax does mp provide? If the later does subsequent evaluations of mp overwrite the manually edited intermediate file? These questions should be addressed early on in the article. Finally, an inappropriate emphasis is placed on the experiment. All portions of the example experiment should be typeset to indicate that they are example and their technical content is not part of this publication and has not been peer reviewed. As it reads the and sections seemed to discuss the content of the example more than the content of the tool. While it seems very likely that the mp tool is a significant contribution to the practice of reproducible research, I am unable to evaluate its significance from this article.
