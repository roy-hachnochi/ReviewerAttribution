The authors describe the useful PesCa app for Cytoscape version 3.x for computing the shortest paths in networks and shortest paths connecting any two selected nodes and reconstruction of subnetworks based on maximum parsimony principle. The PesCa app scales well with efficiency in computation time on large networks. I agree with the point raised by reviewer 1 in version 1 of referee report. Minor concern Using terminology such as isolated nodes (nodes with no connection) and giant networks is making article confusing. Maximum parsimony principle needs to be elaborated in details. and how it scores over other methods such as maximum likelihood used for reconstruction of weighted and unweighted networks along with one illustrative example will help in better understanding of the concept. The representational figure 2 for demonstrating short paths from node 1 to node 9 can be improved by coloring edges involved in short paths with different color.
