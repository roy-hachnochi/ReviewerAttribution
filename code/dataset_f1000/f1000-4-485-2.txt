Baranzini et al. updated the iCTNet database from the data collected from public repositories to facilitate the building, visualization and analysis of heterogeneous biological networks in a comprehensive fashion via the Cytoscape platform. I like the manuscript and source developed by Baranzini group. The resource update is important and timely, and is well-done and clearly described. It is freely available and provides a good resource for the community to understand the connections between different omics or the big data in disease medicine. A few minor comments would improve the manuscript: Add some text in the conclusion about how version 2 is better than version 1. The Phentoypes/diseases vocabulary sources do not overlap much, did this result in a lot of data loss while integrating? Add some description regarding the edges in the Figure 2 legend. What are different node colors? GWAS network is much sparse because of the incompleteness of the interactome and also we have literature bias for the OMIM data. In figure 3, is the network PPI only or aggregated network of all sources? Also, Figure 3C should include only those terms that are below specific thresholds, like p0.05. Overall, an excellent work.
