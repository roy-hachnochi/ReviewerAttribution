This study shows the success of the radiofrequency-induced reduction of abdominal fat, while the correlation with the HRV changes (VLF spectral band). This is a very interesting study confirming the important link between obesity and cardiovascular risk parameters. It could discuss whether the HRV measurement is a good marker for the success of weight loss. It should be noted that the HRV measurement is highly selective, but not very specific. The only downside is that in the sense of a "proof of concept" study, the evidence is not high. The results should be confirmed with a randomized controlled trial. Congratulations to the authors!
