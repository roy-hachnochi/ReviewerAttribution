A stimulating paper, suggesting a new perspective on the nature of signaling peptides. The main idea can be summarized as follows: The mere structure of mature signaling peptides does not necessarily convey the information they carry, but rather their sheer existence, which is due to successful processes undergone by their propeptides, reliably indicates the phenotypic state of the signaling cell. The information given by signaling peptides is heard by the receiving cell because of the toxic nature of the signaling peptides their toxicity cannot be ignored by the receiving cell. This is a truly novel idea, which seems to be a solid consequence of natural selection. The authors present a few examples, yet as they point out sound experimental evidence is necessary. As a theoretician of evolutionary biology (but by no means an expert in cell biology!) I am not in a position to comment or to suggest such an experimentation. If this idea is valid, the consequences to some medical treatments can be substantial, as indicated in the papers last section.
