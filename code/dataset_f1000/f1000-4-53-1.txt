This report reviews recent research on Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies. The report is the result of a recent meeting of the scientific advisory board of the Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation and summarises suggestions made there. The article includes suggestions for improvements to diagnosis, including stratified testing for the most common mutations before screening for the rarer ones, and discussion of new and old animal models that have been developed to study and understand disease mechanisms and for the exploration of possible therapeutic strategies. It reviews other avenues of active research, including selective use of adenoviral vectors and stem cells that are being investigated for possible use in gene therapy for some forms of the disease, for understanding disease mechanisms, and for screening programmes for therapeutic drugs. It highlights the possibility that chemotherapy-induced toxicity may exacerbate some forms of CMT. It suggests that there is room for improved collaboration between different research groups and clinicians and more use of computational approaches. To my knowledge there are already several consortia in addition to the Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation that are already very active in trying to advance therapeutic strategies so I am not sure how much of a deficit there is in this area. On the clinical side a need for reliable biomarkers of the various disease forms is highlighted and the review ends with a discussion of clinical trials and the importance of involving patients and caregivers in the trial outcome measures is emphasised. Overall the article provides an up to date review of the research and possible treatments for this group of relatively rare diseases which will be of use to both researchers and clinicians in the field.
