It is an interesting series of two cases. Indeed the basic premise of the authors for proceeding with treatment of prostate cancer due to complications related with TRUS guided biopsy. Treating prostate by radical surgery without prior biopsy confirmation is challenging the age old dictum in oncology that cancer should not be treated until histologically proven. MRI imaging of the pelvis has improved significantly with the introduction of DW and MP technology. However, confirmation and final diagnosis of cancer remains a histologist domain. I have following observations on the current submission for the authors to comment The reference cited 1, 2 are relatively old, better pain control and improved in the TRUS technology and understanding the potential causes of infective complications are better understood now. the insidence of complication related to biopsy has decreased considerably. Although patients have given an informed consent there is a small possibility of not detecting cancer in the final pathology. Are there any medico legal implications.
