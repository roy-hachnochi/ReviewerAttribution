One reviewer (Dr. Laven) of this article noted an apparent conflict in the statistical reporting. He states, There is one statistical misstep, which is repeated on multiple occasions. After demonstrating no effect of treatment or its interaction with time on behaviour, they then compare the baseline and scarification results for each treatment and report that there were treatment effects for the differences. For example, for the combined head behaviours there was no effect of treatment or interaction with treatment and time (p=0.42 and 0.18, respectively); yet it is reported that for control group baseline and scarification were not different (p=0.75) but they were for the two other groups (p=0.02 and 0.04). This is effectively saying there is an interaction between treatment and time when it’s just been shown that there isn’t. As it’s not really referred to later losing this analysis does not affect the conclusions of the data. This is not a misstep. A lack of statistical significance for the interactions means that there wasn’t enough evidence to detect an interaction, not that an interaction doesn’t exist. The interaction test will have lower power than other tests. The authors correctly double checked the group significance cross-sectionally. It’s a good thing they did, because there is a slight interaction effect. That careful analysis is typical of this paper. The authors methodically verify each step of the study, leaving the reader with little doubt as to the strength of the conclusions. Enough details are provided so that another research team could replicate the study.
