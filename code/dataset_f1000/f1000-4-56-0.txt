This is a well designed in-vitro study, supported with adequate experimental data and statistical analysis. Results are accurately presented and discussed, in a clear and concise manner. The conclusions are justified on the basis of the presented results. Some minor revisions could be positively added to the manuscript, in the discussion part. The flaws of the in-vitro study of the retention of a thermoplastic oral device should, in my opinion, be also discussed as the human mouth motion has very little to do with the testing machine, in relation to lateral movements of the mandible. The influence of saliva, and maybe of mouth temperature might have an influence on the material properties with time.
