The title accurately conveys the articles content. The abstract is a good summary of the work being reported. The author clearly describes the application of an in vitro method for measuring the retentive forces of mandibular devices, to a new titratable thermoplastic device. This novel method was recently reported by the author and colleagues (citation 8). It seems to be a useful in vitro tool for assessing the ability of mandibular devices to resist displacement by jaw opening an important failing of many thermoplastic devices is poor oral retention. The technique naturally has its limitations, which have been discussed in detail in citation 8. It would be worth the author briefly referring to them in this article including: lack of lubrication; linear carrier movement vs. non-linear, least resistance pathway of jaw opening in vivo ; the use of carriers from only 1 patient. It is not clear how 730 cycles represents a years use. If it refers to jaw opening at the end of the night to remove the device then should this not be 365? Nonetheless the data are credible and provide useful insight (alongside citation 8) into the varying in vivo retentive properties of different devices; and device durability; and further demonstrate a potentially straightforward means of in vitro OA testing. The protrusions used were clinically relevant. I agree with the authors conclusions, that the results suggest thermoplastic OAms (with adequate retentive properties) could have a role in: titration; temporary custom made device substitution; and longer term treatment. However I disagree that titration is now a prerequisite for successful OA treatment, because there is strong evidence that non-titratable devices do work ( Thorax 2014;69:10 938-945 ); and the superiority of titration has not been proven by rigorous head-to-head trials. Finally, device effectiveness depends as much on comfort and tolerability (influencing adherence) as on oral retention.
