This article addresses an important issue: what countries can do to ensure that patients with rare diseases have access to safe, effective and affordable medicines. It is essentially a descriptive (rather than critical/analytic) article, that would primarily be of interest to those involved in orphan disease policymaking. A few points for improvement: It is not clear how the first part of title "The role of globalization in drug development and access to orphan drugs" relates to the article. The article is a description of orphan drug-related laws and policies in a series of countries, so it is not clear what is meant by "the role of globalisation" The introduction could be organised better by discussing orphan drugs in general, and then giving the facts and figures regarding Latin America (rather than weaving the two together as is currently the case). It would be helpful to know a bit more about the health systems in the countries discussed so that the descriptions of orphan drug provisions can be placed in context. Finally, it would be helpful to know why the countries were divided according to the definition of rare disease that they have adopted. Was there some expectation that different definitions would lead to different policies and laws?
