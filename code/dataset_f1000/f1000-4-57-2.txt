The authors add to the public domain valuable information about the legislative and policy steps in selected Latin American countries to deal with rare disorders. This is welcome in the context of the emerging globalisation of health polices modelled on the success of pioneering policies elsewhere, particularly in the United States, Japan and the European Union. The work describes actual policy initiatives in Latin America, and avoids the frequent limits of much discussion on this topic which often concentrates primarily on the US and EU experience and simply advocates greater adoption of such policies elsewhere. Here we see the real experience of the globalisation process in its impact in several countries in a specific region. It is notable that the authors briefly describe some aspects of diagnosis, prevention, healthcare, and rehabilitation in their discussion. But the article begins and concludes with strong emphasis on discovery, regulation and reimbursement of novel drugs for rare diseases. While drug discovery and access are of great importance to rare disease patients and their families, so too is the rest of their journey through life in the health and disability system. This and future articles on the topic could be enhanced by greater commentary on how these other important matters are also addressed in various national plans. The work highlights the need for similar investigation of rare disease policies in other world regions, to add to the global knowledge set.
