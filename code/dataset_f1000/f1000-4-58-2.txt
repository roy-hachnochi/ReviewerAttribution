The article proposed an integrative strategy in anticipation of the next outbreak of an emerging or reemerging infectious disease like Ebola. The authors suggested seven cost effective steps that help to establish a synergistic mechanism for a fast discovery of small molecule therapeutics. Under this mechanism, the information and data from publications, patents, and database, even some reagents and assays in different labs, could be shared instantaneously and efficiently among scientific and clinical communities around the globe. The direct experience of physicians is also a great plus. These cost effective approaches could be implemented to prepare in advance for the next pathogen outbreak or newly identified infectious disease that is definite no matter when or where it starts. The article is interesting and will be beneficial for an efficient battle against the future new outbreaks of infectious diseases. Minors: Some sentences are confused and needed to be more concise or clarified: In the case of EBOV we immediately found antiviral medicinal chemistry basic recall searches (i.e. not authentic text mining) had specificity challenges, even just associated with synonyms for EBOV, related isolates and phylogenetic neighbors (e.g. Marburg virus). The advantages of this to pathogen drug discovery (including the abrogation of intellectual property generation) primary data sharing can then become instantaneous and global.
