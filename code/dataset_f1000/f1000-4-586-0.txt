Sunil Munakomi and Bijoy Kumar presented an interesting case report about a traumatic vein of Labb haemorrhagic infarction. However, several aspects need to be considered before acceptance. Major: lack of specificity. The first CT brain presented is an urgent early CT scan, showing multi traumatic injuries, with contra coup contusions. It is not evident that the right-sided haemorrhagic defects are infarctions or contusions. Furthermore, the CT brain after decompressive craniectomy shows no residual infarction in the region of vein of labb. This is strange since the treatment does not provide any recovery of the thrombosis in the vein of labb. The case presented is a result of early decompression in a TBI patient. Major: The surgery that is performed is far from delicate and not in line with TBI guidelines. The bone flap that is performed is very small; removal of such small flap is a high risk for developing mushroom like herniation of the brain after decompression. Furthermore the authors performed haemorrhage removal during surgery. The haemorrhage is within the brain, meaning they removed contusions sq. infarction. This part of treatment is only performed in highly complicated cases where there is no choice but to remove the brain.
