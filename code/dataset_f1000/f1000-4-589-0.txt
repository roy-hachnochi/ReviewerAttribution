Ive looked at this paper and have some comments and concerns, some of which reflect the other reviewers comments. I believe that there have been previous demonstrations of Arrhenius behaviour in unfolding simulations, including for crambin (see e.g. Ferrara et al . J. Phys. Chem. B 2000, 104, 5000-5010 ) and other proteins (e.g. Piana et al. PNAS 109 1784517850, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1201811109 ). Consideration of protein stability is crucial here (see Scalley and Baker Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Sep 30; 94(20): 1063610640 ) and as the current simulations are run at high temperatures where the protein is unstable, this is an issue. The dielectric behaviour of the water model at these high temperatures is also a concern for me.
