I have two main critical points: The conceptual one is that the loss of the beta sheet or the bend could not be, strictly speaking, classified as "unfolding". There is very little in the text that describes how specifically the authors quantified the moment of this loss of structure. Looking at Fig. 1 it can be seen that both motifs come back for some periods of time. Is this a loss of structure or just equilibrium fluctuations? If the latter, then there are no observable unfolding event in the data. As authors rightfully admit, the uncertainty of these loss of structure times is very high, especially at low temperatures. This is most likely because the length of simulations, 1-10ns, is too short (as again, the authors mention this in the text) and also because the algorithm of determining these times is not statistically robust. For proteins, even small ones like crambin, typical time scales for structural rearrangements is of the order of tens of nanoseconds. Even dialanin takes hundreds of nanoseconds to accumulate statistically sound number of its very simple conformational transitions. Taking into account these points, the main conclusion of the authors based on data shown on Fig. 2-4 appears unsubstantiated to me. Overall, the paper is interesting and worth indexing if the authors more rigorously calculate the "loss of structure" times. I would consider building a statistical network on the major conformational states, in the spirit of Markov States Model. Then, the average transition times would faithfully represent the "unfolding" events.
