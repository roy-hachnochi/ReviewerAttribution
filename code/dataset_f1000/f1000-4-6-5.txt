Thank you for an interesting article which overviews an emerging form of publication / peer review General Comments: At an early point, the author defines OPR as simply naming the authors and reviewers ( any scholarly review mechanism providing disclosure of author and referee identities to one another at any point during the peer review or publication process ), but then goes on (e.g. in the 2 nd half of para 1 of Open Peer Review ) to discuss it as if it also includes making those comments publicly available at the time of publication (something which is certainly considered part of OPR by many people). Therefore, the author either needs to expand their definition, or they need to word their commentary differently. For example, when the author makes statements that: "More broadly speaking, OPR provides the scholarly community an insight into author/referee conversations during the review process." They are implying that the community can read the comments upon publication. This is not the case when using the narrow definition which the author has adopted (which is stated as any scholarly review mechanism providing disclosure of author and referee identities to one another at any point during the peer review or publication process and thus does not explicitly include the possibility that peer-review comments will be made public upon publication). I suggest that the author clearly defines what they mean as OPR for the purposes of this article Note: It is interesting that all the studied journals are OA is that worth a discussion? Is OA more naturally favorable to OPR? Are there any subscription journals operating OPR? If not, why not? Edits: have approached is as supplementary should read have approached it as supplementary PLoS One should be written PLOS ONE throughout "individuals may publish in PeerJ a dedicated number of times per year" edit to: individuals may publish in PeerJ a specified number of times per year peer review of assigned articles to be completed by at least one reviewer, change to: peer review of assigned articles to be completed by at least two reviewers, Grammar needs fixing in: In addition to reviews provided each work by two or three designated expert referees Notes: "By publishing research from multiple disciplines, the journal boasts PLoS One use of the word seems unnecessarily emotional here. The first implementation of OPR occurred at Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics with its launch in 2001 This seems unlikely. Is there a reference? The article then says: "Perhaps the oldest of the open peer reviewed publications is Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics . So which is it? The oldest? Or the oldest? In addition to PLoS Ones version of signed review, the journal enables crowd-sourced review, which occurs post-publication. Although I note the authors definition of crowd sourced review (their bullet 5 in Methods), it is worth saying that at the time this article was written, PLOS ONE did not (and still doesnt, I believe) regard (or promote) their commenting facility as a form of review. Instead they regard it as a way to enable post publication commentary. Same goes for PeerJ. "One unique aspect of this crowd-sourced review process is that PLoS One surfaces any media coverage of published articles by linking to them" This isnt necessarily unique, PeerJ does this as well via the ability for any user to add link. Also, many other journals do this via their article level metrics provision. PeerJ is an individual membership-based publisher in the biological and medical sciences. At the time this article was written this was correct. However, since that time, the journal changed the description of its model to publication plans rather than All works published by PeerJ are licensed with a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license Correct at the time the article was written. However, since that time the journal has upgraded to CC BY 4.0 Based on information from PeerJs website, it is unclear whether author and reviewer identities are disclosed to one another during the review process. I can clarify this reviewers are encouraged to name themselves (~40% choose to do so). If they do so, then the authors are first made aware of their identities in the decision letter that includes the comments of that reviewer. I examined four journals that boast open peer review processes, PLoS One, . Actually, I am not sure that PLOS ONE would claim this fact (and the author themselves observes that very few elements of OPR are provided by PLOS ONE) whereas F1000Resarch and PLoS One require referees to disclose their identities. This is not the case for PLOS ONE (unless something has changed which I am not aware of). The default for PLOS ONE reviewers is to remain anonymous.
