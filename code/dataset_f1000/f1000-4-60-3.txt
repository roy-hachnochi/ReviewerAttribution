 Claims Implement a linguistic-based approach that allows the identification of functional patterns from groups of functionally related proteins that does not require alignment of the proteins The method uses regular-expressions that are generated using a parse-tree that is modified via a genetic algorithm, and fitness is scored by accuracy using training data. Able to find discriminative patterns for serine-threonine phosphatases, zinc fingers, and multi-drug resistance (MDR) transporters Predict MDR transporters in a bacterial community from "Hot Lake" as a potential pool for novel MDR transporters that could be transferred to current bacteria as novel source of antibiotic resistance PILGram is able to identify and separate based on the binding region responsible for substrate specificity Praises From this version of the manuscript (v1), the claims are justified. Regular expressions are a linguistic construct, the authors are able to reproduce previously defined regexes without prior alignment using the PILGram method, and classify zinc fingers and MDRs by counting the number of regexes matching a particular sequence, resulting in the MDRPred method. This method, MDRPred was then applied to a newly sequenced bacterial community and possibly novel MDR transporters identified. In addition, from the text, the generation and validation of the regexes was done in a statistically rigorous way, with half of the data used for training and half of the data used for testing / validation / calculation of metrics. This is nice to see in this kind of paper, as it has become the exception rather than the rule. Reservations Although I think the general claims can be justified from the text, there are some areas of concern that I think should be addressed in a subsequent version of the manuscript. These reservations fall under these major areas, ordered in what I consider most important to least important: data availability for reproducibility actual MDRPred code actual ids for positive and negative examples Weak "substrate specificity" claim lack of description in the text leading to either lack of clarity or possible misunderstandings PILGram details Physiochemical Properties and TMR Elaboration of clustering Supplemental Table 1 Describing REGEXEs language implying other methods are not "linguistic" Each of these reservations are further detailed below. Data Code Availability Not all of the code / data necessary to reproduce the results are currently provided. While acknowledging that the primary algorithm (PILGram) is currently awaiting publication and that this is **not** the place to describe the particulars of that software, I think there are still steps to be taken to improve the reproducibililty of **this** publication by providing more of the data. It should be noted that when the PILGram algorithm is published, this publication should be updated with references and links to make it easier for others to find. That being said, this is a publication about a **method**, and although the particulars of the **method** are well described, there is no accompanying code, scripts, even psuedocode supplied so that the reader might make use of the **method** themselves, either on the provided supplementary FASTA files, or on their own sequences. I searched github for the term "mdrpred", and also for the lead authors name and twitter username to no avail. The need for an actual script or executable (preferably open source) is increased after reading the description of including PP-PRE and TMR-PRE, and calculating their matches, as this section is a little unclear as to how exactly that calculation is performed with no example (see comment below). In addition to the code, other data that should be included are: UniProt entries for positive and negative examples for serine-threonine phosphatases and zinc fingers genome accession and gene annotations from the metagenome analysed list of metagenome accessions annotated as MDRs using MDRPred Date of download of PROSITE data. prosite.dat on Mar 17, 2015 shows 198 positive matches for PS00125, and Im assuming 2018 (hard to tell from file) positive matches for PS00028, versus 166 and 1997 sequences mentioned in the text. Text files of the regexes generated by PILGram in each case Weak "substrate specificity" claim This is mentioned in the abstract, and 2 times in the introduction. The wording in the abstract implies that the method is able to delineate substrate specificity, i.e. that the method can generate regexes that are specific for different substrates. However, the one result implies rather that the regexes identify the region responsible for substrate specificity (which is really neat). These seem to be two different things in my mind, and I think either the claim in the abstract and introduction should be dropped or clarified, especially given that there is only one example provided. Finally, the claim is further weakened in the current text because the word **substrate** is missing from the paragraph discussing the evidence for substrate specificity (Results, Drug resistance transporters, Functional motifs identified, last paragraph in that section, no mention of "substrate", just specificity). More so than the "substrate specificty" claim, I think the authors would do well to place more emphasis on the fact that *all* of this work is done on sets of sequences **without alignment** first! It might just be me, but this was to me one of the most important things in the paper (and something I will probably make use of in my own research), that did not seem to be highlighted enough. Lack of Description PILGram Algorithmic Details Again I acknowledge that this is not the place to detail the full inner-workings of the PILGram algorithm, and the example in the text for BMI is useful. However, most genetic algorithms have a defined chromosome length defining the solution. I would have expected an analogous situation for PILGram, in that one would have to define the **length** of the regular expression. This does not appear to be the case here, given the variety of reg-exs noted for Zinc fingers and MDRs. As far as I can tell, this is likely due to the way that individual trees can be recombined, but it is not clear from the text how different length regexes result. Clarification of how different length regexes result would be useful. Physiochemical Properties and TMR I think I understand why the physiochemical properties (PP) and transmembrane region (TMR) score were included for the MDRPred, however there is currently no discussion of their inclusion or justification in the text. From the current description of them, it is also difficult to imagine how something matches the PP-PRE and TMR-PRE, including the PP and TMR scores as part of the match. Therefore I recommend: Having a better description of the PP and TMR scores in Methods Justification for the inclusion of PP-PRE and TMR-PRE in MDRPred. Currently the only justification is "Because we believed ...". I would hazard a guess that the accuracy drops precipitously without them, but there is nothing in the text currently describing why they are needed. Giving examples of how some PPs are different for different AAs Example of calculation of PP score and TMR score for a regex match Example of full match for a derived PP-PRE or TMR-PRE Elaboration of clustering In the Results, "Functional motifs identified", a description of clustering the generated models is provided. The current description is ambiguous. I think what was done was a vector of length 71 (corresponding to the number of training sequences) was generated for each model, with a 1 indicating a match to the model, and 0 indicating no match to the model. These 36 vectors (one for each model) were subsequently clustered using hierarchical clustering. No description of what distance metric was used to calculate the distance between the model vectors, nor which hierachical clustering method was used is provided. In the R stats package, there are: two variations of Wards minimum variance method, the complete linkage method, the single linkage method, median, and centroid. The software, version, and algorithm reference should be provided for completeness. Supplemental Figure 4 should have the clusters indicated on the figure (boxes or something). Supplemental Table 1 I believe supplemental table 1 could benefit from including: a description of what each column is beyond the title (for example, what is the difference between RESmall and RE??) a description of the PP that are included (it appears there are only 11 that end up being used) an indication of which are PRE, PP-PRE, and TMR-PRE Describing REGEXEs I use regular expressions regularly, but even still I found it difficult to follow the regular expressions listed in the text without looking to a reference. A short description, even in the supplemental materials of general features of the regexes would be useful. For example, the fact that [ABC] means one of either A or B or C at that position, that {3, 8} means either 3 or 8 letters between the previous and the next thing, and that [^ABC] means none of either A or B or C. Further, having examples of what portion of a sequence is matched, especially for the serine-threonine case where the sequence interval in general overlaps between the PROSITE pattern and the PILGram derived pattern. But also having examples for the Zinc finger showing the attributes shown, or describing what part of the regex encodes which features would help a lot. Language implying other methods are not linguistic In its current form, the abstract reads: "In this paper we describe a linguistic approach to identify ..." This implies that regular expressions in PROSITE and hidden markov models are not "linguistic" approaches. However, in the text, describing regular expressions used by PROSITE as the simplest form of grammar (regular grammars), and Hidden Markov models as a type of regular grammar (Introduction, paragraph 3). If these are grammars, then that implies they are linguistic approaches. In fact, from the description in the manuscript, PILGram generates regular expressions that in some cases are very similar to those used by PROSITE. It seems currently unclear as to how generating regular expressions using PILGram is a "linguistic" approach, but aligning and finding common features (as in PROSITE or HMMs) is not. I understand that PILGram is able to generate discriminative regexes without alignment first, and that is very useful (as exemplified by this manuscript), but from the current description that does not make it "linguistic". I admit I may be missing something in reading the current text in this area, as I am not a linguist. Other Simple Improvements Methods: under PILGram, first sentence, a reference is missing to SIEVE. Methods: PILGram example, example grammar, spaces around symbols would greatly improve the readability In Results: actually identify the **core** of the PROSITE reg-ex that PILGram is able to capture, noting that PILGram drops the first and last AA in the PROSITE one, and adds **Q** to the set of alternatives compared to PROSITE. Results: paragraph 2 says "Supplemental Table 1", but I believe this should be "Supplemental Figure 1". Results: "We found that applying logistic regression to combine these seven models provided a similar performance as the voting method, but underperformed the logistic regression on the complete set of models." **how much** did it underperform, curious minds want to know?? Methods: hot lake peptide data, the wording implies single bacterium genome, however, the **Results** makes it clear that a metagenome is being used. One of these two sections should be modified to clarify whether it was a single genome or a metagenome. In addition, if these sequences have been submitted, accession numbers should be provided.
