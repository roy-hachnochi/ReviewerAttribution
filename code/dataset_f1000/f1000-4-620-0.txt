The hypothesis put forward by the author is interesting, yet hard to prove. it is extremely difficult to separate the weight of individual exposures: the cosmic radiation at high altitudes and that related to sun exposure of the trip. The bibliography is extensive and still valid. Considering the bases from which originates the article, or the increased incidence of melanoma in the last decades and the multifactoriality, it might be interesting to start the case control study that the author sets out to accomplish. It would be necessary to consider some essential factors, including the frequency of air travel, the duration of the flight, altitude, intermittent sun exposure of patients during their trip.
