The authors raise the hypothesis that commercial jet travel by the general public may increase the risk of developing cutaneous melanoma through increased exposure to cosmic radiation or UVA radiation. Previous studies have shown an increased risk of melanoma in flight crews and pilots. The hypothesis in relation to UVA seems unlikely, given that most air travellers are well-clothed. The hypothesis in relation to cosmic radiation needs stronger evidence of the measured levels within aircraft. The author proposes a case-control study, but this seems unlikely to provide valid results - the most likely explanation of an increased risk of melanoma in flight crews and pilots is higher sun exposure at the locations that they fly to, especially of the intermittent high dose pattern that confers particular risk of melanoma. However sun exposure is poorly reported (as would be the measure of exposure in a case-control study) while air travel likely to be well-reported (and able to be validated). It will be impossible to clearly separate these "exposures". There is likely to be a very high correlation between a history of air travel and of sunny holidays in people with melanoma, such that a history of air travel is a proxy for high dose intermittent sun exposure. Findings resulting from such a study are highly likely to be spurious associations. It is an interesting hypothesis - a start would be to measure levels of cosmic radiation inside passenger aircraft, more clearly make the link between cosmic radiation and melanoma, and assess the body sites affected in cabin crew and pilots who develop melanoma.
