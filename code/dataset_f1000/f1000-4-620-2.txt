The hypothesis, Is frequent, commercial jet travel by the general public a risk factor for developing cutaneous melanoma?, provides an interesting perspective on possible reasons for the increasing incidence of melanoma worldwide. The author cites multiple studies documenting a significant increase in melanoma risk among commercial and military pilots as well as cabin crew. Possible reasons for this increase include exposure to cosmic ionizing radiation at cruising altitudes of 30,000 feet or higher, particularly on long haul routes, as well as increased exposure to UV light during flight. Given that a significant portion of the worlds population now takes advantage of the increased availability and frequency of jet travel, it is possible that the increased incidence of melanoma may be, in part, due to increased exposure to cosmic rays and/or UV exposure during high altitude jet travel. The author suggests that a case-control methodology be used to test his hypothesis, by assessing jet travel histories in melanoma patients and comparable controls, controlling for known risk factors such as age, skin type, and exposure history. It would be necessary to look at frequency of air travel, duration of flights, and altitude, and to disentangle patients intermittent sun exposure history from their jet travel history. If the hypothesis that frequent commercial jet travel represents an additional risk factor for developing cutaneous melanoma proves to be true, not only will it be necessary to look at the mechanisms behind this increased risk, but it will also be necessary to develop appropriate screening and preventive measures to decrease the morbidity and mortality to the greatest degree possible from air travel associated melanoma.
