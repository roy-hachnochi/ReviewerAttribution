The authors should better specify the nature of the surfactant 'Neonol AF 9-12', that is a polyethoxylated nonylphenol with ca. 12 ethylene oxide units, and the conditions of the cloud point extraction. In fact, the surfactant cloud point is rather high (ca. 86C?) and cooling down must be very sudden (quenching). Also, be sure that the conditions for iron preconcentration into the Neonol micellar phase are reported in ref.24. In addition, the paper deals with complexation with 1-nitroso-2 naphtol whereas ref.24 describes complexation with 1-nitroso-2 naphtol-3,6-disulfonic acid. The past tense ('was, were' instead of' is, are') should be used in the 'Procedure with cloud point extraction' and 'Reference procedure with bathophenanthroline'.
