It was gratifying to see that the author has further expanded his study based on my observations. The new finding of Wideman that Emc8 and Emc9 are vertebrate-specific paralogues explains the gain of EMC components in vertebrates. Well, however, have to wait for future research to know whether the duplication of Emc8 in these higher eukaryotes has any functional relevance. I feel that the author has rightfully addressed my major concern and thus approve the indexation of this revised manuscript.
