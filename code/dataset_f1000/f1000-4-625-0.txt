This Correspondence article was inspired by the authors recent review of an F1000Research report examining the temporal relationship between hippocampal anatomical development and spatial cognition. The first part of this opinion article summarizes their previous review and the second part nicely expands into a more theoretical discussion of the relationship between the cognitive and motor demands of spatial memory tasks. The manuscript calls attention to several important factors to be considered when critically evaluating performance in spatial memory tasks and I recommend approval.
