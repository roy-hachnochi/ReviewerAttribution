I read this report with high interests not only for this is a rare case of bone fragment moved into the third ventricle, I am also impressed by the surgical efforts to remove it. Obviously it is a successful operation and it indicates the well trained neurosurgical technique of the surgeon. The fatal outcome resulted from the failure of hypothalamus function, which is still a problem to be solved in the future.
