This is a rare case report from civilian society and is obviously will invite mixed school of thoughts. The authors have wise reasons, obstructive hydrocephalus and infection, for removing the third ventricular bone fragment and, in doing so, has stated that the hematoma track, formed by the fragment traversing through the parenchyma, has been followed. The authors had made prudent decision by keeping neuroendoscope in hand for the removal of fragment in case of complications. This report, I personally feel, encourages all trauma neurosurgeons to attempt removal of foreign body or possible source of infection or obstruction if it is accessible without undue further trauma to parenchyma.
