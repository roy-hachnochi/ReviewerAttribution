It seems obvious that surgery even on symptomatic intracerebral foreign bodies is determined by the anatomical availability and physiological fact. In this case, initially, it seems that the risk of surgery was higher than the risk of complications due to the presence of a foreign body and, therefore, the intervention was not justified. In order to give a more detailed review we would need to have a tomogram data on the patients condition. Based on the currently available outline of the situation, this patient would require more conservative treatment (aggressive antibiotic therapy in the presence of the slightest signs of SIRS or antibiotic prophylaxis from the first hours). Only if the patient on admission had a detailed diencephalic syndrome (and judging by the description they did not) and clinical signs of meningitis, would we try endoscopic removal of the foreign body (if it is of small size, somewhere up to 1 cm). Thus one alternative conservative intervention is to attempt endoscopic evacuation. If endoscopic evacuation is not possible (large size foreign bodies, technical inaccessibility through the ventricle), another possible surgical action that I would have done (but only in the case of ventriculitis) is external ventricular drainage. No more.
