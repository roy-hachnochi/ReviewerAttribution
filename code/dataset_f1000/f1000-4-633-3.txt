There were not any official publications in Vietnam regarding issue of pre-hospital delay in Vietnamese patients hospitalized with a first acute myocardial infarction until now. Therefore, the short report on this issue written by Hoa et al is highly appreciated. This study was conducted with a small and convenient sample of 103 AMI patients with their first AMI and the study approach was to review AMI patients' medical records after their discharge that must be embedded biases as it was a retrospective study. The inconsistence of asking and identifying time of delay by different health workers at the time of hospitalization and the different subjects who supplied information for health workers should be considered the main problems of the validity of data in this study beside 3 other limitations that the author has discussed on this paper. Moreover, it was likely that there were missing value regarding delay time occurred during process of extracting data from AMI patients' medical record. However, this study initially indicated 2 very important findings that pre-hospital delay time for hospitalization among AMI patients was much longer than that of AMI patients in the local and worldwide and patients who had a delay time over 6 hours were more likely to be female compared to -their counterparts. These findings make help in giving suggestion for further full-scale data of hospitalized patients with AMI across Hanoi in order to confirm these initial findings. I would like very much to approve for this short report as it is the starting point for further large-scale study in this issue in Vietnam where such information are still rare.
