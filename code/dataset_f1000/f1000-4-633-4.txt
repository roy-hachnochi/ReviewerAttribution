 It is not clear how the author obtained their samples. There is a very small population to study and to obtain valid conclusions from. It is uncertain how the time of chest pain was recorded. It appears there is no system that allows for a correct determination of the precise moment the patient arrives at the ER, due to the fact that in many patients this particular data is missing. The report is based on more than a hundred patients but in fact the author only presents data from 65 patients. There is no explanation about the findings nor factors. Because only a few patients were enrolled, it is not possible to determine factors related to early or delayed arrival at the hospital. Finally some data, which are in fact results, are written in the methods.
