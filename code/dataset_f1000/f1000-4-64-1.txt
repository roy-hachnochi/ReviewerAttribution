This interesting and timely study raises intriguing questions for future work. While it clearly shows that interactive lectures are popular with many students, there is some evidence of a cohort who prefer their lectures to be free from technology distractions. As the authors correctly note, the big unanswered question here is the potential impact on student attainment, which, as with most technological interventions, is difficult to measure accurately. Nonetheless, this work represents and responds to an area which many universities and staff are currently pondering, and as such it represents a useful contribution. I have no comments on the methodology, statistical analysis or writing which has been carried out at an exemplary level, other than to say it would be useful to see effect sizes calculated where statistically significant differences are claimed.
