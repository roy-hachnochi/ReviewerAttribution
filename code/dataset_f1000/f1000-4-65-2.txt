This is a nicely written manuscript that provides a fairly complete ligand binding Molecular Dynamics frame to Scapharca inaequivalvis HbI and several functionally relevant mutants. Trajectories of biatomic ligand molecules have been carefully examined in mutated proteins and have highlighted the contributions of or mutant induced cavities to the overall dynamics of ligand escape. Such contributions are proposed to profoundly affect the trajectories in a non-trivial manner, by the demonstration that filling cavities with bulky amino acid side chains does not automatically result in ligand exclusion from the cavity itself. At the same time, the simulation thus provided appears to tune down the role of a distal histidine gate that would not represent a significant escape route for the bound ligand in Scapharca HbI. In this respect, the discussion section could and should be improved. It might gain a wider and more general impact by including a comparison with similar molecular dynamics studies on myoglobin in which histidine rotamers appear to exert an effect upon ligand escape dynamics.
