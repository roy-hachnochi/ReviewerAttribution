The author has responded well to my criticisms, and the paper has become more readable. Even though one can still debate some of his suggestions (or speculations), I find the paper worthy of publication now, as it will help to enliven an already lively debate on the evolution of speech and language. I only have a few more issues with the References: In all fairness, the paper by Rauschecker Tian (2000) should be mentioned when introducing the concepts of auditory ventral and dorsal streams (AVS, ADS) on p. 4. The idea of parallel ventral and dorsal processing streams in the auditory system was first proposed and developed there and even earlier. I leave it up to the author, which one(s) of the papers below he wants to cite. I also wonder if references suggested by the reviewers shouldn’t generally be added to the overall reference list of the revised version. For instance, the papers by Bornkessel-Schlesewsky et al ., which seem highly relevant here, are still not cited, even though they are mentioned by two reviewers. References 1.

Its importance is three-fold: It treats the ventral and ... Continue reading READ ALL
