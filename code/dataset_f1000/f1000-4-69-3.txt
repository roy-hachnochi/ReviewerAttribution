I enjoyed reading this useful and well written contribution. I have a few comments: In the subsection of Results entitled Other animal models, the reader might benefit from a brief explanation of the model presented by McCairn et al: did this use a GABA antagonist like bicuculline? In the subsection entitled A look inside: neuroimaging studies, I personally found interesting a paper which is not cited and evaluates the potential of deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (deep rTMS) to the supplementary motor area ( Bloch et al .,2014 ) In respect to neurobiofeedback, as commented on in page 4, another useful paper on ADHD and tic disorders is Gevensleben et al. (2009) . Moreover, a 2015 citation focusing on neurofeedback is this useful review: Farkas et al . (2015) . My main criticism is that there is no citation at all about deep brain stimulation, which is an area currently avidly investigated in Tourette syndrome. It is possible that the authors felt that none of the articles published in 2014 on DBS in Tourette syndrome is sufficiently interesting, but I would at least discuss this in the article and add the following citation in Box 2: Schrock et al ., (2015) . Additional 2014 publications of interest: Chao TK, Hu J and Pringsheim T: Prenatal risk factors for Tourette syndrome: a systematic review. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth. 2014; 14 (53).
