Paula and Hanack touch upon a very timely and important topic. Namely, the use of antibodies in research and how this affects scientific reproducibility. The authors intend to provide a guideline to how antibodies should be selected (or generated) before the onset of a scientific project. This is an opinion article and therefore reflects the personal view of the authors. Although, I do not fully agree with all of the statements in the paper, I still consider this an interesting contribution to the discussion of how we can achieve a transparent use of research antibodies. My main concern is their view on standardization of antibody validation. Antibodies may require very different protocol and buffer conditions in order to reach their optimal performance. One example is described by Ghatak et al . http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016114000211 . A standardized antibody validation system would completely miss such information. Instead, I consider a system for effective sharing of antibody performance details from scientists around the World. This would be much more effective for achieving a reproducible use of antibodies in research.
