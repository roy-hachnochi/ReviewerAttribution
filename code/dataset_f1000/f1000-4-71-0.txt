I agree with the methodological aspects that the author highlights in his correspondence, and that the Samadani et al. paper would have been improved by a more detailed description of their methods as well as a validation or their method to compute disconjugacy. That said, it is uncertain to what extent the methodological aspects influence the differences between the experimental groups found by Samadani et al. The correspondence would therefore benefit from a quantitative investigation addressing the practical significance of (at least some of) the issues raised.
