Overall, this Correspondence does not offer a significant criticism of the paper of Samadani et al. (2015). The author does not specify what kinds of asymmetries exist due to the camera/source geometry. Usually the subject is centered in the Eyelink viewing aperture, so the view of the eyes would be symmetric. The attempt to argue that a 1-2% asymmetry between the eyes would significantly degrade the assessment capability does not seem plausible. The criticism of methodological unclarity may be justified in itself, but it has no bearing on the outcome of the paper since all patients would be equally subject to the same degree by the effects of asymmetry and lack of calibration. As stated, none of the criticisms suggest a systematic bias between the different patient categories. The significant differences among categories cannot therefore be attributed to any of the factors raised by the author, and controlling these factors should only improve the significance of the Samadani et al. results. The authors challenge to the findings of the paper is thus easily refuted. Moreover, despite the fact that this Correspondence is entirely concerned with calibration, it neglects to mention the fact that a core motivation for the Samadani et al. paper is the issue of a misleading spatial calibration metric. They are making the point that restrictions of eye movement may restrict the array of calibration positions, providing a false assessment that the subsequent test movements are normal. Their goal is thus to use the uncalibrated differences between the two eyes (which they term temporal calibration) as a probe for deficits that would be masked by the spatial calibration procedure. It is this strategy that the author should have addressed directly. On a stylistic note, I do not favor using the English possessive on the Latin phrase et al(ia) and recommend the form above, as in the Samadani et al . paper.
