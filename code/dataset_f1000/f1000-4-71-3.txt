The author makes a justified appeal for clarification of methodological issues concerning the study Eye tracking detects disconjugate eye movements associated with structural traumatic brain injury and concussion by Samadani et al. , 2015. The arguments raised by J. Maruta are very valid. Apart from clarification there is also a need for validation before this technique can be introduced in e.g. emergency rooms to quantify the severity of a concussive brain injury and the degree of recovery.
