The article has identified a 54bp homozygous insertion in exon-1 of LHCGR gene which was related to poor ovarian response and concluded that screening of LHCGR mutations/polymorphisms would be useful for prognosis and management of patients with low ovarian reserves. However, there are several concerns that must be adequately addressed and require a detailed response or additional data. The authors performed sequencing of LHCGR gene in patients with history of poor ovarian response, but detailed criterion of poor ovarian response was not characterized. The article mentioned that the patient with the 54bp homozygous insertion in exon-1 of LHCGR gene has a sibling with two children. Whether the sibling has been sequenced of LHCGR gene or not? The result of the sibling could help understand the origin and the function of the homozygous insertion. As described in the article, the patient with LHCGR gene insertion had a history of poor ovarian response and recurrent cyst formation. Why not try transvaginal oocyte retrieval which might improve the outcome? A minor detail is that although the language is excellent for a paper from a non-English speaking country, there are still a lot of grammatical errors that would benefit from editing by a native speaker.
