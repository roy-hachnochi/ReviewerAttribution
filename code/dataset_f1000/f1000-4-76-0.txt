The authors have made a coherent story which includes their case studies as an integral part of the narrative. They have also gone beyond my suggestions and strengthened their argument regarding the challenges facing teaching-focused academics. This paper is a welcome contribution to the debate around the role and status of teaching-focused academics, and I am delighted to approve it. Thank you, once again, for sharing your experiences.
