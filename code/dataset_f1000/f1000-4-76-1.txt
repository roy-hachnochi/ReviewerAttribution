The Opinion Article presents the views of four individuals who have reflected upon their own experiences in the context of a shift in the make up of the UK Higher Education Biosciences teaching community. The article makes a contribution to an on going discussion in the UK (and further afield) but brings to that discussion a fresh perspective (in my opinion observations on the experience of new teachers are too often made by those not new to teaching themselves). The authors suggest that the UK Higher Education Academy (HEA) no longer provides targeted support to teachers in the biosciences. Although it is the case that the HEA no longer support a Biosciences Subject Centre and their current emphasis seems to be focussed more on interdisciplinary/generic support the authors also refer (p4) to a recent HEA Biosciences meeting taking place in 2014 this is an apparent contradiction. Although I like the inclusion of the useful case studies (they provide a clear picture of the context of the authors and the lens through which they have constructed their argument) the structure of this paper is unusual. I feel that the reader progresses naturally through the main text and into the case studies and then reaches the end of the paper rather than coming to its conclusion. The authors might consider a subtitle to more clearly signpost the main concluding paragraph. I am happy to recommend the indexation of this paper. I think that it makes a useful contribution to a current discussion in bioscience education and I feel that it should give all members of the bioscience teaching faculty cause for reflection.
