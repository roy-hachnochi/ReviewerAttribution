The authors Munakomi et al. have written a nice case report which highlights a rare disease. Diffuse large cell, mixed and immunoblastic lymphomas of B cell origin should be considered together as aggressive lymphomas 1 which unlike MALT associated primary dural lymphomas are not indolent. However certain facts need to be discussed. Even though rare, this case is not the sixth reported in literature. Other extra axial locations noted are orbit 2 , Meckel cave 3 , 4 , parasellar 5 , 6 , zygoma 2 , 7 , cerebellopontine angle 8 . In 2010, 93 cases with dural based lymphomas with 10 having extra CNS (systemic involvement) had been reported 9 . Tumor immunophenotyping using flow cytometric analysis (CD5, CD10, CD19, and CD20) and by histochemical evaluation of the lymphoid cells is mandatory. These exhibit strong immunoreactivity both to leukocyte common antigen and to B-cell marker (L26). No staining should be noted for chromogranin, synaptophysin, or the epithelial markers AE1 and AE3 1 . Even though financial restriction is of concern in our country, contrast enhanced CT chest and abdomen should be the protocol to see for lymph node involvement rather than insensitive USG study. This may be a typo error, however to correct the same: Mannitol comes in 20% and not in 25% in Nepal. Image (figure 9) show a limited craniotomy causing brain herniation from the site of craniectomy and has been taken at a level lower than lesion previously shown in Figure 2. To allow comparison, it is suggested to provide CT images of same level or plane. Differential diagnosis should include meningiomas, metastases,extradural abscesses with osteomyelitis or extradural hematomas. Clues for diagnosis include a rapid progression of symptoms with permeative growth pattern with large soft tissue component in galeal and extradural compartment, restricted diffusion on MRI, and the presence of bone lytic lesions on CT, limited periosteal reaction and an angiographically avascular lesion except for blush or vascular encasement 1 , 10 . The treatment of choice for primary CNS lymphoma is chemotherapy (Adriamycin containing CHOP protocol) followed by radiation of the involved field and surgical excision is limited to conditions where mass effect is life threatening. Recognising this entity is important because an early diagnosis and rapid initiation of treatment, in certain cases with sole chemotherapy, is associated with a high response rates and favourable outcome 10 .
