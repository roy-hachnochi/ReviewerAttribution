The authors describe an academic conference and poster competition that occurred online in February 2015. Researchers were invited to share their work via Twitter in the form of an academic poster during a specified window of time on the day of the conference. The authors compare and contrast the online conference with poster sessions at traditional academic conferences, identifying several advantages and disadvantages. The article is well-written and serves as a good contribution to a growing body of work focusing on the changing modalities of scholarship and academic collaboration. Several minor comments: In the description for Table 1, the authors state that "on average, every poster potentially received in excess of 4500 views..." So that this caption can stand on its own, it would be helpful to clarify why the word "potentially" is used in this case. In Figure 2 there one line for "Reach" and another for "Tweets", but the Y-axis is labeled "Impressions". Given that readers may be expecting a second Y-axis, the caption for Figure 2 should be sufficient to explain these three concepts.
