The opinion piece by Mike Browning makes a clear proposal to reduce the problems associated with using research antibodies. He proposes a two-step process, where step 1 is to reduce variability and the second step is to improve validation. The main contribution seems to me to be highlighting the importance of variability- step 1. Overall it is nicely written, concise and makes a very useful contribution to the ongoing discussion about how to reduce the problems with research antibodies, something which is crucial to support progress and reproducibility in life sciences. I feel it is suitable for indexation. I had a couple of comments/questions about the commentary: A reasonable conclusion from the argument about variability seems to me that we should be working towards encouraging researchers to record and report lot numbers of the antibodies they use. Do you feel this would be beneficial? The suggestion of pooling positive serum seems very sensible. I would be interested to know how frequently is this done and if it is not done very often why is this?
