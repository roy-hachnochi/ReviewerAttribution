As the uses of social media in post-secondary instruction continue to proliferate across across disciplines, engaging in research that describe classroom approaches and measures outcomes is a valuable addition to this area of scholarship. Im happy to approve of this paper for: 1) its contributions to the scholarship of practice related to using Twitter in the classroom and 2) its methodology to measure the tools impact. Innovative, is the pedagogical design of a group-level use of the tool. The strengths of the research begin with the strong link and alignment between the course-level learning outcomes and the use of Twitter. This finding, and the implications of the importance of choosing e-Learning tools aligned with student learning, are important contributions beyond the field of teaching and learning with social media. Broadly, I would encourage the authors to make explicit links to the teaching and learning literature in the opening of the paper to strengthen the underpinning pedagogical arguments. For example, there are also more recent (and compelling) references than McLuhan in the literature to support the claim that large-class lectures are more passive. They write that active student engagement is "considered to be effective pedagogical practice"again, a link to research that substantiates this claim would improve the argument being laid out. While it may be implicit, I assume that students use of Twitter on smartphones was integral to the tools positive impact on engagement across the forested reserve. In this case, it is not just Twitter that had an impact, rather it was the combination of the platform (Twitter) and the internet-connected mobile device. This is a broad consideration for future research: how does the mobile, ubiquitous nature of smartphones, used in conjunction with a tool such as Twitter, impact student engagement and outcomes?
