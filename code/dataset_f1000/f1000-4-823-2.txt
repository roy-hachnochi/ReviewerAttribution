Abstract The title is appropriate for the content of the article and the abstract is a suitable summary of the work, though the last sentence of the abstract could include examples of “optimal preventive measures”. Article Content Introduction: Whenever describing “prevalence rates” be clear whether or not it represents seroprevalence. Also, when referring to “anti-HEV antibodies” include whether it is in reference to IgM or IgG. If there is any information on duration of detectable IgM/IgG after infection with HEV it would be helpful to include it. Lastly, if there is information on clinical significance of HEV infection it would be helpful to include it. For example, with West Nile virus infection 90% will be asymptomatic, 10% will have West Nile fever and 1% will have a more serious clinical course. And what is the clinical significance of a pregnant woman who is IgG positive for HEV and similarly her infant? Materials and Methods: Please explain why mothers with diabetes or hypertension were excluded. Table 1: Please clarify whether “haemoglobin, g/dl” was significantly different (p=0.008) between the two groups as the values (i.e., 9.9 vs. 10.4) appear to be very similar. Conclusions The fourth paragraph would be more appropriate for the introduction. More description is needed on “optimal preventive measures”. The author suggests that pregnant women be screened prenatally for anti-HEV antibodies. Please clarify whether this would be for IgG or IgM. Screening for IgG would simply reveal whether or not the woman has ever been infected with HEV. To my knowledge there would be no transmission risk therefore please clarify the benefit of a prenatal screening program and what should be done for women found to be anti-HEV positive and infants born to them.
