This is an interesting case as it shows a rather dramatic development and progression of squamous cell cancer of the bladder. I have few observations on this submission. In retrospect were there any observation on the part of bladder which subsequently showed any changes like hyperemia? The CT showed no evidence of T4 disease, however the per operative findings were quite different. What was the time frame between the CT and surgery?
