A case of drug-induced ILD after Nitrofurantoin Treatment due to recurrent UTIs is presented. Although there are some questions left (DD pulmonary infection, documentation on the CT scan shown) the report seems plausible. This is an important topic since NF use is increasing due to changes in international recommendations regarding antimicrobial treatment of UTIs (restriction of other antibiotic classes such as Co-trimoxazole and quinolones). I would however, recommend in comparable cases to perform a BAL for excluding infection and confirming the aetiology by a BAL cytology compatible with drug induced ILD (typically mixed pattern with lymphocytosis, eosinophilia and some PMN).
