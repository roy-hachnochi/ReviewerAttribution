With this revision, the authors have successfully addressed all my previous concerns. The installation instructions were much improved, and I was able to set up MetaGenSense without any major difficulty. The availability of a Virtual Machine was especially convenient for quick testing/assessing of the application, and I was able to run the example pipeline on the provided test data easily. The manuscript itself was also much improved and I am now happy to approve this manuscript. I think this is a nice example of how one can integrate a LIMS/project management system with Galaxy at the back-end for analysis. Minor (optional) remarks: Unless there is a compelling reason not to, please consider adding the requirements.txt file to the github repo, it was a little bit confusing that I had to create this file myself. Your installation instructions refer to the command "manage.py migrate" but this appears not to be implemented until Django 1.7, yet your documentation lists the requirement "Django==1.6.2". Consider changing the requirement version for Django from 1.6.2 to 1.7 (I had no problem running the rest of the setup using Django 1.7) or changing this part of the installation instructions to fit with Django 1.6.2. Capitalize "galaxy" in last paragraph of the manuscript ( [..] the tools needed in our metagenomic example workflow, a galaxy instance containing those tools [..]) For the VM, it would be useful if you also provided the login credentials for the admin user (mgs_admin) for MGS/Galaxy in your README on github, for those readers who may be interested in seeing how the admin side of the application works.
