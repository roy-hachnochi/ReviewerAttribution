Cytoglobin in regulating redox reactions with H2O2. The study design and methods used are appropriate to address the proposed questions. The data nicely show that distal His residues of this protein play key roles in maintaining heme stability during reactions with H2O2. Details of how many replicates and statistical analyses used to discern differences should be provided. Is the heme loss observed after reactions with H2O2 and His mutants due to heme release and/ or heme modification that in turn would preclude extraction and measurement by HPLC. The authors should provide some thoughts on how they think reactions with H2O2 (in the His mutants) is causing the heme to be released or degraded? Are the effects of the distal His exclusive for reactions with H2O2? Could the authors speculate a little more on whether their results are more generalizable to other biologically relevant peroxides (LOOH, ONOO(H) etc.).
