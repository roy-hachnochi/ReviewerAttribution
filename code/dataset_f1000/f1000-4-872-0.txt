This is an important study and is very well designed. The study has a clear objectives and aims to overcome four challenges in care for patients with multiple sclerosis. The objective of the article is to describe the study design and methods that were used to implement and evaluate the use of the home-based comprehensive care model (MAHA) to overcome the following four challenges: Difficulty in care access Caregiver burden Self-care challenges Societal burden The intervention uses the MAHA and Chronic Care Model. 50 patients will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention or usual care. The authors hypothesized that there would be fewer complications, higher quality of life, greater satisfaction with care, and reduced healthcare utilization to patients who received the intervention. The authors described the theory of change well and it is plausible. We have one suggestion to the investigation. If the objective is to improve care in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis, then iterative testing of changes, and learning from these tests, may be more valuable than testing the effectiveness of a "set intervention". This type of inquiry might lend itself to an ongoing type of treatment and modifications of the implementation of the intervention as opposed to an endline assessment. This would allow for a deeper understanding of the elements of the intervention that did and did not work. More importantly, one could look into why and how they worked or did not. The title and the abstract are appropriate for the article. We look forward to seeing the results of the study.
