This article aims to define a new study pre-protocol examining the efficacy of a home-based comprehensive care model, Multiple Sclerosis At Home Access (MAHA), in patients with Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS) versus the current healthcare delivery models. In particular the study pre-protocol describes a prospective 24 month block randomised controlled model using an estimated cohort of 50 patients in each arm with the following inclusion criteria; Progressive MS, Kurtze EDSS above or equal to 6.5,and live in a residence within 60 miles of the Omaha metropolitan area. The study is subject to review and approval by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB). It would be useful to outline the currently available comprehensive care model. The proposed study measures and data analysis should be sufficient in answering the outcome measures and specific study aims. In our opinion, this study pre-protocol, if approved, will add to the already established data with regard to comprehensive care models, and in particular may be of relevance to those focussing on patients with significant disability due MS as well as to other conditions.
