The authors performed exome sequencing of 1000 UK individuals from the 1958 Birth Cohort who are representative of an outbred population. This data set will be useful for the research community and for clinical genomics, especially since it provides individual genotypes from high-coverage data with a high-quality INDEL calling pipeline. The study is very clear and well described and it will provide a good quality data set for further research. It would be interesting to compare the variant calls of this study to the population based UK10K-cohorts call set which is based on low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 3781 samples (UK10K Consortium, 2015). The authors say low-frequency variants with allele frequencies between 0.2–5% are variants present in 2–50 individuals. It would have been more accurate to refer to allele counts of 4-100 instead, since the allele number is 2000 for 1000 individuals. I was wondering whether it would have been possible to keep all individuals in the principle components analysis if a different set of variants had been selected for analysis. In summary, the exome sequencing data set of 1000 UK individuals will provide the research community with a useful resource, a European based set of variants and especially a high- quality set of INDELs.
