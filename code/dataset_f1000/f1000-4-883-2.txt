This is well executed and data are available. If anything the authors are modest about impact. My report is below: Dr Rahman and her colleagues have summarized both variant and in/del variation in 1000 UK Biobank participants and shared these data. Their analyses show the rate of common and rare variation in the participants. While these estimates are important and underscore that rare variation is very common, possibly the largest impact of this work is the ability to assess the frequency of in/dels in a population-based cohort. Allele frequency data are among the most important consideration in determining whether a variant is pathogenic or not. Clinical laboratories and researchers alike rely on public databases for minor allele frequency data. As the authors rightfully point out, the ExaC variant database is a compilation of individuals with various diseases, which can skew allele frequencies. The Exome Variant Server is limited to heart, lung, and blood phenotypes, but contains no in/del data. While there is limited data within ancestry groups here, the well-curated in/del data will be a boon to those classifying variant pathogenicity. Further, the ability to access the phased sequence data provided here adds utility. This is an important resource that adds to our understanding of rare human variation.
