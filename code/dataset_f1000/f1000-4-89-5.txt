Rinchai et al. suggest a novel role for ADAM9 by mining exisiting dataset. This clever re-use of existing dataset is a demonstration on how scientists can test new hypothesis quickly, inexpensively and with more robustness. They also provide a web tool based on 172 curated datasets ( https://gxb.benaroyaresearch.org/dm3/geneBrowser ) which makes is a practical resource. All sections of the article is extremely well written and I strongly recommend the article be indexed subject to the following comments. Introduction: The introduction starts with the Refseq definition of ADAM9 and a thorough review of existing literature on gene function of ADAM9. It left me wondering what motivated them to ADAM9 until the first section of Results (Knowledge gap assessment). It would be useful to the reader if a brief sentence or two on the motivation to study this gene was at the beginning of the Introduction section. Figure 1: I find it very difficult to color match the Cell type on the x-axis of Figure 1 especially when it appears legend colors are sorted differently. A plot with seven smaller panels (one for each cell type) or even just 2 panels (nueturophils and monocytes) might be clearer. Can you add GSE60424 to title of Figure 1? General comment on Figures 2 - 5 and Tables 1 - 4 : a) There is an inconsistency in the number of datasets stated in text and demonstrated in the figure. E.g. the text for Figure 2 talks about seven datasets but figure only shows three and Table 1 also talks about three datasets but includes SOJIA vs Control and HIV vs Control from GSE29536. b) I find the process diagrams (top half of figures) distracting and redundant with text and legend. This space could be used to incorporate the other studies. I suggest incorporating the cell type and measurement type after the study names on plot (e.g. GSE34205 \n microarray on whole blood; GSE29536 \n RNA-seq on neutrophils). Legend is well described. c) The column for "Avg A - Avg B" is meaningless especially when comparing different platforms. The fold change (Avg A / Avg B) is more meaningful and would be worth stating to two decimal points. d) If possible, combine Tables 1 - 4 into one page, possibly a large table with subheadings for during infection, after treatment with PAMPs, during tissue remodelling etc ... T Forest plot: An alternative/additional suggestion to 3d is to present the data visually in the form of a forest plot with subheadings (e.g. https://www.nichd.nih.gov/cochrane_data/mcguirew_13/fig2019799225306621155.png ; test of heterogeneity might not be necessary). This allows the readers to visually scan all of the in one page. Many ways of doing this but I suggest calculating the Glass effect size (see R codes below) followed by foresplot function from R package rmeta or forestplot. The authors might also find such a plot on their webtool useful in the long run but this is beyond the scope of current paper. effectSize - function(baseline, posttest){ ## Source http://www.meta-analysis.com/downloads/Meta-analysis%20Effect%20sizes%20based%20on%20means.pdf stopifnot( length(posttest)==length(baseline) ) ## assume the data is in same patient order w - which( !is.na(posttest) !is.na(baseline) ) posttest - posttest[w] baseline - baseline[w] r - cor( posttest, baseline ) diff - posttest - baseline n - length(diff) S.diff - sqrt( var(baseline) + var(posttest) - 2*cov(baseline, posttest) ) # note: var(x - y) = var(x) + var(y) - 2cov(x, y) S.within - S.diff/sqrt(2*(1-r)) # same as S.pooled ## Cohens d ## d - mean(diff)/S.within var.d - ( 1/n + (d^2)/(2*n) ) * 2 * (1-r) ## Hedges g estimate ## cf - 1 - 3/(4*n -5) g - cf*d var.g - cf^2 * var.d se.g - sqrt(var.g) rm(posttest, baseline, w, r, diff, n, S.diff, S.within, d, var.d, cf, var.g) return( c( g=g, se.g=se.g, LCL=( g - 1.96*se.g), UCL=( g + 1.96*se.g) ) ) } I am unclear what Supplementary Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 adds to the paper. There is emerging evidence that the monocyte to lymphocyte ratio has relevance to susceptibility to infectious diseases (e.g. Wang et al. , 2015 ; Naranbhai et al. , 2014 ; Warimwe et al. , 2013 ). Could you speculate/demonstrate how you could potentially use your resource to test for this hypothesis? Perhaps using cell deconvulation methods on whole blood?
