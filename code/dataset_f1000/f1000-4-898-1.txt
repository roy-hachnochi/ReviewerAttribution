This article provides constructive and clear advice for learning designers and academics looking to re-design courses for blended delivery, and to make more effective use of the LMS (in this case, Moodle). I appreciated the accessible writing style, and would recommend this article to academics to assist in their teaching. A few small comments: I have some reservations about generalising student cohorts based on generational distinctions such as "Millenials", as this does not necessarily address the diversity of the student body. I do agree with your overall point - that its easy to source information online - though. There was a display error in Figure 7, where the numbers on the Y-axis of the graph displayed as signs (like #$). Im glad of the discussion on culture change as an important part of the process towards more effective use of Moodle, as I think this is one of the most important elements. I am reminded of the work on innovation diffusion in higher education - perhaps this might be relevant for inclusion in any future revisions. (See for example McLaren and Kenny 2015 in Australian Universities Review). I was curious as to the life of the project and workload involved in making these changes. How long did it take, and how many people worked on it? Obviously there was a positive effect on this course, and the new design was appreciated by students on the whole. How scalable was this initiative to more courses, and more institutions, and what sort of investment would be required? Thank you for the invitation to peer review; I found the article insightful.
