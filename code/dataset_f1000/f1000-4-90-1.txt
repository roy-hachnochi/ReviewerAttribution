This article described the planning and undertaking of the study design for the Xtreme Everest 2 research expedition which looks at Sherpa and lowlander responses to graduated hypobaric hypoxia. The authors are experienced in this kind on study having already worked on Xtreme Everest 1 study some years ago. The objectives are stated clearly and the rationale for the study described with the underlying physiology. Part of the difficulty of this kind of study is the recruitment process. It would be hard to recruit widely for this kind of expedition as the subjects are usually self-selecting, those people who are keen to explore and ascent to altitude. However the authors have explained their recruitment methods and the study participant information has been shown. The study itself is fairly straightforward and includes a gradual, measured ascent to altitude and a series of tests undertaken prior, during and after ascent and the descent following the expedition. Within the basic study there is a cohort of subjects taking part in the "nitrate" study, to investigate whether dietary nitrate supplementation has an impact on hypoxic tolerance and adaptation to altitude. A comprehensive table of outcomes and measurements is given which shows the magnitude of the study and the way in which the investigators aimed to separate the workload between cohorts. The measures taken are widespread and range from skeletal muscle mitochondrial function to blood composition and numerous cardiovascular and respiratory functional analysis for which this group of investigators have considerable experience. The data from this study will be beneficial to the field of hypoxia, altitude performance and will give us a better understanding into the adaptations found in those living at altitude. This will translate into patient care in the clinical scenario as hypoxia and oxygen delivery can affect many in intensive care.
