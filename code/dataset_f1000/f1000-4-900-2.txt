This is an update of a widely used tool, khmer, which is in broad use in the technical community around de Bruijn graphs and short reads, based on Bloom filters. It is a good update, provides link to the code, and is sensibly written with tests. I have no concern about the scientific aspect of this paper. I do find the author inclusion list taking a concept and going to the extreme, and I dont think it is sensible to have an anonymised author (en zyme) on the list, with in effect no way to attribute to a person this. Sciences openness in publication is also about attribution. Although I understand Titus consistency of having all git committers as authors, I think it is sensible to make a distinction of substantial/scientific changes, of which the vast majority of the authors are. Acknowledgements are precisely there to handle these other cases. I believe it is uncontroversial to appropriately trim the author list, to use the acknowledgements for anonymous improvement (happens regularly in science) and small details (again, a commonplace practice).
