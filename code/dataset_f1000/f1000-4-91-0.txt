The manuscript 'Case Report: A case of neurogenic bladder in the setting of Behet's disease after an initial diagnosis of multiple sclerosis' is an interesting paper. However, I have some comments addressed below. The case report is a readable report on an interesting topic. However, the authors do not report on any vaginal child delivery nor do they mention the BMI of the patient. Both are risk factors for stress urinary incontinence. It is very possible that before the MMK a mixed urinary incontinence was present and in retrospect it is always easy to say that the previous physicians did not do a good job. The blaming distracts from the main important message that patients with a neurogenic bladder are different from patients without a neurogenic bladder. Both referring physicians and physicians who provided the irreversible surgical treatment were responsible for the patient. This means that also the general practitioner and neurologist should be informed and know to whom they send their patients to. On a regular basis we observe maltreatment because the referring physician did not care to refer his or her patient specifically to an expert in the field. Some attention should be given to treatment with botulinum toxin and midurethral tapes, which were also around when the bladder augmentation was given.
