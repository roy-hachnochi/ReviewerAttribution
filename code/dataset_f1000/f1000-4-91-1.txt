First, the authors have to prove that this patient has Behcet’s Disease. For that, they have give the exact medical history of the patient. We know approximately when the patient started to have Neuro-psychiatric manifestations, but we don’t know when the oral ulcers started and how long after the genital ulcers appeared. Second, we have to know how long each attack of oral ulcer took to disappear. Then we have to know how long the duration between the two attacks was. Then after, we have to know how many ulcers appeared in each attack. Finally we have to know the exact clinical manifestations of the ulcers and their progression until their disappearance. The same has to be given for genital ulcers. It is primordial to remember that not any oral or genital ulcer is an aphthous ulcer, and only an aphthous ulcer can be used as a diagnostic criterion. There are many oral or genital ulcers that may resemble an aphthous lesion, to the eyes of a non-expert. It is why for case reports like this, a high definition picture of the lesion is essential to be sure of the nature of the lesion. Once it is accepted that the oral lesion is an aphthous lesion, the authors have to prove that the genital ulcers were also aphthous ulcers. Once the presence of oral and genital aphthous ulcers is proved, one can say that the patient may have a Behcet’s Disease, because the patient fulfills the International Criteria for Behcet’s Disease (the ICBD). However, as said before, the patient may not have Behcet’s Disease. To be sure, one has to not find any other reason for the presence of the symptoms together. When it is sure that the patient has Behcet’s Disease, one has to show that the neurological manifestations are related to Behcet’s Disease. A patient can have Behcet’s Disease and another neurological disease like Multiple Sclerosis. In this case, the patient refused an examination of the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
