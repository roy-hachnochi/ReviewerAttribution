This is an interesting report on a patient with Behcet’s disease and urological symptoms. The neurological description of presentation, progression, and treatment is outstanding. The case report nicely reviews Behcet’s disease for the reader in a clear and concise way. The authors should be commended for highlighting this uncommon disease. The presentation of the urological symptoms and the relationship to Behcet’s disease in this patient are not as clear. My comments: The introduction notes that the patient was treated with an ileocecal augment/continent stoma for neurogenic detrusor overactivity and DSD.The description, however, notes that she was in retention and could not void after a MMK procedure.Presenting fluro images would be helpful for the reader to better understand how the diagnosis of DSD was reached versus post procedural obstruction. By the history, she could not void after the MMK making it more likely that this is contributing to her retention. The discussion notes that the patient was not properly diagnosed by her urologists.Is it possible that she did have mixed incontinence prior to MMK and then developed complications from this procedure rather than a missed diagnosis of neurogenic DO? More data could be presented to highlight educational opportunities on what the authors feel the work up could have included prior to MMK to avoid the complication and to better work up neurogenic bladder patients. The authors could also touch on the role of Botox in treating neurogenic DO.
