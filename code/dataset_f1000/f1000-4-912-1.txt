TRMT10A is an tRNA (guanine) methyltransferase that is highly expressed in the pancreatic islet cells and brain. In the brain it appears expression occurs early during gestation and expression is in the dorsal telencephalon with high expression in the ventricular zone. Later there is expression in the cerebellum. This case report describes 2 siblings where the male is more severely affected. From previous reports and these 2 cases it appears to be an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by mild dysmorphic features including short stature, microcephaly, non-progressive intellectual disability predominantly affecting speech, no gross for fine motor difficulties and no cerebellar dysfunction. Previous reports have not described any specific changes on the imaging studies whereas this report shows periatrial and periventricular white matter changes consistent with delayed myelination. Furthermore, neither of these children had difficulties with glucose metabolism. In term of understanding the pathophysiology of how TRMT10A brain development there is more work needed. Nevertheless, in the setting of primary microcephaly with speech delay and abnormal glucose homeostasis, TRMT10A mutations should be considered.
