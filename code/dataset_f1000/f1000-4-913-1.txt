Overall, an important preliminary study assessing the 5 gene panel in whole blood to distinguish acute rejection from stable kidney allografts. The study is very small of only 7 AR (and 2 are borderline AR), and 5 controls, so it is unclear whether there is statistical power to generate the significant differences observed in previous studies referenced as #2 and #3. Inclusion of a discussion on the limitation of this study would be useful. There is a discrepancy with the study by Li et al 2012, however Li et al . indicated "all 5 genes had significant change in expression only with the presence of donor specific antibody" and since the 7 patients did not have DSA, this difference should be highlighted. With regards to the Lee et al . 2014 study, the overall discriminatory effectiveness of the 5 gene set was observed to be much reduced compared to the Li et al study. Only MAPK9 and PSEN1 were significantly different in AR, even then there was wide overlap in the values between the CMR and Healthy control groups. Notably there was no difference in the gene expression between the AMR and healthy control groups, a note of concern since the Li et al. demonstrated an association between DSA and the 5 gene panel. Furthermore it is unclear how the raw data could be used to supplement future studies; clarification is therefore needed. Without such a road map for the potential use of the data set, the study may be too preliminary for firm conclusions.
