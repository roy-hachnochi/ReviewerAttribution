I read with interest the newly revised version of the paper writen by Rinchai and colleagues. The revision is a clear improvement on the original submission. The authors have explored new avenues, generating new data that, in some cases, bolster their original conclusions concerning a potential immuno-modulatory role for vaccine-specific IgE responses. At the same time they acknowledge the fact that other, thus far unexplored, areas may reveal alternative explanations for the profiles they document, and that, perhaps most importantly, the results of immunisation in non-exposed North American adults - along with the associated immunological profiles - may prove to be a rather poor guide to the outcome of immunisation in sub-Saharan African babies.
