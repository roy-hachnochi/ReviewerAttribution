This article details a new paradigm in cancer genetics based on the recent original article published by the same group. The idea of the origin of the cancer phenotype based on the circulating nucleic acid/ chromatin fragments is really thought provoking and will generate a lot of interest in the cancer researchers. The manuscript is well written summarizing the salient features of their recently published article.
