This Software Tool is an open source R package for performing a wide variety of evolutionary genetic analyses. It comes at a particularly useful time when large data sets required to use these analytical techniques are more and more available. I predict this package will be used to a greater and greater extent over time. The team, with lead author Diogo Melo, has made a number of major innovations in the field of evolutionary quantitative genetics and this software tool is well within their purview. The group describes the potential application of the new software well, cites the sources for the development of the different methods included, and briefly explains each function with an adequate level of discussion. I found the section on Phylogenetic Comparisons most interesting, and would have liked more discussion of these points. Issues: It would be nice to include data for which the tools could be tried out on and examples of the output included in the text. I also worry about the power of some of these tests, and would appreciate if the authors were to think about adding in caveats where available. There are a few papers out currently that address these issues (e.g. Haber, 2011). For example, I have both heard and performed some analyses using another version of the DriftTest() function and it appears about 20 traits are required to ever reject the null hypothesis. As this package is sure to be used by researchers who are less acquainted with these issues they may be unaware of issues with sample sizes, etc.
