This was a useful paper and an informative read. The title is clear, although it might be indicated where the study was located (Hong Kong). I personally prefer structured abstracts. The methods and data analysis are well described. Sensible limitations, including that the study was restricted to one psychiatric unit, are provided. The author makes the valid point that few studies of this type are about elderly patients, and this study fills a gap in our knowledge, although it is confirmatory of much that we already know in the broader domain of psychiatric rehospitalisaton.
