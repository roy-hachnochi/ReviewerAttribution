In this article, Wong and his colleagues examined several factors that might predict re-hospitalization rates among elderly patients to a psychiatric unit. The study is a retrospective analysis of data from patients mostly at the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in Hong Kong – possible predictive factors obtained “in part” from previous studies in the same domain were sometimes included. The reported main factors related to re-admission included a history of multiple admissions to hospital, and suicidal and or violent behaviors. It isn’t surprising to note that patients with a history of suicidal or violent behaviors were at greater risk for re-admission as they require “acute” intervention (s). This is important as most re-admissions occurred in the first 6 months after discharge, raising concerns for the need for close outpatient follow up to ensure patient adherence to treatment plans. Importantly, and perhaps related to this, referral of patients to appropriate psychiatric disciplines was associated with fewer re-admissions. It was surprising that no significant differences were noted in the study, regarding outcomes between patients who lived alone or with others. This, as well as future studies to include patients with chronic psychiatric diseases may allow discoveries regarding relationships between outcomes as they may be affected by inclusion of psychiatric symptoms in patient histories when a patient is admitted to hospital in non-psychiatric wards. In summary, information reported in this study adds to our limited knowledge regarding the principle reasons for re-admission of elderly patients to hospital and, thus, may lead to improvements in patient care. Moreover, based on outcomes reported in this study, hospitals may benefit by relief from the usual challenges of inpatient bed availability and reimbursement from third party payers. More generally, health care costs might be reduced and family and other caregiver burdens lessened.
