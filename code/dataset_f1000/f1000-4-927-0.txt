This is a retrospective review of 94 IBD patients at a single center evaluating the IBD patient experience of colonoscopy. The importance of colonoscopy and mucosal healing requires more frequent colonoscopic exams and determining how to make the experience as pleasant as possible can improve patient satisfaction and patient compliance with recommended colonoscopy intervals. However, there are several missing components which are essential for determining how we can improve the patient's experience with colonoscopy. Overall, these findings don't provide any tangible items for the institution change in order to improve patient experience and more data should be included in this study which should be easily gleaned from the chart. The type of bowel prep used plays a role in patients satisfaction and tolerance of the bowel preparation. Smaller volume bowel preps have shown to have increased patient satisfaction and patient compliance. It should be reported if there is a standard bowel prep at the institution and evaluate which bowel prep was best tolerated amongst patients. The type of anesthesia also contributes to the overall patient experience and tolerance of the procedure. Is it typical in this center to use conscious sedation with narcotics/benzodiazepams or propofol sedation? Were both used and a comparison can be made as to which was better tolerated? The disease activity could also influence the patients perception of the procedure. Was disease activity assessed and reported as this can confound the results. The small size of the population studied limits full evaluation of additional factors that may contribute to IBD patient experience of colonoscopy.
