In the article “Colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: self-reported experience, understanding, anxieties and tolerance of the procedure,” the authors comment that the perception of colonoscopy significantly differs by gender and age of this unique patient population, where colonoscopy is required in frequent intervals. Females had a significantly worse perception of colonoscopy and a higher pre-procedural anxiety overall. Patients over the age of 55 were less worried about the procedure, and patients with prolonged duration of IBD expressed more discomfort with it. The survey is only based on a single hospital-institution and included 98 patients, of whom 46% were male. Although there are significant limitations in the study, it brings up an important point about how we physicians prepare our patient for an upcoming procedure. Overall good article, but the population examined was too small to make any significant findings.
