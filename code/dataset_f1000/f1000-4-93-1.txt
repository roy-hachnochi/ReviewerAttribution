Sand et al. examinesd the hypothesis that activity of the Ca2 + -permeable the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPV4 contributes to vascular dysfunction in an animal model of sepsis. The study utilized selective pharmacology and TRPV4 knockout animals to determine if loss of TRPV4 expression would be protective against sepsis induced by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Contrary to expectations, loss or blockade of TRPV4 had very little effect on LPS-induced hypotension. Similarly, reduction in mesenteric blood flow following LPS administration did not differ between treatment groups. LPS (24 hours) did not induce significant edema formation in control mice, but did cause edema in the kidneys of TRPV4 knockout mice. Edema was present in some tissues at an earlier (6 hours) time point but this response was not affected by TRPV4 block. Administration of the TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A caused an increase in mesenteric blood flow in 2 nd and 3 rd order mesenteric arteries in LPS but not control animals. This study is clearly written and the work was well designed and properly executed. The guiding hypothesis - block of TRPV4 channels would diminish vascular effects of sepsis - was based on an important study that showed circulatory collapses following systemic administration of a TRPV4 activating drug. This idea is entirely logical and of tremendous interest. Indeed, TRPV4 block appears to improve pulmonary edema associated with heart failure in rodents ( Thorneloe et al., 2012 ). However, the current findings do not indicate that block of TRPV4 is beneficial during sepsis. These disparate observations may reflect important differences between the pulmonary and systemic endothelium.
