This is a well-written review about beneficial effects of coffee on fibrogenesis and liver injury encompassing both lab and clinical studies. A couple points warrant the authors attention: Caffeine also regulates phosphodiesterases. Could this be a contributory factor for beneficial effects? Carbonated beverages also have significant levels of caffeine. Not aware of their benefits for fibrosis though. Any literature about this in context of fibrosis to support or refute the concept of caffeine as the antifibrotic component of coffee?
