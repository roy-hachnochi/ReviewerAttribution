This is an excellent review regarding an area of some controversy, the beneficial effects of coffee/caffeine on liver disease. Feld, et al . have presented recent studies from both human populations as well as animal studies that provide more mechanistic data. The review is concise and highlights important work without bogging the reader down in too much detail. From this review, its clear that more work needs to be done to fully understand the potential benefits of coffee and caffeine on liver fibrosis and other liver diseases.
