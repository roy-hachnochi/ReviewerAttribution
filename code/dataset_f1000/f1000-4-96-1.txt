The Dijkstra and Alexander correspondence suggests that the noncoding NKILA RNA effects on NF-B signaling in breast cancer cells of the recent Liu et al. Cancer Cell publication may be partly mediated via the protein coding PMEPA1 gene, which is positioned in an antisense orientation (head to head) to the NKILA locus. While the authors do not question the main thesis of the Liu paper, namely the direct interaction of the NKILA RNA to p65 that leads to inhibition of IB phosphorylation, they highlight certain published data, which are indicative of a role of PMEDA1 in breast cancer and, interestingly, of a possible reciprocal regulation of PMEDA1 and NKILA. In my opinion, the hypothesis put forward by Dijkstra and Alexander is of interest and should be experimentally addressed to test whether there is indeed an interplay between the sense-antisense PMEDA1-NKILA gene pair, which may further expand the biological roles and mechanisms of action of the NKILA noncoding RNA. In particular, I would like to see the impact of PMEDA1 depletion in the observable NKILA biological effects and vice versa the impact of NKILA depletion in PMADA1 gene expression. Clearly, a state of validating or refuting a hypothesis by experimental means is in front of the scientific community.
