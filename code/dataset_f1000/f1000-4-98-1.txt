The article provides a very good algorithm to follow in case a patient with an unsatisfactory epidural requires anesthesia for a C-section. For completeness I would suggest that the authors be more specific in describing the medications used in different situations of blocks (exact medication, recommended concentration and dose). I would also recommend that the authors be slightly more detailed when describing the "rapid sequence spinal", in particular as this appears to be a rather new and controversial topic. Otherwise its a great article.
