The paper of French et al. "Linking patient outcome to high throughput protein expression data identifies novel regulators of colorectal adenocarcinoma" utilizes publicly available RPPA data for colorectal adenocarcinoma with the objective to predict patient survival. Two factors were identified to be significantly associated with bad prognosis: high levels of IGFBP2 and low levels of GATA binding protein 3. GATA3 protein level is not correlated with its RNA level, highlighting the interest of RPPA use. a Proteins accumulation in tissue microarray was performed, and biological validation in cell culture was provided for GATA3, through retroviral delivery in colon cancer cell lines. Over expression of GATA3 specifically reduced invasion in a transwell filter assay, and reduced the size of colony formation in matrigel without effect on cell proliferation in 2D cultures. The data are sound, convincing and of interest for the community.
