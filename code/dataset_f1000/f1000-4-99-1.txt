The research article Linking patient outcome to high throughput protein expression data identifies novel regulators of colorectal adenocarcinoma aggressiveness by French et al presents a solid and well-structured study examining the link between protein signaling data and potentially predicting patient survival, in particular for colorectal cancer. To perform their research, they have utilized publically available databases to detect protein expression changes in colorectal cancer. The appropriateness and robustness of their experimental design is encompassed by the validation through multiple computational methods which identified a number of known, but more importantly new potential regulators of colorectal cancer. Increased levels of IGFBP2 were shown to be associated with tumour recurrence and death. In addition, they also identified that GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) expression was also associated with patient outcome (being significantly decreased in the lower stage colorectal cancer patients). Confirmation of the role of GATA3 was shown in their proliferation and invasion laboratory studies. The results are clearly presented and extensively rationalized in the discussion, for which the authors must be commended. It is a comprehensive study which will be of interest to many readers who wish to undertake similar approaches utilizing protein expression data in public databases as a foundation of their laboratory research. It is an excellent addition to the current literature.
