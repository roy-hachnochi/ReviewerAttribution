Bharmauria and Bachatene propose that the neurones termed “repulsive” (as they change their preferred orientation while challenged with the adaptor but do not follow it) are fundamental “ to preserve the functional organisation of the cortex” or as it is found in a different place “to participate in conservation of the columnar dogma”. I neither recognise the arguments for this concept or the evidence that it is based on. Why would the presence of refractory neurones not be sufficient if any “columnar dogma” or “the reference” is required? Additionally, as the preferred orientation of neurones changes with the duration of adaptor presentation, it is plausible that the repulsive and even refractory neurones are still shifting to the adaptor’s orientation. If the shifting is never absolute the remaining refractory and repulsive neurones could just have no function (noise). In any case the eventual function of refractory and repulsive neurones can be at present tested in small-scale experiment, as the appropriate technology is available. On the other hand, it would be much easier to test at first whether the repulsive and refractory neurones really exist (long adapting experiment) and if they are whether they are fixed at these functions (series of different adaptors’ presentation experiment with use of the same population of neurones). The results should aid the concepts, which are premature at present.
