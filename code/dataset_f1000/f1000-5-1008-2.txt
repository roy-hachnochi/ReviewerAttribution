The manuscript by Bharmauria Bachatene is a provocative opinion article that claims a role for a particular set of visual cortex neurons in mediating/maintaining some functional aspects of the organization of the visual cortex in response to external stimuli. The script is interesting, well written, and reviews the pertinent literature. It is has potential implications in terms of neural circuitries computation of sensory information in the brain. Using orientation columns as an experimental model, the authors propose that repulsive neurons may play an important role in the orientation processing by visual cortical neurons. The discussion is based on the emerging view that neuronal dendrites possess synapses corresponding to all orientation columns. The authors, however, fail to provide additional anatomical insights that may support their hypothesis. For instance, when thinking about neurons that learn orientation or repulsions shifts after adaptation, horizontal connections between spatially separated cortical areas represented by inhibitory interneurons that may ultimately influence synapses of dendrites of single units, immediately come to oneâ€™s mind. Can the authors rule out this possibility? The work may also get insights from a description of experimental models designed to address the potential role of repulsive shifts in the preservation of the functional organization in the visual cortex.
