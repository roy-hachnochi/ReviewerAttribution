The title and abstract are appropriate and accurately reflect the content of the article. Study design and methodology are sound and reflect the aims of the study. The conclusions are valid. Some minor points for correction: Introduction p.2- the author should correct the references to the 2 papers authored by Norgett and Siderov. The 2014 paper did not use commercially available tests and the 2011 paper did not have adult participants. Methods Please confirm if the participants wore their spectacle correction during the trials. Statistics p.3. spelling error 'Bonferroni'. In the last complete sentence on p.3, the sentence would read better with the word 'from' substituted with 'than', to read '...performance with top and bottom bars was significantly lower than unflanked conditions...' Table 1: The central column should have units- (letter-widths). Decimal places within the table should be consistent. Discussion spelling error in the last line of p.7- Sonksen First sentence of p.8 'currently available test' should be ' tests ' plural. First sentence on 2nd column should read 'crowding magnitude differs' rather than 'differ'.
