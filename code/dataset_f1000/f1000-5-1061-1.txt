These authors have attempted to develop a method for transforming the highly oligomeric light harvesting 2 (LH2) and LH1-reaction center (RC) core complexes into dimers (and trimers) of the alpha/beta hetrodimer, as a means of obtaining an improved understanding of energy transfer within isolated portions of the full arrays. In 4 of the Introduction, the authors need to cite and elaborate on the work by Westerhuis et al . (2002), stating that a method was previously developed for the isolation of a series of light-harvesting 1 (LH1) oligomers from the fully arrayed LH1-RC core complex. In this procedure, a Rhodobacter sphaeroides mutant lacking LH2 was subjected to lithium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which gave rise to a ladder of LH1 bands representing a series oligomers of the alpha/beta heterodimeric unit, varying in size from ( alpha/beta ) 2-3 to ( alpha/beta ) 10-11 . Moreover, these oligomers exhibited oligomeric-state dependent optical properties, characterized by red shifts in near-IR absorption and emission maxima of ~6 nm at 77 K, as the aggregate sizes increased from 3 to 7-8 alpha/beta- heterodimers, accompanied by shifts in highly polarized fluorescence from the blue to the red side of the absorption band. This has been explained by the oligomerization of heterodimers to form a curvilinear array of excitonically-coupled chromophores, with an anisotropic long-wavelength component corresponding to low energy excitonic transitions arising from interactions within inhomogeneous BChl clusters. In light of these findings, the authors can further justify why their method has been developed for the isolation of dimers and trimers of defined architecture in a controlled manner. But will much useful information come out of dimers and trimers when the full LH1 red shift required going up to an octameric state? The type of proposed energy migration studies planned for the isolated small arrays should be mentioned? Regarding Fig. 4, I don’t believe the source of these complexes has been designated. Fig.4A, is a second purification done to further purify these peaks? Fig. 4B, all three spectra need to be normalized at 590 nm to better show the composition of the cross-linked entities. The complex ratios can then be more precisely determined.

The latter are more easily recovered during sample processing and separation, and ionize and dissociate better during mass spectroscopy. Moreover, some membrane proteins are insoluble under enzyme digestion conditions and can also precipitate during the subsequent analysis steps. References 1.
