This study investigates the associations between joint effusion in the Knee and gene expression levels in the circulation. This is a well performed study that had led to the identification of 189 unique genes in blood with joint effusion in knee and few candidate biomarkers. Although the sample size was less and had cohort heterogeneity the authors have made a very systematic approach to identify genes and biological pathways involved in osteoarthritis.
