The article "Biomedical mutation Analysis (BMA): A software tool for analyzing mutations associated with antiviral resistance" describes a new online tool intended for detection of mutations in amino acids implicated in resistance to direct-acting antivirals. Despite the complexity and high degree of specifications reflected in the manuscript, especially in the material and methods section, the results section describes each step in a straightforward way that facilitates the implementation of this software. The usage of the language makes this article accessible even for non-experts in the field. The methodology has been validated using the nucleotide sequence of some gene from HCV genotype 1b, and a compilation of resistance mutations previously described in the literature for those genes. Minor changes: In Materials and Methods section, third paragraph, begins as " The database was design using the tool" and should say "The database was design ed using the tool". Sentence "For reliable calculations the sequences must contain a substantial part of the genes NS3, NS5A or NS5B" in the Results section results quite vague. How much is a substantial part? AAD, that appears in the first paragraph of the conclusions, should be replaced with DAA, for congruence with the rest of the text.
