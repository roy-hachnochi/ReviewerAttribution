This is an excellent text on gender bias in academia with a focus on Sweden but with a general perspective. The topic is highly important , especially since people in many countries believe Sweden is a gender equal country. As the author clearly demonstrates with facts and numbers, this is not true. The text is well written: it contains a historical perspective and the most famous studies demonstrating gender bias in academia are described. The solution that senior women must mentor younger women and help them believe in themselves and pursue careers in academia is very good. Nonetheless, I believe more must be done at Swedish universities to achieve a true change in a foreseeable future. All faculty and administrators need to be educated about gender bias, both conscious and unconscious, and every academic leader must strive for equal treatment in every situation and decision. See below where I outlined some actions to take around the same topic: http://www.stemwomen.net/is-the-gender-gap-solved-in-liberal-sweden/
