This manuscript brings a great amount of investigative work, aiming to provide further insight regarding activity data and promiscuity degrees to publication statistics. The work was well conducted and the data was presented in a way that is rather informative for the readers. Besides some grammar mishaps and a few points that need clarification, I recommend this work to be accepted for indexation once the following considerations are addressed. The relation between promiscuity, or activity data, and single publications is relevant and the conclusions states that well. I believe, however, that this work lacks mentioning the full impact of such discovery. Some discussion is presented, but certain aspects should be highlighted more. How does this new development fit with previous investigations? Why is this conclusion important for those working with activity data and promiscuity? p.2 When presenting data organization, why did the author decide to group compounds based on 1 and 5 targets? Any particular reason for setting multiple targets as 5, and not 4, 6, etc.? p.2 “a conservative of promiscuity”. I understand what do you mean by it, but it should be better phrased for clarity’s sake.
