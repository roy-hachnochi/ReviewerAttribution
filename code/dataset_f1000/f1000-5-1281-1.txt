Thank you for making the data easily available and re-running the workflow with the latest release version of Bioconductor, Jovanna. My minor comments on the initial submission have also been addressed to my satisfaction. Therefore, I happily approve the revised manuscript. I believe it will be a helpful resource to the Bioconductor community and those wishing to learn best practises for analysing DNA methylation array data. Minor comments I have on the revised manuscript: I got slightly different numbers and output when running the workflow (see below). I believe this is due to a bug being fixed in in v1.18.4 (see https://github.com/Bioconductor-mirror/minfi/commit/c16b28e2f4c7127696cbea807f668d0a10c54b37 ); I tested using minfi v1.18.6. These differences were first observable when running This affects all subsequent output such as which probes are identified as DMPs. Unfortunately, such changes in output are par for the course in bioinformatics software. These differences are outside the author's control, and I do not believe these affect the quality and usefulness of the workflow. I'm not sure anything can be done except to point out that such differences may exist due to different software versions. head(mVals[,1:5]) naive.1 rTreg.2 act_naive.3 naive.4 act_naive.5 cg13869341 2.205808 2.205808 2.167697 2.173122 2.106660 cg24669183 2.169414 2.235964 2.280734 1.632309 2.184435 cg15560884 1.761176 1.577578 1.597503 1.777486 1.764999 cg01014490 -2.918305 -2.979692 -4.042347 -3.448734 -3.189924 cg17505339 3.082191 3.924931 4.163206 3.255373 3.654134 cg11954957 1.546401 1.912204 1.727910 2.441267 1.618331 There is a typo (extra whitespace) in the BiocViews URL I was unable to get the Gviz plot to correctly render.
