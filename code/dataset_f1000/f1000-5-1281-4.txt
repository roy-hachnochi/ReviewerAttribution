This paper is a well-written workflow for analysing DNA methylation microarrays using Bioconductor packages. A challenge in writing these workflows is to produce something that is opinionated enough to be useful and balanced enough to be fair to packages developed by other people; I believe the authors have struck the right balance. However, my overall assessment is "Approved With Reservations" because the data used in the workflow is not easily available and therefore the workflow cannot be tested out by the interested reader. I spent some time trying to compile the raw data from GEO, but to me this feels a bit too much to expect of the reader, especially when it is likely that the interested reader is a beginner or intermediate user of bioinformatics software. I strongly believe the workflow should either include code to curate/construct/download the necessary files such as SampleSheet.csv and the IDAT files or include a link to prepared example data that can be used right from the 'Loading the data' section of the workflow. For example, http://f1000research.com/articles/4-1070/v1 uses data from the airway Bioconductor package that can easily be installed by the reader to follow along with the workflow. My other main suggestion would be to re-run the code using the recently published Bioconductor version 3.3. I expect this might require some minor changes to the code, e.g., the minfi::read.450k* functions have been deprecated in favour of minfi::read.metharray* functions. I have some additional minor comments and suggestions that I will include once I'm able to run through and review the workflow from beginning to end.
