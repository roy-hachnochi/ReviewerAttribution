This article describes a novel method for generating responses, opinions and perspectives from stakeholders in a given issue, using a digital engagement processes. The article represents a useful overview of this particular technique and represents a worthwhile contribution to what is an increasingly important area of research. This appraisal comes with the caveat that the article could be improved by addressing the following issues relating to the article content: Given that a forthcoming paper describing the ECOUTER process and authored by the same research group is explicitly referenced in the introduction, it would be helpful to have a clearer delineation of how the article in F1000Research is distinct from the forthcoming paper (i.e. what is the specific aim of this paper), or why two separate papers describing the ECOUTER process are warranted. The authors state that mind-mapping data generated through the ECOUTER process are analysed using ‘social science methods’. This description is unduly vague. As the ECOUTER process generates primarily textual data, it would seem that methods of textual analysis, whether qualitative (e.g. grounded theory-driven thematic analysis) or quantitative (e.g. content analysis) are the most relevant and most applicable subset of social sciences methods (with appropriate methodological additions if visual data is also collected). The concept of ‘mind mapping’ is employed but is not explained. It is not necessarily self-evident and should be explained in more depth or a suitable reference provided. Implementation online: As pointed out by other reviewers, email addresses can be used to identify individuals especially when combined with other data.
