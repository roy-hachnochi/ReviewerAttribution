This article represents a useful package to analyze ribosome profiling data. We found that several important features of the Ribosome Profiling data processing are well implemented in this Bioconductor Package. Actually, the Kmer sizes distribution, the P-site location, the features (CDS, 5UTR, 3UTR) coverage distribution and the codon coverage are important and significant to explain Ribosome Profiling data and this package generates a great summary of these. However this package is not as complete as suggested by the authors. Indeed an important point is the periodicity of footprints that is not addressed here. Moreover it could be interesting to add the ability to detect which reading phase is indeed read. This should be feasible since the P-site is well defined. I include below a few comments for the authors. The algorithm of the readStartCov function is not sufficiently described. The only one sentence found, does not give enough information to understand how it works. For instance, "the read frequency distribution centered on the translation start site": "Centered" needs more explanation. This is important, because using our own datasets we were not able to obtain any convincing results about the position of the P-site. The lack of information prevented us from understanding why. In the Package Manual, when the aroundPromoter function is defined, the TSS is described as the "Transcript Start Site", which does not match with the "Translational Start Site" found in the article. The pipeline requires an annotation file with a specific format (TxDb object). Users have to be aware of that if they want to use their own genome.
