This is an interesting report of the use of post-exposure prophylaxis following possible sexual exposure to HIV in a UK retrospective cohort. While it shows that British guidelines were generally followed well, it of course leaves open the question of what effect the prophylaxis had in terms of eventual HIV seroconversion. Another question raised is how many of those receiving PEP in this study may have also been appropriate candidates for PeEP given our current knowledge of the effectiveness of that prevention approach.
