The authors have examined the DNA sequences of 8 oesophageal adenocarcinoma cells lines and one high-grade dysplasia cell line, The authors should be congratulated for tackling this important unmet need in oesophageal cancer research and publishing these important findings in such an accessible manner. As the authors state, oesophageal adenocarcinoma seems to be one of the cancers carrying the most mutations, and although several cell lines, including those utilized in this study are commonly used for laboratory studies, there has never been a systemic study of the genetic abnormalities in these cells lines. The data in this study does fill that important gap, allowing comparisons between them and the cancer in vivo . The methods are appropriate for the study and well-described and the abstract accurately represents the contents of the study. The results are appropriately and clearly presented. The conclusions appear to be sound based on the data presented and most importantly the paper provides the data to enable other researchers to build on these data and hopefully further refine laboratory models for oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
