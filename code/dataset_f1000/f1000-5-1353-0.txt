This is an interesting short report that documents a significant fall in the number of hospitalisations for MS in Portugal following the release of higher potency disease modifying drugs. The observation is interesting and adds some support to the presumed greater efficacy of these therapies. Although causality cannot be determined from such an observational study. The finding that the age of admissions increased is also interesting as it may indicate that those with longer duration of disease (directly correlated with age) may have acquired more complications of MS for example urosepsis and have required greater admission rates. To directly answer the question significantly more detail and prospective acquisition of data is required. however this report does provide a strong background rationale to undertake these studies and to acquire this type of data which is invaluable in assessing the benefits or otherwise of expensive and potentially higher risk therapies in MS.
