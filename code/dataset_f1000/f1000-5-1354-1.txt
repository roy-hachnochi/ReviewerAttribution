Preliminary investigation of glyphosate resistance in giant ragweed using transcriptome analysis fromâ€™ Padmanabhan is a very preliminary work, and the differentially expressed genes found have to be further validated, genetically or/and functionally. No isogenic populations of sensitive and resistant glyphosate plants were used. Whereas the paper is well written and the data clearly presented, this work is a good start, but it is in a too early phase to be indexed. The article might be, from my point of view, re-focused, on the transcriptome assembly and annotation. This would be acceptable.
