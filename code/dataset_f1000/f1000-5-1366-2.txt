This article describes an overview of current kinase-related databases of significance, with particular focus on the contents of the Kinase Knowledgebase (KKB). The KKB has the largest repository of high-quality kinase activity data. Providing access to over million data points on several of the most important kinases allows for an exciting insight into the relevance of these validated drug targets and the diversity of compounds affecting them. It is a promising trend that private companies are unlocking their proprietary data troves for the advancement of academic research. This is a nice Data Note that merits indexing in F1000Research. A few minor typographical corrections: Table 2: Three of the column names seem to be duplicated. Table 2: It is unclear what the grey vs white rows represent in ‘Kinase Classification’ and ‘Family’ columns. If only for readability, perhaps these should alternate. Section ‘Kinase inhibitor datasets’ at the end of the first paragraph: The word ‘respectively’ is not needed. Section ‘Kinase inhibitor datasets’ 4 th paragraph, ‘~54K inhibitors molecules’: ‘inhibitors’ does not need to be plural. Figures 1 2:I would use the word ‘Breakdown’ instead of ‘Breakup’. Figure 2: Are ‘Cell-Free’ and ‘Animal Model’ truly zero percent? If so, they should be excluded; if not, the fractional percent should be listed. ‘Conclusions’: ‘datanote’ should be two words, to be consistent with the F1000 article type.
