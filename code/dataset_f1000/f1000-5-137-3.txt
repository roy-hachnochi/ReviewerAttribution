This study tests the previously published assertion that reducing the activity of USP14, a proteasome-associated deubiqtuitylase, results in decreased levels of neurotoxic proteins such as TDP43 and Tau. The bottom line of the study is that manipulation of USP14 level and activity in a cell model system has no discernable effect of the levels of these proteins, contrary to expectations based on a previously published 2010 study 1 . While this is obviously a model system with unknown relevance to bona fide neurons in vivo , the experiments appear to be well done and the data support the conclusions. The authors are careful to point out that there are minor differences between some of their protocols and those used in the 2010 study and call for increased communication and collaboration between interested laboratories to determine if USP14 is truly a good drug target for neurodegenerative diseases. This is entirely appropriate. References 1. Lee BH, Lee MJ, Park S, Oh DC, et al.: Enhancement of proteasome activity by a small-molecule inhibitor of USP14.

Continue reading Since posting my review of this F1000Research article, a colleague made me aware of two manuscripts that are highly relevant to this topic, but were not cited by Ortuno et al. They are: Homma T, Ishibashi D, Nakagaki T, et al. : Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 modulates degradation of cellular prion protein . Sci Rep . 2015; 5 :11028. McKinnon C, Goold R, Andre R , et al .: Prion-mediated neurodegeneration is associated with early impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system . Acta Neuropathol . 2016; 131 (3): 411-425. Both of these papers report that levels of prion proteins in neurons are strongly influenced by USP14 activity. Thus, while the experiments conducted by Ortuno et al . reported in this communication do not seem to indicate that manipulation of USP14 has a major effect on TDP-43 and α-synuclein levels under their conditions, the major findings of the 2010 Nature paper by Lee et al. are strongly supported by these two studies. Thus, these papers should have been cited by Ortuno et al . in their F1000Research article. I apologize for not being aware of these two studies when I reviewed this work.
