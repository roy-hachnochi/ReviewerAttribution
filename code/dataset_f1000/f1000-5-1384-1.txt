The second version of this article is much improved from the first. The explanations are simplified, and much of what I considered to be extraneous has been removed. I only have a few minor points that could be addressed. It's not necessary (ever) to use install.packages() or the remotes package directly, for any Bioconductor package or really any package. Installing the maEndToEnd package can be accomplished by simply using biocLite("b-klaus/maEndToEnd") There is some complexity here, as you may need to install some of the dependencies for the maEndToEnd package, but that is a consequence of getting the package from GitHub rather than a failing of biocLite(). End users will have to install the dependencies regardless, so something like deps - strsplit(packageDescription("maEndToEnd")$Depends,",\\n")[[1]][-1] deps - deps[!deps %in% row.names(installed.packages())] biocLite(deps) would do the trick. Making the RLE plot could be simplified by using oligo::basicPLM rather than oligo::rma RLE(basicPLM(raw_data, normalize = FALSE)) While it is true that RMA summarization for Exon ST arrays can be carried out at the 'full' or 'extended' level, that is not true for Gene ST arrays, which can only be summarized at the 'core' and 'probeset' level, so I would remove that from the section titled 'RMA calibration of the data' . Under the linear models section, the resource you call 'genomics class' is actually the Biomedical Data Science course and is authored by Mike Love and Rafael Irizarry (not Michael Irizzary).
