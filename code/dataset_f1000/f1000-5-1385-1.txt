This manuscript describes an important approach to transcriptomics that could be important for future research. It is remarkable that modern technology can give mRNA profiles based on microgram of mRNA. The SOP is important, but some parts of it confuse me. First of all, this company is related to Tempus. Can the method be extended to other products? This is important since PAX is as much used as Tempus. Secondly, I am a bit surprised that -20 degrees is the primary choice versus -70 degrees since all medical biobanks use -70 degrees. The explanation of plastic that is brittle does not sound convincing for future use of the technology. Third, how long is the optimal mixing time before freezing? You state 20 seconds in the illustration while you also write that it can be stored for 24 hours at normal temperatures. The technology is very interesting. Since there are no comparisons of outcomes for different procedures nor any quality measures of mRNA it may look more like a recipe.
