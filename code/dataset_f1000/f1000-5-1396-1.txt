This article contains a thorough description of a new search tool, search.bioPreprint, that can be used to search multiple preprint archives using keywords. In light of the existence of multiple preprint servers that can be used to post preprints in the biological sciences, the development of a tool that enables full-text searching of all current preprint archives (arXiv, bioRxiv, F1000Research, PeerJ Preprints) is a welcome one. The search capabilities of search.bioPreprint and the bookmarklet app are well-described. Looking ahead, the authors will hopefully consider further improvements to the search site. Better documentation on the search site itself explaining how results are returned and ranked would be helpful. This reviewer quickly learned that the search returns approximate word match results, not just exact matches; this should be clarified on the web site. Moreover, approximate matches sometimes appear be ranked more highly than exact matches; the reason for this should be examined and remedied, if possible. It would also be helpful to have options to rank results in other ways, in particular, by date.
