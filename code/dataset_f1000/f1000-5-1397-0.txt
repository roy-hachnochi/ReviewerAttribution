This is a retrospective study that was carried out in a hospital in China, involving 4610 participants. In summary, this study investigated the association between the DM, IGT and IFG and liver cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer and benign tumors. The study shows the high prevalence of DM and IGT in liver cancer. My suggestion if possible, is to include tobacco consumption or exposure to secondhand smoke into this study. Because there is a high prevalence of smoking and also high exposure to secondhand smoke in China 1-3 , there could be evidence to show its association between DM and liver cancer 4-7 . References 1.
