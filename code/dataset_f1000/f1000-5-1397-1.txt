The article entitled “High prevalence of diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance in liver cancer patients: A hospital based study of 4610 patients with benign tumors or specific cancers” is very meaningful on providing evidence for government to prevent liver cancer in China. They found that the prevalence of DM and IGT in liver cancers patients was significantly higher than in benign tumors. Overall, I appreciate the study. The following is some comments and suggestions on the study topic. Some studies 1 - 3 showed that DM is an independent risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma, but some other studies 4 , 5 provided an inconsistent conclusion: only among people who were infected with both HBV and HCV or alcoholic hepatitis can this increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, a systematic review 6 pointed out that among 23 case control or follow up studies, only less than 40% of studies indicated that DM is an independent risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma, and also few studies can exclude the influence of food habits and obesity etc. The reason for this inconsistency is not clear, and needs further study. DM possibly is not an independent risk factor on hepatocellular carcinoma, but among people who were hepatitis virus infected or alcoholic with DM will increase the probability getting hepatocellular carcinoma. According to the above, I suggest that, if available, please add the information about some habits such as alcoholic beverage drinking history, some indices including BMI for example to exclude the influence of such factors which are both related to DM and hepatocellular carcinoma, and the status of virus hepatitis in the analysis. Moreover, a retrospective study cannot provide the causal relationship between DM and hepatocellular carcinoma, if we want to know the relationship clearly, a population based case control and prospective cohort study are needed.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This is a retrospective study that was carried out in a hospital in China, involving 4610 participants. In summary, this study investigated the association between the DM, IGT and IFG and liver cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer and benign tumors. The study shows the high prevalence of DM and IGT in liver cancer. My suggestion if possible, is to include tobacco consumption or exposure to secondhand smoke into this study. Because there is a high prevalence of smoking and also high exposure to secondhand smoke in China 1-3 , there could be evidence to show its association between DM and liver cancer 4-7 . References 1.
