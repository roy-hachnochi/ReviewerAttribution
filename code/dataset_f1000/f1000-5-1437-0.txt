The article is a well-written report on work concerning the use of the Cameca NanoSims50 instrument for imaging of DNA fibers immobilized on silicon substrates. The work is a follow-up of earlier papers on the same subject by the present consortium. It contains work that is original and of interest for the scientific community. It shows the value of potential applications of Combing-Imaging with SIMS (CIS) and leads the way to further work with this ultra-sensitive chemical imaging tool. I fully support its indexations.
