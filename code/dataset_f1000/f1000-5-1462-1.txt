This is an interesting case, but I am not sure that at the present time, we have enough data; if the authors can let us know the followings, it will be all right: Why Campylobacter jejuni or any other infection was not looked for, as the diarrhea was present prior to the onset of the neurological symptoms? Were anti-glycolipid antibodies were tested? In a significant number of acute dysimmune neuropathies, they are considered as useful biomarkers if they are present. If AMSAN was discussed, why did the patient did not receive at the beginning, any treatment such as immunoglobulins or plasma exchanges? I am surprised that after 10 days of evolution, when the motor testing was only 4+, a bilateral atrophy of hands was observed. Actually, the first AMSAN cases have been reported by Feasby et al. (1986). References 1. Feasby TE, Gilbert JJ, Brown WF, Bolton CF, et al.: An acute axonal form of Guillain-Barré polyneuropathy. Brain . 1986; 109 ( Pt 6) : 1115-26 PubMed Abstract Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Interesting case of an "axonal GBS" syndrome occurring shortly after epidural anesthesia, in a patient with a number of health problems. I assume that the patient could also have developed a nutritional axonal polyneuropathy due to her poor health condition. The authors claim that light chain amyloidosis was excluded after negative Congo red staining. Which tissue was studied ? Amyloid neuropathy unlikely because of the rate of onset, and stability of deficit afterwards. Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed. I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above. reply Respond to this report Responses (0)
