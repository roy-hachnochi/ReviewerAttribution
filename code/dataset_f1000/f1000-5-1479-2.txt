This article by Krueger F et al . describes in detail a new software SNPsplit which is capable of sorting reads or read–pairs in the allele specific modus that covers know single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP), or single nucleotide variation (SNV) locations. For sorting the reads the inputs to the software are a ‘N’ masked genome, created using known SNP or SNV locations, to which the reads are aligned using any available aligner and a VCF file containing the positions of all SNPs. The authors claim that this is the only user-friendly solution available for the allele-specific splitting of sequencing reads aligned to N-masked genomes. Overall the manuscript is very well written. However, I have some minor queries regarding the software performance: Masking known SNP positions in the genome sequence eliminated the reference bias but, in case of heterozygous SNPs there could be a chance of having significant bias toward higher mapping rates of the allele in the reference sequence, is there any provision in the software to remove this noise and bias from mapped reads? This kind of bias can lead to false signal of allelic imbalance. It is stated that the software can construct the N-masked genomes, so is it restricted to mouse alone or can be extended in case of humans or other species? Can SNPsplit be used to split reads for indels and deletions? I have personally used the software for ATAC-seq data from patients and it works perfectly fine. I have not used the genome builder module of the software. The data looks perfect in the UCSC genome browser for the ‘Allele 1’ or ‘Allele 2’ and the unassigned. Overall I felt it is a very user friendly software available.
