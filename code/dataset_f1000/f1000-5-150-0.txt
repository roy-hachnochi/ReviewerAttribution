The authors highlight the urgency and advocate for a collaborative approach to Zika virus drug discovery and development. Advocacy for emerging diseases is always a worthy pursuit and the open drug discovery model suggested by the authors to tackle Zika virus warrants further discussion. The authors go on to outline possible drug discovery strategies, with an emphasis on repurposing FDA or EU approved drugs as a faster path to approval of Zika virus therapeutics. Although this is an attractive approach in theory and should be pursued, it is more likely that lead molecules would be identified from this effort rather than effective Zika therapeutics ready for approval. In this short article format, it is difficult for the authors to adequately cover the different drug discovery approaches they recommend. For example, identifying targets and mechanisms for inhibitors identified from a whole cell screen can be complicated and the authors do not discuss the key challenges typically encountered with such a screening campaign. In addition, one very important aspect that is missing from the discussion is drug safety, particularly given that pregnant women in Zika endemic areas represent the population with the highest unmet medical need. The authors should address the hurdles associated with developing drugs with the requisite safety profile for this vulnerable population.
