Be more precious, here. "The idea behind such an ensemble approach to network inference is to exploit the fact that different methods make different mistakes." These are different statistical inferences so based on the underlaying algorithms results will be different. Same may be better suited for parametric or none-parametric data, some perform better with larger or smaller sample numbers. The different methods have also different statistical power do identify significances. Some may produce more false positives or false negatives than others. Some guidance and references to statistical literature could be provided in the article. I really liked to see an implementation that calculates false discovery rate (after Benjamin Hochberg) over all statistical comparisons.
