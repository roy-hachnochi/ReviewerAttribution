The author has attempted to address a problem that has hindered the ability to compare research and treatment outcomes for keloids. Besides a universally agreed upon marker for keloids, a staging system is paramount to successfully compare studies on keloid pathogenesis and treatment outcomes. There are some limitations to this article that should be addressed prior to publication. Placing Caucasian and Asian patients into one group, although it may have been necessary in this study due to small ample size, is not optimum because of differences in risks for keloid development and treatment. The grouping of keloids into massive, very large, large, and minimal neck keloids seems arbitrary and the clinical significance is unknown. I agree that the conclusion that surgery for neck keloids should not be the first choice, especially for large keloids. However, information on the size of the keloids prior to the initial surgical excision is lacking and would add more validity. For example, if the keloid was 3 cm prior to initial excision and 6 cm afterwards compared to 6 cm prior to surgery and 6 cm afterwards. Furthermore, information on outcomes for non-surgical treatment options is needed. Staging systems are intended to guide treatment and to predict outcomes. As presented the staging system does not satisfy either purpose. The staging system is only descriptive and its clinical implications are unknown. Larger number are needed to validate or refute the proposed staging system.
