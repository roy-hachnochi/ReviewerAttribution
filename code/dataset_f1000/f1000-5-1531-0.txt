The manuscript describes a tool for robust de novo pathway enrichment. The software provides the great advantage to study effects of network perturbations thereby allow for the evaluation of quality and robustness of the results in de novo pathway enrichment. Thus, the authors address a relevant issue in network construction and pathway enrichment. The rationale for the development of the tool is clearly stated. A use case to demonstrate the usability of KeyPathwayMiner 5 with varying parameters is described within the manuscript. The source code of KeyPathwayMiner 5 is available at github.com. MINOR COMMENTS: The introduced tool KeyPathwayMiner 5 is a further development of KeyPathwayMiner x. A short overview of added features to all updated versions may be helpful for users to get an overview of the full function of KeyPathwayMiner 5. (provide in supplement) Several parameters must be set to run KeyPathwayMiner. Could an approximate recommendation for parameter values and settings be given for non-expert users? The calculation of the Jaccard index is given in detail, however a short explanation of the graduation (high, moderate, low) of calculated values could be helpful to provide easy interpretation of results for all users.
