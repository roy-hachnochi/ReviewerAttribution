I have read the revised article. The authors have expanded the manuscript from the comments previously raised and have proposed a new version indeed more focused on the issues that they wish to address. However, I must say that, overall, I hardly find the spark of novelty that should lead the reader to take action based on what is presented. Personally, as interested reader and (ideally) a potential funder, I would have liked to better understand what have made successful the UK-example described ( e.g. impact evaluation, audience deliverables) so to better frame the examples within the long-term/objective driven funding discussion (which is, in the end, the main objective of the current submission). Also, on a different but related note, reducing the description of the barriers to (i) stakeholders commitment and (ii) funds availability lacks to address some other quite important barriers that would have worth to be mentioned ( e.g. government/political agenda, academic curricula, peers support etc.). This could have been expanded as well for the sake of discussion. Given my hesitation concerning the above-mentioned issues, I am accepting the manuscript with reservation (and with apologies for the delay). This, to my understanding of the F1000 reviewing process, will make the article ready to be indexed.
