I have now read the revised article. The revision is a significant improvement on the first version, in that the authors provide specific examples of science communication initiatives and have better organized the text. The main message, if I understand it correctly, is that policy makers and science funders need to provide resources and the right incentives to support a strong culture of science communication. While true, I don't know that this idea is particularly novel -- and with funding agencies' budgets so constrained now, it's not clear to me whether they'll be sold on creating a special science communication fund. The authors list several challenges of science communication related to resources and incentives, but don't really talk about the challenges inherent to science communication that would remain if such resources/incentives were available. I think this area might be a fruitful one to explore. For example: Who is our audience, and how do we know when we've reached them? (Can you talk about challenges in measuring this, and propose ideas?) What do we want them to *do* with the information being communicated? (Your article talks about "objective-driven" communication, but nowhere is it specified what the objectives or outcomes are!) How do we measure whether the audience has received the message and done what we intended (e.g., was the objective accomplished)? These are the central questions to me, and the really critical ones for any science communicator to clarify before embarking on a science communication project. Although I did not find the piece to make novel points, I did find the article much improved on the first version, and because tomorrow is Christmas I am marking it approved.
