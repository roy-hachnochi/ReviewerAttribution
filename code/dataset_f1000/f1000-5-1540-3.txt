The opinions shared in this piece were undercited, vague, and not novel. Title and abstract: The authors should consider a title that describes the take-home message of the article. They should also decide on one way of capitalizing the title (all or nothing). Article content: The organization of this paper was not clear, and it also wasnâ€™t clear what this opinion piece was intended to do. Was this written towards funding organizations, individual scientists? What are the actionable items that might allow for a funding organization to test out some of these ideas? A conceptual model or figure would have greatly helped clarify this. Conclusions: The authors might get more traction by developing a more concrete conceptual model with testable hypotheses. This would also help them fund the work to show if their ideas would lead to improved science literacy among the general public.
