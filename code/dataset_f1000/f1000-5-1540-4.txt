This opinion article seeks to describe standards, barriers and possible initiatives that may be relevant for the development of science communication in the UK. Even if opinions concerning a certain topic (in this case science communication) may be very wide and call into consideration several aspects of the subject, I find that the manuscript lacks a clear focus, which, in turn, makes the flow of the text very hard to follow. In particular, in the initial part of the manuscript, authors state that they “will discuss the current practice of science communication in the UK”. However, despite a very general description of the relevance of science communication practice for (i) policy making; (ii) education; (iii) scientific networking and (iv) professional development, there is a substantial lack of any description of experience, best practice, event or initiative that may have taken place in the UK. Again, when describing the several barriers that hamper a proper diffusion and development of science communication, the observations are rather general, superficial and seemingly not focused on the UK scenario (at least this is the perception I have as non-UK reader). Consequently, the suggestions on how to overcome such barriers are extremely hard to be contextualized within and they seem to me rather focused on funding agencies and their policies rather than on the good practice/development of science communication. In light of that, despite the good will that authors put in place for the cause of science communication, I regret to say that I cannot recommend this opinion article to be indexed as it is.
