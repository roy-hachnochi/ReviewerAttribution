This is an interesting review paper summarising the current knowledge about the role of the circadian clock in skeletal muscle development and function. I have few comments which might help to improve the paper: Intro: last two sentences are difficult to understand. "As locomotor activity..." this is not a complete sentence / "It is therefore possible..." - consider shortening. Is your main point to say that there is still a lot to do? Chapter "The tissue-intrinsic circadian clock in skeletal muscle" - Daily oscillations are not GOVERNED by outside rhythms; consider ENTRAINED - Peripheral clocks are not DRIVEN by the SCN; consider COORDINATED/RESET. Carefully check spelling of genes and proteins, in particular capitalisations Consider discussing the role of metabolic feedback on SM clock regulation and function.
