Abstract Given the clock as IS an evolutionarily-conserved time-keeping mechanism that synchronizes internal physiology to environmental cues, locomotor activities initiated by skeletal muscle enable entrainment to the light-dark cycles on earth, thus ensuring organismal survival and fitness. The statement locomotor activities initiated by skeletal muscle is a tenuous statement. Locomotor activities are most likely secondary to central clock function, as was shown in the McDearmon article which showed that muscle specific rescue did not restore locomotor rhythm. Introduction As locomotor activity, the essential function of skeletal muscle in all animal species is under direct circadian clock control through sleep-wake cycles, and the intimate interplay between clock and skeletal muscle physiology is evolutionarily-conserved to ensure fitness and survival. Run on sentence The tissue-intrinsic circadian clock in skeletal muscle This hierarchal machinery is composed of a central pacemaker in the brain’s SCN and peripheral clocks in nearly every tissue and cell types, driven by the central clock pacemaker under normal physiological conditions. (repetitive as mentioned in first paragraph) ……the brain’s SCN and peripheral clocks in nearly every tissue and cell types cell type repetition of ‘intricate’ Accumulating evidence indicates an intimate interplay between circadian clock machinery and metabolic regulations, either at the level of temporal control evident in many key metabolic processes in distinct metabolic tissues, or in the maintenance of whole-body metabolic homeostasis Overuse of ‘metabolic’ and metabolic regulations should be regulation Clock modulation of muscle growth, repair and mass maintenance as early as in 8-weeks old mice 8 week prolong survival of Bmal1-null animals, whereas brain-specific rescue was not sufficient brain rescue improved survival to 75% in the length of the experiment, saying not sufficient overstated. Despite discussion of implications to skeletal muscle disorders, specific links to which skeletal muscle diseases may be implicated are lacking.
