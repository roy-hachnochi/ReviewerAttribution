The work of Luo Y. describes an identification of the biosynthetic intermediates of the lipoteichoic acid utilizing mass spectrometrical approach. Generally, the conclusions are based on the solid raw data, the title is appropriate, and the abstract provides subsequent summary of the article. I have a few comments, which addressing can help to improve the manuscript: In the abstract and introduction given description of LTA refers mainly to Type 1 of LTA. I would specify it, and in the introduction mention other types of LTA, that are structurally different (reviewed: Schneewind O., Missiakas D. J. Bacteriol. 2014, 196(6):1133.) D-Alanylation of LTA 1 and 4 is indeed very common, for the reader of the paper would it be also of interest, to mention other LTA modifications. The use of the sentence with the characterization of D- but not L-Alanine, is confusing, as to date all bacterial Ala is D-configured. Fig. 1 - I suggest to draw sugars in chair conformation, and the double bonds of P- or COO- groups should be equally thick. The given formula of glycerol is wrong - no double bond is present, better to use standard abreviation Gro, e.g. Gro-Glc-Glc (concerns also Table 1). Phosphate groups are commonly abbreviated as P, not Pho. Table 1 - I would write LTA primer, not only LTA, otherwise confusing. Page 4 . when describing peaks at 887 and 915 instead of using 30:0 and 32:0, please use 15:0+15:0, and 15:0+17:0, otherwise confusing. Peak at 887 corresponds to 2x Hex, Gro, 2x15:0, Na, so corresponds to sodiated (but not dehydrated - this word should be removed) linker (Figure 2A). The confusion with dehydrated or not was present a few times in the text (e.g. 753 amu represents loss of glucose and not dehydrated glucose). On page 4 - the QTRAP spectra are shown in Fig 3 - Fig 4, not as in text Fig 2 - Fig 4
