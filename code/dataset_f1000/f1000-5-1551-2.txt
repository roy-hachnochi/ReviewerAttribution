The title suitably addresses the content of the article; in the Abstract, after the second last line, a comment should be made regarding the 52% who were screened by the test but did not receive the targeted drugs. The content of the article in general is of a high standard, it could be improved to the casual and inexpert reader by clarifying where KIT, KRAS and NRAS fit within the overall picture as BRAF deals with MM, EGFR with NSCLC and RAS with mCRC; and of the 6 exclusions the number in each cohort (targeted versus no targeted) could be stated. Finally, Figure 2 is unclear and a disconnect between the figure (BRAF, EGFR, RAS positive, negative) and the legend (â€¦received or did not receive targeted pharmacotherapy), to include actual numbers and not just percentages would also make it clearer. The conclusions are most appropriate and it succinctly highlights the complex interplay between testing, prescribing, guidelines, evidence and funding all of which are rapidly changing but are not connected, all of which have universal implications.
