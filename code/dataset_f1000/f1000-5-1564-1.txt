The authors well described an unusual case of AHS in CVD. However, I think that the following major comments would help to improve the impact of the manuscript: The authors should clearly explain what they mean by stabilized. Are the AHS symptoms improved or do they mean the stabilization of neurovascular symptomatology only? Acute CT findings including the CT figure showing the acute cerebrovascular pathology should be added. They should describe the frequency of similar combined cerebrovascular cases in the literature. What about the therapeutic effects of Clonazepam in the literature? This also should be added in the manuscript. It is not clear how a left acute superior frontal pathology can lead to dysfunction of the right association cortex that secondary leads to a dysregulation of communication with the left side (Conclusion section). I think they should clearly define the hypothesized pathophysiology and include an illustration defining the disturbed communication and functional interaction in details.
