The authors present a method to detect centromeres position in fluorescence images. The proposed method is an extension of their previous work where they segmented the chromosomes and detected the telomeres position. Based on the detected contour of the chromosome they extract salient points, and using am learning approach, try to infer the best position for the centromeres. The methodology is described in details, but it is a bit difficult to follow the different steps, since there is no figures to illustrate the process. The simplified model of figure 1 should be extended with anchor points, telomeres, centromeres, so the different terms are clear for the reader. One main point, however, is the usefulness of using machine learning, since the authors have first a set of 6 points, with 11 features each, and they want to determine the combination of the 6 points that describe best the chromosome. Since there are only 12 possible combinations, why not simply test them all and minimize some cost function ? The number of features used is also reduced, did the authors check the importance of each feature, using classical approaches like PCA ? For the results, the authors should compare their new algorithm with other algorithms, or at least their own algorithm from previous work, to better emphasize the interest of this new method. Finally some minor comments : The Giemsa staining should be referenced. Figure 5 is not useful. Typo euclidian.
