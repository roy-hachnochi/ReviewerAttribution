Thank you very much for the opportunity to review the manuscript by De Fauw and co-workers. The topic is of great interest. Moorefields recently announced their research partnership with DeepMind Health. In this manuscript the project plan is detailed. One million examinations (digital fundus photographs and OCT scans) which met the inclusion criteria will be analysed using machine learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques. The authors did not specify why they did not include angiography as an additional imaging modality which is usually used at baseline or at follow-up exams in patients with AMD and diabetic retinopathy. Please add this information. Since data security is an important issue to be discussed especially when evaluating such large data sets the authors need to provide more information regarding patient consent. Does everyone who is examined at Moorefields Eye Hospital give a general consent for evaluating their data? Patients are not specifically informed about the project with DeepMind Health, aren't they? So data of patients are only excluded if patients previously (independent of this project) requested that there data should not be shared. Although there might be some risk regarding "data security" it outweighs the potential of earlier detection and treatment of million of patients.
