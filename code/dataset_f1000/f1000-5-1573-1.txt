There is a good introduction of the two main conditions, AMD and DR and their burden on public health. Very little information on machine learning to convince the reader that the fundamental processes and pieces of the jigsaw are already available to apply to AMD and DR or in simpler healthcare scenarios. How does MEH plan to locate the ID of those who have given instructions for their images NOT to be used? Is there a database for this specific parameter? Good attention to data security and data protection. Not very much information on specific data outcomes expectations. Eg how detailed will be grading be of a wet AMD lesion. Overall, a novel concept and worth exploring as it will be able to replace human workforce if successful.
