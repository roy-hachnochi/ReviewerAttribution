The authors provide an open source RNA-seq processing pipeline that can be used to extract differential expression data between two conditions from an RNA-seq experiment. To test this, data from a recent publication where human iPSCs were differentiated to neuronal progenitors and then infected with Zika virus (ZIKV), were analysed with their pipeline, and their results were consistent with the original ones. Of interest, the authors discovered a link between the upregulated genes of this study and genes that, when knocked out could cause microcephaly observed in newborns of mothers infected with ZIKV. Overall, this is a novel and exciting computational protocol that promotes reproducibility and transparency of the results, and it is definately worth to be tested in other conditions, as well (eg, cancer). Minor comment: Perhaps its a matter of zoom-in/out of the clustergrammer, but it would be nice to show the names of the top up-/down-regulated genes (or their categories) as depicted in Figure 2.
