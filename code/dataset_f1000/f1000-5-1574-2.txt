Wang and Maâ€™ayan introduced an RNA-seq pipeline tutorial using IPython notebook and a Docker image. Specifically, the authors applied the pipeline to analyze data from a recent Zika virus study. The authors found that their pipeline not only confirms the down-regulated cell cycle genes, but also uncovers a set of genes with a biological function that potentially associated with a particular phenotype. While the work and context sound interesting, there are several concerns that need to be addressed or discussed: This reviewer really liked the approach that the authors have taken to showcase analysis. I wish more researchers adopt this methodology. This could be a great way to do additional analysis easily.. I wonder if authors can look into additional RNASeq pipelines and compare/contrast how Jupiter-friendly they are. Minor comments: The clustering (in Figure 1) is based on z-score and the 800 genes serve well to cluster the samples into two different groups. Was z-scores close to zero excluded as they are uninformative? Was FDR applied?
