This is a policy-relevant article to study hospital and patient factors influencing T2DM treatment in Mongolia. The rapid increasing of T2DM gives a pressure to the health system in Inner Mongolia. The authors are interested in exploring health care disparities by conducting a cross-section hospital survey in 6 hospitals in 3 regions. I would approve the article. However, there may be minor revisions if the authors accept the following comments. In the limitation section, it would be better to explain if there any recall bias when using data from patient interview? If so, please state in limitation part. Give a few words to demonstrate “a series of policies was generalized and experimented by the hospitals” at the current health reform.
