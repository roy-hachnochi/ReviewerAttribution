The paper briefly sets out on page 3 the nature of equity issues in hospital health care and the problems of measuring health care disparities, especially from the clinical side. Using a transitional and developing region of China, Inner Mongolia, the paper focuses on the widely accepted practice of measuring disparities from the population side (socio-economic characteristics) factors. Importantly, the paper also focuses on different types of hospital and also measures clinical treatment differences for diabetes (T2DM) treatments. The choice of disease, T2DM, is justified as the research focus. The authors should be commended for their access to treatment records. On page 3, the authors might add a couple of sentences on tertiary versus county hospitals, especially given the differences in bed-size. Also, the choice of hospital depended on the quality of the records, and a sentence on differences (if any) in tertiary versus county hospital records would be useful. In terms of the explanatory variables (page 3), the authors might briefly define insurance scheme, hospital reform status and diagnosis in this section (although these are (partly) covered in the section on ‘Data collection and measurement’). On page 8, the argument should make clear that type of insurance and ‘no insurance’ did not have an impact on treatment. The discussion contrasts the Inner Mongolia case of no differences in treat by insurance/’no insurance’ with other countries, but does not emphasize that there are no differences in the Inner Mongolia data between insurance/'no-insurance'. This requires only one sentence.
