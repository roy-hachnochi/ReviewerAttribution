Those involved in thinking about the scientific and societal impact of research will know that the complexities in data sharing, citation and reuse practices often hinder us from developing a quantitative understanding of the value of data. This has implications for how data are treated as an important output of research across a wide variety of fields, including in institutional and funder assessment frameworks. The line of inquiry taken in this study to separate original citation from later reuse provides us with a one very promising way forward for how we might start to address some of these complexities. In this way, the study makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of how the impact of scientific data may usefully be quantified and tracked in future. In addition, the study shows us the importance of open and carefully-maintained data infrastructure -- not just for data but also for scientific literature and patents - if we are to understand the important role that data plays in a modern, knowledge-based economy. The importance of high quality data sources is clear; the scope for others to extend this methodology to other disciplines and fields may depend on similar high quality sources and infrastructure being in place. If further work is needed to improve the data infrastructure then this study in part provides a good rationale for this. This is a very well-designed study with a clear methodology. The paper is very well-written and the discussion section in particular provides a valuable and thought-provoking contribution to the debates.
