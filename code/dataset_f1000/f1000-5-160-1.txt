This article is an important look at citation patterns and frequencies of some important and representative bioinformatics data resources (ENA, ePDB) in the professional and patent literature, based on textmining for accesssion numbers in the Euro PubMed Central Open Access corpus, and patent documents in SureChEMBL. The authors provide resources to reproduce their results using RESTFUL APIs at EMBL. As might be expected of resource providers interested to know how the services they provide are taken up - the authors deal exclusively with “citation for reuse”. By this is meant citation of database entry accession numbers to indicate they were used as a source of further analyses, rather than to mark them as an original primary data deposition. Analysis of citations for reuse documents the value of archived data for use beyond the study that produced it. The methodology is well described. Authors note that “citation analysis is a cornerstone of research impact and evaluation”. Their analysis demonstrates distinct usage patterns for deposition and reuse in ENA and ePDB and for patents vs. articles as citing documents. By quantifying the extent of reuse of data from EMBL bimolecular resources the authors demonstrate the importance in biomedical research of such resources . This is a well written paper with a carefully designed methodology which quantifies the role of key EMBL data rescues in the biomedical and bio-industrial community.
