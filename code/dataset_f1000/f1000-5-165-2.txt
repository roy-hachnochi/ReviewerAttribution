This article describes a novel structural analysis of microbial photoreceptors by scoring intramolecular distances derived from their high resolution crystal structures. This work could potentially provide the structural foundation to explain the diverse photoreceptor phenotypes, including identifying the structural factors governing their colour tuning, which is still an unresolved problem.
