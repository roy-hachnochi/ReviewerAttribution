The case study by Vlad et al. is a significant example how quality initiatives are nested within the public health system of Kerala – a “health iconic” State of South India. The representativeness of this case study for other States in India (particularly those with weak health systems and poor socio-economic indices) is possibly quite weak and needs to have a cautionary mention in the discussion. The uniqueness of the components of the Kerala initiative need to be highlighted. In my opinion these would comprise of (a) the significant and dedicated contribution of private participants and the KFOG in persistently facilitating the quality initiatives yet placing it in the hands of the public health sector (b) the wise buy in of the Government of Kerala of international evidence based initiatives and for forging a symbiotic relationship with the private sector (e) facilitation of completion of approach through implementation processes such as definition of quality benchmarks and facility level training. It is hoped that the pioneering efforts of Kerala find wide resonance in other parts of India
