I would like to thank the authors for their explanations and revisions of the paper: Applying a complex adaptive system's understanding of health to primary care. It is very clear, provides much food for thought in thinking about health and disease in people as complex adaptive systems. The paper provides a framework for considering the variability in how patients adapt to various conditions. It also centers the responses on the patient and their “Healing is much rather the result of a process of self-reorganization, enabling the two potentials to again satisfactorily fulfil the demands of life.” And helps the physician to know that compassion, humanism, creativity and willingness to stand by are legitimate roles.
