Thank you for this concise description of the adult presentation of ALCAPA and offer of an alternate surgical procedure for restoration of coronary blood flow from aorta to LCA. This presents another surgical option for the armamentarium. While you make biologically plausible suggestions as to why this procedure may prove superior, the actual superiority cannot yet be known as only the passage of time and experience with the technique will determine that. This should be more explicitly stated, so as not to be misleading. In that bent, I might revise the final sentence to: "...permitting a physiological blood flow to the left ventricle is viable and may prove to diminish the risk of pulmonary stenosis post repair of ALCAPA compared with other techniques." As a non-surgeon, and a pediatrician, I cannot comment on the likelihood of improved coronary patency personally. Also, it might be helpful for the reader to know the degree of residual mitral regurgitation at the six month follow up, and if you intervened on the valve during the surgical repair (I do not believe you did from my review of this case presentation), and whether this patient's presenting symptoms had abated at the time of 6 month follow up. My additional minor suggestions are: the sentence: ...the paraclinical diagnostic methods showed anomalous emergency of left main coronary artery.... should read: "emergence of the left main coronary artery" I would consider an alternate term for the use of "duct". This initially seemed like it was referring to a ductus arteriosus before I rapidly realized this was referring to the "tube graft" you had created.
