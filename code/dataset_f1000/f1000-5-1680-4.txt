A few minor things: Abstract: I recommend using a term "mild exertional dyspnea" instead of " little ...dyspnea". Figure 3: I would rather remove the Legend from the Figure (makes it less crowded). Figure 1 - would show a 3rd plate with a longitudinal view of the LM artery (if available) for a better understanding of the anatomy. Just an origin view is not that impressive.
