Three subjects drove a single course in different vehicles at different intervals (30, 60 and 120 seconds), at different times of day, morning (9:00-11:59AM), afternoon (2:00-5:00PM) and night (7:00-10pm). The nine datasets were examined to determine the optimal collection interval. The 30-second interval was reported as optimal. Time of day was apparently uninformative. I think this paper could make a significant contribution to a burgeoning and important literature. How to measure driving in older adults is a complex issue. If there were valid processes and instrumentation for the meaningful and accurate measurement of safety-relevant driver outcomes in older adults, this contribution would be huge. However, I had a hard time following the results and conclusions drawn by the investigators. I found that most of this manuscript read like a proposal and it editing was seemingly incomplete. As it currently reads, there are significant revisions that need to be made to improve its intelligibility. For instance I had a very hard time finding any real or intelligible outcomes in the results section. The only results I could find were in the abstract (What does it mean to "capture the actual route driven along with the lowest number of incorrect paths") and then again buried in the discussion section properly. Is there really no intelligible data in the results section? Further, it is opaque to me why 30 seconds is preferred - what data supports the 30-second interval and the investigatorsâ€™ reasoning behind this the acceptance of this interva? If it's GIS type data, why isn't reported and interpreted? There is an oblique reference to a GOF but where is the table and logic behind the decision to adopt one model over another? More detail and logic is needed to make the authors' writing, logic and conclusions more clear. At the end of the manuscript I felt that the abstract's conclusion that 30 seconds was an optimal time for data collection is unsupported substantively.
