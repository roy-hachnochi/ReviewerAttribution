The authors present a new Cytoscape app, AutoAnnotate, that integrates topological cluster search with automatic annotation in order to help visualize underlying structures in complex networks. The tool comes to complement previous work by the same authors in other Cytoscape apps such as EnrichmentMap or WordCloud. This app provides a much-needed tool for semi-automatic annotation and visualization of complex network data. I found the app particularly useful when used to visually annotate and summarize term enrichment analysis results, which was its original design motivation. Used in combination with EnrichmentMap it provides users with enhanced visualization options on popular tools, such as BiNGO, g:Profiler or DAVID. The manuscript is clearly and concisely written, providing a nice introduction on the app functionality, its motivation and how to start using it. The tutorial referenced in the text is also quite useful, I have followed it to test the app with different use cases and I could get satisfactory displays without spending much time tweaking my results. The examples shown were also relevant and helped showing the app capabilities, although I would have welcomed an example using third party tool data, such as sorting out the network visualization output of BiNGO. To summarize, this is a valuable tool that I hope to see much used in network annotation visualization in the future.
