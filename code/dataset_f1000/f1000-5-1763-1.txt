This paper analyzes the monetary benefits accruing to citrus growers adopting a 1 trap / 10 ha pheromone trap monitoring program for citrus fruit borer Gymnamdrosoma aurantianum between 2001 and 2013. The principle savings was in a 50% reduction in insecticide application accompanied by significantly lower fruit damage. This is the first time the economic analysis of long term pheromone trap monitoring to better time insecticide application has been conducted. Because manpower costs of monitoring and spraying are not included, and because spraying uses much more manpower than monitoring, the actual additional income to citrus growers using the monitoring program is very likely more than estimated in this paper. The information in this paper is of significant interest to managers of agricultural enterprises.
