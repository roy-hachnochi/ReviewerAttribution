This manuscript reports on the use of a novel injury severity score for spinal cord injury to determine treatment efficacy on histological, functional and transcriptomic outcome measures. The treatment chosen was a selective inhibitor of ASIC1a, PcTx-1. The authors compared extensively through correlation how PcTx-1 improves function as well as white matter preservation based on the individual animalâ€™s severity score. Overall, this treatment appears to improve several outcome measures but did not significantly impact the transcriptome analysis targeting the apoptosis pathway. However, the use of the injury severity score has merit when determining drug efficacy because individual animals are analyzed based on this score. When using this type of analysis, the heterogeneity of SCI can be taken into consideration. Specific Comments: Overall, this is a well-written manuscript. However, several minor points are at issue. The authors state that the use of the osmotic pump for PcTx1 release resulted in stable plasma concentrations of the drug over a 48 hr period, how was this determined? Were levels taken or was this an assumption? In using the beam test, animals are usually pretrained on this task but there is no mention of this in the methods section.
