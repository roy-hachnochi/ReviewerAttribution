This is a simple and effective implementation of the two main heuristics used for calculating solvent accessible surface area of atomic structures such as proteins. The algortihm, FreeSASA, is suitably described and tested in the article. I see no real need to ask for any changes, as the author has done a very professional and nice job here. It downloads and installs very smoothly and offers most of the functionality that NACCESS offers, so will be appreciated by legacy users I would imagine (though some things have not been implemented, probably with good reason - either way, not a problem for me - and the author can react to requests or users can do a little work to get what they want in terms of formatting). I am sure the ability to thread across multiple cores will be beneficial and speed things up, and the API will make it slot into python pipelines etc. It's possible that it won't directly supplant some NACCESS dependencies which rely on its rather old formatting (.rsa file for example perhaps) but this is probably only a minor concern and easily fixed if needed (since its fully open source, its probably reduced to changing a few print statements anyway).
