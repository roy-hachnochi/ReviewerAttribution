The vitamin D receptor plays an important role in the immune system and the roles have widely been studied. Several studies have been conducted to assess the frequency distribution as well as roles of Vitamin D’s in various diseases conditions; including; multiple sclerosis, cancer, diabetes and TB. However, the findings have been varying and inconclusive, imposing the need of carrying further investigations in different populations and settings to determine the roles and frequency distrition. It was on this varying state of Vitamin D that the authors, Ester et al , conducted a study in Uganda aiming to investigate the frequency distribution of the VDR gene ( fok I) polymorphisms in pulmonary TB patients compared to controls in Ugandan population. The article though short and with relatively small sample size of 82 (TB patients and health controls) is well written, appropriate description is given covering all sections; introduction, objectives methods, results, discussions and conclusion. The study found no significance difference in the frequency distribution of homozygous –dominant (FF) and homozygous receive (ff) genotype among TB patients and controls. However, heterozygous (Ff) genotype was more frequent among TB patients compared to controls (7.3% vs 2.4%). The author concluded that Ff gene may be associated with TB because it occurred more in TB patients than in health controls. Specific comment: In the discussion section the author gave references to other studies done elsewhere on the frequency of FF and ff genotypes, however, references on the frequency of heterozygous (Ff) is missing and should be added in the discussion section. In this study the difference was observed on this gene for the Ugandan studied population hence reference to other studies findings is important.
