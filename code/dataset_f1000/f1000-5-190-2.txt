The paper summarizes an application of well established and efficient ISM method to compare ZIKA and H1N1. I would like to underline two points that I guess to be better describe. I suggest that Figure 2 can contain also the consensus spectrum as Figure 1. The second point is the description of Figure 3 in the result section. I guess that the authors could extended the illustration of the differences of the cross-spectrum. These differences are very interesting data for discrimination. Another small remark is about the aim of the paper. The authors suggest a 'repositioning' of H1N1 vaccine if it is possible I would like to ask them if they have considered the possibility to elicit unfavourable effect of cross reactivity with the consequence to reduce the vaccine efficiency.
