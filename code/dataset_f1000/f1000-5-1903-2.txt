This opinion article consists of two parts. The first is a thorough literature review. It gives a solid overview of the issues surrounding the MD/PhD program. I have no issues with this section. The second part consists of five transcribed interviews, and I consider it weaker than the first section. The evidence presented is only anecdotal, with a very small sample size. The author states that the interviewees were drawn from the author's academic contacts, so although a range of views and backgrounds is represented, sample bias cannot be excluded. Given that this an opinion and not a full research article this is not a reason for rejection, but this section could be greatly strengthened with additional interviews, ideally from outside the author's network. Alternatively, given the length of time that has elapsed since the original interviews, follow-up interviews checking whether the participants still felt the same way about their courses would be enlightening. The discussion and conclusion sections are mostly good. However, the second paragraph of the discussion contains the following sentence: "Multiple studies and focus groups have tried to characterize the values and reasons behind the relative lack of female trainees and mentors in academic medicine.", but no citations are given. I suspect that the authors are correct in this assertion, but a relevant citation or other evidence to back up this statement must be added before indexing.
