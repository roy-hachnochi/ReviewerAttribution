Support of biomedical research with a SaaS toolkit is a relevant issue and the selection of open source tools is the right way. There are, however, some points to be discussed: The selection of the different Open Source tools to be integrated in the SaaS should be discussed and motivated. It is not clear how the elicitation of formal requirements was handled. Was there an analysis of the research flow? Who are the stakeholders, the users, the data owners, etc.? The paper provides a technical description. Nevertheless, without testing/evaluation data and a use case (which will be published in another paper), the exercise is more theoretic. It is not demonstrated how the different solutions interact efficiently with each other in the cloud. Data protection issues for cloud computing are not sufficiently discussed. What happens with personal or pseudonymised data in the cloud? How is informed consent for data (re) use handled with the system? There should be a discussion on the pros and cons of the approach taken. The solution developed is partly UK-specific and the question should be raised how this can be applied in other countries and different locations.
