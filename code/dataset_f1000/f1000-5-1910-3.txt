The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HBV and HCV in hemodialysis population dialysis units of four hemodialysis centers in the city of Posadas (Argentina). Serum samples from hemodialysis patients were tested for presence of HBsAg and antiHCV by ELISA. Fifteen (15/172) cases were positives for HBsAg, whereas 17 (17/172) cases were positives for antiHCV. This is a descriptive study on local seroprevalence of HBV and HCV infection in a region of Argentina. The title is appropriate. The abstract provides adequate summary of the content. The methods are adequately described. The conclusions are adequate. There is though missing information which is relevant: no information on viremia, underlying disease severity, sequential data overtime. The following questions should be asked to the authors: How many of the patients were viremic? Was there any information on underlying disease severity How many were HBV and HCV coinfected? Do the authors have sequential data to try to clarify whether there is an increase, stability or decrease of positive cases? Were there HBV patients coinfected with HDV? Were there differences in positivity results by center? In essence, this is a simple study describing prevalence of HBV and HCV seromarkers in a particular region of Argentina. There have been many studies published to date on seroprevalence of these viruses around the world.
