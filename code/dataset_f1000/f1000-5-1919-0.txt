The changes included in this revised manuscript somewhat improve the description of the HiPPiP model and add some useful (albeit highly speculative) discussion of the potential mechanisms of IFITM antiviral activities against ZIKV. However, I am still not entirely convinced of the validity of the HiPPiP model and some of the the statements supporting this model appear to be exaggerated (e.g. "Thus, the novel PPIs predicted by HiPPIP are highly dependable to lead to successful experiments" - I am not sure what this means, and "Furthermore, predicted PPIs with scores ranging from 0.41 to 0.65 were experimentally validated and found to be true interacting pairs" - I am not convinced about the experimental validation detailed in this prior publication as the presented immunoprecipitation data does not include appropriate negative controls, molecular weight markers, details about antibody sources or specificity etc.). Future studies of this nature would be greatly strengthened by experimental validation of computationally predicted protein-protein interactions and exploration of the importance of the candidate host factors for the ZIKV replication cycle (e.g. via knockdown / knockout and/or pharmacological targeting of the candidate host factor and examination of effects on the ZIKV replication cycle).
