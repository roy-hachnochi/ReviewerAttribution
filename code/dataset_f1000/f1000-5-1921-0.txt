The focuses of the paper of Malakyan, Arakelyan and co-workers are the synthesis and characterization of isomeric 2-, 3- and 4-pyridinecarboxaldehydes and L-tryptophan derived Schiff bases and their copper (II) complexes and the study of their cytotoxic activity respect to two different cell lines, in particular the Human HeLa (cervix carcinoma) and the KCL-22 (chronic myeloid leukemia). The paper is well written, clear and highlights the differences between the cytotoxic activity of all Schiff base ligands and relative copper (II) complexes investigated through toxicity profiles. Moreover, the characterization of all compounds involved is detailed described and, in general, we find the results achieved from this investigation interesting. We suggest discussing two points to improve the quality of paper: How metal complexation influences the cytotoxic activity of Cu-2pyr.Trp , Cu-3pyr.Trp and Cu-4pyr.Trp respect to relative Schiff base ligands. The effect of the localization of carboxaldehyde group at 2-, 3- or 4-position with regard to nitrogen of aromatic ring on cytotoxic activity of all compound investigated. Finally, a minor revision. In the first paragraph of the Results and Discussion section, especially in the “Synthesis and characterization of Schiff bases and their copper (II) complexes” section, the sentence “ Based on 1H NMR spectra inspection for synthesized Schiff bases in D2O and CD3OD, the loss of 2 singlet signals of CH2 group was revealed, confirming the presence of target compounds. ” seems in contrast with the next one. This sentence should be reworked considering that the C H =N 1 H NMR signal is diagnostic for evaluation of the Schiff bases formation.
