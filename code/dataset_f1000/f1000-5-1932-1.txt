This manuscripts describes a carefully executed analysis of gene expression patterns over the Plasmodium life cycle. The authors have identified genes and GO categories that are upregulated at different stages of the Plasmodium life cycle, the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle, the gamete-fertilization stage and the sexual development stage. The genes that are upregulated suggest some pathways that may be targeted as new drugs to combat malaria. The authors also identified five motifs that are enriched in the promoters of the genes regulated at the different stages. Identifying enriched motifs is especially challenging in these species because of their AT-rich genomes. The title and abstract are accurate reflections of the work. The experimental design is careful and well-described. The conclusions are appropriate. The work relies on data that are already in the public domain.
