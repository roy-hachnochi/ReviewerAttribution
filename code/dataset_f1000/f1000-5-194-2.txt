I read this research with great enjoyment. The authors take a well-rounded approach to the surveillance and control of Aedes aegypti . However, I have a few methodological observations. Methodologically, the calculation of the Knockdown Time (KDT) is commonly done using a binary logistic regression. From the text is unclear but I assumed that the authors are using the 50 th and 95 th percentiles for the estimation of the KDT 50 and KDT 95 . Box plots are non-parametric; they are used without making any assumptions of underlying statistical distributions. The authors should make use of existing commonly used models to describe their time response observations. Several journals including, the Journal of Medical Entomology, request the use of logistic regression with a logit or probit link function. Using a common methodology allows the comparison of time response bioassay from different places and years. Thusly, please also provide estimates and confidence intervals for the KDT 50 and KDT 90 values using a binary logistic regression. Values beyond the KDT 90 are outside the linear portion of the regression. This publication could help you quickly calculate these statistics Lozano-Fuentes et al 1 .; other options exist in prepackage solutions like the “DRC” r library ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/drc/drc.pdf ) Regarding the V1016I mutation, the authors provide evidence that the mutation is fixed in their samples and it is very likely in at a high frequency in the local population. Please add Vera-Maloof et al . 2 to your discussion to help frame this discovery with closer Ae. aegypti populations. Regarding the AGO-Bs trap evaluation, the provided evidence (Figure 6, panel D) does not show a significant difference in mean relative abundance between any of the weeks as shown by the overlapping confidence intervals, some of the intervals are large enough that they appear to be below zero. Then again, the authors present a significant negative slope. These conflicting results point to the variables not being normal or not having equal variances. Please provide evidence that the data does not break the underlying assumptions of the linear regression model since it is being used to support the claim of abundance reduction by the AGO-B. Other obsevations Please add the citation to the R software to your manuscript 3 . References 1.

We acknowledge that this is omitted in our v1 manuscript. The estimates were provided in Supplemental Table 1. Because there are too many lines overlapping and direct clear comparion was difficult using traditional time response plot. Therefore we decided to plot the distribution of KD50 and KD95 (will revise to KD90 in version 2) to better visualize the comparison between chemicals.
