 Please provide a more detailed description in the Methods of how you obtained the primary and secondary electric fields. For instance, you state that the former is directly determined from the coil and head geometries, whilst the latter is calculated using FEM. Why this distinction? Cannot FEM with appropriate boundary conditions be used for a single/combined electric field calculation? Please clarify more clearly the nature of the magnetic dipoles you used to simulate the TMS coil i.e. how many and how were they distributed on the scalp? These dipoles are shown in the panel of Figure 1b as yellow arrows, but I find the figure very unclear, with minimal description in the text. Can you speculate on how the assumption of isotropic conductivity in WM would affect your results? Current is more likely to flow along WM fiber tracts than across these, potentially altering your electric fields and activation results. In the abstract, replace "corctial" with "cortical", and your field calculation methods, replace "in anterior to posterior" with "in the anterior to posterior".
