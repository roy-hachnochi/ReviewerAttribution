It would be nicer for the readers if there was more explanation and discussion in the text on the various different theories, what they imply, their pros and cons etc. Currently, it requires some background reading on these topics for the not so well-informed reader. A detailed discussion of the basis of the IVF hypothesis, the basis of the proposals, its criticism etc. is suggested for a greater understanding of the author's ideas.
