Overall, this is a good study adding a new knowledge to the field. Comment and suggestions: The title is very interesting. The abstract does not contain clear objective of the article written. The conclusion also is not clearly stated. There are no keywords written. The introduction is good and the objective is stated nicely. The methods section is overall acceptable. However, the sample size calculation is not mentioned. The number of sample collected is rather small. The results presented are satisfactory. Analysis done is appropriate. Overall the discussion is good. The limitation of the study should be addressed clearly. The conclusion is too long. It should answer the objective. The number of references is adequate and updated The Figures and Tables are satisfactory.
