This describes an R-based tool to query the drug-gene interactions in DGIdb. The paper is well written and the tool clearly has some utility. However, my reservations are outlined below. As the application of NGS to cancer samples accelerates the resultant explosion of somatic variants threatens to swamp userâ€™s ability to select them to input to this tool. What filters can be put in place to reduce huge aberration lists associated with passenger (i.e. probably non-causative and spurious) rather than driver mutations? Given the latest Nature publication on the analysis of protein-coding genetic variation in 60,706 humans now available in the ExAC resource I suggest the utility emphasis for looking at germ-line vs somatic target aberrations should be re-balanced. According to their website, DGIdb (v2.22 - sha1 aa9170e) was last updated 2016-02-21 and not all primary sources loaded were the latest versions even then. For example DrugBank is now up to 5.0 and GtoPdb is up to 2016.3 and it is not clear if it has only ChEMBL 20 rather than 21. Unless DGIdb can be prevailed upon to update more frequently and provide the release statistics of content, the utility of this tool is constrained because users cannot trust the results to be up to date. The main goal of this tool for the identification of targetable aberrations will be confounded by the conflation of loss vs gain of function on both the target and drug sides. As we know, genetic aberrations are predominantly LOF but most drugs also negatively modulate their targets. This should be discussed and perhaps even made filterable in some way? Why does Table 1 show such an apparently inconsistent mosaic of results? Reasons for discordance between the individual sources need to be explained. Given this tool was developed by SIB would it be possible to add in Swiss-Var as an independent source via Swiss-Prot or NeXtProt?
