This revised article "South-East Asian strains of Plasmodium falciparum display higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms compared to African strains" address several of the different criticisms listed by the reviewer in the recent submitted peer-review. In particular, the authors have revised their discussion section to better highlight the contrast between their conclusions and the conclusions made by a similar MalariaGen analysis. The authors have also addressed errors highlighted by the reviewer in both figure legends and discussion concerning the effects of selection. Together, these changes create a stronger article worth being indexed.
