The authors present a persuasive argument for replacing conventional lab notebooks with electronic versions (eLNs). Crucially, they outline the current drawbacks of conventional lab books in the current age and why there is a need to consider alternatives. One comment would be that the authors could perhaps have indicated if alternatives other than the systems mentioned in the article exist? The benefits of adopting eLNs described seem clear and comprehensive but importantly the potential weak points are also considered to give some balance. A similarly balanced tone is evident in discussion of the willingness of researchers to adopt eLNs and their reaction to doing so. Thus while the article is clearly presenting the authors' favoured opinion they also reflect on alternative views. As commented on by the authors, adopting an electronic system particularly in larger departments or organisations will need the appropriate IT infrastructure and support. While the authors surveyed opinions from researchers it might also have been informative to gauge and record opinion from IT professionals as to some of the practical issues of particular relevance to lab personnel. Overall, this article is very well structured and presents a helpful and informative perspective and primer on this emerging issue.
