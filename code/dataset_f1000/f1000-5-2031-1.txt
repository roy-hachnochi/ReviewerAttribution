I have read carefully the article on collecting clinical data in primary ciliary dyskinesia, the usefulness and comprehensiveness of the questionnaire used. I admire great effort and workload of the authors to set up this questionnaire and to approve its applicability in real life. From that point the topic has achieved its main goal. The other point is the low feedback responses and related questions that have been analyzed. Very interesting and valuable issues were raised. All of us working with questionnaires spent most of our time trying to avoid low response rate. Since this paper has no input on clinical diagnosis or treatment option in primary ciliary dyskinesia I would suggest this key problem to be pointed out. What would be the possible opportunities (as noted in the title) for solving this problem? In the methodology section, I would like to add the way that physicians filled up the questionnaires with their patients, precise time frame that they have been used including the time for explanations and clearing up the complicated or hardly understandable questions. Having in mind very detailed time consuming questionnaire, the importance should be in national based registry making, which should be pointed as well. I must say that reviewing this manuscript was real honor and I strongly support its publishing.
