This is an outstanding study demonstrating validation of a PCD clinical questionnaire by an expert group of clinicians from Israel. The data are well presented and the results will be valuable to clinicians caring for children and adults with PCD. However this is still quite a long questionnaire (98 questions and an hour to complete) and the authors have not made it clear how this questionnaire is to be used: As a diagnostic screening tool this could be stratified and streamlined to identify criteria sufficient for patients to be referred for additional testing such as nNO, TEM and video, or genetics. As a tool to monitor disease progression, many of the background questions would be redundant on repetition. As a tool to evaluate the outcomes of specific interventions (results of therapy) many of these questions are irrelevant. As a "general PCD questionnaire" it is long and time consuming to complete and may have limited application for an individual patient or clinician. I would appreciate it if Prof Amirav would discuss how he would see this questionnaire used in "real life" and if shortened versions might be more relevant for specific clinical applications.
