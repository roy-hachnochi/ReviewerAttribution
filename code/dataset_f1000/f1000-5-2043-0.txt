The origin and possible computational role of neuronal noise has been the focus of considerable scientific effort during the past decades. In particular, the transition to chaos has been extensively studied using simplified rate-models and much is known about this transition. A recent work studied the dynamics of a sparsely connected network of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons in the balance regime and a compelling mapping between spiking neural network and rate model was proposed. Following analysis and numerical simulations it was suggested that a novel type of asynchronous state exists and it was further hypothesized that this novel state is useful for complex information processing in the central nervous system. Here the authors reevaluate this claim. Several counter examples are provided to prove that the claim of a transition to a second type of asynchronous state does not hold. Furthermore, the origin of ‘strong fluctuation’ super-Poisson irregular firing is studied and is found to be related to extremely negative voltage fluctuations that are beyond the typical physiological range. The work is timely. The results are solid and well presented. I also find the effort devoted to reproduce and re-evaluate results refreshing. I believe this paper will contribute to the scientific debate.
