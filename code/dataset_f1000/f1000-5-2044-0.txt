This research note adds on the current discussion on the results of Tomasetti and Vogelstein, demonstrating that stochastic effects associated with stem cell division contribute in a substantial way to cancer incidence. As this conclusion has important and possibly harmful implications in the public health decisions, this deserves attention. On the one hand, this note confirms robustness of the TV analysis of the correlation between lscd and cancer risk. On the other hand, it points out that cancers predicted to be replicative may include a proportion of preventable cases. This is demonstrated by the higher ERS index for hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan, where HCV and HBV prevalence, and therefore its preventability, is higher than in the USA. Minor points: It would be interesting to show variation in ERS for other tumors such as, for example, esophageal and thyroid cancer. As discussed in Garattini Tavani (2016), the incidence of these tumors show a great geographical variability. Even if it is not possible to associate these differences to preventable factors, this would add information on the global impact of geographical variation on ERS variability. The discussion on lscd is also interesting. Perhaps the authors should make it explicit that more research is needed on the determination of the number of stem cell divisions and its dependence on factors such as different cell types in the same organ, damage, inflammation, individual height or weight and even ethnicity. Finally, the authors should better explain why they deemed it important to demonstrate the robustness of TV analysis, as they reproduced it with minor changes.
