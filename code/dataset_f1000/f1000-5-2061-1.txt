The article stands as a final word on a closed era of HCV treatment. I wonder if in the rapidly changing world of HCV treatments the introduction should be updated a little, especially the second to last paragraph that implies that in the real world some patients with G1 might still be treated with PEG RIBA. I also question the relavence of the presenting of the data separating referrals to the anti viral unit (as a sort of ITT analysis) and those actually treated (per protocol esque analysis). This is a little artificial as we don't know how many people were seen in other hepatology clinics and never referred because they were either deemed unsuitable or uninterested. Other than these few tweaks I approve.
