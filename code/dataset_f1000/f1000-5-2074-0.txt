The revised version is substantially clearer. The clarification between generic and particular on the tree model and the discussion of the log normal distribution (in my opinion) improve the paper. It's an EXCELLENT contribution. I now see how my previous critique was a bit of a misunderstanding on my part. The normal and log normal are really the same pattern (as stated in the appendix). Once you see that they are the same, one of the main ideas becomes much clearer. I have one suggestion . I think people will benefit by being pointed to the appendix early as the rest of the paper is more easily understood (at least by me) by first reading the description of normal, log normal, and power law because we get the functional forms. I would suggest one modification. Change the sentence: "The normal distribution calls to mind the great regularity in pattern that arises solely from the aggregation of an underlying stochastic process." to the following The familiar regular pattern exhibited by the normal distribution (or equivalently the log normal distribution - see appendix ) arises solely from the aggregation of an underlying stochastic process or processes. Not a deal breaker for me if they don't add this but it would be a loss if they did not point to the appendix with a teaser. I also think that by saying "normal and log normal" are the same pattern, the reader will suddenly get it!!!!
