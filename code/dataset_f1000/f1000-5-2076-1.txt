Survival analysis is a field with a long history, mainly associated with the name David Cox, and is of interest far outside of biology, e.g. the reliability analysis of machines. One element of it concerns making inferences about underlying mechanisms from observed processes. The historical development of the subject seems to have ended in a cul-de-sac which we see in Stroustrup's worm paper, discussed here, although clearly explored in an earlier Ricklefs paper, discussed by no-one. Frank offers an entirely new approach with a different starting point. It seems sensible to discuss the Frank paper at the junction where the new collides with the old, which is the Stroustrup worm paper, published in Nature magazine this year. The heart of the matter, from my perspective, is this. The old development of the subject ended up at this point - Survival data is typically well described by both Weibull and Gompertz distributions, which are described in terms of the 'hazard' function derived from them, describing your future chance of surviving beyond a particular time, given you have survived to that time so far. If these hazards change for some reason (e.g. temperature for Stroustrup), we can model the effect of these changes in one of two ways, dreamed up by Cox because they 'work' for statistical analysis. One of these ways (AFT) is a time scaling of the hazard, in which everything happens in 'dog years' for example. The other (PH), as noted by Cox, is very hard to give a biological interpretation to in terms of underlying mechanisms, although it is very useful for prediction, evaluating drug efficacy etc. Now, the Weibull distribution can be proved analytically to allow interpretation under both these ways of changing circumstance, one of which is, itself, intrinsically hard to interpret. So if the data are Weibull, which fits the Stroustrup data, you cannot really say anything about the underlying mechanism. Unless you get very inspired and allow "imagination" (Ricklefs) and "preferences" (Stroustrup Supp Info) to assist you. This is not necessarily a bad thing, of course, but it sounds like an admission that you have gone as far as you can by the traditional route. I note that the Supp. Info Figure 1.1, which is central to the narrative flow, uses a Weibull distribution, which has a log-log hazard and the Weibull plays a large role in their statistics/simulations etc. The Gompertz has a measly log hazard, which rather screws up the simple scaling story. Frank now approaches the whole subject in a way which is new, thought-provoking, challenging and very welcome, starting from a rethinking of the basic meanings of statistical distributions. It is far to soon to have an opinion on the likely success of this approach in leading us out of the cul-de-sac. But I certainly have the opinion it should be published. The Ricklefs paper deserves some acknowledgement and will also flag this topic for a larger audience of evolutionary ecologists, as it concerns the evolution of longevity, species variation in longevity etc. etc. Ricklefs RE, Scheuerlein A. 2002.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This paper by S. A. Frank builds on his recent work on general common patterns of statistical distributions to comment on some invariance rules when examining the distribution of mortality data. In particular, the present paper shows that there always exists an adequate transformation of time (or age), such as, when measured on this scale, the shape of the survival curve is unaffected by any shift on this scale. Interestingly, Frank here also shows that on this scaling, the survival curve has necessarily a Gompertz form. On this scaling, the acceleration of mortality with (transformed) time is constant. This is indeed interesting to realize that any mortality distribution would have these properties. So not much could be inferred about the mechanisms of mortality and aging just because one transformation of time would lead to the distribution of mortality satisfying those properties. The remaining question is whether we can infer something from the fact that one transformation of time rather than another produces this invariance. As an illustration, the present paper by S. A Frank then comments on a recent study by Stroustrup et al. (2016, hereafter S2016), which showed that various genetic or environmental interventions affected mortality patterns in nematodes populations by modifying the time scale of mortality, leaving the shape of survival curves unchanged. More precisely, a log transformation of time then satisfies the invariance properties mentioned above. Interestingly, a few interventions in their data set do not exhibit invariance after a log-transformation of time. In the supplementary material of the S2016, the authors have examined a diversity of mechanistic models of mortality and checked under which perturbations of the parameters of these models one would observe the specific invariance pattern seen in their data. In some of these models, the specific invariance pattern emerges only when all sub-processes affecting mortality are affected to the same extent by the intervention (e.g. competing risk models), or when all parameters in the models are affected to a similar extent by the intervention (diffusion models). In some other models (e.g. network models), the specific invariance can emerge when only part of the processes are affected by the intervention. These conclusions appear therefore more subtle than the claim made in the main text of S2016 that “each intervention must alter to the same extent throughout adult life all physiological determinants of the risk of death”. It is furthermore not very clear to me what is meant exactly by “all physiological determinants of the risk of death”. Can we say that the drift and variance terms in a diffusion model for vitality correspond to different physiological determinants of the risk of death? Again we could imagine different mechanistic sub-models that would create different functional relationships between the drift and variance parameters. Frank uses S2016 in two ways: first, as an illustration of a particular type of invariance exhibited by real data, second, as a warning against the risk of over-interpretation of such invariances. In particular, Frank reacts to the claim cited above, which is indeed confusing. As S2016 did in their supplementary material, Frank exhibits a mechanistic model of mortality (but yet a different one from those considered S2016), which shows the same properties of invariance when only part of the processes of mortality are affected by the intervention. Both the theoretical exercise of Frank and those of S2016 show that there are many different mechanistic models that can exhibit the same specific invariance and thus raise together strong doubts about what we can infer from invariances in mortality patterns. The set of models examined by S2016 is certainly not exhaustive despite its diversity, and claims based upon this set (already more complex than the simple cited argument suggests) cannot really be generalized to all models of mortality. I therefore agree with the general message of caution of the present paper by S.A. Frank. It however remains frustrating that the general framework that he proposes does not really help to get a better general grasp at what features of a model would produce one type of invariance rather than another, and for instance help generating hypotheses that would explain why some interventions did fail to produce the same type of invariance in S2016. This what S2016 attempted in their supplementary material. In particular, I would be interested in a clearer illustration of the claim made by Frank that “consideration of the alternative processes with the same observable invariances leads to testable predictions about the underlying causal processes”. Interestingly, the model put forward by Frank is shift-invariant on a scale, which is not a simple log-transformation of time (see equation 17 and that following on the right column of page 6). While early in the process, the deformation of time to achieve invariance would resemble that expected under a log-scaling, this is not true later. I therefore failed to understand exactly why this model would actually fit the data presented by S2016. More explanation would be necessary here. The whole argument page 7 about interventions affecting part of the processes when slow and fast processes determine mortality makes intuitive sense but would be more convincing if illustrated (as was done for instance with examples in the supplementary material of S2016). I found these arguments about slow and fast processes to be quite disconnected actually from the general arguments about invariance presented before. To conclude, I found the contribution of Frank novel and interesting, but still a bit frustrating about how this perspective could help us extract more information from patterns of mortality. The message of caution is an important one. The criticism of S2016 is justified by the over-simplistic claim included in their abstract and main text, but I am a bit concerned that it may misrepresent what these authors have achieved. This claim was actually motivated, not directly by the examination of invariance in the data, but by the comparison of several models to data in a spirit similar to what Frank proposes here. That several models could exhibit the same invariance rule for different reasons was clearly shown already in S2016 (supplementary material). The common properties of models exhibiting that specific invariance rule however appear even less clear than suggested by the initial exploration of S2016 and it could be good that the present paper communicates more precisely about this point.

F1000Research includes referee reports as part of the final publication, and I am very pleased to have this report included. I agree with most of the comments and opinions in this report. My primary goal was perhaps a bit simpler and less ambitious than Ronce's wider goals. I intended to show that there is a simple mathematical truth that should be kept in mind whenever one tries to understand patterns of mortality. The mathematical truth is of great value but at the same time does not tell us exactly what is happening in any particular case. I emphasized that duality very clearly in my conclusions. In the context of that duality, my discussion of Stroustrup et al. (S2016) was intended primarily as an illustration of the mathematical result rather than as an attempt to deconstruct fully their data and analyses. With regard to Ronce's specific comments: I therefore agree with the general message of caution of the present paper by S.A. Frank. It however remains frustrating ... In particular, I would be interested in a clearer illustration of the claim made by Frank that “consideration of the alternative processes with the same observable invariances leads to testable predictions about the underlying causal processes”. Perhaps my use of S2016 as an illustration was misleading. I do not view my conclusion as one of caution. Rather, there is something very simple and true about curves of death that one must keep in mind to move forward. I do not know exactly how to move forward, but I do know that I must use the truth to help focus my approach. The accomplishment is, I think, a step in the right direction, a positive rather than cautionary or negative contribution. With regard to the specific point, consider the following. Suppose that, in theory, members in one set of seemingly different processes all lead to the same general scaling of mortality. Suppose that other members of another set all lead to a different scaling of mortality, for example, a different bending of time. We now have a comparative theoretical prediction. If we can transform the underlying processes from one set to the other, the bending of time should change in a predictable way. If, by contrast, we transform from one underlying process to another within the same set, then the bending of time should not change. That is a very abstract summary, without specifying exactly what those underlying processes are. But the knowledge that such a thing is possible gives us a point of departure for moving ahead. We now know that we need better theory to tell us what we might expect, And we need to figure out how to design experiments in the context of this theory, which is much deeper and more likely to provide a way ahead than the current relatively shallow and haphazard approach. That is not a critique of S2016, which was a thoughtful article, but rather of much of the literature. But, as I said, I am not interested in caution or critique, but rather in what we need to go forward. In that regard, I agree that the supplementary material of S2016 may have provided some interesting discussion, but I think it is not what we ultimately need to move ahead. Interestingly, the model put forward by Frank is shift-invariant on a scale, which is not a simple log-transformation of time (see equation 17 and that following on the right column of page 6). While early in the process, the deformation of time to achieve invariance would resemble that expected under a log-scaling, this is not true later. I therefore failed to understand exactly why this model would actually fit the data presented by S2016. More explanation would be necessary here. That is a model of a gamma process. A gamma process is perhaps the simplest and most common model of failure. A gamma process always has that property of log scaling at small magnitudes and linear scaling at large magnitudes, leading to a transition from power law to exponential forms. I have discussed this extensively in my series of articles on probability patterns, which can be found on my web site at https://stevefrank.org. The whole argument page 7 about interventions affecting part of the processes when slow and fast processes determine mortality makes intuitive sense but would be more convincing if illustrated (as was done for instance with examples in the supplementary material of S2016). I found these arguments about slow and fast processes to be quite disconnected actually from the general arguments about invariance presented before. Such analyses would be a good project for future work. This article concerns a simple abstract mathematical point, rather than a variety of specific models tied to specific assumptions. Again, perhaps my use of S2016 was misleading with respect to my primary interest. S2016 is interesting, but only in a very limited way. On the positive side, we now know more clearly what needs to be done, so we have a basis for future work. In closing, I wish to emphasize again how much I appreciated the deep and thoughtful comments by Ronce.
