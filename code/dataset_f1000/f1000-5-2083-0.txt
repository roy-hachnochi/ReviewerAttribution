This is a well thought out analysis of the data available on human pregnancy wastage. The conclusions are valid from the data explored but the major variant of failed fertilization and very early embryo loss cannot be estimated. Failed fertilization will always be an unknown in such studies but early embryo loss can be estimated from the large amount of IVF data published on embryo survival to the blastocyst stage (day 5-7). However, the vast bulk of this data comes from superovulated patients and this may not represent embryo loss in the natural ovulatory cycle. This data suggests that only 30% of conceptions end up as live babies at delivery (Macklon et al., 2002) Indeed embryonic arrest before day 5 can be attributed to whole chromosome abnormalities in more than half of human embryos (McCoy et al., 2015). The embryonic losses due to mitotic and meiotic support the high embryonic wastage in human reproduction. It is a pity the authors didn’t include this genetic data in support of their hypothesis References 1.

I respond to his comments as follows: Use of IVF data: The study was intentionally restricted to the analysis of hCG data from a natural reproductive context, and from the three studies in particular 2-4 . As Prof. Trounson indicates, data from IVF may not be representative of natural cycles. Extrapolation of conclusions from a specific to a wider or different context should always be done with caution (see review by Prof. Senn 5 ). The use of IVF data to inform our understanding of natural reproduction can be particularly difficult, as I note elsewhere 6 . Macklon et al. , 2002 7 : This is a well-known and frequently cited review. I discuss the referenced value of 30% elsewhere 6 . However, contrary to what Prof. Trounson seems to imply, it is neither a summary of nor an extrapolation from IVF data. It is part of Macklon’s “ overview of the outcome of spontaneous human pregnancy ”, and is copied directly from an earlier review on the “ frequency of implantation and early pregnancy loss in natural cycles ” by Prof. Tim Chard 8 . Macklon is explicit in stating that the conditions from which in vitro data are obtained are “ far from ideal ” and “ do not reflect the normal situation ” 7 . He reviews several hCG studies concluding that many problems associated with these were addressed by Wilcox 2 and subsequently Zinaman 3 . Surprisingly however, the numerical estimates in Macklon (including the 30% survival value) do not reflect the outcome from these two studies, as I explain elsewhere 6 . McCoy et al. , 2015 9 : It is difficult to incorporate quantitative conclusions from McCoy into a model of natural human embryo loss. All McCoy’s data are from IVF embryos and are susceptible to criticism regarding their accuracy as a description of natural reproduction. As he himself states: “ specific rates of meiotic and mitotic error reported in this study are likely particular to the IVF population ” and “ studies also demonstrated that ovarian stimulation and IVF culture conditions can both influence rates of chromosome abnormalities ” 9 . McCoy cites Macklon 7 as authority for a 70% loss of all conceptions in human reproduction. Moreover, he goes further by associating this loss specifically with “ young, otherwise fertile couples ” 9 . McCoy also cites a published summary 10 of Edmonds, 1982 11 , an early hCG study. Edmonds' data lie at one extreme of the pre-Wilcox studies, with 56.8% of hCG+ cycles failing prior to clinical recognition. By contrast, Walker, 1988 12 reported no pre-clinical losses of hCG+ pregnancies. Neither Edmonds’ nor Walker’s estimates have been replicated since Wilcox, 1988 2 . Subsequent studies report a post-implantation, pre-clinical loss of approximately 20% 6 . Elsewhere 13 , McCoy states that “ Fewer than ~30% of conceptions result in successful pregnancy ”, citing Wilcox. However, Wilcox 2 reports that “ The total rate of pregnancy loss after implantation, including clinically recognized spontaneous abortions, was 31% ”. Therefore, McCoy’s conclusion that high levels of aneuploidy observed in IVF embryos can explain natural human embryo loss is not well-founded, since natural embryo loss is substantially lower than he claims. An alternative view is that the high level of aneuploidy observed in vitro is, at least in part, an artefact of the handling of human ova and the associated interventions of assisted reproductive technology, as suggested by Chard (“ it is possible that at least some of the abnormalities are the result of the experimental procedures themselves ” 8 ) and Braude (“ Experiments in our laboratories have suggested that the in vitro handling of oocytes can produce chromosomal aberrations at alarmingly high frequencies ” 14 ). The critical question is – how large is that part? These issues are addressed in more detail elsewhere 6 .
