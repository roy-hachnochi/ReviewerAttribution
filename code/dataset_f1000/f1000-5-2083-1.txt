This is an interesting and generally well-written article. I am unfamiliar with the field of reproductive physiology and female fertility regulation and so cannot be described as an expert reviewer. However, I do have expertise in the field of statistics and modelling and felt to understand the issues much better having read this article and that is a tribute to its general clarity. Nevertheless, at one or two points I felt the clarity could have been improved. The author is not always completely explicit on two points. The first is whether a conditional probability is being estimated (and if so conditional on what) and the second is the precise details of the mixed model being used. Since readers will not necessarily be familiar with the software an author uses, and since the more complex the subject the more likely an algorithm will differ between packages, one of the inevitable problems in a field of this complexity are 1) that it is quite likely that readers will not be familiar with some details of implementation and 2) results might differ somewhat from package to package. The author has used NONMEM, a package that is popular in nonlinear mixed effect modelling in pharmacokinetics but less well-known in other fields. This is a limitation of the article. (Not because NONMEM is not a suitable package to use but because it is the only package used.) For example, Makubate and Senn, modelling the effects of cross-over trials in infertility, found some differences depending on whether SAS, GenStat or R were used to implement what was ostensibly the same model, or indeed program it from scratch using Mathcad and in the field of estimating values below the limit of quantitation Senn, Holford and Hockey got different standard errors using NOMEM compared to SAS, GenStat and R, although such differences are not necessarily inherent to packages but may reflect implementation. On a more technical matter, the author has used a discrete mixture which some might regard as being excessively restrictive and a little unrealistic, although the author does claim " the published data do not support a model of uni-modal, albeit varied, fecundability ". A further issue is that unlike for causal studies, such as clinical trials, the degree to which the subjects studied are representative of a population of interest is important. Lacking knowledge of this particular field and the studies cited I cannot judge whether this condition is satisfied. It seems at least plausible that sub-fertile couples are more likely to be studied than those of average fertility. Nevertheless, this seems to be an interesting and valuable exercise in modelling a difficult field. References 1. Makubate B, Senn S: Planning and analysis of cross-over trials in infertility.

The analysis attempts to introduce a little more focus to the data from the three particular studies 2-4 .

However, in the absence of the original raw data, there is little else that could be done.

My own instinct (which is admittedly not as refined as Prof. Senn’s) is that any difference is likely to be small, since, although I used NONMEM, there is no random effect (i.e., OMEGA) modelling other than the residual error variance (i.e., SIGMA). However, there are perhaps other reasons why performing the analysis in GenStat or R is preferable. At some point I will repeat the analysis and report back any differences in the output.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This is a well thought out analysis of the data available on human pregnancy wastage. The conclusions are valid from the data explored but the major variant of failed fertilization and very early embryo loss cannot be estimated. Failed fertilization will always be an unknown in such studies but early embryo loss can be estimated from the large amount of IVF data published on embryo survival to the blastocyst stage (day 5-7). However, the vast bulk of this data comes from superovulated patients and this may not represent embryo loss in the natural ovulatory cycle. This data suggests that only 30% of conceptions end up as live babies at delivery (Macklon et al., 2002) Indeed embryonic arrest before day 5 can be attributed to whole chromosome abnormalities in more than half of human embryos (McCoy et al., 2015). The embryonic losses due to mitotic and meiotic support the high embryonic wastage in human reproduction. It is a pity the authors didn’t include this genetic data in support of their hypothesis References 1.

I respond to his comments as follows: Use of IVF data: The study was intentionally restricted to the analysis of hCG data from a natural reproductive context, and from the three studies in particular 2-4 . As Prof. Trounson indicates, data from IVF may not be representative of natural cycles. Extrapolation of conclusions from a specific to a wider or different context should always be done with caution (see review by Prof. Senn 5 ). The use of IVF data to inform our understanding of natural reproduction can be particularly difficult, as I note elsewhere 6 . Macklon et al. , 2002 7 : This is a well-known and frequently cited review. I discuss the referenced value of 30% elsewhere 6 . However, contrary to what Prof. Trounson seems to imply, it is neither a summary of nor an extrapolation from IVF data. It is part of Macklon’s “ overview of the outcome of spontaneous human pregnancy ”, and is copied directly from an earlier review on the “ frequency of implantation and early pregnancy loss in natural cycles ” by Prof. Tim Chard 8 . Macklon is explicit in stating that the conditions from which in vitro data are obtained are “ far from ideal ” and “ do not reflect the normal situation ” 7 . He reviews several hCG studies concluding that many problems associated with these were addressed by Wilcox 2 and subsequently Zinaman 3 . Surprisingly however, the numerical estimates in Macklon (including the 30% survival value) do not reflect the outcome from these two studies, as I explain elsewhere 6 . McCoy et al. , 2015 9 : It is difficult to incorporate quantitative conclusions from McCoy into a model of natural human embryo loss. All McCoy’s data are from IVF embryos and are susceptible to criticism regarding their accuracy as a description of natural reproduction. As he himself states: “ specific rates of meiotic and mitotic error reported in this study are likely particular to the IVF population ” and “ studies also demonstrated that ovarian stimulation and IVF culture conditions can both influence rates of chromosome abnormalities ” 9 . McCoy cites Macklon 7 as authority for a 70% loss of all conceptions in human reproduction. Moreover, he goes further by associating this loss specifically with “ young, otherwise fertile couples ” 9 . McCoy also cites a published summary 10 of Edmonds, 1982 11 , an early hCG study. Edmonds' data lie at one extreme of the pre-Wilcox studies, with 56.8% of hCG+ cycles failing prior to clinical recognition. By contrast, Walker, 1988 12 reported no pre-clinical losses of hCG+ pregnancies. Neither Edmonds’ nor Walker’s estimates have been replicated since Wilcox, 1988 2 . Subsequent studies report a post-implantation, pre-clinical loss of approximately 20% 6 . Elsewhere 13 , McCoy states that “ Fewer than ~30% of conceptions result in successful pregnancy ”, citing Wilcox. However, Wilcox 2 reports that “ The total rate of pregnancy loss after implantation, including clinically recognized spontaneous abortions, was 31% ”. Therefore, McCoy’s conclusion that high levels of aneuploidy observed in IVF embryos can explain natural human embryo loss is not well-founded, since natural embryo loss is substantially lower than he claims. An alternative view is that the high level of aneuploidy observed in vitro is, at least in part, an artefact of the handling of human ova and the associated interventions of assisted reproductive technology, as suggested by Chard (“ it is possible that at least some of the abnormalities are the result of the experimental procedures themselves ” 8 ) and Braude (“ Experiments in our laboratories have suggested that the in vitro handling of oocytes can produce chromosomal aberrations at alarmingly high frequencies ” 14 ). The critical question is – how large is that part? These issues are addressed in more detail elsewhere 6 .

I am unfamiliar with the field of reproductive physiology and female fertility regulation and so cannot be described as an expert reviewer. However, I do have expertise in the field of statistics and modelling and felt to understand the issues much better having read this article and that is a tribute to its general clarity. Nevertheless, at one or two points I felt the clarity could have been improved. The author is not always completely explicit on two points. The first is whether a conditional probability is being estimated (and if so conditional on what) and the second is the precise details of the mixed model being used. Since readers will not necessarily be familiar with the software an author uses, and since the more complex the subject the more likely an algorithm will differ between packages, one of the inevitable problems in a field of this complexity are 1) that it is quite likely that readers will not be familiar with some details of implementation and 2) results might differ somewhat from package to package. The author has used NONMEM, a package that is popular in nonlinear mixed effect modelling in pharmacokinetics but less well-known in other fields. This is a limitation of the article. (Not because NONMEM is not a suitable package to use but because it is the only package used.) For example, Makubate and Senn, modelling the effects of cross-over trials in infertility, found some differences depending on whether SAS, GenStat or R were used to implement what was ostensibly the same model, or indeed program it from scratch using Mathcad and in the field of estimating values below the limit of quantitation Senn, Holford and Hockey got different standard errors using NOMEM compared to SAS, GenStat and R, although such differences are not necessarily inherent to packages but may reflect implementation. On a more technical matter, the author has used a discrete mixture which some might regard as being excessively restrictive and a little unrealistic, although the author does claim " the published data do not support a model of uni-modal, albeit varied, fecundability ". A further issue is that unlike for causal studies, such as clinical trials, the degree to which the subjects studied are representative of a population of interest is important. Lacking knowledge of this particular field and the studies cited I cannot judge whether this condition is satisfied. It seems at least plausible that sub-fertile couples are more likely to be studied than those of average fertility. Nevertheless, this seems to be an interesting and valuable exercise in modelling a difficult field. References 1. Makubate B, Senn S: Planning and analysis of cross-over trials in infertility.

I respond to his comments as follows: Representative Populations: This is an important point and Prof. Senn’s intuitive concern is well-founded. The analysis attempts to introduce a little more focus to the data from the three particular studies 2-4 . Despite the similarities between the quantitative conclusions from the three studies, extrapolation to a general population is risky, given the known and likely variances in fertility associated with age, health and social status, level of education, ethnicity etc... However, the strength of these studies lies in the detail and density of the data, which is rare among other similar studies, and I believe this re-analysis does yield some additional insight. I have addressed some of the concern regarding differences in populations and other sources of reproductive variance in another article 5 . Conditional Probabilities: I hope the following makes my intention more explicit. If P(A|B) is the probability of event A, conditional on event B, then: (i) π LB = P(A|B), where A is a live birth, and B is a clinical pregnancy (ii) π CLIN = P(A|B), where A is a clinical pregnancy, and B is a positive hCG test (iii) π HCG = P(A|B), where A is a positive hCG test, and B is successful fertilisation (iv) π FERT = P(A|B), where A is successful fertilisation, and B is the in vivo co-localisation of ovum and sperm (v) π SOC = P(A|B), where A is the in vivo co-localisation of ovum and sperm, and B a single menstrual cycle Discrete mixture model: I agree that dividing the cohort into two discrete populations is a little unrealistic. However, in the absence of the original raw data, there is little else that could be done. The data conform markedly better to this bi-modal distribution, as compared to either a uni-modal or tri-modal model. I doubt if this model captures all the quantitative subtlety that subsists in the data; nevertheless, it does both confirm and quantify, albeit perhaps a little brutally, the clear impression expressed in the original reports that the study populations included subjects who were sub-fertile. Modelling packages: The point about differing outputs from different modelling software packages is also well made. My own instinct (which is admittedly not as refined as Prof. Senn’s) is that any difference is likely to be small, since, although I used NONMEM, there is no random effect (i.e., OMEGA) modelling other than the residual error variance (i.e., SIGMA). However, there are perhaps other reasons why performing the analysis in GenStat or R is preferable. At some point I will repeat the analysis and report back any differences in the output. I shall incorporate changes relating to points 1, 2 and 3 into a second version of the article.
