In this revised manuscript, the authors have satisfactorily answered my previous questions. Overall, the workflow provides a useful step-by-step instruction on how to analyze scRNA-seq data, and it is worthwhile to be documented in the literature. The authors explained why they hesitated to provide the whole pipeline through an R file and a graphical user interface. While their explanations are reasonable, convenience in installation and data exploration will greatly help many users. Therefore, I hope they could add/improve those components as they continue to develop this workflow.
