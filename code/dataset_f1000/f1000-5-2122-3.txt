In the 2nd version, Lun and colleagues have updated the workflow for the 3.4 release of Bioconductor and provided a tool to install all the needed dependencies to replicate the workflow. This eases reproducibility and addresses my first and largest concern. The authors have not modified the article in response to my other comments, but rather offer a rebuttal. I acknowledge that some of the issues I raise are probably too large to be solved in a vignette, but nonetheless potential users of this workflow should be aware of them. I reply below: 1b. Inheriting from a `SummarizedExperiment` not only allows storage in sparse formats, which as indicated in rebuttal may not be terribly applicable for scRNAseq, but also allows analysis of data that is too big to fit into memory, by storing the data on-disk in HDF5 format. Adopting `SummarizedExperiment` as a container would future-proof this software in the event that data sets do get too large to fit into memory of conventional machines. A back-of-the envelop calculation suggests this won't be an issue until data sets are on the order of 10 5 cells, and require on the order of gigabytes of memory to store. Conducting analysis on big-memory machines might delay this issue indefinitely. 2. Although feature counting is an approach used by many studies, I do not know that it has been shown to provide equivalent estimates to EM-based transcript quantitation (and would welcome a reference otherwise!) Because feature counting throws away multi-mapped reads, at a minimum it is an inefficient use (scarce, costly) data. I would not characterize it generally as "conservative," either, unless the reads are discarded uniformly at random from all possible transcripts, and only single isoforms are of interest. If uniformity doesn't hold, or multiple isoforms are present, feature counting distorts the relative abundances of genes, and even sample-to-sample comparisons of the same gene (e.g. Figures S1 and S4 in [1]). Additionally, modern quantitation programs do much more than account for multi-mapping reads--they also can model biases in the sequencing chemistry and fragment start sites, and can be faster than alignment-based procedures. 2,3 I find analyst inertia an unconvincing reason not to adopt them. 3. I also agree that the plethora of alternate approaches is a quagmire for end-users at the moment. Lamentably there has been very little in the way of across-method comparison, and instead the methods have been developed around a specific data set, or two, and rarely compared to each other. More direct head-to-head comparisons would advance the field dramatically. In the meantime, caveat calculator . I thank the authors for their effort in creating this tutorial. Having well-documented software and workflows will be critical for allowing the sorts of head-to-head comparisons I mention in [3]. References 1.
