Lun and colleagues describe a low-level analysis specific for single-cell RNA-seq experiments, using open-source packages available on Bioconductor. This paper could potentially be a valuable resource for those who want to carry out such analysis in R. The steps are very descriptive, and they even include 2 different datasets presenting different types and conditions for analysis. They have done a very thorough job in explaining the decisions taken at each step of QC, filtering, normalization and provide some basic but important visualization examples (clustering, heatmaps) that would help in assessing not only the quality of the dataset technically, but also provided information on the outcome of the experiment itself. Unfortunately I could not run some of the steps in the workflow which prevented me from assessing the code. Some I could figure out and "fix" in the attempt to run the code, but others not so much. I provide some (not exhaustive) examples below to help in the troubleshooting, and if these (and the subsequent code relying on these outputts) could be solved, I would be happy to continue the review further. isSpike(sce) - "ERCC" //worked with isSpike(sce) - is.spike can't find the function nexprs [I had to use numcells - rowSums(exprs(sce)!=0)] is.ercc - isSpike(sce, type="ERCC") //worked with [is.ercc - isSpike(sce) Could not run code from the section: Identifying HVGs from the normalized log-expression var.fit - trendVar(sce, trend="loess", use.spikes=FALSE, span=0.2) Error in simpleLoess(y, x, w, span, degree = degree, parametric = parametric, : invalid 'x'
