The authors have addressed all the concerns raised from the previous review. A minor comment for the batch effects is given in the follows. As batch effects are expected for heterogeneous datasets, the direct application of prediction model built on the discovery dataset to the validation dataset would be incorrect and usually result in poor performance. To show the usefulness of the gene signatures while minimizing the batch effects, the authors might consider to run cross-validation on the validation dataset alone using the gene signatures obtained from discovery dataset.
