I have only minor comments, listed below. “In the present study we reanalyzed data from high throughput behavioral phenotyping of BXD RIS in the presence of morphine (Philip et al., 2010).” Although it is clear what the authors are trying to say, strictly speaking this sentence implies that the authors had morphine present (on their desks? Or in their bloodstream??) when they were analyzing the data. Please make the sentence less ambiguous. “Strain mean scores were Winsorized when statistical outliers were present”. Please elaborate on this and/or cite references to support the decision to modify as opposed to exclude data. “We remapped these data for each time point using composite interval mapping to identify QTLs potentially masked by this large QTL.” Please clarify what “time point” refers to here. “protein coding genes” this is a redundant expression. Please use either “protein coding sequences” or “genes”. In the discussion, perhaps a few words could be mentioned about why in general reanalysis of prior phenotyping data may yield useful new pieces of information about QTLs..
