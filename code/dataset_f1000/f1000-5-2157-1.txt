This manuscript describes a novel way to display large-scale data, including (but not limited to) data with a clear relation to neuroinformatics, with the goal of increasing the utility of complex multi-modal data. This is a relevant topic for neuroinformatics and neuroimaging, as it ensures that data accessibility advances in the same pace as the possibilities of data acquisition, data analysis, and data storage do. This manuscript is well written and provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the capabilities and logistics of one particular display system which is suitable to investigate functional or structural neuroimaging data and to compare changes over time. For these reasons, this manuscript will be relevant and interesting to the readership of F1000Research and I recommend its indexing after some minor technical points have been addressed (see below). Minor recommended changes: 1) The very first citation ("Katal et al. , 2015"; paragraph 1, line 4) does not contain a hyperlink. The same is true for the citation "Bakshi et al. , 2008" in the first paragraph of the Case Study section. 2) The abbreviation CAVE should be explained at its first instance in the text (5th paragraph)
