I believe the protocol presented is interesting and will be able to provide important information on which technique may have advantages to address discal herniation with surgical indication. The objectives and assessment criteria are clear and consistent. The assessment covers the main points of clinical practice when we think of the results. The limitations and difficulties of the study are not small. The lack of control over information and aspects of surgery as pointed out by the authors can actually hinder the interpretation of results. It would be interesting to have a profile on surgeons in both groups. It seems to me microdiscectomy is preferred by younger surgeons. This and other factors related to surgery may influence the results. Other comparative reviews show few differences between the techniques. Several factors related to patients, indications and technique are involved and it is difficult to understand the importance of each. Furthermore preference, training and experience of each surgeon still overlaps the data from the studies. Even with great care to obtain and evaluate data such studies may have little influence on surgeons' treatment decisions.
