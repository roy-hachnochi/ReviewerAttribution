The authors have designed a study to investigate the difference in outcome between microdiscectomy and open discectomy as treatments for lumbar disc herniation. Microdiscectomy refers to a discectomy with the use of magnification (microscope or loupes) and open discectomy refers to a discectomy without the use of magnification. This is a real-world, large, observational study using data from 2006 to 2014 from the national spine registry in Norway. The study is well designed, will have a high degree of external validity and can approximate the strength of a randomized controlled trial; the authors will include propensity score matching to reduce the potential bias of a range of baseline co-variables. Previous retrospective and prospective observational studies of microdiscectomy versus open discectomy have landed on both sides of the fence. However, three randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated any superiority between the two operative techniques 1 - 3 . In an updated Cochrane review from 2007 4 , it was argued that microdiscectomy and open discectomy are both gold standard treatments for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation. Nonetheless, contemporary use of microdiscectomy or open discectomy is probably relatively independent of the accumulated scientific evidence, and to a larger extent reliant on the training and expertise of the surgeon, as well as the availability and quality of visual augmentation systems. We feel that this study is a little like documenting the need for binoculars in birdwatching. An experienced birdwatcher may identify nearly every species without binoculars, but for some reason they all use binoculars; they can simply see much better. We can agree that there is still a need for more and better evidence on the relative clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of microdiscectomy versus open discectomy, but microscopes significantly augment vision and – let us not forget – greatly facilitate teaching. For these latter reasons, most (if not all) major spine units worldwide utilize some kind of magnification. It would be interesting to know if the relative number of microdiscectomies and open discectomies varied over time, or if its simply a gradual conversion from open surgery to microsurgery. Whatever the outcome of this study may be, we are concerned about the interpretation, because we do not know why some surgeons chose not to use any kind of visual magnification. In the study period in Norway, most of the open discectomies were probably done by experienced surgeons (and some by reckless individuals), whereas many of the microdiscectomies were probably done by less experienced surgeons or surgeons in training. Including the identity of the surgeons in the data analysis could help unmask possible differences more attributable to the surgeon than the surgical technique per se . Visual augmentation devices are widely used, and microscopes are unsurpassable in the training of young surgeons. From this, and the accumulated literature in this field showing similar or minor differences, it is in our opinion unlikely that any positive or negative result of microdiscectomy will affect the way surgeons choose to operate lumbar disc herniations.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions I believe the protocol presented is interesting and will be able to provide important information on which technique may have advantages to address discal herniation with surgical indication. The objectives and assessment criteria are clear and consistent. The assessment covers the main points of clinical practice when we think of the results. The limitations and difficulties of the study are not small. The lack of control over information and aspects of surgery as pointed out by the authors can actually hinder the interpretation of results. It would be interesting to have a profile on surgeons in both groups. It seems to me microdiscectomy is preferred by younger surgeons. This and other factors related to surgery may influence the results. Other comparative reviews show few differences between the techniques. Several factors related to patients, indications and technique are involved and it is difficult to understand the importance of each. Furthermore preference, training and experience of each surgeon still overlaps the data from the studies. Even with great care to obtain and evaluate data such studies may have little influence on surgeons' treatment decisions. Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed.
