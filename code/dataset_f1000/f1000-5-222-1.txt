The article provides a proof of concept of a way to tackle some fraudulent techniques of manipulation of research data and protocols. According to the authors, it is possible to employ blockchain in clinical trials and other kinds of studies to deliver a time-stamped record of the protocols, preventing retroactive manipulation and offering a simple and affordable way of auditing and external validation. The authors tested such an approach successfully by using a study protocol from clinicaltrials.gov. The suggested strategy looks very promising and it would be great to see how it can be streamlined and integrated with CTMS and current registries in a simple manner. The article is well-written and has a logical structure. The abstract summarises the contents meaningfully, the method employed is appropriate and the conclusions are justified.
