The title is informative and appropriate. The abstract is well done and provides considerable detail in an elegant way that focuses on an original innovation for data security. The research article is a proof of concept study that explains the model and the rationale for why it is needed and how it will be fit for purpose. Blockchain improves and expands the role for trial registries or publishing protocols. The approach could be used for RCTs and a whole range of observational and experimental studies where registries are needed but do not currently exist. A blockchain provides a real-time time-stamped record of any study protocol. Security for data and time stamps that are secure and tamper resistant are a welcome addition for clinical trials databases as is one secure shared location for all trials registry entries. This needs to be flexible enough to register change easily and efficiently. The authors supply real data and it is feasible to accomplish this however for professionals with little time to spare the outside interface will need to be simplified and steps minimized to retain users. Somewhat like GOOGLE search on a white page. Only typing a word from one link is required and the search does all the background algorithm loading to accomplish the task. I am sure this will be the next step in the project. This present research can be replicated by those with sufficient IT skills and it fulfills a significant gap in research. Social media is full of information on security breaches, data fraud and altered protocols, this would be one way to make registering a valid protocol secure and to reduce concerns about trials transparency as research needs to be registered and reported. The conclusions are justified and balanced.
