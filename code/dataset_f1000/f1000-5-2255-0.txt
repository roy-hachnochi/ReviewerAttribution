This is an interesting and thoughtful take on the approach to DBS in GTS. Because GTS is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome with a variety of different symptoms (or comorbidities), it may not be reasonable to assume that all of these symptoms will be alleviated by DBS; to the contrary, they may actually appear to be worsening because they were previously being masked by the tics. As the author suggests, it is impossible to make accurate assessments of a treatment's effect without first appropriately classifying the phenomenology of the illness and/or symptoms being targeted. This article shows familiarity with the literature and clear writing, and is entirely appropriate for an Opinion Article. We add a few comments, hopefully to further the discussion. The author argues well for focusing clinical trials for DBS in GTS on one problem at a time, namely tics. However, as he notes, the great majority of patients with GTS have clinical features other than tics. Gilbert and Buncher (2005) 1 include this observation of multiple symptoms as one of several features that complicate performing and interpreting clinical trials in GTS. Focusing DBS on the most problematic symptom in each patient may even prove to produce better results than focusing DBS on tics. But we have insufficient data to make such a judgment. The issues identified by Prof. Hartmann highlight the critical importance of further clinical trials and of registering all DBS experience in GTS 2 .
