Professor Hartmann's opinion article is a clear-thinking and original critique of the directions that DBS for GTS is taking. The field is perhaps expanding faster than uncertainties are being addressed, partly due to the heterogenous nature of the condition and the possibility of several different surgical targets- variables that he surveys from an interesting perspective. I agree with him and Professor Cavanna that the practice of selecting modified surgical targets for tics based on comorbidites may lack a good evidence base, but the fundamental problem is establishing how to best to treat tics with DBS, including the prediction of beneficial effect for individual patients.The notion of DBS in GTS as an enabling therapy to allow conventional management strategies to be more successful needs further exploration and may prove an important principle.
