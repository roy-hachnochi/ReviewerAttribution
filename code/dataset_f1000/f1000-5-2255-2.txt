I found Andreas Hartmann’s considerations on the use of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for patients with Tourette syndrome (TS) both clinically sensible and thought-provoking. The article is clearly written and the take-home message is convincingly argued: patients with TS who are candidates to DBS present by definition with a clinical picture characterised by highly severe and refractory tics. Rather than considering DBS as a panacea for the multifaceted neurobehavioural spectrum complicating patients’ presentations, the focus (and expectations) of DBS should remain anchored to tic alleviation. From a practical point of view, it has been observed that the DBS procedure can have wide-ranging effects, however the approach of a priori targeting multiple symptoms at the same time (“killing several birds with one stone”) can be prone to theoretical and clinical fallacies. Conversely, it would be interesting to test the sequential approach proposed by the author by systematically assessing changes in health-related quality of life in patients undergoing tic-focused neuromodulation, followed by specific therapeutic interventions for the residual behavioural co-morbidities.
