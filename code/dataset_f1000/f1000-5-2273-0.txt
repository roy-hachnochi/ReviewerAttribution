This data note labels cuts in the motion picture "Forrest Gump" with starting time, three levels of location information, indoor/outdoor information, temporal progression, and the time of day. An automatic detection algorithm was also used to validate the labeling. It is very interesting as it provides an important tool for anyone who may be interested to study perception, attention, and other cognitive functions. I would like to thank the authors for their efforts and sharing this wealth of data. The introduction and data description including materials and methods are all clearly written. I approve this article. Minor points: It might be informative to provide to readers that among the total number of deviation of human labeling and automatic detection, how many were human errors and how many were computer errors.
