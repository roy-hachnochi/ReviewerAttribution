This Data Note presents a very useful (and labor intensive!) complement to the studyforrest dataset, providing additional annotations that can be used for data analysis: the timings of all the cuts in the movie, together with the depicted location and temporal progression for each transition. There are of course many, many other features that can be labeled in this movie, yet this particular set of features is useful on its own and will add to the bank of features already available. I have no major changes to suggest. Minor comments: would the authors consider publishing the code for the automated detection routine that they used to cross-check manual cut detection? a few cuts are annotated as locale "unknown_...". Is there no label that can be used rather than unknown? (I don't currently have the movie available to check these four cuts, at time stamps 4544.32, 4554.96, 4559.32 and 4561.56). Very minor comments: the second sentence in the Introduction, "What sets motion pictures apart from other dynamic naturalistic stimuli is that they are more likely to evoke time-locked response patterns in a larger portion of the brain while retaining synchrony across multiple individuals who are experiencing the same movie", is rather unclear to me, in particular the use of "while" which indicates a contradiction -- why would time-locked responses in large portions of the brain not be synchronous across individuals? typos: - in Materials and Methods/Shot start time (time) : correct to "Time stamps *are* provided in seconds *from* movie onset". - caption of Dataset 1: correct to "CSV table with depicted locations and temporal progression [...]" table 1: for consistency, maybe the column headers should be the same as in the actual csv file?
