The puzzle considered here is rapid evolutionary innovation, and Steven Frank draws parallels between the evolution of cancers and the evolution of language. Cancerous cell lineages must rapidly innovate in highly sophisticated ways to avoid being killed off by the immune system, and to achieve continued growth in an environment that is rapidly changing – including as a consequence of their own behaviour. Human language and associated cultural innovations appear to have happened in an explosive way that some have suggested is inconsistent with gradual evolutionary change. Frank suggests possible commonalities between these two phenomena, including how recursive growth may involve a ‘long fuse’ phase at which key innovation is occurring – perhaps invisibly – well before the explosion takes place, and how recursion itself may facilitate innovation owing to feedback of input and output. This is a compelling synthesis that immediately suggests many more questions, and I’m sure will stimulate further investigation and new insights. This article might benefit from the addition of a figure: an illustration or schematic showing how recursion facilitates explosive, innovative evolution. Also, for comparative purposes, might certain instances of stagnation and stasis be conceptualised and explained in terms of relative lack of recursion? As is my policy, I waive anonymity.
