Authors reported a case complicated with stone spillage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Perforation of the gallbladder during LC is a common complication and the incidence of lost stones during LC is not so rare. However it is rare that lost stones lead such a severe postoperative complication. So I think this paper is very interesting. However the authors had better concern the following points. Case report session is well written. Authors summarize the long progression in compact. I would like to know at one year after procedure how do authors indicate treatment options to patients and his family. Authors described a CT just showed swelling around calcification. However the patient was conscious of abdominal tenderness, and the cause of tenderness is assumed to be lost gallstone. I think operation must be considered as the best treatment at this point. Authors should discuss more about this point. During the period between 15 and 18 months following the LC, subcutaneous abscesses were formed. The patient was treated with ultrasound-guided incision and drainage. Did authors take bacterial culture? How about antibacterial treatment? Proper antibacterial treatment is important for preventing for progression of diseases. If done, authors should mention detail antibacterial treatment such as choices, doses, duration etc. The discussion session is also well written. However authors did not mentioned fistula with communication to pleura. I would like to know why the patient developed fistula. What is the main factor of fistulization? The position of spilled gallstone? Inadequate treatment for abscess? Just after LC, did authors take CT? Of course operation for removing spilled gallstone might be best choice for preventing fistulization when the gallstone was found. Is there any other choice avoiding fistula with communication to pleura? Authors should discuss about this point.
