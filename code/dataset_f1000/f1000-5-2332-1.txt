This paper is presenting the web-based mouse ultrasonic vocalization database. The aim and the methods of the system MouseTube are well designed and organized. My only concern is with how many users would be registered and how many calls would be uploaded. More users, more fascinating. Therefore the authors need to do other things to collect the users and calls. For example, DNA seq data should be registered if papers using the new sequence need to register the sequence first before paper submission. A such “obligated” system would accelerate the values of this system. If the authors can propose such things to the scientific committee, that would be fantastic. I believe that both the title and abstract are appropriate for the content of the article. The design, methods and analysis of results from the study have been explained and are appropriate for the topic studied. The conclusions are sensible, balanced and justified on the basis of the results obtained.
