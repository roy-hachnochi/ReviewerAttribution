My concerns have been addressed, and the quality of the presentation is now more than sufficient to understand the details of their methodology. It is an important article, and the findings here contribute to (hopefully) a larger, quantitative discussion regarding pharmacogenomic studies. Differences (both technical and biological in nature) in methodologies between studies cause differences in results (eg which compounds are identified as affective). The methodological differences might be important: although they can "deflate" reproducibility, they also serve to probe a larger search space (that is, each assay may be exploring a subtly different part of a huge space of compounds with specific bioactivity). Regardless, it is important to have the tools to have a quantitative discussion about whether two assays disagree due to "nuisances", or whether they disagree because they are fundamentally testing different hypothesis. This manuscript, and the software developed here, provide the community with important components to facilitate such discussions.
