I would like to thank the authors for addressing my earlier comments and adjusting their manuscript accordingly. The latest version presents a clear overview of some of the ways that Minecraft has been used in educational and provides context though reference to existing video game research. The additional insight into the authors' opinions are welcomed. I am happy to now approve the paper.
