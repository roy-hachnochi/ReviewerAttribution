The paper shows an inspiring vision of the copy number changes in the genome focusing on the "changes" more than on the levels of change. The underlying reasoning is that a copy number change, if occurs within the loci occupied by a gene, implies an alteration in the coding sequence of the gene. In addition, it is shown that these changes occur recurrently, i.e. the loci where the copy number changes tend to be similar in different samples with the same type of cancer. The methodology has been uploaded to Bioconductor. The stringent quality checks of Bioconductor guarantees the availability for different platforms and, in fact, the vignette is easy to follow and use. My main concern with this paper is the (lack of) description of the statistical method to state the recurrence of the copy number changes. Within the methods section is only stated that there are two methods (genome location and gene-level) but the differences between them or the underlying statistical model is missing.
