The paper nicely describes the generation and testing of a useful plasmid set that allows complementation of commonly used auxotrophic markers in the budding yeast system. The paper provides clear and adequate descriptions of their construction and therefore represents a solid piece of work that is ready for indexing as it is currently presented.
