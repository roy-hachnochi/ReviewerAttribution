In this data note, the authors analyzed and reported semantic conflicts in the movie “Forrest Gump”. This data collection has been well conducted and is part of a larger project named the studyforrest project. An explanation in few lines of what the goal of the studyforrest project is and of the rationale behind this data note would be welcomed. The authors mentioned that this data collection was conducted “in order to evaluate whether the available brain imaging data can be readily used to study this aspect of cognition” but it is quite hard to follow this sentence without information regarding the goal of studyforrest project and without reading the recent publications of Hanke and Ibe. As a more minor suggestion, we think it could be useful to add some references justifying the cues used in this dataset (see Attardo’s et al. , 2003). References 1. Attardo S., Eisterhold J., Hay J., Poggi I.: Multimodal markers of irony and sarcasm. Humor . 2003; 16 (2): 243-260. Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed. We confirm that we have read this submission and believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.
