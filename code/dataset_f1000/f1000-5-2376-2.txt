The authors adapted an in-vehicle device to measure driving behavior in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease. Data from five participants were collected using the COTS Azuga G2 Tracking Device. Results from this study suggest that this technology was able to accurately identify locations and travel patterns of the participants. Given the increasing number of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer disease and the important role that driving plays in a person’s life, this study has the potential to provide a measurement tool that can be used reliably to study driving involving seniors with Alzheimer disease. I have two recommendations for the authors to consider: For the introduction, can authors provide a little background information on the driving behavior of senior citizens with Alzheimer? It may be helpful to orient readers who are unfamiliar with this topic. As for results section, do you have data on under what situations, the alert behaviors happen the most frequently? If so, would it be possible to add it to the result section?
