The presented study is based retrospectively on a considerable patient population. This makes conclusive statements possible. Some questions need revision/to be answered: The time to recurrence of urethral stricture would be necessary to know. In addition, it might be interesting to see whether the specialist status has an influence on the recurrence rate. Have patients with laser urethrotomy been excluded? Overall the idea of a flow chart as a result of data analysis is excellent and worthful for clinical daily practice.
