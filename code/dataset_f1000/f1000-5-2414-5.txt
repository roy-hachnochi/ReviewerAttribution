This articles describes the addition of a new function to the extant rBiopaxParser R library. This new function converts a BioPAX-formatted pathway of gene or protein interactions into a graphical structure that is human-viewable. This function supercedes an earlier function which performed the same task, but was unable to convert all nodes and egdes in the pathway. This resulted in a loss of information. This loss is now remedied, however, with the new and improved function. I installed the package and tested it and it seemed to work flawlessly, although I didn't try anything fancy. I imagine that the new function is a significant advance for people working on these pathways routinely as it must have been frustrating to have missing data. My only reservation about the paper is that I was unclear on the point of the new function until I'd read most of the paper. Perhaps the authors could extend the last paragraph of the introduction to be more clear about why the new function was necessary and how it has improved the R package. Although this request is a small change, the article is confusing as it is and making this would be a big improvement.
