I would like to congratulate the authors for their efforts to compile such evidences required for the improvement of maternal and child health service utilisation in Bangladesh as well similar communities in neighbouring countries. I find the manuscript well structured and written. However, I suggest some editing for languages (please see highlighted and suggested in the pdf text ) for consistency and rearrange the quotations in the result section. I have also suggested to touch the situation of Antenatal Care service use by the women in the study area and briefly describe the existing government/nongovernmental structures available in the communities. I approve the manuscript to be indexed after the incorporation of the comments and suggestions.
