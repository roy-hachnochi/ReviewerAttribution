The article describes a COMBINE archive of a previously published ODE model (Calzone et al) of the oscillatory dynamics of cell cycle regulatory proteins in Drosophila embryos undergoing rapid syncytial nuclear division cycles. The files are stored on GitHub in 4 subfolders, containing the original article, model files, the figures generated from the simulations, as well as metafiles. The XML and CellML files that were originally published along with the article were modified, by adding metadata on the authors. Issues: There is a clear advantage to such an archive for publication of such models, reproducibility etc., but the authors do not insist on it. This type of archive could be added to publications, and provided by the authors, with a full documentation. This more general aim of the article should be more forcefully and clearly stated. We tried to open the model file available on github (XML) using COPASI (4.16) but some errors appeared. We downloaded the initial model from Biomodels and it worked. Same issues with CellML files. The link pointing to the website "bqfbergmann.dyndns.org/SED-ML_Web_Tools/" is broken, but if copy-pasted the figures are correctly displayed.
