This concise manuscript provides clear evidence that addition of quercetin in growth medium protects plants against Methyl Viologen stress (as monitored by growth phenotypes and decreased protein carbonylation) and that quercetin can alleviate stress sensitivity in flavonoid biosynthesis Arabidopsis mutants. The conclusions are sensible and justified on the basis of the described results.
