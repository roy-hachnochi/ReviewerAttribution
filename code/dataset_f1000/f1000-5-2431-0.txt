 Introduction 3 rd Para, Line 9 “The Xenorhabdus produce an armory of antibiotic compounds….” Can author define some names of antibiotic compounds produced by Xenorhabdus spp. Last Para, Line last 3 rd “designated “mursamacin”19 obtained from Xenorhabdus bacteria” Name the spp. of Xenorhabdus bacteria used. Methods Page 3, Phylogenetic analysis, line 12, (Nei and Kumar 2000), according to reference style name should not be included despite use number and this reference is cited in text but not mentioned in Reference part of the manuscript. Page 3, Bacterial fermentation, line 1, only one bacterial strain was used for fermentation what about the second strain mentioned in the manuscript? Page 3, Bacterial fermentation, line last 4 th , “These were heat-treated by autoclaving……” If these were further autoclaved, even after inoculation, the antibiotics produced might get degraded. Explain. Page 3, Bacterial fermentation, line 5 th , The ideal temperature for growth of Xenorhabdus spp. is 28 o C, then why 33 o C had been used for bacterial fermentation? Page 4, High performance liquid chromatographic analysis, line 1, “To identify the compounds…..” How can compounds be identified using HPLC only? This part is not explained well as per scientific standard. Page 4, High performance liquid chromatographic analysis, line 5, “Eclipse Plus C18; 3.5um, 4.6 100 nm….” Instead of nm it should be mm and C-18 should be written like this not as author wrote. How MIC’s were calculated? If my questions would be answered with full justification, I would give my full approval for this manuscript.
