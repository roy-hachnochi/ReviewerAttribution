Major points: Are the concentrations of Lunasin used physiologically relevant? Does Lunasin have similar effects on the progression of these tumors in immunodeficient mice such as RAG deficient mice and RAG/common gamma chain deficient mice? Comparing the effect of Lunasin in these two models, immunodeficient mice and immunocompetent mice, will provide information as to whether adaptive and innate immune cells are involved. Since there is a direct toxicity of Lunasin to tumor cells, it would be important to show the contribution of immune cells to the anti-tumor effect of Lunasin seen in the in vivo models. Minor point: Axis labels of Fig 1 may not be correct. Are those really % control?
