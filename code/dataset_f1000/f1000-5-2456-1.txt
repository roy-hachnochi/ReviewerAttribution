This paper tests male Kv4.2 KO mice in the Lashley type III maze at 60+ days of age. It is well-written and I have only a few comments. Were mice pre-exposed to the gelatin-sugar reward before the tests to prevent neophobia? The figure caption for Figure 2 is garbled and should be reorganized. Both groups of mice reach the same asymptote in terms of errors by day 15, so although the KO mice made more errors during training, they reached the same endpoint. What does this mean? What type of errors did they make? The first trial effect in Figure 2B occurs only for the WT mice but not the KO mice. Why should this occur? What was different about the first trial each day? Were mice food deprived at all? How much of the reward did they eat? When I look at references 14 and 15, there is the suggestion that the KO mice are slower to develop a spatial search strategy and use more procedural strategies. Is there any evidence of this in the Lashley III maze?
