This is a very interesting, well written and designed account comparing the accuracy and utility of genetic microbial testing as compared to standard microbiological culture techniques. All aspects of study design, methods and conclusions are well explained and defended, and should easily allow replication if comparable techniques are applied. I would suggest expansion of the study's implications in the abstract if the word count will permit this. In 2005, Vancouver Coastal Health in British Columbia reported transmission of meningococcal cases by sharing of joints, and perhaps this pathogen deserves scrutiny given its ubiquity in young adults very likely to be engaging in social cannabis usage. The legal analysis permitting cross-border transmission of DNA from cannabis material has important implications for greater adoption of similar analytical techniques, which certainly seems warranted given the advantages in accuracy in distinguishing beneficial, commensal and symbiotic microbiota from pathogens, and the speed of this approach to the issue.
