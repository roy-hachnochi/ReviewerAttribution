The paper titled “Validation of a commercially available anti-REDD1 antibody using RNA interference and REDD1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts” shows convincing data that demonstrates the specificity of the commercially available anti-REDD1 rabbit polyclonal antibody from Proteintech, Inc. (Cat. No. 10638-1-AP, lot #00019207). I have some minor concerns that would help strengthen this report if addressed: Concerns: Figure 1 shows data from two replicates using two separate shRNAs targeted to REDD1. This experiment should be replicated at minimum three times. Furthermore, looking at the raw gels can the authors clarify that these two replicates are from two separates sets of HEK cultures and transfections although they were run on a single gel? What are the other lanes in the raw images? Do the authors see any differences in specificity and signal intensities when blocking with BSA as compared to 5% milk? Is the knockdown quantified in Figure 1B statistically significant? Including a protein standard on the gel to emphasize the molecular weight disparity of REDD1 on SDS-PAGE would be helpful. Do the authors observe this migration of 35 kDa compared to the predicted 25 kDa in both the MEFs and HEKs cell lysates? What protein standard (source) was used on these gels that can be observed in the raw data set? Have the authors tried doing a secondary only control? This could help determine if the band they observe in Figure 2 KO cells is being caused by the secondary antibody. Figure 2 says that n=3 however only two gels are shown in the raw image sets. Can the authors include the third gel? Figure 2 raw data set shows two replicates that look like they are from the same blot. Are these from separate cell lysates and Western blots or was were these two replicates completed simultaneously?
