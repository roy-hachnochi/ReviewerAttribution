There are a few issues that the authors should address as they refine the presentation of this work as detailed below: The authors should refer to the data in Figure 1A, the characterization of the TIM-4-Fc reagent and expression of TIM-1 on the surface of these mast cells. Since IgE alone has been shown to affect mast cell survival, does TIM-4/TIM-1 affect the mast cell response to IgE alone? In figure 1E, the graph looks as if there is production of IL-6 in the absence of IgE (third bar from the left). Is this correct? The location of the flag tag on TIM-1 should be described by the authors. Do the antibodies against TIM-1 affect the ability of TIM-4 to enhance cytokine production? The reference to a small although statistically insignificant increase in IL6 when 4G8 was used is not appropriate to say, since the change is not significant, and not any larger than other changes that are not remarked upon by the authors. This statement should be modified. In experiments where TIM-1 is overexpressed in the MC/9 cell line, what is the ligand for the transfected TIM-1? Is calcium signaling affected by TIM-4/Tim-1 interaction? Is activation of Btk affected given the potential role of PI3K downstream of TIM-1? The statement in the 6 th line of the discussion starting with “Tim-1 expression alone could promote IgE/Ag-mediated NF- k B and NF-AT/AP1 transcriptional activation…” should be qualified that this is in MC/9 cells, which may not behave like primary mast cells.
