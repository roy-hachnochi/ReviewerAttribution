I think the revisions are helpful and agree that GWAS has not identified single genes that can cause Crohn's disease. The revised text highlights both this point and that the value of GWAS lies in identifying pathways that may be involved. So as not to dissuade investigators from studying the effects of disease-associated genetic variants, however, I think it is important to note that a small odds ratio does not mean that variants cannot have effects on cellular function (for reasons including functional redundancy and overlap as stated in my first review). For example, several GWAS hits have been shown to drive relevant in vitro and in vivo phenotypes, which - through their elucidation - have added to our understanding of disease: Nonetheless, I am happy to approve this manuscript, which I believe presents a thorough overview of the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and is an important contribution to the literature.
