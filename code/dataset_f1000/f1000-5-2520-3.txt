The manuscript is well written. However, I would like to point out that oxoG artefacts can also be generated during fragmentation of DNA by sonication (standard step in the method followed by authors). Given that only 71% of these mutations could be verified (the verification was not by an orthogonal method but the same sequencing technology), I am not sure if there are some residual artefacts in the final data set (even after all filteration and taking into account the fact that both tissue and blood DNA were subjected to the same method).
