Concerning a case report of awake craniotomy in patient with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD). The authors describe an unusual case of a rather complicated and rare pathology that needs an emergency surgical intervention during a night. I have no specific scientific remarks concerning the content nor the design, but I think that for several reasons this case should be known by large anaesthesia community. First, the number of patients with CHD that can be scheduled for surgery is growing so our responsibility is to know how they should be handled, why spontaneous ventilation is preferable than mechanical, for which kind of complications we should be prepared etc. Second, we can always discuss which drugs should be used in a case of awake craniotomy, is dexmedetomidine better than other drugs? Personal experience and a local policy should be respected in such case. What is notable is that the authors were capable to establish, in this short time and during a night, an interdisciplinary consensus involving all disciplines, which was probably crucial to handle this case in this remarkable way.
