The authors proposed a new Cytoscape App to generate random networks and compare them with real data. It consists of the most common approaches for network randomisation. Moreover, the authors proposed a novel method to generate random weighted networks. There are few implemented apps available in Cytoscape for this purpose, so this app will be very useful and simple to use in a well known framework. The manuscript is well written and clear. It could be nice and useful to have a figure representing the workflow of the proposed app, if it is compatible with the number of figures allowed for this journal.
