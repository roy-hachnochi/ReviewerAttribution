The serial PMCA procedure reported in the present work shows a highly sensitive amplification of the mouse adapted BSE prion strain 301V. The authors compared this method with the bioassay and underlined several advantages of the sPMCA procedure. The data are convincing but I have one restriction on the author’s conclusions. In my opinion they have not clearly demonstrated that the sPMCA amplification products (Amplicons) correspond really to the original strain. They can at least in the present version of the article show on the same gel a profile of 301V mouse inoculum in parallel with the PMCA products instead of showing the scrapie PrPres profile, which is not relevant. They can also determine and compare the glycoform’s ratio between the unamplified PrPres of inoculum and the PMCA amplicons. These parameters could rapidly give some information on the identity of the amplification products before having the bioassay data with the PMCA products (is it really 301V BSE strain?). On page 3, the authors discuss the advantages of the sPMCA method in bioethical terms. Other laboratories 1 have already underlined this point and they should be cited in this part of the present paper. And the following paper 2 that goes further on this point by replacing animals tissues with cell culture lysates for amplification of several prion strains. One minor point: please spell LDS on page 4, western blotting section. References 1.
