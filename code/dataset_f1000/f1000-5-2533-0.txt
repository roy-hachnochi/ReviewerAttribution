I thank the author for taking my suggestions into account. The added remarks, as the author rightfully notes, are included as part of the final publication. I think those responses are useful in contextualizing and explicating what methodology is being employed to perform what philosophers call an “explanatory reduction” of cancer, i.e., the methodology that gives “rate” a meaning, and within which we must distinguish rate and function. The response now provides a particularly clear illustration of how reduction proceeds in isolating individual processes that influence rate “within the background of many other often unidentified processes that must also be acting” (see Frank 2007). Therefore, despite the fact that version 2 of the paper did not change very much with respect to version 1, I approve the publication. Like the author, I am convinced that the evolutionary perspective on cancer here adopted will need to be put into dialogue with organism-centered dynamic views, focused on the dynamic stability (and loss thereof) of tissues, organs, and organisms. Indeed, I observe that the whole field of cancer research is moving towards more adequate definitions of cancer that focus on explanatory levels that are increasingly appropriate to the disease. Experimental and modeling works, and well as rigorous methodologies like those defined by Frank, are not diminished, rather, they find a context and a proper place that justify their explanatory power, as well and their limits and validity conditions.
