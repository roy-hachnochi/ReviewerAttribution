This article describes a new Cytoscape plugin called “dot-app” designed for the import and export of Graphviz files conforming to the DOT format for representing graph topologies, layouts and formatting. Graphviz is a popular set of open source software tools initiated at the ATT Labs Research that can generate or process DOT files. Many other software tools are using Graphviz to represent all kinds of graphs. The DOT language support visual features and attributes that are not currently included by Cytoscape network formats. There is currently no Cytoscape plugin for the import and export of networks to the DOT language. Therefore the dot-app plugin may be useful to convert and import biological networks, and might be very interesting for the large community of Cytoscape users. The article is globally clear, well-organized and logically structured. I particularly appreciated the efforts of the authors to explain the details of the conversion process and exactly what kind of visual properties are imported and exported, including the properties that are not supported. I would suggest minor improvements to the article that could make it more precise and valuable for the readers. Add a table for at least some of the main visual features and attributes supported by the DOT format and indicate which ones are supported by XGMML/GraphML. The sentence mentioning the differences in the introduction section is too vague. Compile also in a small table some examples of applications (related to biology or not) that produces or consumes DOT files. Here also the paragraph discussing this in the introduction section is quite vague. Minor comments: The reference to the JPGD parser do not appear in the bibliography. A few sentences on how to install the app in Cytoscape might be helpful.
