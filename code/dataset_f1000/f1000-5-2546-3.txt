In summarizing a timely and well-attended symposium at the ICE2016 conference, Leal’s opinion article also masterfully encapsulates the history of the Zika epidemic and glaring gaps in our understanding of Zika virus transmission. While still in its early phase, the Zika outbreak is a relatively “minor” public health event on a global scale, compared to other infectious and arboviral diseases, such as Malaria. But because of its astonishingly rapid emergence, especially in Brazil, its unusual damaging effect on neurological development of the human neonatal brain, its spectacular evolution since it was first isolated, and its sexual transmission and stealthy existence in seminal fluid in humans, this virus has “gone viral”, especially during the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Leal’s summary highlights important needs in the research agenda to combat Zika. All public health interventions rally around “source/vector reduction”, but the full array of mosquito species that are competent to vector the Zika virus remains to be determined. Recent research has added genetic approaches to the tool-box for vector management, but it will be years before these powerful options can be broadly implemented. A couple of corrections and editorial points: Consider replacing “conquering” with “spreading into” in the sentence: “ZIKV was silently making headway out of the Zika forest (Entebbe, Uganda), hitchhiking on humans, and conquering new habitats” (p.2). Change “91-” to “nine one-” in the sentence: “Additionally, she placed 91-day-old infant mice in a cage” (p.5).
