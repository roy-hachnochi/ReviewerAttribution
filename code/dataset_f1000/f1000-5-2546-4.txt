This opinion article is essentially a meeting report, where most of the speakers showed data indicating that Culex mosquitoes could be vectors of Zika. However, as pointed by Dr Leal, several other groups published independent reports with negative results for Culex infection with Zika. While the major claim of this paper (that the vector competence of Culex for Zika is still an open question) seems a fair statement, reading of the published papers do not provide an immediate explanation for the discrepant results from different groups. Of course, although experimental errors can not be excluded, data can be reconciled as differences in virus and or mosquito strains (or even symbiont microbiota) can explain the distinct findings from each group. If Zika transmission was merely an academic question, I would say that time would solve the question. However, this is a major threat for global public health, and transmission mediated by one or two species calls for very distinct control strategies. Therefore, I would add to this report that there this debate needs urgently to evolve in the experimental field, ideally as collaborative research, but at least with exchange of virus and mosquitoes strains, and rigorous comparisons of the methodology.
