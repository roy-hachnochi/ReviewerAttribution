The manuscript “Adrenomedullin 2 activates extracellular-signal-regulated kinase in endothelial cells via a protein kinase C α-independent pathway” presents an elegant mutational analysis of cellular activation by the enigmatic adrenomedullin 2. Endothelial cells harvested from PKC-α knock out mice still demonstrate ERK phosphorylation, suggesting that the current paradigm of ADM2 intracellular activation (ADM2 signalling occurring through a PKC receptor pathway) is not completely understood. While this work is limited in scope, it does set a foundation for needed work in this field. There are some technical and context specific elements which would significantly strengthen this research note. Major points: Which specific ADM2 peptide was used? It would be helpful to mention this in the methods; ADM2-47 is believed to be the more potent agonist compared to the -40 peptide. Perhaps it would also be appropriate to test both ADM2 peptides (both -47 and -40) for comparison. The abstract and introduction sets the context for this work by describing ADM2 signalling in cardiomyocytes, but this research note presents data for arterial endothelial cells. The addition of the same phospho-Westerns for the same PKC-α knock out mouse cardiomyocytes would address this criticism. The results section is clearly presented, but a brief discussion and conclusion to put these results in a physiologic context would again enhance the impact of this research note. Specifically, this reviewer could cite a review by Hong et al. (2012) where it is stated that the receptors that mediate ADM2 action are not completely understood (i.e. the authors results suggest that perhaps the calcitonin like receptor pathway for ADM2 might activate endothelial cells independent of protein kinase). Presenting an updated version of Figure 4 from this review would also further work in this field and put the results in context.
