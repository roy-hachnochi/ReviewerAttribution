The authors reported a case with hypomorphic IKBKG mutation of a 7-year-old boy with disseminated BCGitis and unusual Aspergillus infection, who was successfully treated and prohibited with INH and RIF, in addition to IVIG administration. But any evidence about molecular and functional defects were not shown in the table or Figures. They only described. I could not confirm the results. The reviewer needs some figure for them but not precisely. The title is appropriate for the content of the article. The abstract represent a suitable and attractive summary of the work. The design, methods and analysis of the results from the study been neither explained nor shown any figure or results of functional studies. Although the detail was not required, some figure for them are necessary. Conclusions are usual and no novel findings. The data shown in Table 1 is not enough to explain patientâ€™s symptom. More critical or positive data should be listed, like a sequence data.
