The authors described the study in a proper manner but a few questions such as how did they select the variables to represent ‘learning preference’ can be improved. For example, there should be proper reference on the definition of learning preference and how learning preference is different than learning style? There should also be literature support on how did the authors select the variables to represent demographic information (such as, why ‘age’ matters?). The reliability and validity of the administered survey should be included in the report. Overall, considering the authors might not came from educational background, this article can be potentially improved.
