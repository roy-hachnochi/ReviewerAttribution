This is an interesting case report of congenital LV diverticulum in the setting of Cantrell’s syndrome. The authors describe well the clinical findings and imaging techniques with echocardiography of MDCT and contrast angiography which confirmed the diagnosis. Advances in non-invasive imaging have played an important role in confirming rare congenital cardiac anomalies such as this. The patient underwent surgical resection of diverticulum, however there was no mention of treatment of the co-existing congenital heart disease, namely double outlet right ventricle, ventricular septal defect and transposition of great artery (DORV-TGA-VSD). Was this done at the same time? That the patient was well at 6 months review, does this mean that the major cardiac abnormalities were also repaired? If so, how did resection of the diverticulum impact or repair of the other cardiac anomalies? Secondly, in the “discussion” section (para3, line 1-3), the authors state that patients with a diverticulum sometimes present with an abnormal ECG, as did their patient who had right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. This abnormality is likely to attributed to the DORV-TGA-VSD rather than the LV diverticulum.
