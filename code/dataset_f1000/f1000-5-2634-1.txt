Chemical space networks are an interesting method to visualize chemical space and to analyse SAR of chemical series. Recently, behavior of CSN dependent on data sets and parameter settings have been carefully analysed esp. by Prof. Bajorath and co-workers. Typically the layout of CSNs is optimized for visualization purposes and thus, distances between nodes do not have a chemical meaning. Here, a method is presented, which takes into account chemical distance information in generating the network layout, which is particularly helpful in SAR analysis. The effect of the algorithm is nicely illustrated, first with a model data set and then with real SAR data sets. In addition, a comparison between distances in the graph and similarity values shows, that the design goal to reflected compound similarity in the graph distance is achieved. The publication is well written, clearly structured and adds an interesting, valuable feature to CSNs. Some small additions might be considered by the authors. Instead of referencing the target Chembl ID in the text naming the target might make reading easier. Is it possible to discuss the effect of network density on layout and SAR interpretation, esp. for larger data sets?
