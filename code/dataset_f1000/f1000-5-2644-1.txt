As a data note I think this is an excellent very detailed and comprehensive description of a dataset. I can find all the data in the public databases as described. I have only the most minor of quibbles: The breeding of the hemiclonal lines always confuses me, and I think it would help the reader if there were a figure describing this with different colored chromosomes showing what is happening as you go through the crosses. If I wanted a vcf file (or ideally gvcf) for the project is there one available for download. Maybe stick the data in fly-var? http://www.iipl.fudan.edu.cn/FlyVar/
