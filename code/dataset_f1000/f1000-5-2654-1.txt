The authors discussed many aspects in Falade et al . (2016) article but their explanation didn't convince me with their findings. For example: The authors focused on CO1 data and almost ignored 16S data. I was expected to see more figures to proof their points. "The evidence presented by Falade et al. is not sufficient to determine at least the COI sequence KX231778. The method applied by Falade et al. made it nearly impossible to fail ...." what is the right way in the authors' eyes. "The remaining COI sequences did cluster with other GenBank sequences in such a way as to suggest the remaining ....." At which level the clustering parameters were set to? It is a vague expression.
