The article “Intensive nutritional counselling obviates a weight gain in kidney transplant recipients with long-term graft survival in Estonia” is an interesting manuscript evaluating impact of intensive nutritional counselling on patients after kidney transplantation in the prevention of post transplant weight gain. Diet is one of the important factors of management of this patients group. My specific comments: Title and abstract . The aims of the study must be in the abstract. It must be more clearly described compared groups of patients. Please write the results accurately identifying periods of study. Article content . There is an error at the title of second column of Table 1 (“Body weight (kg) one half years...” Should be “... one and half years...” First study group at the Table 1 should be identified accurately (Kidney transplant patients with intensive nutritional counselling), as both groups of patients are” kidney transplant patients”. Explanation of results of Table 2: “Thus, there was a positive tendency in the change of the content of different macronutrients among all counselled subjects, although the directions in which macronutrients intake changed were not similar in males and females”. In my opinion, differences of males and females should be clarified in the text. The discussion is quite short. The results must be compared with data from the literature, or at least you need to provide the data, which are found in the literature on the matter. Discussion should be based on both parts of the results. Conclusions should accurately reflect the aims of study and results, so they must include changes in macronutrients intake and body composition in patients after kidney transplantation and long-term impact of intensive nutritional counselling 10 years after kidney transplantation on weight gain. Conclusions should accurately reflect the results of the study. In my opinion, the article could be indexed after the corrections.
