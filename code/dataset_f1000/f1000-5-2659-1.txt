This opinion paper provides an undated and practical overview on the properties of molecular hydrogen in musculoskeletal medicine. The paper focuses on the preliminary studies of H2 on musculoskeletal medicine, and the concerns over the general use of products containing H2. I sympathize the authorâ€™s prudent attitudes, which toward the hydrogen should be regarded as an experimental agent and not recommended to general use provisionally. However, I think this paper should also mention the long-term diving practices which high pressure hydrogen inhalation involved to prove the possible safe use of H2 gas.
