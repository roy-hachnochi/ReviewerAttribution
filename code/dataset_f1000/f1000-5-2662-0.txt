The title is appropriate for the content of the article. Abstract is concise and informative. The study design and the data have been structured well. The objective and conclusion of the study do not match though the title of the study is relevant to the conclusion. It is not clear if women with previous failed cystocele repair were included in the present study. Page 3, line 3 states: 114 patients of 119 patients completed the 12 month follow up. But the next line states that 17 patients (13%) did not complete the follow up - contradictory statements.
