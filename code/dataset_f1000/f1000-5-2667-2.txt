 The case report is interesting. The authors unnecessarily repeated several sentences and phrases e.g. in the Introduction section the sentence "X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder ...." has been repeated in the discussion section. Also, in the case report section the phrase "of the right knee joint". The findings of the whole exome sequencing analysis should be regarded as interesting findings because a causal relationship with X-linked agammaglobulinemia needs additional cases and animal studies.
