This paper offers a survival time prediction method based on a gradient boosting algorithm for a Cox proportional hazard model. The analysis of the Prostate Cancer DREAM Challenge dataset found that the prediction performance of a model built from all three clinical trials is much better than the performance of models built from each clinical trial. Major comments: Additional comparison with the prediction performance of the Halabi model built from all clinical trials and the performance of the models built using each trial should help to evaluate method PostCombined in more detail. And the description of procedures of the first and second winning teams is cessary. What is the test data to compute iAUC? It was clinical trial AstraZeneca in the challenge. The manuscript should describe the procedure of the performance evaluation in detail. Minor comments: Please explain the machine learning method used in this work in more detail. The threshold value of the feature selection should be described in the third paragraph of the right column in page 4.
