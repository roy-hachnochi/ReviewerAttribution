The manuscript describes the application of complex networks concepts to the problem of identifying survival patients suffering from prostate cancer. The manuscript is scientifically sound, and the conclusions are supported by the results. The author, however, should address the following issues raised below: How performance depends on the weight chosen to binarize your data? Note that this step may affect considerably the performance. Why traditional topological structures are not considered? The author should further motivate the combination of traditional and network features, as similar approaches have been applied in other contexts 1 , 2 . References 1.
