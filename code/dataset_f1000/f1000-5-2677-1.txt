The authors documented the strategies they developed and used to predict the risk scores (Sub-challenge 1a) and survival times (Sub-challenge 1b) of prostate cancer patients as part of their participation in the DREAM 9.5 Prostate Cancer Challenge. The paper was well-written with ample of details for each step of the pipeline, with very nice figures and tables. The models performed well and ranked well in the challenge. However, there are still some areas that need further elaborations: The authors mentioned missing data in the “Introduction” section. However, the data imputation techniques used to replace the missing data, such as the lesion volume in the ASCENT-2 trial, are not described in “Materials and Methods”. The reviewers would like to request the authors to explain what have been done to replace the missing data in all the clinical trial studies with missing data and the rationale of their strategies. The authors developed a “curated, ad-hoc, feature selection” (CAFS) strategy to identify predictors. The reviewers would like to request additional details on how this method selects the features, and especially on how the weights of different features are computed. Figure 2 showed the representation of each model and the variables involved. If the 6 considered highly correlated variables with patients survival (ALB, ALP, etc.) are already included in the first principal component (PC1) (which is used in 4/5 of the cross validation models), wouldn't it be redundant to have the same features included in the model? What were the considerations taken for this decision? Also related to the previous questions, model M4 was built with restrictions to not include PC1 which is claimed as the significant predictor. However, as seen in Fig 2B, this model still performed reasonably well --any observations or comments on this?
