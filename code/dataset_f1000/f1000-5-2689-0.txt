The article presents an annotation method, YeATSAM, that leverages the information contained in RNA-Seq derived transcriptomes. The method was compared with two other annotation methods using two organisms: MAKER-P (a RNA evidence based and ab initio hybrid method) with walnut, and NCBI Gnomon (a homology based and ab initio hybrid method) with chickpea. Although YeATSAM and MAKER-P identified same genes, there were also genes that were identified by only one of them (about 4,000 by YeATSAM and about 700 by MAKER-P), as well as genes that both methods failed to identify. Similarly, YeATSAM identified about 1,000 genes that Gnomon failed to identify. The article is well written, the analysis is technically sound, the tables and figures present the results well, and the conclusions are supported by the data. Nonetheless, I would suggest the following changes: Address discrepancies in the numbers reported, e.g., 20 tissues (in abstract, introduction, results, and future work) v. 19 tissues (in methods: 15 samples + four additional samples); 700 (in results) v. ~700 (in future work, and coclusions); ~1,500 chickpea proteins (in results) v. ~1,000 (in conclusions). Instead of approximate values report actual values. As the tool is designed to be used with other organisms (besides walnut and chickpea), make the method and workflow (Figure 1) independent of any organism (e.g., the input to YeATSAM is the genome sequence rather than the walnut genome). Figure 3 (b) can be resized without losing its readability.
