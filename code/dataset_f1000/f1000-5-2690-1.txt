The revised manuscript has been improved in several ways and now also contains information/data regarding the planned institutional changes in relation to the injunction against the FLSA updates. The manuscript provides an important analysis and it raises many additional questions. In relation to the latter comment, as I stated in my initial review, I believe it would be useful for the authors to clearly discuss policy recommendations related to the pay and employment status of postdocs. For example, the issue of some institutions recognizing postdocs as employees and other institutions not doing so is an issue that may require greater policy clarification at the federal level. What would the authors recommend in relation to this? Minor comment: The authors should check for spelling and typo errors. For example, “possible” is misspelled in the second paragraph of the conclusion.
