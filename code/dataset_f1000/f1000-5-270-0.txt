The authors have attempted to determine the phenotype of human brain endothelial cells in response to a pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. This study is of significance given the paucity of data in this regard. The data on the induction of MCP-1 in response to IL-6 are compelling. However, I have the following suggestions/questions to lend credibility to some of the claims the authors make: Even though the authors have discussed future experiments to study the response of other pro- and anti-inflammatory events in the presence of IL-6, this is one of the short-comings of the study. They might want to consider adding some anti-inflammatory molecules to the repertoire. This will also build a case for the type of signaling mechanism in play, ie classical or trans IL-6 signaling. In order to determine the effect of IL-6 alone on the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, VCAM-1 and MCP-1, statistics should be performed to compare all treatment groups to the vehicle. Currently, the effects reported are those of IL-6+vehicle (since comparison has been done to media control). This will be particularly helpful in reaching a meaningful conclusion on the VCAM-1 result. The authors should cite the serendipitous study mentioned in the introduction. It sounds like it might provide some meaningful background for this piece of work. The vehicle and its concentration must be mentioned in the materials and methods section.
