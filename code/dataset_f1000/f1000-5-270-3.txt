The reported observations are of interest, to understand immune to brain communication. Given the background of the experiments and the potential interest, I have two suggestions of further experimental work that would provide strong support to the authors claims: As acknowledged by the authors, if IL6 alone can elicit a response, this would indicate the potential expression of mIL-6R by hCMVECs. This needs to be confirmed, as its needed to understand the already reported data. The authors comment on the different inflammatory profile caused by activation from mIL-6R or sIL6R. Seems like the current findings just scratch on the surface of that response, and further analysis of pro- vs anti-inflammatory mediators seems a sensible complement to this study.
