This papers introduces a tool, named Disambiguate, for computationally separating the DNA/RNA sequencing reads of two species, like for example in case of xenograft samples. The tool takes as input BAM files from wide range of NGS aligners. I have made the following minor observations: The tool Disambiguate works on RNA-seq and DNA-seq data and this is mentioned for the first time in Methods section. Probably it would help to have this mentioned much earlier, like for example in the abstract too. In order to improve the clarity, to the Tables 1 and 2 could be added also the percentages where is relevant, like for example, "26157" would become "26157 (0.0553%)" and so on.
