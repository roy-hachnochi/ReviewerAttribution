The authors (including the new author J. Wollbrett) have addressed all my comments from version 1 very throughly or plan to address some of the more technical ones in the future. I want to highlight all the work the authors did ensuring that their paper is reproducible (they mention versions of packages throughout the text) and in clarifying their work (mostly updates on the introduction). I was able to download supplementary file 1 (an .Rmd file) and execute it without any problems or modifications at all using R 3.5.1 with Bioconductor 3.7 on a Mac (BgeeDB 2.6.2, MFuzz 2.40.0, biomaRt 2.36.1). The authors did a great job with https://github.com/BgeeDB/bgee_pipeline which I believe includes all the information needed for anyone who is interested in the Bgee pipeline. If not, the authors seem responsive on https://github.com/BgeeDB/bgee_pipeline/issues and https://github.com/BgeeDB/BgeeDB_R/issues which is a great sign. Thanks to their changes in the introduction I now have a better understanding of their anatomical expression enrichment test. I look forward to seeing how the community uses BgeeDB in the future and the use cases they apply it to.
