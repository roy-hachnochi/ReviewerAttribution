The manuscript adds important and relevant work on tRFs present in rat brains at three different time points. The methodology is well-written and able to be replicated. The results demonstrate that tRFs abundance is dynamically regulated in the context of age and that tRFs contain 7-mers which match 3â€™ UTR regions of relevant mRNAs. Also, the tRFs analysis have an added value revealing unannotated tRNA genes for multiple species. There are minor issues (indicated below): It would be interesting to add more detail of the criteria used to determine the expression level of the miRNAs that are compared with the tRFs. It may also be explained in more detailed how the authors selected the 5 miRNAs for comparisons. It would be interesting to show a table with the number of tRFs sites (single or multiple) per mRNA target since in the supplementary material it is difficult to see. Also targets regulated by distinct tRFs. The legend of Figure 4 mentions the yellow color that is absent in the figure.
