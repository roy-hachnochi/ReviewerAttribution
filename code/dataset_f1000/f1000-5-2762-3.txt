The author presents a criterion to choose the operating point for a binary classifier. This criterion is analyzed in term of the game theory. By using the mininax principle author proposes to use as classifier threshold the intersection between the ROC curve and the descending diagonal in ROC space. This operating point for the classifier could maximizes the robustness against some bias in the training set. I found some novelty in the fact to consider such bias for an optimal threshold estimation. The paper is well written and organized but I think also that it could be improved by incorporating some general considerations that helping readers to a better understanding of the problem and the present proposition [1,2]. In the binary classification problem one is trying to deduce the answers to new questions, rather than just recall the answers to old ones. In order to do that we need to train the classifier from question-answer pairs (the training set). This is called supervised learning, because it requires a teacher, knowing the rule, which gives the correct answer to the example questions. In the case here, the author consider score-based binary classifiers, which does not need such learning stage. Could the author put the problem in the context supervised vs. no-supervised? In the supervised learning context the classifier threshold is a parameter that is found during the learning stage. Training the classifier maximizing the area under ROC curve is an strategy for the classifier learn the training set. Consequently, the proposed strategy could be considered as a "learning rule". However, the performance over new examples is not guaranteed. Other point which can improve the manuscript would be to consider the ability of generalization of the proposed strategy. Could the author add a discussion in this sense? I believe that this manuscript is of an acceptable scientific standard, and that it will be of interest to a wide audience; however, the manuscript could be revised, as outlined above. References 1.
