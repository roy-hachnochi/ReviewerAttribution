This is an important study that attempts to reproduce results obtained with a putative Na v 1.7 blocking antibody. Na v 1.7 sodium channels have become major targets for reducing nociceptive signal transmission. Lee et al. (2014) reported generation of a monoclonal antibody that binds to the S3-S4 linker of the Na v 1.7 domain II voltage sensor, blocking channel activation and providing pain and itch relief in animals. Here Liu et al. used the publicly available sequence information to generate recombinant SVmab1 antibody. They rigorously characterized their antibody. Surprisingly, the antibody did not seem to bind the target immunogen, voltage-sensor or full length Na v 1.7 channels, nor did it block Na v 1.7 currents. This raises many important questions. The authors appropriately discuss several reasons that their results may differ from that obtained with the original SVmab1. The array of electrophysiological experiments carried out in order to detect rSVmab1 activity is impressive, but a few additions to the paper would have been helpful. The lack of activity for recombinant SVmab1 raises concern about the original study and it would have been good to see if an aliquot of the original preparation from Lee et al. acted differently in their hands, but presumably aliquots of the original antibody are not available to the authors. Clarification of this point would have been helpful. Multiple studies have identified the S3-S4 linker of the Na v 1.7 domain II voltage sensor as critical molecular determinants of the action of peptide toxins that modulate Na v 1.7 activity. Indeed, Huwentoxins I and IV and Protoxin II seem to target the very peptide region that SVmab1 reportedly targets ( Schmalhofer et al. , 2008; Sokolov et al. , 2008; Xiao et al. , 2008, 2010). Discussion of the mechanism of action of these toxins that inhibit Na v 1.7 might have been helpful. The authors generated a monoclonal antibody against the sequence putatively targeted by SVmab1. Because this control antibody did bind Na v 1.7 in their cell lines and this peptide contains multiple major molecular determinants of HWTX-IV inhibition of Na v 1.7 (Xiao et al. , 2011), it is important to know if the control antibody inhibits Na v 1.7 currents. Overall, this is a very interesting study. While it does not directly determine whether the voltage sensor of domain II of Na v 1.7 is a good target for inhibiting Na v 1.7 currents, it does raise questions about how the original SVmab1 antibody reported in Lee et al. (2014) was able to inhibit Na v 1.7 currents and if binding to Na v 1.7 domain II was indeed important for reducing pain and itch behaviors in that study. References 1.
