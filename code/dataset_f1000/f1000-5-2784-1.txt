This is a brief report on an in-vitro assessment which may or may not be applicable to earwax removal, hence the title is somewhat misleading. The test reported is of very simple methodology, of preliminary and partial nature, compared with other, similar in-vitro studied that are cited by the authors. There are not sufficient details on the new, tested agent. Clearly, visible disintegration does not reflect the cerumen clearance ability, certainly with little attempt to imitate bodily conditions , i.e. temperature. One cannot deduce from this succint report about possible safety issues, towards a possible clinical trial. I would augment this interesting data with more details on the "exploratory study in humans" mentioned at the end of the report, or accumulate some more data before re-submission. The topic is important and the authors are encouraged to review and re-submit their info. Reference should include the newly published AAO guidelines on cerumen removal.
