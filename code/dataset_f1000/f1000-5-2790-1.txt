In our first review of this opinion article, we indicated several comments and suggestions for a few aspects that required further attention. We see that the author has incorporated most of the changes suggested (either by us or the other two referees) into the article, and we feel it looks now improved. In our opinion, this new version of the paper is satisfactory, and suitable for publication in F1000Research.
