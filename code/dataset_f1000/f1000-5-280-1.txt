This is a thoughtful and timely piece, looking at the different communities of practice (CoPs) that exist in our HEIs currently and arguing that these communities must work together (despite the pressures of REF and, the potential-TEF, drawing them apart) to achieve excellence in teaching and learning. I think Tierney has raised good points, grounded in the literature around CoPs, concerning the need for 'brokering relationships' and highlighting the very real threat to HE without such action. Both types of practitioners are equally valued and respected in her discussion and drawing on theory, policy and experience this article forms a good opinion piece. It'll be interesting in particular to see what further study of the contribution and activity of learned societies in this area reveals.
