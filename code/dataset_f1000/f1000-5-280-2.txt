This Opinion Article raises a number of very interesting points about the inter-relationship between research academic specialists and those pursuing a learning and teaching led specialism. It highlights the tensions that may frequently emerge between the two and proposes the use of brokering as a way forward, in the context of the emergent Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), for universities in England, which will also have impacts and change behaviours in the rest of the UK and further afield. The author emphasises the value of enhancing relationships between these two communities of practice, and the role that Learned Societies, for example, can play to promote greater interchange of ideas and experiences between these groups. Without such initiatives, these groups which may also extend beyond single departments and across whole institutions, may diverge further leading to a paucity of student learning experience and the detriment of lost knowledge, skills and expertise that might not meet institutional Research Excellence Framework priorities. The rise of the TEF provides an opportunity for the imbalance of priorities between research and learning teaching which may arise, to be redressed for the benefit of all. The article explains the opinions stated well, placing them into the context of previous work. The conclusions are balanced and justified. The article is acceptable for approval, subject to the following minor corrections: 'teaching-focused' (Abstract, line 7 of pdf), 'community' (lower case 'c'; at end of para 1 page 4 of pdf), and 'teaching-focused' (para 3, page 4 of pdf).
