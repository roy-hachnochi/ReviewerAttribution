I think this is a very well written opinion article, which is underpinned by the relevant research in Higher Education, especially pertinent to the work of Eric Wenger et al. The concept of 'brokering' to bridge the gap between the different communities of practice is very important, especially in a time of tension between research and teaching. It will be very interesting to see, how this concept is transformed into reality through emerging examples and case studies.The article should be indexed as is without any further corrections.
