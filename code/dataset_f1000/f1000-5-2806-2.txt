This paper proposed a weighted Cox proportional hazards model (DWCox) to reduce the effects of outliers. Experimental results demonstrated that DWCox outperforms the standard Cox model. The proposed method is interesting. This manuscript is well-written. Major comments: Table 1 shows that the selected features by Halabi’s model (Halabi’s 8 features) and DWCox are quite different. A performance comparison the proposed model with a Cox model using Halabi’s 8 features would be a good demonstration of the proposed method. Performance of DWCox and a standard Cox model were compared using only simulated data. A performance comparison using real datasets by leave-one-trial-out CV such as Table 4 is an important experiment to evaluate the proposed method. Minor comments: p. 5 (in the above section of Eq. (2)): “sped up training” - “speed up training”.
