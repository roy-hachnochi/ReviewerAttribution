In this piece Cohen gives a masterclass to young scientists that our aim is, not just to accrue datasets, but to ponder, synthesise and then write something thought-provoking, challenging, elegant and readable. Here he considers a timely update/iteration to the Neo-Darwinian paradigm, proposing a model of evolution of interacting information, with pruning by entropic selection. The title and abstract are appropriate. His case is elegantly made, drawing widely on biological evidence and models to construct the argument. One might perhaps have wished in one or two areas for more detailed exposition of recent data in the light of his hypothesis: while interaction of the microbiota with host immunity is briefly alluded to, this has been one of the fastest growing areas in the past few years and surely offers food for thought. Also, any Neo-Darwinian reappraisal surely needs to incorporate space for evidence from environmentally-determined epigenetic modifications of the genome and impacts thereof on survival?
