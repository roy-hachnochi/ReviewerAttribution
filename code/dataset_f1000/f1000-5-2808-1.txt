This is a well-written, thought-provoking article that challenges the foundations of Neo-Darwinism and presents an alternative concept for the evolution of complexity. To begin with, Cohen argues that Neo-Darwinism fails to explain cooperation, biological diversity, programmed death and complexity, which we now know are all hallmarks of life on this planet. Although these phenomena appear to contradict the selfishness of Darwinian evolution, evolutionary biologists have attempted to reconcile them with existing theory, more or less successfully. The co-discoverer of evolution, Alfred R. Wallace, argued that a characteristic can evolve also because it benefits the group even though it may be harmful to the individual possessing it. Subsequently, evolutionary biologists referred to this latter concept as group selection. Recently, a number of prominent evolutionary theorists have come to see the body of ideas known loosely as "multi-level selection theory" as a potent explanatory principle. Selection can operate simultaneously at different levels of the biological hierarchy, including groups (cooperation). The most interesting and important part of the article is the concept of viewing life as the evolution of information. Information can increase by autocatalysis and be destroyed by entropy. According to Cohen, physical principles of information and entropy drive the evolution of life. Entropic selection operates wherever entropy operates, even in the absence of variant individuals, environmental constraints or competition. This is a novel concept. The paradigm-changing concept presented in this article raises many questions that should be addressed by scientists from different disciplines. How exactly does information and entropy drive complexity at the cell and molecular levels? How does enthalpy enter the picture? Most important, how can this novel idea be tested? Hopefully, this article will inspire an in-depth examination of Neo-Darwinism.
