Overall I thought it was a very good article with well presented results. Where it was slightly lacking was the Introduction - I would have liked more background on the different applications of this type of clustering in the broader scientific field. Are there, for example, applications in physics and cosmology? Ecology and the environment? Cell biology, neurobiology, immunology?? Psychology and sociology? A greater comparison to not hierarchical methods would also be appropriate here (or, alternatively in the conclusion). When should such methods be employed in comparison to simple clustering algorithms like Ripley's K-function or DBSCAN for example?
