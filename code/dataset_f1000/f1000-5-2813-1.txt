 Short synopsis. The authors describe an online resource for exploring disease-associated germline variants. The Cancer Variation Resource (CanVar) browser is inspired by the ExAC browser at the Broad Institute. Currently CanVar is limited to those germline variants that were identified as risk-associated in a study of 1,006 familial early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) patients published by the authors in Nature Communications in 2016. Overall impression. CanVar is a useful tool for mining variants implicated in CRC, and the authors do a good job at explaining how to use the resource. The authors also provide some background information on the underlying data, methodology and technologies. We have only a few minor suggestions as to how its presentation could be improved. Suggestions . In the Introduction, the sentence “CanVar has been produced by adapting the ExAC framework” is a bit vague. You could be clearer what is meant by framework: software? APIs? some or all of the concepts, and which? datasets? Abstract and introduction can be confusing (at least to the rushed reader, of which there are many) as to whether CanVar also contains or interfaces to the ExAC 60,000 exome data on top of the CRC data. This is clarified in the “CanVar datasets” subsection, but in our view this should be clarified earlier. For instance, abstract and introduction talk more, and earlier, about ExAC than about the data that are actually contained in CanVar; in the “CanVar website” section, links to the ExAC browser and to the CanVar website are provided side by side, which might lead to further confusion. Since both websites are almost look-alikes, readers might even be led to expect that both sites might also mirror each other. Perhaps, it would be better to provide the links in a more asymmetric manner. In “CanVar datasets” it is mentioned that each variant is annotated “with ExAC allele frequency data excluding samples from the TCGA”. Perhaps, a short explanation of why this has been done could be provided, as not all readers may be familiar with the source of non-TCGA samples in the ExAC dataset. It should be time to remove the “Beta” state from the resource. Bring it to a good enough state to warrant release, and then be not afraid to update it later with new releases.
