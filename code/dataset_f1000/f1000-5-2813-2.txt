The study of Chubb et al. presents an online database and software tool Cancer Variation Resource (CanVar), developed on the basis of Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAc) framework (sequenced exomes of cancer patients). The main aim of the database is to enable an open access to germline variant frequency. CanVar focuses on colorectal cancer, as it summarizes exome sequencing data from more than 1000 familial early-onset patients with this disease. Strikingly, the CanVar database catalogues almost 1.1 million variants and more than 100000 insertions/deletions. An additional advantage for the user are the data on associated annotations of variants and insertions/deletions. The information, which may be acquired from on the basis of the published database, may provide valuable information on gene variants and indels in populations assuming disease-specific context. The data that could be mined with the help of the present database may also find utilization in clinics, particularly in the context with mutational screening in cancer, which becomes to be routine. A sentence in Introduction (When undertaken by multiple agenciesâ€¦) would benefit from re-phrasing into a more reader-friendly form.
