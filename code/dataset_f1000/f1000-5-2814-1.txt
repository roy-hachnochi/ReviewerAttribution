The manuscript addresses three avenues related with the relationship between biodiversity conservation and food production if we are meant to manage our natural resources in a reasonable way to assure the provision of environmental services in the future. These ideas are (1) the importance of the conservation of the ample genetic diversity of domesticated varieties of plants and their wild relatives; (2) the food acquisition habits of the population and, (3), in my opinion, the strongest idea, the integration of the ministries of agriculture and environment into one single entity. The three key ideas are important, but they are not developed to their full expression, and do not connect clearly with the central theme of the manuscript. I suggest that the author develops the two first ideas more comprehensively, and go more in depth in the third, so he can round up the message he wants to convey.
