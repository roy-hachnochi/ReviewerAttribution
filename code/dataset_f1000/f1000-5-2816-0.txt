I fully approve this corrected version of the manuscript. Indeed, not all important issues could ever be treated in a single article. I therefore want to point out here that stigmatizing the so called “predatory journals” is quite unfortunate part of the competition for the scientific journal markets and a result of the counter attack of the big journals that are losing markets. Before some fair rating of the scientific journals would be invented, the only reliable criterion must remain the scientific quality of each particular article itself and the arbitrary and a priori discrimination of some open access journals or "predatory journals" abandoned. If the authors would agree, I would suggest that they express their opinion on this issue in their article.
