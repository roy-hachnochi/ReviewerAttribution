In the last review, my main concern was that survey data should be published openly in a repository. This has been done. I note in passing that additional value could be added by publishing a data frame of individual participant responses, rather than response distributions for each question, as it would then be possible to independently analyse data for the purposes of validation or exploration. The text has been improved in this revised version. The addition of Table 1 to summarise key concerns is particularly helpful. I am happy to approve this submission.
