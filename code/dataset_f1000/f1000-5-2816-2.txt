The title for this article is appropriate. The abstract adequately summarises the article. In addition, the article goes beyond the FAIR acronym (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), for authors and publishers and addresses FAIRNESS on equity and justice for patients, clinicians, academics, publishers, funders and academic institutions. This is an opinion and not an "opinionated" paper. It is backed by a succinct and balanced analysis of responses to distributed questionnaire and discussions with stakeholders in publishing , authors and editors. The conclusions are balanced and justified on the basis of the results. I have also made some additional comments to the manuscript. To see this, please click here .
