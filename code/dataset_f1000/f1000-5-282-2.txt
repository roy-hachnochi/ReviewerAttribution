 General comments This report communicates the details of a small, but not insignificant survey of doctoral students’ and professional scientists’ from the Medical University of Vienna attitudes towards animal research. The findings, perhaps not surprisingly, reveal strong support for animal research within the life science research community at this single institution, but importantly also highlight an awareness of the short-comings of communicating this necessity to the public in the light of recent political movements in opposition to research using animals. The data in reference to the use of a given medical treatment without previous testing on animals is particularly interesting and will contribute much to the debate. My sole concern with this research is the generality of the questions. For example, a distinction ought to be made in reference to the type and severity of treatment in the survey. Nevertheless, the data presented will contribute to public (and scientific) debate. The authors are correct in identifying the need for a more systematic survey amongst European life science institutions and professional groups that will inform this important area of public debate.
