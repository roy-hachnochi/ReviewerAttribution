This paper describes a pipeline tool, Cluster Flow, (http://clusterflow.io/) specifically for bioinformatics processing. Cluster Flow is well documented, and comes with many pipelines, and modules. Pipelines are built by combining modules. Modules define how to run specific tools, including the CPU and RAM requirements. The tool works by specifying a pipeline to run, which then creates a shell script that either submits jobs to a cluster or runs locally depending on configuration. Cluster Flow is designed to be simple to use, but it does lack basic pipeline features such as being able to automatically re-run stages of a pipeline. It is not clear whether parameters can be changed when running a pipeline. For example, selecting different adaptors for trimming, or different mapping thresholds for a short read aligner. While Cluster Flow is designed to be simple, it seems such a feature would be commonly needed.
