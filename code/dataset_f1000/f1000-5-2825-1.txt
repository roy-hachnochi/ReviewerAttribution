The article by Neubauer and Pitson compares two commercially available antibodies against sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2). They tested the antibodies for their performance in western blotting, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence using two human cell lines as well as MEFs. They concluded that the Proteintech antibody has better performance for immunoblotting while the one from ECM Biosciences works with higher sensitivity in immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Both antibodies are more specific with the human cells. The results suggest that these antibodies can be used to track the level of expression of SK2. The report has detailed information on reagents utilized for each protocol as well as the experimental procedures, and it is a starting point for establishing specific optimal conditions for other investigators. The article is well written. The experiments were designed with the adequate controls. The results are presented correctly and support the conclusions.
