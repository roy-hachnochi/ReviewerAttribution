 Usage of diclofenac suppository, seems to be an excellent choice, based on the results of this revelatory research, so I congratulate the authors for running a well-designed trial and obtained an acceptable scientific standard. The issue of non-anesthetists procedures, for any examination like flexible cystoscopy, is always the most common matter of concern about patients for the practicing Urologists. Worldwide there are many used local anesthetic drugs or substitutes transient analgesia, without much success in the best case or side effects to their use in the worst. However, the use of an analgesic which may be readily obtained from the patient while avoiding adverse effects associated with the gastric tolerability, for maintaining a sufficiently efficient to meet the requirements as a pain reliever during flexible cystoscopy, is not only necessary but also imperative. We will certainly take into account the fact that during both rigid and flexible cystoscopy, there is a potential of greater momentary discomfort when the stent is being pulled through the bladder neck and due to the length of the urethra. So, an effective analgesic, not only will help the patient to be well tolerated, it will give the advantage to the urologist to deal with more calm the cystoscopy. Moreover it would be interesting to know the authorsâ€™ feedback on the response of patients according to sex and age in the administration of diclofenac.
