Hoogstrate al. present a Galaxy plugin (tool) to enable a direct access to the European Genome-phenome Archive. The purpose of this work is to enable the direct access from the Galaxy workbench to the data stored in the EGA, whose access is restricted due to their personal nature (personally identifiable biomedical data). Such components are indeed a requirement to implement a user-level access to restricted data, and are aligned with the goals of CTMM-TraIT and ELIXIR. The proposed solution is simple, pragmatic and effective. The current limitation of this work is the authentication for users who have to share their credentials at the level of the Galaxy instance. It is very clearly explained, and I agree that this restricts the usage of this tool to small group or private instances. This very problem is however discussed by the Galaxy community (see https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/393 , https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/3121 , https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/3383 ) and hopefully solving it will enable such use cases on institution-wide and public Galaxy servers. One aspect I would like to see discussed, although it is probably a bit beyond the scope of this paper, is the implementation of the first analysis step (figure 1) of the designed ecosystem which produces the interpreted data stored into TransMart. Ideally, if the Galaxy system is used for reanalysis of the raw and interpreted data, one would expect that the "Analysis" use the same Galaxy workflows. It does not seem to be the case here, and I would be very interested in hearing what motivates selecting the alternative that was preferred to this solution.
