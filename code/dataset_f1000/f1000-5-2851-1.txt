Artimo et al. present a software tool to pre-process microarray, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data for server-based ISMARA motif activity response analysis. With the novel client tool, the data transfer from the user to the ISMARA server is dramatically reduced saving time and allowing to keep the primary data confidential. The developed client tool is a very useful complement to the ISMARA server. It makes the ISMARA server much more user friendly. The manuscript is well written with sufficient level of detail. I have two minor suggestions: The client logfile is replaced after each start of the client. It might be helpful to be able to access logfiles for each of the jobs individually as well as even after restarting the client. It was unclear to me to which genome version the sample data was mapped to. It might also help to state the species for the sample data in case a user does not read the GEO entries.
