This paper still does not meet a basic standard to qualify as original research. They have removed one set of gene sequences, and added two others gleaned from Genbank. These last two sets have low species coverage and have been published. These two sequence alignments are posted as part of the zenodo supplement without the original genbank accession numbers or other source information, making it unclear that these were posted by another lab.
