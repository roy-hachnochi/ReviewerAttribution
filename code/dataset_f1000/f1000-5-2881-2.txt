This study is a metaanalysis of available ctenophore sequence data. My thoughts largely echo those of the previous two reviewers. The methods seem reasonable (with the exception of the methodological problems with analysis of the Homiphora IPNS gene raised by Steve Haddock) but rooting with Beroida as the outgroup is inappropriate as no molecular studies have supported this in the past, key references are absent, and the English of the manuscript needs significant improvement. Available ctenophore transcriptome data could be used to expand sampling of the protein-coding genes. If that were done, a concatenated analysis of all of the markers used with only taxa sampled for 18S (so all taxa overlap for at least part of the alignment) with the addition of appropriate outgroups would be an interesting improvement.
