The report describes the process of selection of the UK-ELIXIR xxxx to be presented to the ELIXIR SAB. The report is very informative and being the first node that describes in detail their national process, it has the potential to be very useful for nodes in other countries. I have a number of suggestions of additional information that is mentioned in the text but not explicitly included. Composition of the Scientific Development Group (SDG) A figure with the time line of the process that could be integrated with the Fig. 1. The template used for the EoIs. The EoIs submitted by the selected resources (if possible) I also have a few other questions that may help to clarify specific aspects. Three training resources were finally selected but in the description of the UK-ELIXIR strategic items training is not described separately (Technical infrastructure for interoperability and training including standards). If possible, it may help to clarify what was understood by training in the strategic items and how it is different, or not, of the technical infrastructure. If it would be possible to give some additional explanation to some of the ' final set of criteriaâ€™ that may really help others. One possible way might be providing examples of answers provided by some of the applications. It is not very clear how the 'ELIXIR criteria for the selection of Core Data Resources' was incorporated in the process. Given the importance of the ELIXIR guidelines for future similar processes this point could be quite relevant. Finally, even if I realise that this might be considered outside the scope of this paper, what will be really interesting is to include a short explanation of how the selected resources fit each one of the selection criteria, at least at some level of detail.
