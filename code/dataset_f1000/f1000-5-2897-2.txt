The opinions expressed in this paper are reasonable enough. My main reservation is that those opinions donâ€™t go far beyond common sense, but that it is not at all obvious how to carry out these principles. As I said in my first review, preaching to scientists about what they should be doing is not very useful. Leading the way would be useful, but this paper does not do that. The modified manuscript does nothing to address my earlier concerns. So, no, I would not amend my earlier recommendation. However, it is possible that my objection may be out-of-bounds, given the editorial policies of the journal with respect to this article type. If that is the case, then I have no further reservations about the manuscript.
