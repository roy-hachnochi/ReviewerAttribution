I believe that the title is appropriate and the abstract captures the essence of this opinion piece. I’m emphasising that this is an opinion piece because judgement regarding sources and data would be very different. There is much that I like about this piece and one of the main things is that it puts out there a very important at present discussion: how we use indicators in research evaluation and how we can do this better (or at least in a way that doesn’t disadvantage the development of science). The authors are well informed about the state of play and have given serious consideration to what can be done. I also can see how the very practical proposals in this piece could be implemented and yield some results. My reservations are about the failure to reach beyond the ‘technical’ – this is very needed though probably outside of what the authors have set out to achieve here. This is why, I believe that this piece should be published and, possibly, scholars in the UK and beyond encouraged to take part in this kind of discussion. Hope this helps.
