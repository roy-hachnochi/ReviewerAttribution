In an opinion piece, Lin, Murphy, Taylor and Allen point out that: 1) researchersâ€™ contributions to their fields are evaluated for purposes of research grant allocations, career advancement, prizes, etc.; and 2) the quality and validity of metrics that underlie these decisions are not well studied. Lin and colleagues call for the development of a discipline that will improve the evidence and infrastructure with which science is evaluated. Their point is well-taken. The manuscript was useful (to me) in pointing out some references and links to initiatives that are now underway in this field. However, to tell the reader what needs to be done is much less useful than actually doing something. This manuscript offers some reasonable suggestions about steps that might improve the evaluation of science; the difficulty is that the article does not present any evidence of an advance. More than opinion is necessary to advance the field.
