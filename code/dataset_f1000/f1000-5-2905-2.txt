I congratulate Dr Munakomi et al for an interesting article. The following are my comments: The article is well written and highlights a rare pathological entity which may thought of in the differential diagnosis of large scalp lesions. A clinical photograph outlining the lesion would be interesting. There are no MRI images. Any large scalp tumor should have a pre-op MRI. If MRI images are available kindly upload those. English language editing is recommended e.g. instead of using the word ‘pint’ the word ‘unit of blood’ seems more appropriate. There is no discussion on the radiological characteristics of the tumor and its differential diagnosis. It would be interesting to have a tabulated review of literature of myopericytomas of the scalp. I would also recommend the authors provide a table of differential diagnosis of various pathologies and their immunohistochemical characterizations. Although the take home message appears to be a high clinical suspicion in order to prevent excess blood loss intra-operatively, the authors do not specifically mention any particular measures, if any, they took to minimize bleeding intra-operatively. A two week follow up is too short for any tumor and some discussion on how frequent (%) is the recurrence after complete excision and what is the treatment strategy for recurrences. Final Verdict : Paper may be accepted for indexing with the relevant changes.
