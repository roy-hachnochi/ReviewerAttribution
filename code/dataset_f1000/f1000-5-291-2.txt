In this short descriptive report the authors put their published Gene Expression Browser tool to work in arranging several thousand transcriptome profiles obtained from public datasets that looked at monocyte immunology. They were able to compare groups of monocytes based on phenotypic attributes and rank gene expression. The authors provide a nice summary of the technique and validation.
