This initiative to provide further clarity by stratifying 'Low Prognosis' ART patients into 4 main groupings is a valuable step forward in assisting clinicians and organisations considering clinical trials in such individuals. There is one point that I would urge the authors to consider in their future deliberations on this topic. If a patient in Poseidon Group 1 or 2 had a suboptimal response, following an individualised FSH dosing scheme based upon for example AMH, should this be checked again in a subsequent stimulation cycle where a higher incremental FSH starting dose is used, prior to categorising the patient in these groupings? R. Fleming has recently referred to the existence of an 'iatrogenic poor response' (ESHRE Annual meeting 2016 Helsinki, sponsored symposium). In his dataset, a higher FSH starting dose given in a subsequent cycle (within 9 months of the poor response cycle), increased the oocyte yield. On the contrary, ART patients already identified by low AMH to be 'poor responders' did not benefit from an increase in the FSH dose.
