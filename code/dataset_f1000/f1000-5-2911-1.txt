Five years have passed since the publication of the Bologna criteria for the definition of poor ovarian response (POR) 1 and evidence is continuing to accumulate to assess their employment as well as limitations in the ART setting. This has been recently encapsulated in a contemporary critical appraisal 2 . The POSEIDON group is making a sincere effort to introduce a more specific and higher resolution set of criteria in an attempt to guide the physician to most optimally manage this group of patients ( 3 and current F1000Research paper). There are, however, several reservations regarding the proposed stratification system and some clarifications that need to be made. Since age is perhaps the most important criterion for oocyte quality, embryo ploidy and therefore also prognosis, it is now used as a major criterion in the POSEIDON stratification, with 35 years being the age cut-off used. Thirty five years is indeed the age where both aneuploidy rates begin to rise, and pregnancy rates begin to decline in many large ART data sets. The choice of 35 years as a cut-off should be briefly explained and backed up by references. A large amount of research has established antral follicle count (AFC) and anti-mllerian hormone (AMH) as the most reliable and accurate ovarian reserve tests (ORT) in predicting ovarian response. Specific cut-off values of 1.2 ng/mL and 5 antral follicles have been selected for AMH and AFC, respectively, in contrast to the less clearly defined values in the Bologna criteria, ≤5-7 follicles for AFC and ≤0.5-1.1 ng/mL for AMH. How were the cutoffs of AMH and AFC reached/decided? The standardization of measurement of both markers is still underway. AMH assays are in a constant process of precision improvement and automation. It is unclear for AMH whether "one size fits all", for example, should two patients, one with AMH levels of 1 ng/mL and the other with undetectable AMH levels, be counseled and managed the same way? Furthermore, currently, a 36 years old patient with regular cycles and POR, may have the same undetectable AMH levels as a 50 years old menopausal woman. Ultra-sensitive AMH levels are currently being developed, and whether they will have a role in better discrimination and prognostication of POR patients, remains to be seen. Similarly, there is yet a lack of standardization of AFC measurements. The performance and resolution of ultrasound machines is being constantly improved, and standards should be set for optimal imaging requirements. The fact that the techniques for measurement of both AMH and AFC are still under development should be mentioned. The POSEIDON group classifies the retrieval of 4-9 oocytes as a suboptimal response. For many, including ourselves, 8-10 oocytes is considered a goal and a successful outcome of COS, in terms of both safety and efficacy, especially in young patients. Furthermore, Cai et al. 4 have recently demonstrated that similarly aged patients have similar pregnancy prospects after fresh embryo transfer when the same number and quality of embryos are replaced, irrespective of their number of oocytes retrieved. It is therefore questionable whether the range of 4-9 oocytes is again not too broad in terms of prognostication of outcome. The authors claim that the Bologna classification criteria have been unable to discriminate patient subsets within the POR population who could benefit from specific interventions. This is still premature to decide, as there are many studies based on the Bologna criteria that are still underway. Furthermore, a recent well performed multi-center study has shown that in normal responders the individualized treatment has similar efficacy to conventional ovarian stimulation 5 . Whether the same is true in the POR population employing the Bologna or other criteria has yet to be explored. The POSEIDON group also suggests that stimulation should be tailored according to "the age-related embryo/blastocyst aneuploidy rate" with the intention "to retrieve the number of oocytes necessary to obtain at least one euploid embryo for transfer in each patient. The corresponding references and nomograms should be brought and constructed, respectively, in order for the stratification to become practical and for clinicians to be able to proceed with its use. Having an euploid blastocyst as a goal may be too simplistic, since many (in some publications 50%) euploid blastocysts never implant. Do the authors suggest to extend embryo culture to the blastocyst stage, or just use having one blastocyst as an end-point for calculation of the desired oocyte number per age group? It is questionable whether embryos in POR patients should be cultured at all to the blastocyst stage, or transferred as early as possible in the cleavage stage 6 . The POSEIDON stratification aims not only to define poor ovarian response but also to establish the prognosis for patients. It is likely that by using these criteria more homogenous populations can be established for clinical trials. However, it remains to be seen whether the management and outcome of POR patients undergoing ART can be also improved by their incorporation. It is possible that unless we will witness major breakthrough in the management of POR patients, the lay definition "women who require large doses of medication and who produce less than an optimal number of oocytes" used by patient organization Resolve ( www.resolve.org ) will be as good as any stratification system. In summary, it is clear that the POSEIDON group offers an improved stratification for POR patients, which has the potential to improve study designs and fine tune prognostication. It remains to be seen whether the reproductive outcome of POR patients will also be improved following the new classification system. Perhaps it is time to set an international expert meeting in order to revise the Bologna criteria and establish new consensus criteria that would enhance both diagnosis and prognosis. References 1.

F1000Research 2016, 5 :2911 (doi: 10.5256/f1000research.11186.r19119) Dear Editors, We thank doctors Weissman and Younis for their insightful commentary on our most recent publication in F1000 Research (Humaidan et al. 2016). First of all, we are pleased to see that our colleagues agree in the fact that the novel proposed Poseidon stratification of ‘Low prognosis patients in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)’ is a “sincere effort to introduce a more specific and higher resolution set of criteria” and that in comparison with the Bologna criteria this new classification system offers “an improved stratification for poor ovarian response (POR) patients which has the potential to improve study designs and fine-tune prognostication”. Moreover, that this stratification system also has the potential to help guide the clinician to most optimally manage a heterogeneous and challenging group of ART patients. Importantly, the Poseidon stratification is based on the concept that although POR is very relevant, it is not the only variable for defining prognosis. In fact, the Poseidon group’s proposal is to move from a strict view of POR to the “low prognosis” concept. In particular, two new prognostic indicators have been introduced: i) the hypo-sensitivity to standard doses of gonadotrophins, and ii) the ovarian “quality”. The former is related to Poseidon’s groups 1 and 2 and is based on the principle of the ‘Follicle Output RaTE’ (FORT). In brief, patients classified as Poseidon’s groups 1 and 2 have an oocyte yield lower than expected and can be probably retreated with different OS regimens. The latter is based on the age-related aneuploidy rate, which might offer the possibility of exploring different stimulation strategies and treatments, including an oocyte/blastocyst accumulation program. As regards the clarifications requested by Weissman and Younis, we are delighted to have the opportunity to provide the answers to help the authors as well as clinicians with interest in the matter concerned to view the Poseidon concept in the correct perspective. Firstly, the cut-off of 35 years of maternal age is a generally accepted and well-recognized limit to distinguish the young and the ageing patient, as it overall determines the initiation of age-related changes in not only oocyte quantity (Ferraretti et al ., 2011; Ata et al. 2012) but also oocyte quality (Ben-Meir et al. 2015; Weall et al. 2015). As for the specific cut-off values of AFC and AMH set at 5 antral follicles and 1.2 ng/ml, we certainly agree that these limits are more clearly defined than those suggested by the Bologna criteria (≤ 5-7 and ≤ 0.5 – 1.1 ng/ml, respectively). For AMH, the best cut-off values reported in the literature are in the range from 0.5 to 1.1 ng/ml, whereas for AFC the values range from less than 5 to less than 7 (Broekmans et al ., 2006; Broer et al ., 2010; La Marca et al ., 2010). Thus, the cut-off levels used for the Poseidon stratification are well within the accepted criteria to define POR, but more clearly defined to make them applicable to daily clinical practice as well as research. Secondly, the Poseidon stratification classifies 4-9 oocytes as a suboptimal response, based on the results of the largest analysis until now including a total of 400 135 IVF cycles showing that live birth rates (LBR) within this population were ∼20–30% lower compared with women of the same age with 10–15 oocytes retrieved (Sunkara et al. , 2011). These observations were recently confirmed by Drakopoulos et al. (2016) in a retrospective cohort study involving 1099 women 18-40 years old subjected to IVF/ICSI. The cumulative LBR, i.e. the sum of all live births obtained in the first fresh IVF/ICSI including those achieved by utilization of all cryopreserved embryos available, varied as a function of the number of oocytes retrieved, being 21.7% among patients with 1-3 oocytes, 39.7% in those with 4-9 oocytes, 50.5% in the group with 10-15 oocytes, and 61.5% among the patients with greater than 15 oocytes. In particular, suboptimal responders (4-9 oocytes) had a significantly lower cumulative LBR (P=0.02) than normal (10-15 oocytes) responders (Drakopoulos et al. 2016). Whether or not this range is too broad needs to be determined in future prospective trials applying the Poseidon criteria. Thirdly, as regards tailoring of ovarian stimulation to obtain at least one euploid blastocyst for transfer in each individual patient – the new proposed measure of a successful ART treatment by the Poseidon group (Humaidan et al. 2016; Alviggi et al. 2015)- and the corresponding nomograms and references, we are happy to announce that these are on their way, and that a “Poseidon Calculator” is currently being developed, using mathematical and statistical models, to provide the clinician a useful tool to calculate with a few clicks the number of oocytes needed for each specific patient – also taking the results of the individual ART laboratory into account. Although it might still be debated whether an embryo should be transferred at the cleavage or blastocyst stages in the ‘Low prognosis’ ART patient, we are convinced that in a well-functioning ART laboratory blastocyst transfer is the correct way to go. Lastly, we concur with Weissman and Younis that like all other criteria set in medicine prospective trials are needed to explore the efficacy of the Poseidon criteria in each specific sub-group to evaluate whether the incorporation of the new stratification improves the management and outcome of low responder patients. Along these lines, we would certainly welcome an initiative to set a larger international board to further improve the diagnosis and prognosis of the ‘Low prognosis patient’.

F1000Research 2016, 5 :2911 (doi: 10.5256/f1000research.11186.r19119) Dear Editors, We thank doctors Weissman and Younis for their insightful commentary on our most recent publication in F1000 Research (Humaidan et al. 2016). First of all, we are pleased to see that our colleagues agree in the fact that the novel proposed Poseidon stratification of ‘Low prognosis patients in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)’ is a “sincere effort to introduce a more specific and higher resolution set of criteria” and that in comparison with the Bologna criteria this new classification system offers “an improved stratification for poor ovarian response (POR) patients which has the potential to improve study designs and fine-tune prognostication”. Moreover, that this stratification system also has the potential to help guide the clinician to most optimally manage a heterogeneous and challenging group of ART patients. Importantly, the Poseidon stratification is based on the concept that although POR is very relevant, it is not the only variable for defining prognosis. In fact, the Poseidon group’s proposal is to move from a strict view of POR to the “low prognosis” concept. In particular, two new prognostic indicators have been introduced: i) the hypo-sensitivity to standard doses of gonadotrophins, and ii) the ovarian “quality”. The former is related to Poseidon’s groups 1 and 2 and is based on the principle of the ‘Follicle Output RaTE’ (FORT). In brief, patients classified as Poseidon’s groups 1 and 2 have an oocyte yield lower than expected and can be probably retreated with different OS regimens. The latter is based on the age-related aneuploidy rate, which might offer the possibility of exploring different stimulation strategies and treatments, including an oocyte/blastocyst accumulation program. As regards the clarifications requested by Weissman and Younis, we are delighted to have the opportunity to provide the answers to help the authors as well as clinicians with interest in the matter concerned to view the Poseidon concept in the correct perspective. Firstly, the cut-off of 35 years of maternal age is a generally accepted and well-recognized limit to distinguish the young and the ageing patient, as it overall determines the initiation of age-related changes in not only oocyte quantity (Ferraretti et al ., 2011; Ata et al. 2012) but also oocyte quality (Ben-Meir et al. 2015; Weall et al. 2015). As for the specific cut-off values of AFC and AMH set at 5 antral follicles and 1.2 ng/ml, we certainly agree that these limits are more clearly defined than those suggested by the Bologna criteria (≤ 5-7 and ≤ 0.5 – 1.1 ng/ml, respectively). For AMH, the best cut-off values reported in the literature are in the range from 0.5 to 1.1 ng/ml, whereas for AFC the values range from less than 5 to less than 7 (Broekmans et al ., 2006; Broer et al ., 2010; La Marca et al ., 2010). Thus, the cut-off levels used for the Poseidon stratification are well within the accepted criteria to define POR, but more clearly defined to make them applicable to daily clinical practice as well as research. Secondly, the Poseidon stratification classifies 4-9 oocytes as a suboptimal response, based on the results of the largest analysis until now including a total of 400 135 IVF cycles showing that live birth rates (LBR) within this population were ∼20–30% lower compared with women of the same age with 10–15 oocytes retrieved (Sunkara et al. , 2011). These observations were recently confirmed by Drakopoulos et al. (2016) in a retrospective cohort study involving 1099 women 18-40 years old subjected to IVF/ICSI. The cumulative LBR, i.e. the sum of all live births obtained in the first fresh IVF/ICSI including those achieved by utilization of all cryopreserved embryos available, varied as a function of the number of oocytes retrieved, being 21.7% among patients with 1-3 oocytes, 39.7% in those with 4-9 oocytes, 50.5% in the group with 10-15 oocytes, and 61.5% among the patients with greater than 15 oocytes. In particular, suboptimal responders (4-9 oocytes) had a significantly lower cumulative LBR (P=0.02) than normal (10-15 oocytes) responders (Drakopoulos et al. 2016). Whether or not this range is too broad needs to be determined in future prospective trials applying the Poseidon criteria. Thirdly, as regards tailoring of ovarian stimulation to obtain at least one euploid blastocyst for transfer in each individual patient – the new proposed measure of a successful ART treatment by the Poseidon group (Humaidan et al. 2016; Alviggi et al. 2015)- and the corresponding nomograms and references, we are happy to announce that these are on their way, and that a “Poseidon Calculator” is currently being developed, using mathematical and statistical models, to provide the clinician a useful tool to calculate with a few clicks the number of oocytes needed for each specific patient – also taking the results of the individual ART laboratory into account. Although it might still be debated whether an embryo should be transferred at the cleavage or blastocyst stages in the ‘Low prognosis’ ART patient, we are convinced that in a well-functioning ART laboratory blastocyst transfer is the correct way to go. Lastly, we concur with Weissman and Younis that like all other criteria set in medicine prospective trials are needed to explore the efficacy of the Poseidon criteria in each specific sub-group to evaluate whether the incorporation of the new stratification improves the management and outcome of low responder patients. Along these lines, we would certainly welcome an initiative to set a larger international board to further improve the diagnosis and prognosis of the ‘Low prognosis patient’.
