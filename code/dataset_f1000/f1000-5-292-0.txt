This pilot study was performed in 40 patients type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and examine the association between circulating endothelial cell (CEC) levels and surrogates biomarkers of vascular damage (urine albumin, von-Willebrand factor antigen, hs-CRP, uric acid). Mean CEC levels were significantly higher (x1.8) than the normal population independently for albuminuria level and correlated with uric acid levels. Higher CEC levels have been already reported in severe renal disease (T1 and T2DM, CKD, Lupusâ€¦) and cardiovascular disease (ischemic cardiac disease, angioplasty coronary stenting or bypassing). CEC are considered as markers of severe vascular damage with poor outcome. The originality of this study is to identify that CEC levels are elevated also in normoalbuminuric patients with T2DM and CKD suggesting severe vascular injury despite the absence of significant albuminuria. Unfortunately, the predictive value of CEC levels either on cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease progression is missing. In addition, it would have been interesting to have data on endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) levels, which are markers of endothelial regeneration with vascular protective role. As the authors mentioned, further prospective studies are needed to define the role and the predictive value of CEC in T2DM and CKD patients as biomarker of cardiovascular and kidney disease progression.
