Novel pilot study demonstrating significant increase in circulating vascular endothelial cells (CEC) in stage 3 chronic kidney disease with and without microalbuminuria suggesting significant vascular disease in patients with normal albuminuria and albuminuria compared to historical healthy controls. Significant correlation was also shown between CEC and serum uric acid. This is a preliminary study and prospective outcome studies will need to be performed to demonstrate any clinical predictive power of CECs. This limitation the investigators acknowledge. It would be interesting to measure CEC levels in T2DM without CKD (normal eGFR without microalbuminuria) and follow them prospectively to see whether they are predictive of development of CKD.
