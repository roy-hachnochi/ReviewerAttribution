This is a study providing proof of principle for an approach to screening potential teratogens using the nematode model C. elegans. The small size, simple culturing methods, and genetic tractability of C. elegans make it useful for rapid screening of compounds for biological activity and for identifying genetic factors that contribute to compound mode of action. The results demonstrate the ability of the assay to detect compound effects on egg production and embryo viability. The authors might comment of embryo viability; the percent of eggs hatching is pretty low (generally under 50% even with vehicle control). Embryo viability on agar plates is usually far higher. A useful modification of the assay would be to extend monitoring for the whole egg-laying period of 3-4 days to measure total eggs laid and to measure the latency of recovery on egg production and embryo viability.
