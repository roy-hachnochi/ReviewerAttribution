I have gone through the article and I think this is a public health concern and I would like to thank the authors for depicting the timely problem in front of the readers. Definitely it is a good initiative. I only have the following comments to clarify by the authors: Title: The title would be more appropriate if make it in one sentence and more simple. Methods: Which area you have taken as urban and rural in the study should be specifically explained. Dhaka Metropolitan City and Upazila cannot be the same as urban area. Why has Dhaka been selected separately out of 12 random district selections? What was your denominator in the calculation of incidence rate over 6 months? Discussion: If you could compare the results (like study subjects affected more and the lightning circumstances) with other studies, then it would add more value to the study. ‘People living in rural communities in Bangladesh have a number of misconceptions including religious myths and superstitions, as well as social stigma attached to lightning injuries’ – why it came in the discussion? Did you get this type of information from your study? Conclusion: Conclusion should contain what you have actually obtained in the study. The others may be a part of the recommendation.
