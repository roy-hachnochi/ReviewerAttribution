This manuscript by Winchenbach et al described generation and characterization of a new transgenic tool to investigate astrocyte biology. The field is currently limited by cre recombinase driver transgenic reagents that show poor coverage and/or temporal control during central nervous system development. The current paper uses ALDH1L1 cre ERT2 BAC transgenic mice to address limitations in the field, developing a useful new tool. The data presented are technically sound and included the use of crosses with two conditional reporter alleles, single cell patch clamp electrophysiological analysis to confirm astrocyte features and inclusionary and exclusionary immunohistochemistry. The conclusions are supported by data and also highlight the utility of this new transgenic allele, compared to a commonly-used (GLAST-CRE) transgenic driver mouse, such that I think will be of significant interest in this new mouse line from the glial biology community.
