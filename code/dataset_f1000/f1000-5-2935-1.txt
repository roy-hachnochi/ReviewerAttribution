Thank you for giving me a chance to review the paper ‘Health communication, information technology and the public’s attitude toward periodic general health examinations’. I find the paper is interesting and important for health care. In Vietnam as well as other countries, there are an increasing number of smart phones, but there is low health care utilization. The paper shows that development of reliable IT apps is a useful way to increase the health care utilization. The title and abstract are appropriate. The study design is well described. Overall, the paper is well written. I would like to suggest this paper for indexing. Best regards, Cuong
