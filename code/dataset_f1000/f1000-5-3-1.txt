Drs. Zukiwsky, Tun and Desai has described ischemia as a potential complication of mesenteric biopsy. This certainly highlights the need to be cautious in performing what might be considered a minor procedure. I do have 2 requests: Can they be more descriptive in how the actual excisional biopsy was done - was there an attempt to identify the vascular supply to the nearby structures? Can they suggest ways of preventing ischemic injuries while performing similar procedure?
