The authors of this article have collected several gene expression datasets, related with the development of the human placenta and associated pathologies, from the public database Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to analyze them in the context of a web application known as Gene Expression Browser (GXB) platform. This web tool provides a graphical interface to search and visualize gene status across different datasets. The collection of datasets presented on this article makes this platform particularly useful to gather information about transcriptome profiles related to human placenta and associated pathologies. Undoubtedly, this tool allows fast searching of a gene of interest on those datasets, which could facilitate visualization of results from the corresponding studies and helps in manuscripts or grants writing. There is no information on this manuscript about the statistical analysis followed to rank the genes on each dataset but it refers to the publication that details the GXB software 1 . Here, it is specified that genes are ranked according their differential expression using the limma package, and the links to the R scripts are showed. However, the application should include the information about the normalization/background correction methods used on each dataset. Different methods could yield different expression measures 2 and so modify the gene ranking. Also, comparisons of gene expression across studies could be a powerful feature of this program, but for that is necessary to apply a method to remove batch effects. Another suggestion is to extend the verification of the datasets including genes that are known to be deregulated in placental pathologies --such as LEP up-regulation in preeclamptic placenta 3 , 4 --. An explanation about these genes along with graphs obtained from the web application could be useful for the reader as an example of its utility. Finally, the application should include the date of the last update. Obviously, new placenta-related datasets might be uploaded into the GEO database and so they should be added to the collection.
