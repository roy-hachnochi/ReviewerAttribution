I read the article with great interest. Lipid metabolites play a role in the pathophysiology of asthma and their changes during different stimuli are of interest. The critical point of the article is that the EBC 11β-PGF 2α levels were below the lower detection limit of the ELISA kit used in the study. Thus, the authors can simply not conclude on the results as they might have experienced changes and differences on variations of zero (distilled water)... To resolve this crucial error, I recommend concentrating the sample (i.e. vacuum evaporation), or adding a known concentration of standard to each sample to overcome the detection limit. The article is too short. Methodology of EBC collection is extremely variable, and to compare results with external findings, EBC methodology needs to be decribed in more detail.
