Antibody has been widely used in bio-research fields, and discrepancies among publications using antibodies from different vendors are frequently observed. The main reason is the specificity of antibodies used by different researchers. This article described a siRNA knockdown strategy to validate the specificity of antibodies, which provides a negative control that may serve as an alternative way to exclude non-specific antibodies. This strategy may, at least partially, solve the irreproducible results among researches using antibodies as detecting reagents.
