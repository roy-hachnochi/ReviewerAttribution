Summary: In this study, the authors investigate the expression of Wg and the activation of Wg signaling in the Drosophila intestine. They find that wingless is expressed in the pylorus, consistent with previous studies, and also sporadically by diploid cells throughout the midgut epithelium. However, in contrast with other studies, they do not observe Wg expression in the visceral muscle. The source of wingless in the intestine has been investigated in multiple studies now and appears to be a vexing problem. The reason for the inconsistency between the studies remains unclear, but this study will contribute to the overall effort in the field to find the answer. In addition, we find their observation that Wingless signaling is activated sporadically to be an interesting and understudied aspect of wingless signaling in this tissue. Comments: Figures 1A and B show results from two methods of detecting Wg expression in the pylorus (antibody stain and Wg-Gal4 UAS-GFP) but the differences in the presentation of the tissue in the two experiments make it difficult to compare the results. The Wg-Gal4 image is at a lower magnification and the relevant section of the tissue is not well centered in the panel. Comparable images for these two approaches should be provided. Referring to these same panels, the authors contrast their findings to those reported in Tian, et al 2016, but we cannot see any apparent contradiction between these two studies. From the images presented, it would seem that approximately 3-4 rows of cells anterior to the pylorus express wingless as detected by antibody staining (Fig 1A’ of this study) or Wg-LacZ expression (Fig 1I of Tian et al , 2016). The Wg-LacZ expression in Fig S1 of this study shows slightly more restricted expression, confined to maybe only 2 rows, but the row of lacZ+ cells in this image does not even extend across the width of the intestine (as one would expect based on the antibody stain presented in Fig 1A’), suggesting that this image is not representative of all of the wg expressing cells in this region of the tissue. More convincing images should be provided and the precise differences between the studies (if there are any) should be described in more detail. In figure 2, the observation that the frequency of clones increases between 2 and 8 days after temperature shift is interpreted as an indication that Wg is expressed intermittently, but this could also be due to the inefficiency of flippase. Even in cell populations in which flippase is expressed constitutively, all cells do not undergo FRT recombination immediately. Instead, FRT recombination seems to depend at least in part on the phase of the cell cycle as well as the stochastic nature of the reaction, resulting in an inconsistent rate of clone induction. Although other data in this study support the notion that wingless signaling is intermittent, it is important to acknowledge the caveats of this clonal induction approach. The authors state in the discussion “in contrast to Lin et al . (2008) and Tian et al . (2016), we observed minimal levels of wg expression in the muscle cells using different lines and methods.” But the only method presented was the use of the wg-Gal4, UAS-flp system for inducing clones, which is not the same method used by these other studies. In addition, muscle cell nuclei are not visible (even by DAPI staining) in the low magnification image shown in figure 3. Moreover, there appear to be no LacZ positive clones in this tissue at all whereas the segment of intestine shown in figure 2c (also 8 days after temperature shift) has several LacZ positive clones. A much more careful analysis is required, especially because these observations appear to contradict published work. To validate the clonal labeling approach, it would be essential to (1) provide images in which the muscle cell nuclei are clearly visible and preferably stained with a muscle cell marker; (2) quantify the number of intestines analyzed and provide some description of number of muscle cells observed and where they were located in the intestine; (3) ensure that the intestines analyzed contained the expected frequency of LacZ+ clones in the epithelium, as a positive control. In addition, if the images of wg-LacZ+ muscle cell nuclei in the published studies are wrong for some reason, the authors should replicate this simple experiment (i.e. stain intestines from wg-LacZ+ flies for LacZ and obtain high magnification images of the muscle cells in the same regions of the intestine that were analyzed in these studies) and incorporate the result with their other results into a discussion of whether muscle cells do or do not express wg. What part of the gut is imaged in Figure 6? Is this still part of the posterior midgut? In the assay using overexpression of full length arm to identify cells with active wg signaling, why do some cells express arm but not GFP, such as the cell just below the inset in Fig 7B-B” and the pair of cells in the lower right corner in these same panels? In figure 8, the assumption that “UAS-armFL is induced in all cells”, as stated in the figure legend, is inaccurate. In these experiments UAS-armFL is expressed within flipout clones generated by heat-shock induction of flippase. This would result in the random labeling of a subset of cells in the tissue and a clonal marker (such as GFP) would be necessary to determine which cells were part of a clone and which were not. The authors conclude from these experiments that the midgut tissue is responding to Wg signaling in a non-uniform way, but a much more likely possibility is that the cells with elevated arm signal are part of a clone and thus expressing UAS-armFL whereas those with lower arm signal are not part of a clone. A comparison of multiple cells that are all clearly part of a UAS-armFL-expressing clone (identified by the expression of a clonal marker such as GFP) is essential for this approach.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This article addresses a topic of interest (Wnt signalling in the Drosophila gut), and brings new, relevant data to an issue that has remained controversial despite numerous publications. The article is well written, includes a complete up-to-date introduction, and the data that are shown are good quality and believable. Indeed the various methods employed to assess the spatio-temporal patterns of Wnt signalling in this organ are ingenious. Interest from the field is documented by the large number of internet hits already sustained (307). Notwithstanding these strengths, the paper has some notable weaknesses that should really be addressed before it is finalized for indexing. First of all, it needs to be said that there is no data on Wnt function in this paper, and this is a limitation. Secondly, the two assays used to assess Wg activity, namely fz3-RFP expression and Arm stabilization, are not validated with the necessary controls. Although references are cited that support the accuracy of these markers, these references looked in different cell types and so controls in the gut still need to be done. The obvious controls would involve increasing or decreasing Wg expression and seeing increases or decreases in the activity reporters. Finally, the authors need to note that Wg is not the only Wnt expressed in the fly intestine, and so some of the activity patterns might be due to other ligands.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Summary: It was previously shown that Wingless (Wg)/Wnt signaling is required for the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) during development and tissue homeostasis. In this study, the authors examine the expression pattern of Wg ligand and the activation of Wg signaling in the posterior midgut of adult Drosophila . Consistent with previous studies, they find that Wg is expressed in the pylorus, but also sporadically in the diploid cells in the midgut epithelium. For unknown reason, they do not observe Wg expression in the visceral muscles (VMs), which is different from previous reports (Lin et al., 2008; Takashima et al., 2008; Tian et al., 2016). Their observation complicates the expression pattern of Wg in adult posterior midgut. They should carefully examine Wg expression in the visceral muscles. Nevertheless, their examination of Wg expression and signaling activation in adult posterior midgut will contribute to the overall effort of understanding the function of Wnt signaling in stem cell biology and tissue homeostasis control. Comments: The panels in Figure 1 are randomly arranged. The panels should be uniformly arranged with the pylorus to the right side. Same rule should be applied for other Figure. Higher magnification of Fig. 1B is required to better compare Wg expression with Fig.1A. It is very difficult to compare between the Wg antibody staining and wgGFP results. The authors examine flies expressing a membrane-tethered form of Wg (NRT-Wg) using anti-Wg antibody staining, and claim that “Anti-Wg again showed high Wg signals at the pylorus, with no obvious signaling gradient (Fig. 1E)”. They do not detect the signaling activation of Wg in this experiment, thereby it should be more proper to state “with no obvious Wg protein gradient”. Furthermore, the immunofluorescent intensity of Wg staining in Fig.1E is weaker than that in Fig.1A, could the authors explain the difference? Did the authors use the wgKO-Gal4 line to drive the expression of UAS-GFP to compare whether the results they obtain is same as that of wg-Gal4 UAS-GFP ? Results obtained from wgKO-Gal4 line should be more convincing as this KO line faithfully recapitulates endogenous Wg expression. The authors do not find Wg expression in the VMs even though they use the same lines as previous studies. LacZ signal can be easily detected the VMs when wg-lacZ lines are examined. Can the authors explain why they fail to observe Wg expression in the VMs? Carefully examination of the lines they used, including wgKO-Gal4 (by UAS-GFP ), is required. The authors claim that “However, we still detected faint Wg antibody staining in midgut areas anterior to the lowest point of the Wg gradient, and we also observed low activity of wg transcriptional reporters (Figure 1)”. However, where in the posterior midgut is the so-called low activity of wg transcriptional reporters the authors are referred to in Figure 1? Flp-out system is used to detect Wg expressing cells. However, the experiment is not carried out in a strict manner. When the flies are put into the 18℃ incubator? Immediately after cross setup or at some stage after cross setup? The authors should specify it, as leaky lacZ expression is observed in flies raised in 18℃ for 13-20 days. It maybe due to the strong activity of wgKO-Gal4 , or just handling problem. If it is due to the strong activity of wgKO-Gal4 , the authors should observe the lacZ expression in the VMs. Moreover, it is critical to examine control flies from 18℃ at the time points of 2 days and 8 days in order to compare side-by-side to those of flies in 29℃. To further confirm that the identity of lacZ+ cells at 2 days in 29℃, it is better to perform Dl and Pros staining. In Figure 4, it is not clear to observe a gradient of Wg signaling activation using Dfz2-GFP and sgg-GFP. Lower magnification panels should be included to show whether a gradient exists, like Figure 5. Green signal (likely GFP) can be observed in the left side of the lower dashed box in Fig. 5A. What are those cells? Midgut epithelium or VMs or other tissue? Is it true signal? Interestingly, this signal is not observed in Fig. 5C'. In Figure 7, why do some cell shows strong Arm staining, but no GFP signal? In Page 7, the authors state that “Global arm overexpression suggests that cells in the midgut tissue respond to Wg signalling asynchronously. Also, this forced global Arm induction appeared to perturb regular Arm distribution in the midgut....”. This statement is inaccurate, as the authors use flp-out system to induce clones expressing uas-ArmFL in adult flies, which could only randomly result in a subset, not all, of cells expressing uas-ArmFL . Same phenomena as in Figure 7 are seen in Fig 8B, why some GFP negative cells show very high Arm signal? Closer examinations or explanations are needed. If the authors indeed can not observe the expression of Wg in the VMs after further trials as suggested, they should explain the discrepancy in the discussion part. References 1.
