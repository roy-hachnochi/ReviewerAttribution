Blazkova et al. describe an interactive web application that includes 34 different transcriptome datasets. This open tool facilitates access to transcriptome analysis in the HIV field allowing meta-analyses on transcriptomic changes in HIV infection. As strengths of the article I will highlight: The application is friendly and easy to use and allowed us to compare our results with a large collection of databases in a comprehensive way. The software allows searches related with a particular gene and how its expression is modified in different scenarios (infected vs non-infected, long term non-progressors vs typical progressors, treated vs untreated). The cellular types in which dataset have been obtained are indicated. Datasets included have been selected according to their interest and high methodological standards. For example, when contamination with cell types different from those initially targeted are detected the studies are not considered for the final dataset thus enhancing the quality of the results. I would propose some suggestions to improve this interesting tool: All the studies were performed with microarrays. It would be important to discuss if the inclusion of data using RNA-seq approaches and the current units used in these studies (FPKMs, RPKMs,TPMs) could be incorporated in the future. It should be clarified if the results among the different studies are normalized or just described with the units used in each study. If data normalization has been performed it would important to describe how it was done. Overall it represents an important effort that can be useful for many researchers working in the field of HIV genetics and pathogenesis.
