In this interesting article, Blazkova and colleagues describe the development of an interactive web application that allows HIV researchers to access a collection of transcriptome datasets relevant to HIV infection. The collection includes 34 datasets generated with human samples that have been carefully selected based on their relevance and quality control checks. This is a very useful tool that can be easily used by non-experts in transcriptomics analyses. I have used it and I am convinced that it potentially represents an important contribution to the work performed by HIV researchers. I tested the accuracy of the tool (not in a formal way) by examining differences in the expression for several genes that are well-known to be modulated by HIV infection. The results are clearly presented and can be easily exported to be included in presentations/publications. A few suggestions: I anticipate that the database will be updated on a regular basis. Therefore, it would be great to specify the date of the last update of the data set available online. Also, the possibility of adding RNAseq data would be important in the future. Maybe a brief description of each dataset would be useful too.
