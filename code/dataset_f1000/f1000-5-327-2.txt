The article by Blazkova and colleagues constitutes an important contribution to the HIV field. It crystallizes the efforts of multiple groups that characterized the host transcriptional response to infection by providing a viewer of data that are not immediately accessible in a structured interface. I have assessed the performance of the tool, and found it intuitive and user-friendly. It extends efforts of my group to provide facilitated access to gnomic data in HIV disease ( http://www.guavah.org/ ). I would bring two aspects up for discussion. First, that this tool should evolve to display RNAseq data = new generation sequencing data are increasingly available, effectively displacing microarrays. RNAseq is also easier for standardization across studies. Second, that users should be attentive to the subtleties of analysis: covariates such as gender, age, cellularity, analytical platforms and batch effects can influence expression profiles significantly. In-depth analysis may thus require downloading of original expression data.
