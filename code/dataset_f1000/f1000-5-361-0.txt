The article is extremely useful for intervention and operations researchers who examine a systemic innovation, have a successful proof of concept studies and attempt to upscale simple or complex interventions on a national or even a regional scale. The paper aims to detangle the thought jungle that accompanies this effort and give a procedural element to this effort. This detangling itself is a laudable effort and deserves to be indexed but it maybe an effort that is fraught with deviations in various parts of the world with different dynamics between innovators, end users and the decision making environment. It would be nice for the authors to identify those willing to use the NTT in different parts of the world to guage its utility in different scenarios. Within countries also end users maybe heterogenous so the limits of scalability in a particular setting need to be contextualized. It would be interesting to see articles on NTT use in a variety of innovations a couple of years from now. Secondly as soon as an innovation is framed, a concept which seems to be missed out in the NTT is the gauging of its life span. This requires information on the evolution stage of the condition for which the innovation is planned as also the stage of parallel competitive technologies or approaches that are being worked on to obtain the same or similar output. Perhaps this is one sort of additionality that maybe inserted in Fig 1 . The NTT would serve as a valuable checklist for both simple and complex innovations and looks promising as a reliable guidance tool. However the proof of the pudding is in the eating for which a platform may need to be consciously created to get views on its utility and the omissions.
