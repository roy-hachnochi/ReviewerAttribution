The authors report a case of prune-perineum, an extremely rare malformation for which survival beyond the perinatal period has not been documented. Only 2 previous case reports are described in the literature. The description of the findings is interesting and the illustrations are of good quality. The description of the surgical technique is short. If the authors were able to provide more details about the reconstruction performed, it would be of interest to the reader. It is not clear what kind of reservoir was created and how exactly CIC was conducted postoperatively. A detailed account of the findings and intra-operative decision-making process would strengthen the report significantly. The authors should be applauded for reporting the best outcome thus far for this exceedingly rare and complex condition.
