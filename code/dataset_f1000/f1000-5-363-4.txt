The authors present a very interesting and unique case report. Some questions that arise: Had the child had any renal imaging after birth? Was the urine leaking through a penile urethra as well as through the orifice that contained urine? This part is not clear from the description. The authors could assist the reader additionally, should this case ever arise again, by describing exactly what kind of reconstruction was done at the first stage. Was a true bladder found? Were the ureters implanted normally into a bladder? Was there a bladder neck and urethra? What exactly was the “orifice” that was draining urine? When the authors say they created a continent abdominal reservoir – was this a bowel reservoir to which the ureters were implanted? If there was any bladder present, was this used? This kind of case report is interesting and important since many pediatric surgeons and urologists may never see something like this in our lifetime, but if we do, it is very valuable to have some inkling of what is going on, and how we might even begin to manage it.
