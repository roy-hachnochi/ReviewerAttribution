Research and diagnosis of human tumours is based upon the analysis of small samples of the neoplasms, which are collected by surgical pathologist during macroscopic examination of surgically resected tumours. The study of Lopez and Cortes proposes a new method for tumour sampling for histological and molecular analysis, which could be particularly useful for large tumours (diameter than 3 cm) with high intratumour heterogeneity (ITH). Detecting ITH is indeed challenging especially for large tumours which cannot be examined in toto and this issue may be a limitation for research and therapy. The method suggested by Lopez and Cortes is essentially based upon a new multiple sampling strategy that could overcome some of the limitations of current sampling protocols. Their assumption is that usual sampling protocols (examining sampling roughly 1 large tissue fragment every centimeter of tumour size), do not allow a reliable evaluation of ITH, which could be ideally achieved with a total tumour sampling strategy (TTS) which is however not sustainable by routine diagnostic laboratories. Lopez and Cortes suggest that performing multiple smaller samples for each tumour collected from randomly selected multiple tumour areas would more effectively detect ITH. Lopez and Cortes defined this strategy as “divide-and-conquer” (DAC) and used a sophisticated mathematical modelling approach to demonstrate that it largely outperforms standard protocols with similar laboratory costs. The data of Lopez and Cortes are based on synthetic data and suggest for that DAC performs 94% in detecting ITH as compared with an idealized TTS strategy, but at a much lower cost. The paper of Lopez and Cortes is very interesting and it is an incentive to consider new sampling strategies of human tumours and should prompt additional studies using real tumour samples to verify whether these synthetic data reflect real life and if this approach will allow a more accurate and relevant histopathological and molecular analysis.
