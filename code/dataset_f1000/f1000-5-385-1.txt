This paper provides a very elegant solution to the problem of detecting intratumour heterogeneity. The authors show quite convincingly that, at least in their modelling framework, the proposed divide-and-conquer method can outperform the routing protocol, and even yield results close to the ideal, total sampling method at a small fraction of the cost. I hope this idea will be taken up by researchers who can test the divide-and-conquer strategy in the lab, and eventually provide a significant improvement in tumour diagnosis.
