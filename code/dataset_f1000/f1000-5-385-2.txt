In the field of Gynaecological Pathology, tumours are known for their heterogeneous histology which often bear a prognostic significance, either by unmasking areas of malignant histology in an otherwise benign tumour of by evaluating multiple areas in tumour grading. To illustrate this, I would choose two particular tumours where multiple small tissue blocks, as proposed in the article, would be of help. An example involving the first situation would be mucinous tumours of the ovary, while the second one will be immature ovarian teratoma, where the semiquantitave evaluatiom of the number of developmentally immature neural and endodermal areas provides the histological grade necessary for managing the neoplasm. This simple technique may be helpful with a lower cost in both working hours and laboratory material
