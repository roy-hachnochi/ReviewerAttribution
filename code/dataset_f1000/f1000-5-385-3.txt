The authors address the challenging problem of detecting of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), an important question in routine pathology with relevant impact on patient treatment and prognosis. Nowadays, pathologists follow standard protocols although current practice seem to be insufficient for detecting intratumor heterogeneity with high reliability. To assess ITH with high precision, the authors proposed a divide and conquer strategy, a very simple approach consisting in sampling many small-size pieces along the tumor. The proposed strategy has two advantages: a) increases the performances of standard protocols for detecting ITH and b) reducing the laboratory costs. To assess the performances of the proposed strategy, the authors designed an interesting statistical model and performed an accurate simulation. The paper is well written and fit well the spirit of the journal. I have only one minor remark. The procedure adopted for detecting ITH sites in the simulation is not clear. Is this a random selection? Please add one sentence to make clearer this aspect. Finally, I found the paper extremely interesting, with high impact and relevance on current patient prognosis and treatment.
