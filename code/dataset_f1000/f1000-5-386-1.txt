A myriad of software tools have been developed for the alignment of next generation sequencing data to a reference genome and for the subsequent genotyping of DNA variants. Evaluating the specificity and sensitivity of a variant calling framework can be achieved with a dataset containing validated genotypes. Ruark et. al. provide the ‘ICR142 NGS validation series’ exome sequence fastq files of 142 individuals, and a large set of corresponding Sanger sequencing validated variant sites and sites where variants were called by an NGS tool, but no variant was found with the corresponding Sanger sequencing. I found the NGS dataset to be easily accessible, on request, from the European Genome-phenome archive and it comprises paired end fastq sequencing files generated by an Illumina sequencing system on the stated 142 individuals. The Sanger sequencing dataset is available as supplementary table 1 of the manuscript. This is a useful resource for evaluating variant calling pipelines.
