Jaafar and Maweni are entitled to their opinion but I don't believe they have contributed in a sufficiently significant way to warrant being indexed. They provide no original analysis of their own; they provide a brief overview of contributions by other authors and they provide only a brief, cursory statement of "solutions". The proposed solutions in part reiterate suggestions of others but a more serious problem is that they miss the mark in how basic research is actually done. Productive researchers rarely replicate previous work explicitly. They build on previous work. To successfully build essentially validates the previous work but the point of research is to extend into the unknown, not to merely replicate. From this point of view, the emphasis on 'reproducibility' in their solutions does not capture the heart of the matter.
