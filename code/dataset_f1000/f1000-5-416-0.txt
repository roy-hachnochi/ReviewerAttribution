I understand the purpose of this report is the validation of the actin isoforms antibodies. Muscle biologists would like to hear answers for questions derived from this study. For example: What is a role of myofibroblasts appear in regenerating muscles and disease muscles? Does each actin isoform play a distinct role during muscle regeneration? Particularly, a role of aCAA in newly formed myofibers is interesting. I expect the panel of antibodies against actin isoforms will help future studies to reveal distinct role(s) of actin isoforms in muscle regeneration.
