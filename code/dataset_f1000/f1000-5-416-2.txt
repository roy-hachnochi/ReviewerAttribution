The paper by Chaponnier and Gabbiani reports the production of two monoclonal antibodies, one specific for skeletal actin and the other for cardiac actin. Being able to obtain these antibodies is a momentous accomplishment given that these two actin isoforms differ from each other by only a few amino acids. The authors rigorously demonstrate the specificity of each antibodies for their respective isoform by Western blotting and competitive assay with the immunogen. Because the antibodies are from different subtypes, they can be used by double immunofluorescence to investigate the regulation of skeletal and cardiac actin in different conditions. The authors provide stunningly beautiful immunofluorescence images that demonstrate the utility of their antibodies to pinpoint different cellular populations during skeletal muscle repair. It is to be expected that these antibodies will be extremely useful to studies questions related to cardiac and skeletal muscle physiology and pathology.
