The article entitled "How to put plant root uptake into a soil water flow model" by Dong is in general well written and technically sound. However when I read this manuscript, I just found it a bit difficult to read as most relevant information such as Feddes function was in a supplemental file. There were no examples in the manuscript either. In my opinion, if the author is providing a tool to evaluate root water uptake, several examples (more than one) need to be included in the manuscript; for example how the choice the model affect soil water dynamics. This fact really makes it difficult to evaluate the manuscript. There should be a sink term, S, that is used to account for root water uptake in Eq (1). Figure 1 needs to be upgraded. They get blurred.
