It is an interesting topic and the text is well written but it is requested some program experience. It is a technical report not fully a scientific paper. It gave sufficient detail information about this model and also some relative programs. If a plant root uptake model with plant growth process which can report LAI or other parameters for ET calculation was put to Soil water flow model, this is more useful. If some cases can be tested and compared with other models, it will make user to use it easily. I fully agreed that it can be published as so far and give more opportunities to test it.
