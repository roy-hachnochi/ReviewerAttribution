The text is nicely written and I have few minor comments as described below. Some references order is not cited correctly. For example the compensation function in equation 7 is proposed by "15" instead of the cited reference is number "14". Similaraly the rest of the citation numbers needs to be corrected. The author has shown the moisture flow equation (Eqn 1) without the sink term. Since the focus of this article is on plant root uptake, so sink term should be included in all the governing equations along with their discrete form. The figure 1 can be improved to make it more readable.
