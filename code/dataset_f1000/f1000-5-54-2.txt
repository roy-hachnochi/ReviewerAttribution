This paper suggest a quantitative approach for certification of ChIP-seq grade antibodies. This is an interesting aim and the authors point out several factors influencing the quality of ChIP-Seq data sets. In the paper they have retrieved antibody sources for 12036 datasets from GEO, and these data are illustrated in different figures. Using data from GEO they have also produced a figure illustration how different sequencing depth can be needed for different histone modification analyzed. The authors have also used 3 antibodies from Active Motif to illustrate how they can give scoring to a given antibody. However, if the authors aim to make certification of specific antibodies they should provide a more detailed and standardized protocol. Moreover, they should also comment why they choose to x-link 30 min in paraformaldehyde, rather than more common 10 min in 1% formaldehyde. The choice of kit for making library should be discussed, and also why they have used a not so common kit in their procedure. Also variation in performance between different lot of polyclonal antibodies should be discussed. It would also be interesting with a discussion of the practical relevance of the different grades from scoring for a specific antibody.
