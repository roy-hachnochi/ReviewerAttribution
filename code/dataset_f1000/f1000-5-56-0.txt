Sorrentino et al. have been highly responsive to my previous review and the article is much improved. I find the article acceptable at this stage. With that said, if the authors wish to further improve the article, I believe that it would be helpful to incorporate the details of the statistical analysis within the methods section and it would be helpful to include a table(s) summarizing all the results of the statistical analysis. I appreciate the authorsâ€™ responsiveness and I have enjoyed reviewing their work.
