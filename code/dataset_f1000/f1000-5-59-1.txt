This is a well written and timely summary of interactions between the circadian system and the stress response system set in the framework of drug addiction/reward. The article provides an accurate summary of the current literature and a helpful introduction of these biological systems to readers who are unfamiliar with the field. The figures are clear, well-described, and aid the reader in understanding the molecular mechanisms described in the text. In addition, the evolution/environmental interaction perspective in the introduction provides an excellent framework for the following discussion of how interactions between the circadian and stress systems can go awry. This mini-review is a useful reference to researchers studying basic neuroscience questions on these systems and how these systems are disrupted in psychiatric disorders. The review highlights the importance of recognizing the potential interactions between these systems in both normal and pathological conditions.
