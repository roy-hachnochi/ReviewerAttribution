The revised paper has been significantly improved and addresses a number of issues raised in the original reviews. However, a few issues remain that should be addressed. 1. The description of Figure 1 is inconsistent with the figure legend. It seems that the red and blue labels in the legend of Figure 1 need to be swapped to make the figure consistent with the description in the text: The red and green curves look like pdfs whose integrals are very similar and close to 1 while the blue curve has a much larger area inconsistent with a pdf. 2. For the ChEMBL data set the inactivity/activity cutoffs used should be mentioned.
