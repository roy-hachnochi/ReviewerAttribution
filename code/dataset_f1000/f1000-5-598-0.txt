I acknowledge the authors' change to the title to reflect that the study is ongoing and the results are preliminary, the publication is certainly a preliminary report. The other reviewers raise some legitimate concerns over the study design and statistical treatment of the data. I felt more could be done in the current version to at least address some of the legitimate concerns over the choice of statistical tests used (e.g. t test and linear regression analysis) and urge the authors to address these concerns to correctly present and comment on the preliminary data they currently have on hand. I also recommend the graphs are improved to attain publication quality (suggest using publication quality graphing software) and that the authors clearly label x and y axes. I struggled to follow when the data represented total counts for all traps combined or were for individual units, for example. I strongly suggest that the experimental design concerns raised by the reviewers are being addressed in the ongoing study so that the authors can confidently measure the trapping improvements made by the ovillantas.
