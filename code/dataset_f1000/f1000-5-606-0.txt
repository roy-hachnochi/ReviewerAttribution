The authors have responded to two questions from my previous report. One question was related to the choice of the docking program AutoDock Vina, while the other question was related to the target of SYN-010 in the clinical trial that authors referenced. The authors have justified the use of AutoDock Vina as a well tested docking program that has been found to be "a strong competitor against other programs, and at the top of the pack in many cases". Regarding the target of SYN-010 in the clinical trial, although the binding assays for the key dehydrogenases targets were not conducted, the presented docking study of lactone statins generally show preferential docking as compared to F420 (known to interact with both dehydrogenases targets). Based on these findings, the authors suggest that these targets may interact with the lactone form of the statins.
