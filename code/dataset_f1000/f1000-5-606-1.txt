This paper provides insight on how statins inhibit methane production by direct inhibition of dehydrogenases using modelling studies. Previous work in this field (reference 14) focused on the F420-dependent oxidoreductase. Here, authors explore the potential binding of lovastatin and simvastatin into two F420-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenases (mtd) of M. smithii and Methanopyrus kandleri . From modelling perspective, the paper is well-structured and it provides enough information to reproduce the results, highlighting common problems involving modelling techniques (e.g. different ligand structures in databases). Considerable computational effort was put into identifying the most probable binding site as well as the active form (lactone versus hydroxyacid) of the ligands. Maybe the major drawback is the lack of in vitro results confirming the results, what currently seems difficult to achieve on the basis of the previous authorsâ€™ reply. Results from the clinical trial do not fully ensure that the mechanism goes via these targets, so I would suggest putting this correlation/clinical trial into context. Apart from that, I understand that in vitro validation of all modelling results is not always possible and the authors use a proper tone to expose their conclusions. As a minor point, some comments (e.g. target description) on the PDB entries used to model Q02394 (page 4) would be useful.
