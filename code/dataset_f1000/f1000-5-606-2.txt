The authors modeled the structure of F420-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (mtd) and systematically predicted possible binding sites in order to test docking of lactone form of statins vs. β-hydroxyacid form of statins, as well as the native ligand F420-coenzyme and other co-complexed ligands found in related structures. They used AutoDock Vina for docking and scoring and their results suggest that: for each modeled site the lactone form of the statins had more favorable site interactions compared to F420; the statin lactone forms generally had the most favorable docking scores, even relative to the native template PDB ligands; and the statin β-hydroxyacid forms had less favorable docking scores. Can the authors explain why would the lactone form of lovastatin be a privileged ligand for the predicted binding sites when compared to the other tested ligands? Did the authors try to use another docking program to reproduce these findings? Authors also suggest that the lactone form of lovastatin could inhibit the activity of the key M. smithii methanogenesis enzyme mtd in vivo. This is in agreement with the phase II clinical trial (NCT0249562335) the authors refer to. The clinical trial showed a reduction in symptoms and breath methane levels in patients treated with lovastatin-lactone (SYN-010) when compared to placebo. However, it is not clear from the clinical trial reference if SYN-010 inhibits mtd. It would be beneficial for this manuscript to add a reference that indicates the target of SYN-010.
