The authors report for the first time a multifocal variant of the recently described squamoid alveolar renal cell carcinoma, a distinct microscopic tumor in the spectrum of papillary renal cell carcinoma.. This is the first reported case on this location. The paper is original, elegant and well written, and the quality of figures nicely reflect the morphologic, and immunohistochemical aspects of this infrequent neoplasm. The references are acceptable and recent. Thus, I consider this paper acceptable in the current version, but some changes may improve the content of the manuscript: Since Cyclin D1 has also been reported in other variant of renal cell carcinoma, I recommend to the author to delete in the discussion the sentence Cyclin D1 immunohistochemistry is specific of this tumor. Moreover, I also included a sentence emphasizing that although Cyclin D1 is characteristic of BSARCC, it may be rarely observed in other variants of RCC. I considered that there are many immunohistochemical pictures of Cyclin D1, I would change figure C by a new HE of the conventional clear cell renal cell carcinoma
