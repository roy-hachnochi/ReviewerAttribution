CyLineUp is a new Cytoscape app which allow users to visualize 'changing' networks by enabling users to match dynamic features to networks. In my humble opinion, I find the title a bit confusing - and would modify it to something like: "CyLineUp: A Cytoscape app for vizualization of data-matched style in multiple networks". The abstract does a fair job in describing the main features of the app presented in the article. The article include suffice explanations, and usage examples, of the app with real biological data. The app itself is very easy to install and use - and thus is very user friendly, which is always an advantage as Cytoscape is heavily used by no-computer-expert biologists. From my own experience, by following the screenshots and explanations provided in the article, it is easy to plot your own data with CyLineUp. I see the CyLineUp app as a potentially great app for analyzing multiple 'omics' data sets, as often we wish to plot small multiples based on different omics data sets.
