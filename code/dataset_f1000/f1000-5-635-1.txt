It is a common use case for Cytoscape, to have data for multiple conditions or time points. There are a few other apps to address this in various ways, including cyAnimator, enhancedGraphics and DynNetwork, which utilize either animation or custom chart graphics for nodes. The "small multiples" approach has always been an option for users who were sufficiently skilled with using Cytoscape, which allows one to make multiple networks and apply a unique, data-mapped style to each. This is a tedious and error-prone task, however. So, the CyLineUp app is a welcome tool to make this task easy, consistent and reliable. The app is easy to install and use, and the paper is clear and well-written. It is nice to see a fundamental visualization technique like "small multiples" applied here. However, it is disappointing to see the red-green color gradient offered by default, which should be shunned by data visualization tool developers. Perhaps something to consider changing in the next release of the app? Since the app is open source, maybe I'll contribute this code patch myself as a pull request! The CyLineUp app offers its own table importer, visual style editor and image exporter customized for visualizing data for multiple conditions or time points. Looking forward, it would be interesting to see what would be involved in adapting the core of Cytoscape to be able to annotate columns of table data already imported and then support the small multiple view generator, leveraging the native importer, style editor and image exporters. I could picture this functionality becoming a part of the Cytoscape distribution, in the same way the enhancedGraphics app was eventually merged with the core as an out-of-the-box feature. This would make the useful facility of small multiple views available to all users, without having to learn these new, single-purpose interfaces.
