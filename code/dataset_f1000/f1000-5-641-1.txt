In the study “Fasting blood glucose and newborn birth weight of non- diabetic Sudanese women" A. Elmugabil et a l aimed to assess the relationship between maternal sociodemographic and obstetrics characteristics and blood glucose and birth weight. The authors report an association between fasting blood glucose and birth weight (BW) and no association between other variables and BW. There are several concerns with this study: The title does not accurately reflect the objectives of the study The objective of the study does not match the methodology; the study was designed to study an association and not causality/effects Methodology: i) Study designed: there are no information provided on survey data collection; not clear if the sample included both preterm and term pregnancies; what test was used for OGTT, if the test is validated, at what gestational age was the test done; how the correction for 2h blood glucose was done and what was the rationale behind this correction; the term “early” pregnancy and US should be defined; ii) Statistical analysis is not sound as the authors used both continuous and categorical variables as independent variables in the linear regression analyses; GA is a confounder for the relationship between BMI, GWG and BW and should be controlled for. Results section do not report on how many women had normal or abnormal OGTT tests; it is not clear what GA was included in Table 1 Most part of the comments from the Discussion section are tangential to the topic; the authors do not provide any explanation for their findings and the differences between their results and the data from literature. Part of the Conclusions of the study are incorrect.
