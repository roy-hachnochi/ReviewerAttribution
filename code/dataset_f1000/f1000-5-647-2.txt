This is a nice piece of work in which the author simulates elegantly the effect of an incretin, GLP-1, on glucose absorption, metabolism and blood circulation as well as the level of hormones relevant for the regulation of sugar metabolism such as insulin and glucagon. Overall the paper is well written; title, abstract and conclusions are sound. I have only some minor comments for improvement of the manuscript: List of abbreviations: The list is incomplete, e.g. Fig. 9E can only be understood when reading the result text in which it is explained that here glucagon secretion is described. I suggest to control the complete text for further missing abbreviations (such as e.g.sys art V or Ce V in Table 1A). Perhaps this part would be easier to read when presented as a table (if this should be allowed by the journal). Some symbols are used in a double sense, e.g. P for pressure and for permeability. Perhaps it would be easier for the reader to use ‘p’ for pressure (in physics ‘P’ stands for power). P.9, paragraph about renal glucose excretion: 10 % filtration rate is only a meaningful estimate for glomerular filtration rate if referred to renal artery blood flow (and not renal artery plasma flow, which is the usual reference value for GFR in text books). So perhaps adding the word ‘blood’ might make this estimation more clear. Legend of Fig. 2, panel D: should be ‘… decreased aortic pressure and arterial volume’. Several figures: please add the units (e.g. mM to Sys glucose in Fig. 4D and so on) to all subheadings of all figures. P.26, 3 paragraph: I miss any explanation/discussion for the biphasic insulin response presented in Fig. 10C. Typographical errors: p.8. last paragraph (right): Kirchhoff (not Kirchoff).
