This is one among the informative studies about the antimicrobial susceptibility and clarithromycin resistance patterns of Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates in Vietnam. The title is appropriate for the content. The methods and analysis of the results are well-described and appropriate. However, there are several minor revisions that the authors should be considered to make results of the paper more clinically meaningful: The design of this study is not prospective randomized one. It is a cross-sectional study. The clinical information of the patients recruited in the study should be clarified: are they nave patients or not. This information is essential to understand the true situation of antimicrobial susceptibility in Vietnam. As a result, the conclusion “Susceptibility tests prior to treatment are necessary to select the optimal H. pylori therapy regimens in Vietnam” may be not appropriate without this information. The authors should also addressed the weak points of the studies. Although this is a multi-center study, all of the medical centers locates in southern Vietnam. The picture of antimicrobial susceptibility and clarithromycin resistance patterns of Helicobacter pylori has been shown to be somewhat different in Central and Northern Vietnam. Therefore, the author should change the title from “in Vietnam” to “in southern Vietnam”, or they can keep the title as it was but add a sentence which mentions this weak point of the study.
