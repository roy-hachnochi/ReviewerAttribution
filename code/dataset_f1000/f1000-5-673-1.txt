The authors create a set of scripts that take SVs submitted to dbVar and find how many calls cover each region of the genome. I expect these will be useful for understanding locations in the genome where multiple SV calls have been made. The methods appear to be straightforward to use, so that they can be applied to new callsets as they are submitted to dbVar and potentially to other repositories as well. I have a few minor suggestions below: Fig 4 caption seems to refer to red box in Fig 3, not Fig 1. It appears that the output wig files for the current dbvar are on the GitHub site, and it would be useful to make clear that these are available in the paper. Are the output bed files also available? Are the outputs available as a track in any NCBI browser? Why did the authors choose gvf as the output format? Although no format is great for SVs, would the authors consider adding vcf as an output format since vcf seems to be increasingly adopted by SV callers? This is implied in the future work proposed, but it may be useful to state explicitly that dbVar entries are not curated for accuracy, so regions with many SVs may be enriched for artifacts or true SVs or both.
