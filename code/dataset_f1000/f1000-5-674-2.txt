Minor points: "...somewhat inaccessible to users with weaker computational backgrounds" - I have a strong computational background, and dealing with poor build processes and user interfaces is frustrating to me also. Maybe rephrase this to say that different tools have different levels of usability, which can be ameliorated by providing a single, well-designed interface to multiple tools. In Figure 1, "Network-based variant analysis tools" is represented as a single box, but there are multiple steps encapsulated there. It would be more informative to show the steps involved for each of the four tools and the output of each tool.
