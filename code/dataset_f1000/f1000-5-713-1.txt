The 'method article' by Brisco et al is well written, easy to read/understand and to the point. I have read the article keenly and with deep interest and on this basis declare that I have no reservations whatsoever against this article - its a simple but great piece of work. The Sweep Net Catch (SNC) method for collecting mosquito larvae described is long overdue for inclusion in tool kits for field entomologists. The video showing how larvae were sampled are clear. I note that the SNC method is carried out continuously for 10 minutes and gives it undue advantage over the dip method, which involves sampling with interruptions. However, the authors have discussed this issue adequately and in fact adjusted the length of sampling time for the dip method to legitimatize comparisons. Table 1 shows raw data of numbers of mosquito larvae collected by genus and sampling method. I suggest that the data presented be 'digested' a little further to show such important elements like number of sampling trials (N), mean mosquito catches, standard errors etc. The authors conclude that 'Our SNC method is particularly effective in capturing Anopheles mosquito larvae'. This statement is true given the numbers of larvae collected but looking at the video I'm inclined to think that the mosquito breeding sites selected for the studies were not typical habitats for culicine mosquito larvae, thus the use of the word 'particularly' is not due. In fact the authors state in their discussion section that "However, due to the relatively low numbers of Culex larvae collected throughout our study, we suspect there wasnâ€™t a high enough population density of these larvae at any of our trial sites to accurately determine if either method was more efficient for the collection of Culex larvae."
