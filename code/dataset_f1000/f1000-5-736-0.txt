This manuscript describes a useful and robust method to quantify PAR chains in cells after various treatments. This is important for evaluating the effects of various PARP and PARG inhibitors. Results and conclusions are in general well described and appropriate. I have some minor comments, mainly about the text and figure legends: The Cellomics’ Scan software was used to report the intensity of the PAR signal within the nuclear area, either quantified as the total intensity of the nuclear PAR signal or the total intensity of PAR signal points within the nucleus. Could the author clarify what defines a signal point? It would be useful for researchers using other software to reproduce these findings. Furthermore, could the authors indicate whether another method, such as simple thresholding, would also be possible? The curves in figures 3a and b suggest that the result might be quite similar. Figure 1: Last sentence ‘in’ should be removed. Figure 3: The text describing figure 3a and 3b in the legend was switched. Also, I would indicate in the figure that in 3c 50ug/ml MMS was used, as the concentration MMS is indicated for 3a and 3b but not for 3c. Also the sentence on page 6, lines 4-8, is not entirely clear: ‘… increase the sensitivity of the assay but the bottom of the curve was not reached.’ Is a somewhat difficult way to say that the authors used a range that did not go to low enough concentrations to reach background levels. Probably this sentence could be adapted for easier understanding. Figure 3d: use different colors for each different compound. It is now very hard to distinguish which line represents which compound. Figure 5a: after 72 the word ‘hours’ should be added.
