Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is activated in response to DNA damage. In this manuscript, the authors used the immunostaining assay to examine the DNA damage-induced PAR chain and measured the dePARylation process in cells. The assay itself is very simple and reliable. However, besides PARG, there are other dePARylation enzymes contributing for the cellular dePARylation. And the list of the dePARylation enzymes is still growing. Since this assay is to measure overall dePARylation instead of specifically examining the PARG activity, the authors are suggested to modify the title of this manuscript, which might be better to convey their message.
