The authors of this article "highlight a role for molecular modeling and molecular dynamic simulations as tools that can significantly increase the yield of information to aid in the evaluation of pathogenicity." Molecular dynamics simulations are indeed excellent tools to study protein and nucleic acid structures, protein-ligand, protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. These structural changes and interactions are fundamental in molecular biology and thus molecular simulations are an excellent tool to increase our understanding of these biological processes. In particular the proposed method may help the understanding of coding variants associated with amino acid substitution. In addition, RNA structure can be modeled, which can be informative about some micro-RNA variants. However, these methods are not without limitations and this paper does not state these limitations explicitly. Pathogenic effects come in all strength and complexities. Most often pathogenicity is not associated with a single variant, but with a combination of several variants and the effect of a particular variant depends on the genotypes of other genes. Most likely, variants will stay of unknown significance unless we develop a system level understanding of biology. We may reach a point that we can simulate viral functions at molecular level, but it will not be applied to human variants any time soon. Molecular modelling has some limitations and requires expert knowledge to apply it properly. While I agree that molecular modelling is an excellent tool to understand molecular biology, we need to develop a system level of understanding of the connection between molecular biology and genetics before we can apply molecular simulations. Currently, molecular modeling can make practical contribution to understand variants associated with strong effects or the molecular basis of some Mendelian disorders.
