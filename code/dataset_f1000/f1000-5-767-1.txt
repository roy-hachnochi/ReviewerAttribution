The theme of this paper is, to my mind, very interesting (socioeconomic inequalities in general and dental health) and various general and dental measures with trustable definition are plus. The design and data analysis seem acceptable to support the conclusion. Thus, I believe that this paper merits indexation, but there is a few points to be addressed / discussed more. For anthropometric variables, authors describe: “Even after adjustments were made for sex and age, still all anthropometric variables: height (P 0.001), weight (P 0.001), BMI (P = 0.001) and leg length (P 0.001) of children significantly increased as the socioeconomic status of area increased.” However, no actual results on this appear in the table and please check in which table the result is shown. If this finding is less important and authors decided not to present the data, please indicate that “data is not presented”. It is not clear why two p values are presented in the table 1 and I think it would be four p-values per each column. Similarly, only two p-values were presented in the table 2, instead of four as to four measures. I am sorry, if misunderstanding is mine. For presentation of table 1, I wonder whether the use of Odds Ratio is proper approach. I think instead of OR, presenting different proportions for three area groups and statistical test with Chi-square would be relevant and complementary to other results in table 1, for example, Chi-square test for “having at least one jobless parent” for three area levels. Use of area level SEP could be more justifiable, if the parents are actual residents of the areas to which their siblings attend, if additional information of this kind is available.
