This opinion piece describes and refutes seven arguments against sharing research data. The authors focus on clinical trials, but their reasoning is applicable to research with human participants in general. In the ongoing conversation about open research data in scientific journals, arguments against open data are not always presented clearly and explicitly. The mere listing of counterarguments in a paper that can be referenced is therefore an important contribution. The authors refute each argument against data sharing in a clear and coherent manner and their counterarguments are a valuable resource for researchers debating open data. I have only one minor point of criticism: the statement in the last paragraph that a study with 10 000 participants has 100 times more information content than a study with 100 participants does not take into account the diminishing information content in consecutive dependent observations. I suggest this may be reworded.
