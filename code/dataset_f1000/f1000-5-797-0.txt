In this opinion article, Kourilsky articulates a sweeping, holistic perspective on the plethora of innate defense mechanisms that exist at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and organismal levels to ensure survival. The author broadens the definition of innate defenses to include not only cells traditionally associated with immunity such as macrophages and dendritic cells, but rather each and every cell and organ system in the organism. The division of function is between cells that are sessile, such as those organized into tissues and organs, and that are motile such as those of the hematopoetic system. A key idea is the “normative self” – a homeostatic physiological state to which both types of cells contribute. The normative self is learned and is continuously reinforced by interactions between sessile and motile cells that tune the system to respond appropriately to neoplastic cells, aberrant inflammatory responses, and environmental perturbations such as infectious disease. The essay is thought-provoking and attempts, successfully in our opinion, to highlight the landscape of adaptable interactions that is necessary to sustain life. Conceivably, this perspective may be applied beyond the individual organism to the interplay of communities and even higher order populations.
