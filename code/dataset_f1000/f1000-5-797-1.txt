The opinion article by P. Kourilsky proposes a new model of the immune system called the normative self model. It is vividly written and discusses several former models - such as the one promoted by Paul and Grossman - and it also capitalizes on recent experimental findings. It will be interesting to add a couple of sentences on innate lymphoid cells, unconventional T cells (e.g. MAIT, gd T cells, and CD8aa+ IELs), and tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells since these diverse cell types play a role in the preservation of tissue integrity and function during homeostasis, infection, and non-infectious perturbations. More importantly, the aim of a model is to provide experiments that can be tested and clearly refuted or validated. Therefore, I will strongly encourage P. Kourilsky to include a section in which a couple of such experiments are suggested.
