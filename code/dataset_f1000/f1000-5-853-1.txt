The authors have addressed the highly important issue of free open access (FOA) as a means of tackling emerging epidemics and infectious diseases burden in Africa. They argue that unrestricted open access and free use or reuse of relevant and appropriate data together with sharing of data among African researchers, international partners, policy makers and the community will help limit the effect of burden of infectious disease epidemics in Africa. Availability of real time information on virtually all aspects of infections and diseases is required for timely action and response needed to ensure that public health events do not escalate to international concerns with grave consequences. It must be however observed that unrestricted free open access to data may lead to users being overwhelmed and unable to make sense out of the data, unless there is available capacity and capability for appropriately analysing and synthesizing the data into valuable information for policy-makers, implementers, care providers, researchers, health-related institutions and stakeholders including the community. This requires increasing and improving human resource capacity side by side with the call for unrestricted free open access. I find the review stimulating and challenging, with title and abstract matching the contents and conclusions which focuses on the benefits of FOA. As they call for FOA, they also call for the need for unrestricted but planned collaboration between all stakeholders under the “One Health” umbrella.
