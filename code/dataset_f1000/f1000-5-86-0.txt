In their m/s, the authors present an analysis of genetic interactions between published ABP1 knockdown lines (based on antisense and immune-suppression approaches) and the Arabidopsis ABP1 locus. After crossing three different knockdown lines into recently described abp1 knockout alleles, followed by segregation analysis of resulting F2 and F3 progeny, the authors came to the conclusion that growth defects of their knockdown lines do not depend on a functional ABP1 locus. These findings represent a valuable contribution to ongoing attempts, trying to clarify ABP1 issues. Nevertheless, off-target loci recognized in the knockdown lines remain mysterious. Are there any ABP1-related loci (cupins?), expression of which could be affected by these knockdown lines? Perhaps this could be tested in the abp1-AS line. Phenotypes of the knockdown lines are reminiscent of mutants with altered auxin responses. Did the authors look into expression of some of the characterized auxin-related loci? This could give us a better idea about the genetic determinants, causing the phenotypes in these knockdown lines.
