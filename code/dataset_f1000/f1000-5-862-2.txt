 Title and Abstract: The title is reflective of the content of the article. The abstract adequately summarizes the article. Article content: The topic of the case report is very interesting. The authors can expand the current body of knowledge on elective fertility preservation in this age group by providing more details about the patient. For instance demographic information such as the patientâ€™s gravity, parity, medical comorbidities, BMI, ovarian reserve (Day 3 FSH, E2, AMH, antral follicle count) are missing. It can be inferred that the patient underwent more than one stimulation cycle. The number of cycles she underwent to reach 8 oocytes and the protocol is also omitted. The grade of the embryos transferred was also not shared. Most importantly the indication for the early term c-section at 37 weeks and any maternal medical conditions that developed antenatal, intra-partum or post-partum are extremely relevant and should be reported. Providing more information would allow the information to be applied in similar scenarios. Conclusions: The conclusion was well thought out. However, given very little information was given about the patient is difficult to assess if alternative conclusions would be more plausible.
