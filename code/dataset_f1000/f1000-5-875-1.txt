A well written article describing an interesting presentation of an uncommon condition. The case would be useful to other clinicians, as there is some important discussion of magnesium preparations. I note the authors reference another case report published this year by themselves of a 37 year female with chonedrocalcinosis and GS. These could have been combined, with a more substantial discussion for a more useful contribution to the literature.
