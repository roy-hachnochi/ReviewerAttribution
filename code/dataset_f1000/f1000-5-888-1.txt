The authors describe the results of an educational effort in which a hackathon event was used to develop an interactive tutorial to help biologists learn a fundamental NGS analysis skill. Specifically, that of selecting an appropriate read aligner, performing alignments, and evaluating the outcome. Overall the tutorial is organized, and the accompanying paper is well written. Major points: The primary goal of this work is commendable. However having reviewed the paper and tutorial, I was surprised by the lack of discussion/ interpretation of the results. Choosing an appropriate RNA-seq read aligner and evaluating the outcome can indeed be a challenge to those new to the field. The tutorial walks a user through the process of conducting alignments with four possible aligners. Some tools that evaluate the resulting aligners are presented and used during the tutorial. However, the authors offer little interpretation of the results, even for the demonstration data set. What do the results tell us about the quality of each alignment result? What factors might be considered in deciding which is "best"? What are the pitfalls for such assessments? How might the results be visualized to assist interpretation? A secondary goal of creating a tool "bamDiff" to assist comparisons between RNA-seq aligners is less well developed. This works seems to be fairly preliminary at this stage, consisting of a single Python script that produces a text summary of a few metrics extracted from RNA-seq BAMs from multiple aligners. Similar to the previous point, additional development would be needed before the results of this tool would be readily useful to most prospective users. Considerable resources/ tools for performing quality assessment of BAM files (including RNA-seq alignments) already exist. The authors could provide an overview of these, either in the paper or as an additional section in the tutorial Wiki. In the tutorial. The section for each aligner considered (BWA, HISAT, STAR, and blastmapper) should provide a basic description of the aligner, references, link to the aligner documentation, etc. The alignment comparisons focus on the number of reads aligned, and how aligners differ in the alignment of particular reads, or reads aligning to particular regions. What other ways might the aligners be different? For example, in their ability to correctly map RNA-seq reads across exon-exon junctions, align reads containing single base sequencing errors or polymorphisms, correctly handle reads containing small insertions or deletions relative to the reference genome, etc. Minor points: Perhaps the abstract should include a URL for the tutorial mentioned in the title. The authors have created an AMI to "allow students to initially bypass the intimidating task of installing software and dependencies". This is reasonable, but perhaps the installation task could be provided (with detailed instructions) as an optional exercise. On a related note, it would be ideal to have detailed documentation on how the AMI (ami-3590de50) was configured (including all dependencies that were installed). In addition, this tutorial could include a "resources/pre-reading" section that referred the reader to additional helpful materials on RNA-seq sequencing and analysis principles (in addition to the hands on pre-requisites already listed in section 1). More details on the example RNA-seq data set used in the hands on exercises would be helpful. Are there similar efforts for comparison of DNA aligners that could be referenced by this tutorial? Other RNA-seq educational pieces that cover many topics relevant to new NGS users (with less focus on aligner comparison specifically) could be cited by this paper (e.g. Griffith M et al. , www.rnaseq.wiki).

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions The manuscript summarizes two achievements from NCBI’s hackathon of 2015. First is a tutorial to introduce RNAseq mapping. Second is bamDiff, a program for comparing different RNA-seq aligner mapping. This reviewer believes the current state of the tutorial is on the thin side and could benefit from additional expansion. The functionality of bamDiff program is intriguing but based on the current state of the program the reviewer feels the program should be expanded to incorporate other QC metrics. Overall, this work makes great stride for guiding biologist to their first hands-on-experience on NGS. Major points: The tutorial provides a step by step tutorial from downloading to mapping and some mapping evaluation. The tutorial can be useful to users that find difficulty working on a Unix environment. In the current form, the author introduces basic commands for performing mapping; however, the author should caution and educate the reader that additional vetting of the raw RNAseq mapping is necessary. While mapping evaluation is important, that is just one of the many QC metric necessary in RNAseq data that contribute to the decision making. Here is an incomplete list of RNAseq related issues that should be included in the tutorial: Whether the RNAseq sample require trimming of low quality or adaptor sequences. The different parameter tuning that increases the coverage of these hard to map region (i.e. STAR 2-pass). At what sequencing depth is the RNAseq sample is deep enough for expression analysis, gene fusion detection, splicing detection, and whether additional sequencing is necessary. (The reviewer recognize that the above comments might not be suitable within the tutorial, but the author should make some attempt to inform the user of these caveats.) Regarding the bam comparison program, the author might want to automatically include output of coverage Bed files that can be displayed in UCSC genome browser or IGV. In the tutorial, the author included some examples of coverage differences; however, the discussions from the tutorial appear to be incomplete. The author failed to discuss the reason that contributes to these differences in coverage such as the parameters or algorithm design. Another discussion point should be to examine where the same read is being mapped to in different program? Here I present a couple factors that might impact the mapping the author might want to consider: GC content Highly repetitive region Paralogous gene bodies such as some ribosome genes and mitochondrial genes or histone genes might have varying coverage in different programs. Within the tutorial, the author mentions “is every mapper allowing reads to map to the intronic region? After all, this is an RNA-seq experiment -- there should be minimal intronic genetic material.” While the statement is largely true; however, this reviewer believe the author should also mention that there are different type of RNA-seq library specifically TruSeq Stranded Total RNA prep would include contain intronic reads. Poly-A enriched RNAseq experiment could also contain intronic reads for intron retention events. Since the author appear to discuss splicing region in the tutorial, a more detailed analysis on how different programs deals with the splicing region could be of tremendous interest to certain readers. The author might also want to consider the impact of RNA-seq library protocols on the variation of splice site mapping. A number of tools have been developed for assessing RNAseq alignment quality. A review tools compared to bamDiff might make a stronger case for the novelty of the program. A comprehensive table in the tutorial or within the manuscript summarizing all the advantages and disadvantages of different mapping programs will definitely enhance the manuscript. Minor points: Perhaps include other popular aligner such as Tophat as an option. While it is great that the pipeline being on the amazon cloud allows users to bypss installation. Perhaps the author could include installation procedure or reference to individual software if the user wants to install the program on their private server. Make sure all program provide sufficient commenting. Most of the shell script lack sufficient commenting for what the program will do and why the author chose those parameters. Sentence that might benefit from rephrasing “With the rise of RNA-seq for exploring biological hypotheses has come an increase in the number of algorithms for aligning RNA-sequences to the genome.” Particularly the choice of “has come” is a bit awkward of a wording. Another sentence that might benefit from rephrasing “If they map to a conflicting region outside the region of interest, bamDiff will report the top ten regions reads are mapping to, by agglomerating reads mapping within 1kb of each other.” For certain details on RNAseq analysis, the author want to refer the reader to the following paper for additional details on RNAseq analysis. “https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0881-8” Regarding the accompanying software bamDiff. The summary statistics merely output summary statistics obtained from other mapping programs. The author might want to consider refining the output to a more presentable format like outputting to an excel file. References 1.
