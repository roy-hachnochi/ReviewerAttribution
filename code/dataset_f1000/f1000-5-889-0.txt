This is an interesting paper, but I have a fundamental disagreement with the central tenet - the suggestion that increased terrestrial water retention and storage could in any way impede sea level rise, let alone 'mitigate' it. While I appreciate and agree with the general discussion regarding the myriad uses and benefits from increasing terrestrial storage (ecologically, agriculturally, etc.), there is no feasibility that the rate could be sufficiently high enough to impede sea level rise. By the authors own back-of-the-envelope calculations, the magnitudes are so wildlife different that it is ridiculous to contemplate. That said, I appreciate the other ideas in the manuscript, although I have some questions regarding the underlying assumptions. The central tenet assumes that there has been a net transfer of water from terrestrial to the marine environment following anthropogenic disturbance (in addition to climate-driven thermal expansion of the oceans). Has this been established? Has this occurred, and can you demonstrate it? What about the uptake of water vapour as global temperatures rise? How is that factored into your calculations? I also found it an amazing oversight that the authors did not mention the only demonstrated scalable, low-emissions technology currently available for power the enormously electricity-hungry technology of desalination: nuclear fission. Not only are 100% renewable scenarios not feasible for even basic demand (doi:10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.114), there is absolutely no way they could conceivably power massive desalination at the scales mentioned. The ONLY technology would be nuclear. Full stop. Figure 1 is poorly captioned and incomplete. It is not clear to which components of storage the different symbols and lines refer. A much more detailed caption is required. Minor watch split infinitives carbon 'dioxyde' (dioxide) separate numbers from units that describe (you cannot write 1000kilometres, so '1000km' is also incorrect)
