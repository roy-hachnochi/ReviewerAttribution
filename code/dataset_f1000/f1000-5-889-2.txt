 Title and Abstract : The main title is fine; the sub-title “a water-based solution to global issues’ is vague; desalination of sea water is the central argument of the article and should appear in the title somewhere. Article Content : The article proposes a bold, nay sensational, solution to the potential consequences of seawater rise due to global warming. The proposal to the humankind is: begin by investing US $ 23 trillion in building 46,000 mega desalination plants to desalinate 9-12 trillion m 3 of sea water every year, and use it for agriculture, wetland restoration, groundwater recharge, afforestation and in general, meeting fresh water scarcity around the world. Once this threshold capacity is commissioned, build more desalination plants to take care of increased global warming as it accelerates thermal expansion and further seawater rise. Doing this would protect low-lying island nations and coastal communities globally although other threats from climate change and warming will still challenge the humankind. I would have normally thought the proposal bizarre, even reckless. But global warming and sea water rise are formidable and complex challenges and the world needs to be receptive to all manner of ideas, even if they sound bizarre. I would have thought that a policy proposal of such gigantic economic and ecological dimensions should be advanced with analytical effort of commensurate magnitude and depth; but this is missing in this analysis which I find a trifle casual in its approach. In fact, I am afraid the article has not subjected, to even a preliminary scrutiny, the various implications of its proposals using evidence freely available on the internet. For example, there are important questions of technical feasibility that have not been touched, leave alone addressed. If fossil energy is to be used for desalination, how much will the 46,000 mega-desalination plants themselves contribute to further global warming and seawater rise (unless, of course, they all use solar or wind power)[1]? At a very conservative 5 kWh/m 3 [2], producing 9-12 trillion m 3 of desalinated sea water per year would use 45-60 trillion kWh of thermal energy every year, over two times the 22.7 trillion kWh of total electricity the world generated in 2012 [3]. The article provides no hint of how much more energy would be needed to transport desalinated water from plants to places of use, with what further impact on global warming? Given that the world’s annual use of groundwater around 2010 was estimated at only 1.1 trillion m 3 (Margat and van der Gun 2013 p.6), do depleted aquifers have empty storage to absorb a significant portion of the 9-12 trillion m 3 that desalination plants will have to dispose of every year? Likewise, given that the world’s total annual water withdrawals for all uses are of the order of 4 trillion m 3 [4] is it possible for the earth to absorb 9-12 trillion desalinated sea water/year that will be made available from desalination plants on fields, forests and wetlands? A redeeming aspect, the authors suggest, is that agricultural water use would not require removing all salts from seawater to make it drinking water quality and therefore will cost less money and energy. This is a dangerous proposal. Dumping 9-12 trillion m 3 of partially desalinated seawater with say 10,000 ppm salts (compared to 35,000 ppm in sea water) could, over a decade or two salinize soils in the surface of the entire earth to the same level as the lower Indus basin in Pakistan, with frightening consequences. Are there competing ideas/proposals for coping with sea water rise that we can compare the present proposal with? The authors are silent on this. Would it not be far cheaper to build levees around low-lying island nations to counter sea level rise? Might it be more cost effective to desilt the seas to expand their storage and use the silt to build the levees? Many geoengineering proposals are dismissed for being far less bizarre than the one proposed here; but injecting aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from the earth[5] would be far cheaper and a lot less riskier than 46,000 mega desalination plants and might resolve all problems of global warming than just seawater rise. Would it be cheaper to live with those impacts or use the money saved to compensate people-at-risk from seawater rise? Climate Central estimated that worldwide 147-216 million people live on land that will be below sea level or regular flood levels by the end of the century, assuming emissions of heat-trapping gases continue on their current trend [6]. The Boyer-Lefort article proposes a one-time investment in building desalination plants at US $ 106,500-156,000 per person-at-risk but glosses over US $ 42,000-82,000/year per person-at-risk ever after in operational cost of desalinating sea water at US $ 1/m 3 [7]. Would it take a lot more money to help these communities to make a transition to the Netherlands-type dykes-and-levee ecosystem to cope with rising sea level? Developing countries have been, for over two decades, fighting hard to get the world to commit US $ 100 billion in assistance to help them move to low-carbon technologies; but without any success. After all, US $ 100 billion to protect the global carbon sinks is just 1 percent of the US $ 9-12 trillion the idea proposed here would cost. If this has not clicked, what would it take to persuade the world to invest a third of its GDP (estimated in 2014 at US $ 78 trillion [9]) in desalination plants to mitigate the impacts of sea level rise? There are also other important questions about economic feasibility. Does this proposal compare well with other comparable proposals doing rounds? A 2014 report from World Energy Agency estimated that it would cost US $ 44 trillion in investments, between now and 2050, for the world to change entirely to renewables and halt climate change and sea water rise all together [9]. A similar analysis by IPCC estimated the investments required to stabilize GHG levels in the atmosphere at US $ 13 trillion. These clearly appear to be far better deals than the one proposed here since even after 46,000 mega desalination plants, most ill-effects of global warming, bar sea water rise, will continue to afflict the humankind. Conclusion: Overall, even a cursory examination suggests that the proposal advanced is unrealistic, even disingenuous. I would have expected authors to undertake a modicum of scrutiny before offering their piece for publication. I do believe that its science is unacceptably poor.
