Though the authors distinguish dominant (DDEB) and recessive (RDEB) subtypes of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) at the outset in their abstract, they lapse into speaking of DEB in more monolithic terms later and conflating findings that are specific in some cases only to one subtype. There is a reason for this as there is considerable overlap but there are differences particularly with certain features like the propensity for developing skin cancer. The authors state "the development of skin cancer....in almost all affected members in the third or fourth decade of life." This is true for RDEB phenotype but not DDEB in whom the development of squamous cell carcinoma as well as the distinctive psuedosyndactyly type of scarring much less common. This may not be the forum for parsing such details but this struck me. Similarly, while I realize this is not an EB review article a brief internal reference to the Vander Oever article might allow interested readers easy access to a therapeutic update. Finally, I would want someone other than I with expertise in the genetic methods used to weigh in on their suitability. The methods and results to my untrained --relative to a geneticist--- eye appear sound. Otherwise I approve indexing this article. References 1.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Apart from few typo errors, the manuscript is well written and informative. There are few too strong statements, e.g., "The disease also predisposes individuals to development of skin cancer and it is estimated that almost all affected members develop cancers in the third or fourth decade of life". Perhaps authors can insert a reference (s) that supports this statement. Fig. 1. needs some corrections. Please insert (a) to refer to the upper limb, thorax and abdomen (not hands and thoracic region). b. should refer to legs and feet. Is the mentioned "our internal cohort of 122 exomes" published or available online? Furthermore, they may mention some of the weaknesses of the Nextera platform, such as coverage bias. In the discussion sections, authors may mention the clinical relevance of their finding. Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions The authors describe a 5 year old boy with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), which is due to a novel mutation in the COL7A1 gene. The case is the first report of a genetically characterized case of DEB from India. It is a well written manuscript which is worthy to be indexed with F1000Research . To understand the new mutation as the cause of severe DEB in the boy, it would be interesting to know what are the differences to other mutations of the COL7A1 gene. In other words, what does this mean on the protein level? Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed.
