I have read the new version of Illingsworth's paper and am happy to approve its indexation, with suggestions for the following two minor revisions. First, I believe the author intended to use the word, elicit , not illicit, in the sentence: "As well as not conveying some key elements of the study (as was the case with the ‘Model’ category) there is also the danger that the poem might illicit in the reader an implied meaning". Second, I would be happier if the writer also cited following: Rowan, K. E. (1988). A contemporary theory of explanatory writing. Written Communication , 5 , 23-56. Rowan, K. E. (2003). Informing and explaining skills: Theory and research on informative communication. In J. O. Greene B. R. Burleson (Eds.), The handbook of communication and social interaction skills (pp. 403-438). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. The Rowan (1988, 2003) papers argue, following James Kinneavy's (1971) Theory of Discourse , that scientific discourse and literature discourse have differing goals. Science is designed to provide empirical support for claims representing some aspect of reality. Literary discourse, which includes poetry, is designed to edify or entertain. My main concern with offering poetry in place of a scientific abstract is that poetry is not intended to provide a proof or evidence that something is the case about the natural or social world. That is the job of scholarly discourse. But it is possible Professor Illingsworth and I will disagree about this matter, so my sense is that I should raise this point one more time, but not let it stand in the way of this interesting paper being indexed.
