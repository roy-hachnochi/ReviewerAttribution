This paper pulls together evidence from Dr. Kripke’s own work and subsequent work, which indicate that the use of benzodiazepines and perhaps other sleeping pills is causing thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of deaths annually in the United States. He reviews the complete lack of evidence for any positive health effect of the use of these drugs. This is especially striking because drug companies sponsor a considerable amount of research on their sleeping pills and would undoubtedly publicize any data indicating positive health or lifespan effects – but there do not appear to be any. Kripke also points out the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. This well studied treatment is less expensive, without any known deleterious effects on lifespan or health and produces a long-lasting reduction in insomnia. The effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy in the treatment of insomnia contrasts with the miniscule (0-20 min) increase in sleep time produced by sleeping pills, followed by a considerable withdrawal effect if the patient stops taking the pills. Minor suggestions include the following: I would delete the discussion of Judge Scalia’s death. Although it gets one’s attention, without knowing what Scalia was taking and without any documentation of the cause of death, it does more harm than good to the impact of the paper. On page 10, I would delete the paragraph on prescriptions without valid clinical indication. I guess that in many cases the prescribing physician would just say he forgot to document the need. I do not doubt that Dr. Kripke is bringing attention to an important issue, but it is not persuasively presented, in contrast to the rest of his argument.
