In my first review I requested full and significant rewrite of the paper. This has not happened. Authors did add some new material and video, both useless for validating the correctness and usefulness of the proposed method. Firstly, research question is missing, what are the problems the proposed method tries to solve? Secondly, the transformation of the traditional relational model to proposed model is not described clearly enough. It seems that there are some rules how relations and their attributes are stored to new structure, but this is not described clearly enough. Paper should list clearly set of rules that are used and give examples how these rules are applied. Third, usefulness of the proposed method is not clear. Sure you can have only one index, but how you do simple queries like select first_name,street from Personal p, Address a where a.id = p.id is executed? How user could know what ID some attribute now has? How the created one index can be used to perform simple primary key or foreign key queries. How constraints are enforced ? Finally, what are the use cases for JT logic and how the proposed method improves the state-of-the-art i.e. compared to relational model or object oriented model? This question remain fully open based on this paper. This paper does not successfully fulfill requirements of the scientific paper. At its current form, this looks more like a marketing material.
