In this paper authors introduce a new logic called Joker Tao (JT) which provides universal data storage for cloud-based databases. However, the paper is very poorly written. Firstly, the proposed logic is not presented detailed enough for the reader to understand and validate the method. Authors should research how relational model is presented and based on rigorous relational calculus and algebra. Based on this research, this paper should be rewritten based on rigorous mathematical foundation and give clear examples. Secondly, one table based example is far from convincing and provided Java-program is unnecessary. Length of the paper should be greatly increased to contain detailed description of JT method and give examples. Lastly, presentation is so poor that is not even clear how queries to resulting JT structure can be executed. To be honest, currently paper looks more like computer generated rubbish than a real scientific paper.
