The primary objective of this study is to perform a sub-study of the Systematic Assessment and Targeted Improvement of Services Following Yearlong Surgical Outcomes Surveys (SATISFY-SOS) study by comparing a validated quality of life measure (VR-12) to a self-reported "global" quality of life question. Secondary aims include comparing mental and physical quality of life pre- and post- surgery (Aim 2) and to describe these based on types of surgeries (Aim 3). The authors feel this is important because self-reported measures are subject to recall bias, and yet are more commonly used. Major criticisms: None Minor criticisms: Co-morbidities (such as depression, Alzheimer's, or other psychiatric or neurologic illness) and their treatment or lack of treatment may affect quality of life scores. Will these be accounted for and will the patient be monitored? For example, if a patient suffers from depression, undergoes surgery, and is started on an antidepressant after surgery, this would potentially affect quality of life, but is not directly related to the surgery itself. I would like to know how this type of confounding variable will be addressed. The validated tool used should be compared also with the PROMIS measures, which are essentially individually validated questions, often reliant on patient self-report. Would consider adding these.
