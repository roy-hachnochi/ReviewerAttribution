Thank you for a well written article with an important message - that injection safety can be improved which might decrease injection related disease transmission. Comments: In Abstract it states: The nurses who are familiar with injection safety standards ... 82.6% The proportion of injections that met the 23 standards of injection safety ... 22.2%. A low proportion of nurses performed correct safety injection... This indicates a large difference between knowledge and practice. It would also be of use to have the average of the number of safety standards that was recorded. In Table 1. the headline "Training courses on safe injection in the past year " occurs twice with different figures which is not clearly explained in the text. Experience might not always guarantee better practice - "rate of correct practice of SI in nurses 30 years was found to be 3.1 times higher than those 30 years old" Clarifications: Question "Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?" Partly as it would be good to have a shortlist of all 23 standards and how each of them was assessed as well as the result (average, SD, median) Question "Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?" Partly as there would be good to see a discussion regarding the large gap between knowledge and practice - why do people not behave as they know they should?
