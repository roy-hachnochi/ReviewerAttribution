The opinion article by Totomoch-Serra and colleagues suggests that a “targeted” Sanger Sequencing Method (SSM) is an appropriate first-line approach to diagnose Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS). Although Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, especially in cases of genetic heterogeneity, is gradually replacing the traditional SSM as the method of choice for genetic testing, its high cost and unavailability often preclude its routine use, particularly in developing countries. The authors maintain that for conditions that require sequencing of short fragments of DNA (1000 bases), previously amplified by PCR, SSM remains the gold standard. In ATS, where 60% of the reported cases involve mutations of the KCNJ2 gene (that codes for the Kir2.1 channel protein) exhibiting autosomal dominant Mendelian inheritance, half the mutations are located in the C-terminal cytosolic domain with a hotspot at Arg218 (ATS type 1). Characteristic developmental abnormalities coupled to specific ventricular arrhythmias and/or muscular disorders can identify ATS patients who could then undergo SSM to identify the putative causative mutations in KCNJ2 with a potential 60% success. NGS could then be applied if the patient falls within the 40% of the cases that are not due to KCNJ2 (ATS type 2) with the hope to discover additional genes responsible for the disease and determine their frequency of occurrence. The opinion expressed by the authors is reasonable and advisable to physicians especially in cases where cost and access to NGS are problematic. Yet, it is likely a matter of time before cost and access to NGS improve and limit the choice of SSM for genetic testing. SSM has certainly served us well for the past 40 years and continues to serve us well in cases like ATS type 1 but it is inevitable that NGS will eventually make it obsolete. Until then, the authors make their case convincingly through this opinion article.
