It is a well written manuscript focused on use of Sanger technology in genetic diagnosis. Currently, despite to NGS technology allows a cost-effective analysis of hundreds genes in a reduced time, Sanger sequencing remains as gold standard for validation of variants identified using NGS, segregation of variants in family members, and analysis of small genes, such as KCNJ2.
