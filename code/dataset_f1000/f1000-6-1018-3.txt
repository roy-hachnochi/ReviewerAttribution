The review entitled "MicroRNAs in the development and neoplasia of the mammary gland" has briefly presented recent studies in the relevant studies in mammary gland microRNAs field. This kind of review is very good for scientists to update their knowledge without reading informative reviews. However, minor comments are below to make the review suitable for indexing: Introduction: More information is needed to understand the mechanism of microRNA roles in the mammary gland. miRs in mammary gland: Along with Alsaweed et al. study, Modepalli et al. (2014, BMC Genomics) has provided evidence that mammary gland is the main source of microRNAs in milk. Therefore, milk microRNAs are not considered as nutrients as stated, so better to not use "whether they are only simple nutrients". Examples about the milk microRNAs are important as the mammary gland is synthesized and secreted milk. miRs controlling lactation: Highly expressed microRNAs in milk/mammary gland have different roles in synthesize various milk nutrient contents such as triacylglycerols and lactose, so the role of highly expressed microRNAs must be linked to related functions (Alsaweed et al 2016, PLoS ONE and IJMS). Li et al. (2012, BMC Genomics) has presented very important aspects of the microRNAs and lactation performance. miRs controlling involution and breast cancer: Zhang et al. (2013, Nature Cell Biology) has provided breast cancer inhibits progression by microRNAs expression roles, so it must be considered in this review.
