This is a simple, small prospective RCT addressing the issue of scrubbing and prepping patients undergoing hernia repair ("anaesthetised" group) before or after ("awake" group) induction of general anaesthesia. The manuscript is clearly written and provide adequate details about methodology, including a power calculation. The results show that the only statistically significant advantage an "awake" approach was less time in recovery by 9 (48 v 39) minutes. None of the other variables were significantly different although there was a trend to less anaesthetic usage in the awake group associated with a 4 (64 v 60) minutes reduction in anaesthetic time. Whether or not there is a meaningful advantage of pre-anaesthetic scrubbing and prepping is not confirmed by this study, perhaps because it was underpowered, and this is reflected in the authors' conclusions. Nonetheless, this is an interesting study and one which may stimulate larger studies in different surgical areas. For this reason, publication would be worthwhile.
