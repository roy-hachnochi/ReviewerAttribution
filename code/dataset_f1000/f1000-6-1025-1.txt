Riemondy and colleagues have made a valuable tool, `valr`, available to the general public, one which deserves much merit for bringing modern R idioms from the `tidyverse` into the world of genomic research. As a fellow bioinformatician who has struggled with the idiosyncrasies of the aforementioned tools for interval manipulation in R, `valr` addresses many of the usability issues associated with these legacy methods by fundamentally altering the user experience. Consequently, there are two main advantages to adopting `valr` for interval manipulation in R: ease of writing, and ease of reading, code. Thus, this referee wholeheartedly endorses `valr`, and hopes to see more work that brings many of the `tidyverse` philosophies over to working with genomics in R. Nonetheless, there is some room for improvement of the associated manuscript to better help explain the philosophy and usage of `valr`, and its place amongst the many tools for the manipulation of genomic intervals. Firstly, in the introduction, it is mentioned that there exist `IRanges` methods that utilize the S4 convention, whereas `valr` utilizes a less formal schema where 3 columns, `chrom`, `start`, `end`, are present in the `data_frame` object. Indeed, it may be of use to expand upon such design choices that were made, and what advantages/disadvantages are made in using this less formal schema, and any other highly pertinent choices that affect user experience. In addition, one line mentions integration with other `tidyverse` tools, and should expand upon this with either one to a few specific examples or explain this point in more detail. Additionally, it should also be pointed out how `valr` builds upon these existing toolkits, and either expands upon/adopts their conventions. One way might be to create a table comparing functions between `valr`/bedtools/GenomicRanges might be helpful for a reader to see that the toolkit will be easily adoptable. Indeed, its mentioned that the syntax is similar to bedtools in the use cases, and might be good to mention in the introduction as well. Thus, an expanded introduction/additional section explaining the uniqueness of `valr` would help to better "sell" when one should use `valr` and why. In performing benchmarking, it would be useful to include one or two leading R tools, such as GenomicRanges, into the calculations, as this is likely how many R programmers currently perform interval manipulations natively in R, and I suspect would likely show an impressive performance improvement by relation. `valr` presents an exciting new development in the R+Genomics realm, and this referee is hopeful that this sort of development helps fuel further `tidyomics` tools for R bound together by a cohesive philosophy, great user experience, and pointed utility.
