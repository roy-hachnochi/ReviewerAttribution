The authors provide the rationale and study design for the implementation and evaluation of a digitally-enable care pathway for the recognition and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). The paper is well-written and the topic is timely given the impact of AKI on short and long-term outcome. This program has the potential to radically change how patients with the earliest signs of AKI are managed and the team should be applauded for these efforts. I had just a few minor queries: It might be nice to show the actual protocol for intervention based upon the NICE guidelines Is the timeline to intervention once the alert triggered standardized? I am not sure I understand the rationale behind including Barnet General Hospital as compared to RFH- it would seem that the patient mix (cardiac surgery, etc) might be very different between these centers. Is there any methodology used to match causes of AKI and severity of illness? Overall, this is an exciting study with potentially profound implications for care of patients with AKI.
