I agree with the previous referee that the authors have developed a nice user interface to the SuperPC algorithm, which should make its application accessible to many experimental scientists. I read the manuscript and I have little to no comments to make on its contents. However, I have tried to use the tool myself on my own dataset and was unable to get it to work. I had formatted my data exactly as in supplied example input files, even with the exact same column names. After submitting my data, I only got an unhelpful error message "ERROR: An error has occurred. Check your logs or contact the app author for clarification." I could not see any logs or any other means of finding out why the program didn't work. If the problem lies with the formatting of the input files, the authors need to provide some more documentation on the format of the input data, including column names, newline convention, etc. Given that I presently cannot verify that the tool is working properly, I therefore cannot accept the manuscript for indexing.
