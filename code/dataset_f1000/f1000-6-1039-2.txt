The authors describe a software package for interactive (via a shiny webapp) use of the superpc R package. This work will likely make the methods in the superpc package available to users who are unable to work in R. My primary criticism of this work is that there does not seem to be a clear description of the methodology to which GAC provides GUI access. I understand that these methods were not developed by the authors of this paper; however, if the target audience are clinician scientists, it is doubtful that will have read the original paper 1 . A lay description of the method would greatly improve this manuscript. I also have a few minor criticisms of the article: The authors write, “Currently, prognosis and outcome predictions are solely based on clinical factors.” This seems to dismiss a lot of recent work in this area. On a related note, the most recent paper cited is from 2004. The numeric output of the GAC shiny app is often unformatted R output. For example, on the Super PC Binary Outcome tab below the box plots. It would be better to provide formatted results (e.g. using knitr::kable). Also, the p-values (and other numeric outputs) should likely be rounded to a number of significant digits that conveys the precision of the values. There are several grammatical errors. For example: “The researcher can also specify how many numbers to test to check which the optimal threshold is.” The superPC method is referred to in a variety of ways; it would be good to pick one of these: “Our GAC tool enables the user to perform a SuperPC analysis...” “... super pc analysis can be performed on both continuous …” “We have extended this tool to include super PC…” “Figure 2. SuperPC continuous outcome”
