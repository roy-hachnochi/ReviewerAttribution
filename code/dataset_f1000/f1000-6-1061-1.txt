This article is nicely written and the methodology is clearly explained. There is a clear rationale to develop the technique that the authors are presenting. The telemetry techniques used in cardiovascular research on animals are contributing to animal welfare (reduction and refinement alternatives), and are reducing overall animal research costs. Some articles describe the technique in small animal models but very few examples of its use in large animals are available in the literature. As the paper only includes 3 cases, one of which died before data acquisition, this report should be considered as the very early learning curve of the technique presented. The surgical approach described included a rib resection to allow sufficient exposure to the structures of interest. I wonder if performing two thoracotomies (in the 3 rd and 4 th or 4 th and 5 th intercostal spaces) would maybe alleviate the need for a rib resection, which is known to be a potentially painful procedure. It may also be possible to consider an hybrid approach that would allow a device to be implanted in the pulmonary artery (PA) using right heart catheterization for PA pressure measurement combined with minimally invasive surgical placement of the bipotential leads and pressure sensor. The animals were given buprenorphine postoperatively. Have they been pain scored to determine that buprenorphine was sufficient and that stronger opioids were not needed? Calves are considered pray animals and are therefore expressing pain a more concealed manner which may give an initial false impression that their pain level is low. It would be interesting to know how long the authors think the devices surgically placed will last in a growing calf. Working with other animal models (such as pig) the growth of the animal has to be taken in consideration for any chronic study- I presume it would be the same for a study in calves?
