Carlos de Lannoy, Dick de Ridder, and Judith Risse have put in a huge amount of effort in improving their review of nanopore sequencing. I'm satisfied that the manuscript is now sufficiently close to describing the current state of nanopore sequencing technology, particularly when considering the level of detail present in the discussions of different aspects of the technology. While I think it's important to make reviews as current as is possible, I understand that it's also important to make sure that the information is accurate; trying to predict where ONT technology will be at the time of publication can be an exercise in futility. In light of this, I provide here some minor corrections / suggestions for the text. These represent my attempt at a comprehensive nit-picking of what has been discussed in the manuscript, rather than a selection of demonstrative comments as in my previous review. "its size, roughly that of a cellphone" Nick Loman has used "office stapler" previously, which I think is a closer comparison "yields up to 5 Gbases of raw sequenced data" The current [?unconfirmed] MinION Yield record is 18 Gb https://twitter.com/ZaminIqbal/status/939234111339880448 The current record reported in the semi-private ONT community PoreBoard is 15.7 Gb "second generation and SMRT sequencing methods do require some form of labeling of nucleotides" Be careful with this description. The IonTorrent sequencing process doesn't use labelled nucleotides, but still depends on a specific nucleotide model due to the process of nucleotide flow during sequencing. I prefer to say that nanopore sequencing is an observational process that has a minimal dependence on models for signal capture. "[Amplification by PCR] is mandatory for Sanger and SGSmethods" Illumina/TruSeq has an amplification-free protocol https://support.illumina.com/downloads/truseq-dna-pcr-free-protocol-guide-15075699.html strictly, amplication is still used for that via bridge amplification on the flow cell, but that's amplifying a single short sequence per cluster, and biases associated with selective PCR amplification are therefore substantially reduced. "the maximum read length produced by the MinION is... only paralleled by SMRT sequencing" Current read-length record for MinION is ~970kb https://twitter.com/martinalexsmith/status/923894083000483840 even at the fastest PacBio sequencing speed of 2.5 bases/s, 970kb would take over 4 days to sequence, which is far in excess of the maximum Sequel run length. MinION sequencing time for a 970kb read is about 40 minutes (at 450 bases/s). https://twitter.com/OmicsOmicsBlog/status/910163516191109120 "Solid-state nanopores... are made by burning openings in a synthetic membrane" Somewhat related: see Kerstin Gpfrich's PhD thesis, which discusses nanopores constructed from DNA, embedded into lipid membranes. It's sort of a half-way point between fully biological nanopores and solid-state nanopores. https://t.co/7WtwMgM8nt Figure 5 is much improved; thanks. "much smaller with respect to the well diameter (about 10 m)" Sequencing wells are closer to 110Î¼m in width https://twitter.com/gringene_bio/status/939965835350745088 https://twitter.com/gringene_bio/status/938904193313554433 [from one of Clive Brown's presentations] "Chiron (v0.2) performs similarly to Albacore v1.1.2" Note: Ryan Wick has updated his analysis to include Chiron v0.3, which produces much more accurate consensus assemblies. "The source code... is currently only open to developer users." clarification: "users who have signed a restricted-distribution developer agreement with ONT" "due to the error-prone nature of the reads" For now, I prefer to assume that the errors are mostly in the basecallers, rather than the reads themselves. I acknowledge that I could be wrong on this, and leave the distinction as a moot point. "after polishing without methylationawareness" - "after polishing without methylation-awareness"
