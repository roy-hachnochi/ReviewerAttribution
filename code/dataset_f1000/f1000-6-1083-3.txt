Carlos de Lannoy, Dick de Ridder, and Judith Risse have written a technical review paper of MinION sequencing. This is a challenging task due to the high rate of MinION consumable obsolescence, and the breadth of use cases. Unfortunately I feel that this challenge has not been met in their paper, which appears to be a scattered mixture of discussions of differing recency with no cohesive story threading them together. I think it is especially important that a review paper of MinION technology is as current as possible, because it has the potential to be used extensively by others as an indication of the quality of sequencing at a particular point in time. I should perhaps point out that the main thing I found the most frustrating to read was a reference to R9 as current technology, and my other comments are likely coloured by me spotting this in my first scan through the article. Here are some additional comments about the content of the paper. This is not a comprehensive review, and should only be used as a guide to the areas of concern I have with the content: Title: "Coming of age" -- overlaps with Sara Goodwin's Nature Reviews Genetics paper [doi:10.1038/nrg.2016.49], which is also a review paper on sequencing technology (including nanopore). See, for example, this image: [https://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v17/n6/fig_tab/nrg.2016.49_F5.html] A search for "coming of age" and nanopore returns another paper: [http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2007/mb/b702845h] The paper talks about "current" nanopore technology as R9, which was discontinued last year in preference to R9.4. Shortly before this, the paper discusses solid state nanopores for a review paper, when there is no commercially-available product. This is despite mentioning the introduction of 1D technology in May 2017, which was introduced after R9.4 pores. The paper references internal nanopore community technical documentation, which is unlikely to be available to general readers of the article (and particularly not those who are considering its use). "The exact start and end of the hairpin is not always clear from the signal" -- I disagree with this. While current software may have difficulty interpreting the start/end, the location is obvious when looking at the raw signal. It is surprising to see this shortly before referencing our chimeric reads paper, where we give visual examples of the raw signal where the characteristic harpins are annotated. Figure 5: I like the idea of this figure. It's uncommon for people to give a visual indication of multiple pores and the MUX switching. However, some changes (and/or different annotation) are warranted. Using colours for both the mux type and the QC error is distracting; I would recommend using a hatch pattern to indicate failed pores. The pores are much larger than their actual size relative to the well size; this should be stated in the legend. Pores can also fail QC due to the membrane breaking, due to blocked pores, and presumably other reasons; the QC check is not only counting pores. Figure 6: There is enough event-annotated nanopore data available that mock data should not be necessary. Spikes and within-event signal variation that I am used to seeing in raw signal data are not present in this figure. "Any comparison in this chapter" -- might want to change that 'chapter' to a 'paper'. Canu is now published in Genome Research: [dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.215087.116] The nanopolish algorithm has now been improved such that it takes substantially less time for v0.7: [http://simpsonlab.github.io/2017/06/30/nanopolish-v0.7.0/] The paper makes many statements around the accuracy of base-calling and assembly solutions which [mostly] ignores post-transducer base-calling. I would like to see a review paper that (if possible) concentrates on post-transducer software, which would probably mean discarding discussion on HMM-based callers.
