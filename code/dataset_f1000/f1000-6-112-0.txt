I agree fully that MTD should not be the only goal of dose finding. The paper nicely pointed that out. The author seems to suggest using an optimization approach (i.e., Newton-Raphson) rather than a model-based approach for achieving individualized dosing. There is no concrete design being proposed, or at least it is unclear to me how to design a trial based on the contents in the paper. Also, I think the paper can be more concise and needs some more clear flow on the statistics and mathematical modelling. It is expected that a probability model (or an algorithm) is presented with an inference procedure. There are a few models proposed in this paper, but their relationship to the inference is a bit unclear. I would recommend a subsection of “Algorithm” that would connect different parts of the paper into a coherence piece. Otherwise, the paper clearly discusses an important issue in dose finding.
