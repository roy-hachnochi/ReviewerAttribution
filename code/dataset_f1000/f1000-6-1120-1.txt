I have gone through the review article. To me, the author has taken a timely initiative to review on maternal and perinatal death review system and also he is experienced enough to write review on this topic. He has described the total MPDR system in Bangladesh from its initiation to scale up, benefits and challenges. But he didnâ€™t mention in the whole paper what was the purpose of this review paper. Also some more comparison with the maternal and perinatal death review system of other countries should be added. The author could include a table showing the findings of different articles (used in reference) in short regarding MPDR, so that the readers can get a clear view of the review articles at a glance. Also the conclusion should be modified by adding the advantage of this review paper, not only of the death review system, I mean how this review paper will bring benefits to other researchers or how can it be used further in future. Also I have some corrections mentioned below (the correction lines are numbered as in the pdf file) Introduction Last paragraph, line 1 - "This reviewed" needs to be corrected to "This review" Last paragraph, line 4 - " This review" needs to be corrected to "The review" Last paragraph line 9 - "full text of articles" needs to be corrected to "full text articles" Inception of the system in Bangladesh First paragraph line 2 - "though" needs to be corrected to "through" Last paragraph line 3 - "though" needs to be corrected to "through" Last paragraph line 4 - "neonatal death" needs to be corrected to "neonatal deaths" Scale up of the system Second paragraph line 18 - "ministry of health and family welfare" needs to be corrected to "Ministry of Health and Family Welfare" A unique approach First paragraph line 4 - "though" needs to be corrected to "through"
