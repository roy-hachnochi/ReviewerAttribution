Excellent paper. Well written. Well researched. Excellent methodology and scientific protocol. The authors should be proud of their work. I would like to see a comparison of this to ErCrYSGG as a next step. My only comment is the age of the lambs-was the age appropriate and comparative to a human adult? If the age of the lamb was young-comparative to a child or teen, the results might be quite different with a more mature specimen.
