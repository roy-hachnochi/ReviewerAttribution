I thank the authors for addressing most of the issues. However, two problems still appear. The authors say that "selecting 2 PCs the performance is slightly better and more stable (compare Figure 1 and Figure 2 against Figure S2 and Figure S3 )" than with 3 PCs. When I compare Figure 1 with Figure S2, it seems to me that 3 PCs are at least not worse than 2 PCs, and maybe even slightly better on the basis of smaller difference between runs. Thus, without a quantitative measure it cannot be said that performance of 2 PCs is better, it may be only said that 3 PCs do not provide improvement over 2 PCs (though it is not obvious from the plots), and if 3 PCs scheme has higher computational demands, it may also be mentioned. The compound standardisation procedure (Supplementary Methods) looks as it is taken from a different manuscript. For example, compound activity is mentioned, although not used in this study. It is also not stated that standardisation procedure was not applied to DrugBank (at least to the SDF file available in the supplementary dataset).
