The authors report on their participation in the 2014 Teach-Discover-Treat (TDT) initiative. The goal of the TDT is to encourage the creation of practical tutorials for computational chemistry. The authors present the two workflow tutorials that they developed for Challenge 1 of the competition. The challenge involved three tasks: analyzing single-point phenotypic HTS results and follow-up dose-response data for a subset of the compounds, building a predictive model of the anti-malaria activity and using that predictive model to select compounds from a set of commercially available compounds for prospective testing. The first workflow presented by the authors only used the HTS data for its predictions and the second used both the HTS and dose-response data. Overall I think that the paper is a thorough and easy-to-follow description of the methods and results of the two workflows, but there a few items that I feel require revisions. Page 5, a brief description of what "heterogeneous classifier fusion" is would be appreciated Page 6. The authors should list the total number of features that they use as descriptors in workflow 2. Page 6. When building the random forests and extremely randomized trees of varying sizes, the ensembles of trees with 6000 trees (the largest number tested) were shown to preform best. The authors should explain why they did not try a higher number of trees. Page 6. In the "Task 2..." paragraph. The authors should state what the resulting linear combination of the models was. The ratio would be interesting to know. Page 8, in the paragraph starting "The results for the remaining...". It states in the text that there were 9 compounds predicted by workflow 2 that tested, but in Table 5, there are 10 compounds from workflow 2 listed. This should be corrected or clarified. Page 8 and Table 5. As the compounds from Workflow 1 were selected randomly due to an error, is it meaningful to list their rankings at all?
