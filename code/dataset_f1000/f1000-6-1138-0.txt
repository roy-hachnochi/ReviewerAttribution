The authors present an alternative peak caller for HITS-CLIP data. While the idea is interesting and the examples are compelling, there is not sufficient analysis presented to determine the utility of YODEL. Major: The bench-marking is insufficient to evaluate the difference between YODEL and PIRANHA. The primary figures only have single examples. There needs to be a transcriptome-wide analysis to evaluate the performance. The analysis should include some type of specificity/sensitivity analysis. It would be instructive to design "true" positives and "false" positive. Generally the "TRUE" positives could be thought of as miRNAs that are expressed in that system vs those that are not. Additionally, one can design 'decoy' seeds that are di-nucleotide shuffled seeds if the expressed miRNAs (that don't match the expressed miRNA seeds) and evaluate the number of counts relative to the actual expressed miRNA seed. In the case of the KO, one could examine if the peaks called from WT data that contain seed matches to the KO miRNAs change in coverage (WT vs KO), particularly relative to compared to the peaks that contain seed matches to the expressed non-KO miRNAs. Comparing YODEL and PIRANHA in this analysis would be quite instructive. Minor: In the intro the authors describe three properties of YODEL. The first was: "Incorporate strand specificity (Piranha does this, but many other CHIP-SEQ peak callers do not)" I think this should be removed. Any peak finder for RNA interactions needs to be strand-specific. I do not know why CHIP-SEQ peak callers are even mentioned, unless the authors believe this could be beneficial for CHIP-seq data. If so, they would need to compare to common CHIP-seq peak finders, though that would be a distraction in my opinion.
