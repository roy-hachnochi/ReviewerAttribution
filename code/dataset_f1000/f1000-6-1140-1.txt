I think the case report fulfills diagnostic criteria for Adrenal Incidentaloma as Kim and Zeiger et al. rightfully have pointed it out. The clinical case was well studied according to accepted guidelines. I consider that the manuscript is well written. Perhaps the only thing that would call my attention is in the Discussion section since it seems to me unnecessarily extensive, but it depends on journal requirements and policies. One suggestion in the abstract: Use Arabic number to describe the type of Diabetes.
