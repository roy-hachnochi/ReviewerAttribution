In a short research note, Yeverino-Gutierrez and colleagues report interesting data on the representation of women as editors in chief in environmental science journals. A few major aspects should be clarified: In the abstract, the authors should state some specific results of their analysis (no. of journals, no. of editors, % female etc.) The manuscript is indeed very short and would benefit from some greater detail for all sections. The numbers mentioned in the text are discordant to the numbers in the table (e.g. 103 journals analyzed vs 148). Were data missing and if yes, why? I think it would be better to use tertiles in the analysis of impact factor in order to have similar group size as opposed to an arbitrary cutoff for the impact factor. Limitations should be added (only one time point, only one category, etc.) Add the used test to the table legend. A few minor typos/grammar errors are present PS: Were any efforts made to contact the journals and obtain more detailed data from them or have more information about the process of assignment for editor in chief? Are the authors aware of data on how the percentage of women in scientists or people working in this field is? To date, the category "Environmental Sciences" has well over 200 journals. Were indeed only 148 listed in 2015??
