I compliment the authors on this study. It is fascinating to see the group from various parts of the world collaborate on this project. - The project/manuscript is a much-needed one with the rapid growth of social media in society. There are indications that access to social media platforms have increased dramatically in the last decade and further democratizes information sharing. - The authors use a novel approach to look at the content of various social media posts in Twitter regarding health and determine that the readability of the posts are much better than conventional health education methods. - The article is well written and easily readable. I have a couple of minor corrections to recommend. 1) Highlight that this analysis is particular to Twitter. The authors have done this, but I would recommend reinforcing this as the title indicates Social Media ( which has different platforms). 2) The issue then is possibly of brevity rather than the platform. I would recommend that the authors highlight this in the discussion too. 3) I recommend that the authors highlight the other issues in understanding health-related information, including the assimilation of the information and behavior change that needs to follow and that further studies should look at this. Again, my compliments to the authors.
