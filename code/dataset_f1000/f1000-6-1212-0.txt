The authors set out to investigate a possible in vitro role for Vitamin C in reducing Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) formation in sickle cell disease patients. Comments Abstract Were there matched controls? How were they selected? Introduction The study ignored the role of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase status which plays an important role in protecting red cells against oxidative stress; especially since a significant proportion of the population at the study site will be G6PD deficient. G6PD plays an important role in the production and removal of ROS. Methods The sample size is rather small, how was this determined? What was the study design? The inclusion / exclusion criteria did not state if the patients were in steady state or not and if so how was this determined? The calculation of the baseline ROS prediction score is not clear. Results It is known that obesity is associated with increased ROS generation, thus, addition of data from overweight patients and the 4 patients with 'unknown' BMI to those of patients with normal BMI could have adversely affected the results. These patients should be excluded in calculating the association between BMI and ROS. The finding that men produced more ROS may be related to their G6PD status.
