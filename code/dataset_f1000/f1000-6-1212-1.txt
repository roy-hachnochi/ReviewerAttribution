The authors measured the in vitro effect of vitamin C on reactive oxygen species generation in RBC of patients with Sickle Cell Disease. Comments The data are not entirely novel. The authors should cite previous studies on the oxidative status of RBC from patients with sickle cell disease and their response to antioxidants, including Vit. C. For example, Amer et al. 1 The experimental approach is not clear. For example: Abstract “matched controls” – here and elsewhere – what does it mean? RBC of SCA patients not treated with Vit C? what about normal individuals? Materials and reagents “Blood transfusion rate” – Provide data. When were the blood samples obtained? Before/after transfusion? “Cell staining and flow cytometry“ – How were the cells analyzed and ROS determined? “number of ROS per ul” – not clear. “per ul” of what? Before or after washing? Why not calculate the ROS per washed RBC? Relationship between baseline ROS count and patient characteristics “Baseline ROS count (BRC) refers to number of ROS per ul before any red cell intervention.” What does “before any red cell intervention” mean? "Baseline ROS prediction score" – Explain "prediction score" Other comments Introduction “Paulson et al. ” – Change to Pauling et al. “ Paulson et al. demonstrated a direct quantitative effect of the sickle gene pair on sufferers 2 .” – explain. “…during the reperfusion state…” – explain. Table 1. Baseline characteristics of study participants. The parameters should be shown per males and females. Figure 3. - What does “positive control” mean?
