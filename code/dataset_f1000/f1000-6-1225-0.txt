It is difficult to evaluate antibiotic overuse without reference to locally available guidelines on prophylaxis. There are mixed thoughts on the timing of prophylactic antibiotics 1 - 30 minutes prior to incision vs after clamping the cord - what do the local guidelines recommend? It is not clear what was done in patients with preterm rupture of membranes. The design seemed more of a retrospective records review than a cross sectional study. The results don't spur future practice as they can not be pegged against current guidelines. Recommendations: a. The study could benefit from additional information on local guidelines on antibiotic prophylaxis during Caesarean section to enable the reader to compare adherence to guidelines. b. I have significant reservations about the study despite its importance in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance.
