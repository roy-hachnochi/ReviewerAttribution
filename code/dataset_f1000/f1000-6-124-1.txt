This is an exciting endeavor to address the reproducibility crisis by providing re-executable neuroimaging publication. This study is well designed, analyzed and written, with the analysis can be easily replicated. I only have some minor comments. One may would like to follow this paper to try to make their publication re-executable. As the first step is sharing data, the authors may would like to provide some guidance to share data. As the paper entitled “very simple”, the analysis here is structural image analysis without any statistical group comparison. I wholehearted look forward to the authors’ future progress on functional imaging. The flexibility of functional imaging is much more than structural imaging, thus the authors may would like to provide some discussion on that. Group comparison and thresholding (with multiple comparison correction) are challenging to be reproduced, thus recently have been questioned a lot (including Eklund et al. , 2016 PNAS 1 ). The authors’ re-executable strategy may have some potential to prevent lots of p-hacking practices, thus deserve some discussion.
