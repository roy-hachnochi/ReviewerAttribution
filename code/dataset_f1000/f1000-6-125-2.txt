The experimental set up was not properly written. In the abstract, the authors indicated a split-split plot design. In MM, there were four factors including (i) lateral spacing levels (0.8 and 1.2m), (2) depth of irrigation (5-10 and 15-20 cm), (3) solar powered and well operated irrigation, and (4) variety (TNRH 180, JKRH 3333 and ADT(R)45). However, there was no info on experimental design, plot size, and no. replications used for this study. Furthermore, it is not clear how these factors were analyzed. The authors showed the main factor only. There were no information on interaction effects among source of drip irrigation, variety, and drip treatments. Without examining such interactions, the authors could not draw the conclusion that JKRH3333 is best suitable material under drip irrigated conditions, and 0.8m lateral distance laid out at 5â€“10cm depth sub-surface drip may proliferated more roots at subsurface soil layer with a yield increment in rice. There might have been interaction among variety x drip irrigation on traits measured in this study. The authors could report the effect of each factor on traits in the results section rather than describing the results in each trait for different factors. Then, the interaction effect should be highlighted. If there is significant interaction, detailed results should be shown (e.g. if there is variety x drip treatment on yield, yield of each variety in different drip treatment should be shown). Some of the results were not described in the results section but the discussion section (e.g. figures 2 and 3). These should be reported in the results section.
