First of all I want to thank Abidullah Khan (Pakistan) for his punctual answers, and in the same way I take this opportunity to applaud his openness to academic debate. I want to add the following: This point was appropriately addressed. This point was appropriately addressed. This point was appropriately addressed. However, I am not sure if we are falling into a conflict of interest by including an article written by the reviewer under the suggestion of the same reviewer. If possible, I would like to leave this decision to another reviewer in order to avoid any conflict of interest. This point was appropriately addressed. Taking into account that you also used a formula to determine the appropriate sample size for detecting a difference between the means of two samples, I think it would be good to cite the previous report on which this calculation was based (i.e., the article from where you got the values to make your sample size estimation). Likewise, I think it would be good to know how much is "more than 0.8" (power). This point was appropriately addressed. I agree with your proposal, so lets leave them in two separate tables. The final SLEDAI score is an ordinal variable 1 , so I consider that it would be more appropriate to evaluate the correlation between this variable and MPV using Spearman's rho. This point was appropriately addressed. I do not know if you are close to the word limit. If this is not the case, perhaps it would also be worth mentioning the studies in adults 2 that yielded results similar to the study in patients with juvenile lupus 3 . This point was appropriately addressed. An additional final comment: 12.The following lines in the Discussion seem particularly bold to me, perhaps it would be worth rephrasing them: a) "Thus, it can be argued that, as an indicator of disease activity in patients with SLE, MPV was as effective as both ESR and SLEDAI-2000". b) "Therefore, we recommend MPV as a global marker of disease activity in patients with SLE".

Reply: Spearman's rho has been used to assess any relationship of MPV and ESR with SLEDAI. However, the relation of MPV with ESR has been assessed through Pearson's correlation test. 10: The Indian study has now been referred to. The study by Yavuz S et al had already been cited. Additional comments: The final two sentences pointed to (a and b), have been rephrased. I hope it works this time. Thanks again.
