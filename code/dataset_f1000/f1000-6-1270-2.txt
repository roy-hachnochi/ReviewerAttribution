The article is interesting, but the presented analysis only is descriptive, losing the relevance and applicability. I suggest that Authors enlarge the analysis, which should evaluate the potential risk factors. The conclusion is adequate, but only they could describe the consumption of traditional alcoholic beverages. The introduction is not enough to explain the problem compared to the use of alcoholic beverages. In the methods, authors should clarify the patterns of consumption, the frequencies of consumption per week or monthly. The data analysis only centered in the descriptive the mothers consumption (perceptions), accessibility and perception of risk, but they did not analyze the association or relation with childs age, weight, height and school grade, household income and number members.
