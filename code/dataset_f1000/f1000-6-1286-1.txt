The authors provide an interesting case report of an aged individual with significant comorbidities undergoing an intermediate risk surgical procedure. The operative and optimization pathway are discussed in appropriate detail. The authors are also to be commended for including the patient's health status 30 months after the surgery, as such information is clearly relevant to surgical decision-making in patients with significant comorbidities. The report would benefit from the following additional details and suggested edits: The case presented does not justify the statement "In conclusion, laparoscopic liver resections are safe and feasible in older patients, even when major comorbidities are present, provided that there is a careful therapeutic planning." Describing a medical practice as safe implies a very low event rate, which cannot be demonstrated with a single successful patient outcome. The patient's medical comorbidities are listed. However, important functional details such as the patient's functional independence, metabolic functional capacity, and COPD symptom burden are not described. Such details would be critically informative of the comorbidity disease burden, frailty status, and anticipated complication rate of the patient. Additionally, inclusion of other key diagnostic information, such as serum creatinine and hemoglobin, would be relevant along with the above information for predicting pulmonary and acute kidney injury risk. Without inclusion of all of this information, it is difficult for the reader to truly appreciate the risk level of this patient.
