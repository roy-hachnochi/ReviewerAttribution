In this study, authors conducted a bibliometric analysis of articles published from 1980 to 2016, in the top seven journals of child and adolescent psychiatry. The paper is well written but can only be accepted has after these changes. Specifically: In the Abstract Section, Conclusions is just a restatement of the Results Section. I believe the paper has much more to offer than what is mentioned in Conclusions. Discussion section should be rewritten to highlight some future research directions also. This will definitely improve the quality of the paper. For Visualization of important nodes (Figure 4), authors can use other software like Gephi, as the figure is not depicting the results properly. It is very difficult for readers to understand the concept.
