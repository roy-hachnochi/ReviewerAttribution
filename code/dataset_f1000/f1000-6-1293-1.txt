Excellent work by authors in reviewing the literature on child and adolescent psychiatry. Would be important to mention in the limitations that quite a few child and adolescent psychiatry articles are published in journals for paediatrics and general psychiatry. Secondly Clinics of North America usually publish articles which are usually review of the literature about different issues.
