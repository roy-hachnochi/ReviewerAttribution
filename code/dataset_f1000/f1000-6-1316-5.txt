In the present work, the authors developed a novel method to detect DNA binding activity of CLOCK-BMAL1 complex with a fixed DNA probe containing an E-Box repeat. The method is based on a simple procedure and could be useful for studies including high-throughput investigation of the regulatory mechanism on CLOCK-BMAL1. It is desirable to compare the new method with previously established ones, e.g., EMSA and ChIP-PCR in parallel experiments by using the same samples. Then, readers could easily understand advantage/disadvantage of the present assay, in terms of detection limit, the range, and sensitivity etc. The data in Figure 3 demonstrate enhanced DNA-binding activities of CLOCK:BMAL1 by pre-treatment with lambda phosphatase and CKI-epsilon/delta inhibitor (PF670462). We are interested in a potential change of the CLOCK-BMAL1 activity under previously described conditions. For example, we reported several treatments that reduce the transactivation ability of CLOCK-BMAL1 complex: MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of BMAL1, phospho-mimic mutation in CLOCK, reduced CLOCK-BMAL1 dimerization under CaMKII inhibition [1,2,3]
