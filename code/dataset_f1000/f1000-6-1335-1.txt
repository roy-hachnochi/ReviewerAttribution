This is a nice and comprehensive review of the studies that assess the strengths and weaknesses of the peer review process. Although there are no new conclusions, it does reveal or highlight the three major issues that plague our mechanism to dole out research funding and the use of peer review. The first is fundamental - without a clear and agreed upon definition of what constitutes the "best" science, or the "best" outcomes, it will be impossible to know whether the grant adjudication process is meeting, or can ever meet, its objectives. Second, the paper highlights what is often overlooked, and this is the real cost in time of writing funding proposals. Although scientists often manufacture a narrative that writing grants is good for them (for example, making you catch up on the literature), the real costs to the system are rarely factored in. I think this paper did a nice job in highlighted this issue. Finally, I would have liked a greater discussion on what is an amazing disconnect. All the empirical evidence highlights the deficiencies of the process to allocate grant funding. It is clear that it is neither scientifically founded, nor evidence-based. Yet one of the only strongly supported aspects of the peer review process is that is has the strong support of the community. I find this fascinating.
