Insulin resistance (IR) is the root cause for several major metabolic disorders and identifying individuals with IR is right now a public health priority as this will pave way for appropriate prevention and management of type 2 diabetes and associated non-communicable diseases. While Euglycemic-Hyperinsulinemic Clamp which is considered as the gold standard for the determination of IR is an invasive and impractical procedure for risk assessment in the general population, the measurement of IR by Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) also requires costly tests like insulin assays which are difficult in the low-resource settings. In this context, assessing IR and metabolic risk via triglyceride-glucose index (TGI) as detailed in this manuscript receives some attention and importance. The main advantages of the TGI is that both the triglyceride and glucose measurements are cost-effective and hence affordable in epidemiological and screening programs to assess the relative cardiometabolic risk in the general populations and in the clinics. However, the manuscript should delineate several limitations of the study (as detailed below): As the study nature is of cross-sectional observation study design, it is difficult to evaluate a direct causal relationship. TGI may have limited inference when used in subjects with extremely high triglyceride levels. Extrapolating the findings of this study to other races or ethnicities should be interpreted cautiously; there might be a need for ethnic / race specific TGI cut-offs. TGI may suffer from confounding factors such as medications that lower mainly triglycerides. Authors should discuss these medication (statins, fenofibrate, omega-3 etc) effects. Also, TGI values could be confounded by diet and physical activity among the groups. Therefore, authors should discuss the role of diet (if FFQ is available) and physical activity in relation to cut-offs of TGI. These should be discussed.
