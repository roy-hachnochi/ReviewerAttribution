The research was developed on the concept of probiotics being microbes that enhance good health and thereby promote optimal utilization of feed. The authors have shown that use of probiotics can improve feed uptake by the fish thereby reducing the cost of production especially where the cost of feed in some places is on the high side. The title is most appropriate for the work and the Abstract gave a concise summary of the research work. Furthermore, the design and methods fit the work done. The analysis correctly explained what has been obtained from the designed work and appropriately reflects the topic studied. The Conclusion is balanced and has justified the basis of the results. Useful data with adequate information has been provided to warrant replication of the experiment elsewhere. Overall, the research has made a remarkable contribution by providing the first well documented information on positive advantage of use of probiotics in the culture of T. tambra .
