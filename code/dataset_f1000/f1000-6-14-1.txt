This review article is a timely ‘call-to-arms’ to clinicians caring for women suffering from endometriosis world-wide to utilise the Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonisation Project (EPHect). Published by the World Endometriosis Research Foundation (WERF) in 2014, EPHect provides a fundamental framework for collaborative international endometriosis research through global standardization of phenotypic data compilation and biological sample collection and storage. Concerned that the uptake of the EPHect has be sporadic and not uniform, the authors believe that the collection of “standardized detailed information”, using the standard surgical form (EPHect SSF) and standard endometriosis patient questionnaire (EPQ-S), should be ‘non-negotiable’ whenever surgery is undertaken for endometriosis. In practice, there are a number of challenges to the uptake of the EPHect which this review article has not addressed. Firstly, the time taken for busy clinicians and surgeons to complete the standard surgical form (SSF) is a potential impediment. Secondly, the completion of the standard endometriosis patient questionnaire (EPQ-S) or the minimum (EPG-M) by patient also requires motivation and time. Thirdly, the storage of the large amount of paper-based information is space-consuming. Fourthly, the transfer of information collected onto an electronic database is time-consuming, with privacy coding an issue. Finally, the storage, extraction, collation and analysis of data for the purpose of collaborative international research is likely going to be an expensive endeavour.
