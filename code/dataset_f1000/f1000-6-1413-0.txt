The purpose of the work should be described in more detail. No post hoc test was performed on the statistical evaluation. Discussion and result parts are given together. While the findings are given in detail, discussion of the data is not appropriate. The mechanisms of the possible toxic effects of aflatoxin should be discussed in detail. The mechanisms of the positive effects of Schiff base aromatic amino acids should also be considered in detail. For this reason, the discussion part is written insufficiently. The conclusion should be rearranged taking into account the scientific results.
