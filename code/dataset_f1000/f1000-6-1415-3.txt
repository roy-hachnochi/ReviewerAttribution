The researchers tackle an area of significant interest, rapid determination of bacterial species, especially associated with life threatening illness, using a relatively new approach, that of VOC analyses. In general the paper reads well. The analytical method for VOC analyses is ok. Could the authors confirm whether the cfu/ml count is approx. for the different species at the same time points to enable a good comparison of VOCs to be made. One major weakness to the work is that only one analysis for each species at one time point and media was undertaken, the literature gives examples of several analyses being undertaken for similar studies. The title is too ambitious, rather than diagnoses being purported, maybe an” initial study of…” would be more accurate. The authors could comment on how their research would ultimately fit into a clinical test, if the VOCs were to be analysed in breath, would the same volatile profile be expected? In the text it was stated that “Extensive studies were also performed by a phytochemist to determine if the compounds were organic” , some explanation would be good as to what this means. Some other matters, VOC abbreviation used twice in the abstract, also in quite a few places the chemical names have capital letters and are misspelt and merged with another word. In Results, what is uncommon determined by, some more discussion on stats…
