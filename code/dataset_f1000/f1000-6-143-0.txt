A very useful contribution to the literature to engage both supervisors and trainees alike. This paper addresses the importance of critically analysing our approach to surgical education and training while focusing on the theories of adult learning to guide such approach. Title is very appropriate and abstract summarises article sufficiently. Design of article is appropriate and in keeping with its attempt to summarise the existing theories of adult education and provides an excellent narrative of extending these theories into the context of operative surgery. The opinions presented are well constructed, balanced and based on foundation literature. Very well done. I make the following suggestions to improve the article. • Adult learning principles (page 3) are referred to as theories under its heading. Two paragraphs later the heading Theories of adult learning surfaces. This created a small degree of confusion. Could this be addressed to simplify reader dissonance. • The theory of “Experimental learning” seems similar to “Reflective learning”. Does the author feel that separating these into two theories enhances the paper? • The use of dot points throughout the paper is inconsistent. Especially the word following the dot point – sometimes listed as a capital letter sometimes not. • The term ‘Up-skilling’ is spelt differing ways throughout the article.
