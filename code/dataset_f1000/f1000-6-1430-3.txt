Prof. Kevin Black has provided an up-to-date and largely comprehensive summary of the current status of our knowledge concerning the phenomenology, natural history, etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of Tourette syndrome (TS). However, one important area that is largely missing concerns the findings from post-mortem studies of the brains of individuals with TS that have been conducted by Flora Vaccarino and her laboratory at Yale University. The most notable and highly-cited article from 2016 presents an analysis of the transcriptome of striatal tissue (caudate and putamen) from the brains of nine TS and nine matched normal control subjects (Lennington et al., 2016 1 ). The authors found 309 down-regulated and 822 up-regulated genes using a data-driven gene network analysis. More specifically, they identified 17 gene co-expression modules associated with TS. The top-scoring down-regulated module in TS was enriched for striatal interneuron transcripts. This finding confirmed earlier studies by the Vaccarino laboratory that had reported decreased numbers of cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons in the same brain regions (Kalathini et al., 2005; Kataoka et al., 2010 2 ). However, the top-scoring up-regulated module was enriched in immune-related genes, consistent with activation of microglia in patientsâ€™ striatum. While these findings confirm the earlier post-mortem studies using unbiased stereological techniques, they also point to the important role of neuroinflammation in TS pathophysiology. Indeed, a deeper understanding of neuroimmunology may well transform the field of neuropsychiatry and point to novel treatment approaches to TS and related disorders (Leckman Vaccarino, 2015 3 ).
