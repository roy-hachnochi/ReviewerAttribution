My comments and suggestions have been responded to adequately, but the author did not change the manuscript accordingly in all instances. Specifically I recommend to add the following study limitations to the discussion section: No checks are done for non‚Äêpublication, selective publication, and for other discrepancies between protocol and publication for the published studies. There is no requirement for studies to have been entered on the register before data collection starts. Similarly later changes to the entry in the register are not identifyable as such. The study did not attempt to quantify transparency nor review the methodological rigor of studies, but simply provides an overview of the study designs employed.
