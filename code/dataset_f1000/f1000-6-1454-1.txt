The article was reviewed for a different journal by myself previously, and rejected there. Most critics raised there were not improved in the present submission. The article still claims to present a global phylogeny of Droseraceae based on taxa sampled from India. However only 5 taxa of a genus with globally ca. 250 taxa occur in India. And only sequences from those taxa occurring in India were generated de novo , ALL other sequence data was taken from those published in Rivadavia et al. (2003) and Rivadavia et al. (2012). Interestingly, those previously published phylogenies did also include the 5 respective Indian taxa newly sampled here, thus none of the data presented here is actually new. The paper repeats the results of above-mentioned two articles, without adding any substantial new information. Additionally, some of the literature consulted is cited in wrong context, e.g. when stating “Apparently all palaeoendemics ( D. meristocaulis, D. burmannii, D. arcturi ) are scattered throughout the southern hemisphere and also in tropical America.” Rivadavia et al. (2003) CLEARLY show evidence that D. burmannii (and its sister D. sessilifolia ) is NOT a palaeoenemdic, and Rivadavia et al. (2012) do so for D. meristocaulis – both are cases of recent LDD, not old vicariance, thus cannot be palaeoendmics. ONLY D. arcturi can considered a palaeonedemic of the list of species presented here (in addition to D. regia from South Africa). In contrast, Dionaea and Aldrovanda , which can be considered palaeoendemic lineages, occur in the Northern Hemisphere.
