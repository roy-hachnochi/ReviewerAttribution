This manuscript is emphasized in a good way. However, it will benefit from some more revisions. Major points: I recommend the usage of standard HGVS nomenclature for documenting the detected variants. This will resolve the issue of different nucleotide position for the Q356R variant. Moreover, the novel V1736D need to be re-checked for its novelty after applying the standard HGVS nomenclature. The Q356R is widely regarded as polymorphism (Borg et al. (2010) 1 ), or at least of very minor risk. What the additional evidence provided by this paper giving it’s the evident lack of control population and functional study. I suggest designating this variant as polymorphism or at least as unclassified variant based on the bioinformatics tools. However, Hadjisavvas et al. (2002) 2 suggested that S1512I in combination with Q356R may be disease-associated, since these two missense mutations are simultaneously present only in this family, and in none of the other samples from the breast cancer or control groups. The V1736D variant need to be investigated more, at least in control populations. I seems to me it is very hard to say that a novel variant that is detected with a frequency of 3/10 (30%) is probably a pathogenetic mutation based only on bioinformatics studies. Thus verification on control populations will provide more information about this variant. Minor points: In many part of the manuscript there is many comments (The mutated residue is located in a domain), which domain and what is the predicted change on function? The introductory part about SNPs page 3, third paragraph, second sentence “These” I think refer to BRCA1 mutations, whereas the paragraph about SNPs. This is mainly because frameshift mutations are not part of SNPs. Please resolve. The PCR figure appears to have a smear. If no good image is available, this figure could be removed as DNA sequence chromatogram were provided.
