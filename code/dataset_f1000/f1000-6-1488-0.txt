This is a quite unusual paper. It presents a demo with TraIT of a cell line use case (CLUC) to combine functions, samples, and datasets from tranSMART (v16.1) and EGA into workflows in Galaxy. I was pleased to see proteomics identified as a key data type in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows the metadata mapping and the assessment of the FAIR principles. The Discussion of the ELIXIR implementation lays out improvements needed. Sometimes we might require a manuscript to report the implemented improvements, with results, but in this complex situation, including recommendations for managing public access versus controlled access across different independent resources, I think indexing at this stage is worthy. The model of ORCID IDs for researchers and their publication DOI's is a useful analogy.
