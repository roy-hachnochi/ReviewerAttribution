This study presents secondary analysis of a study of adherence to CONSORT reporting guidelines for Abstracts. While the original study (Hays et al, 2016) looked at this adherence in a sample of abstracts from several high-profile medical journals, this study performed a subgroup analysis, looking at whether the mention of professional writing assistance was associated with the score for different items on the reporting checklist. The study is thus quite methodologically biased, and it is not clear whether the observed differences are real, or random. For example, the finding that the acknowledgment of professional writing assistance decreases the frequency of adequately reporting the setting of the study is difficult to explain. The potential randomness of the significant findings should be addressed in the Discussion section. Making a publication out of the original publication by looking at a single characteristic does not really warrant the publication of the submitted manuscript. It would be preferable if other characteristics were explored in relation to reporting completeness in abstracts, such as the type of funding, phase of the trial, institutions where trials were performed. The manuscript is well written and structured, and there are no major comments or suggestions for improvement except the conceptual one described above. In the Methods section, the extraction of data for this study is not fully explained - how many experts extracted the data, how were different terms in the statements on writing assistance interpreted and categorized, etc.
