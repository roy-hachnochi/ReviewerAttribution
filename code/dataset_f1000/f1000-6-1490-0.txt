The manuscript “BAT: Bisulfite Analysis Toolkit” presents a software pipeline for the analysis of sequencing-based analysis of bisulfite treated DNA. It introduces the major modules of this pipeline and familiarize the reader with their basic function, compatibilities and output, but is obviously not intended to provide sufficient detail to allow reimplementation of the described modules. Instead, it refers to external resources such as research articles and documentary webpages, which provide most of this information. The article excels in providing a researcher who has to choose among several software pipelines for his next methylation project with the necessary information on BAT, without attempting to benchmark it against other approaches. Especially, the offer of a dockerized pipeline version and a real example datasets ensures the applicability of the software, while simultaneously proving the claim of improved reproducibility. Another prominent claim, namely the compatibility with other modules for instance alternatives to segemehl, is less well documented. Here the article would profit from an extended example in which some of the modules are exchanged by third party alternatives, e.g. in the alignment step or during the grouping. Finally, the authors describe the utility of their diagnostic diagrams depicted in figure 2 for the detection of quality problems. To this end a supplementary figure/resource in which a number of examples of how several quality problems manifest in these diagrams is required, not only to proof this statement, but also to educate less experienced users. Minor comment: The sentences “However, performing each step by hand is highly error prone, takes time, and impacts reproducibility” in the introduction is formulated unfavorably, as it can be misread as a suggestion that someone would attempt to analyze a WGBS dataset by hand.
