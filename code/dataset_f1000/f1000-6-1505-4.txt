This article makes an important contribution to addressing a serious complication in screening for new biological activity, especially in the context of new drug discovery. Several researchers continue to point out the waste of time and money in following up on false positive hits from biological screening programs. While paradigms to filter out false positives, such as aggregators or other “frequent hitters” such as PAINs, are becoming mainstream techniques, these may not be sufficient, either because they miss some false positives or because they mistakenly classify legitimate hits as false positives. By carrying out a statistical analysis of a large set of screening data for hit rates using matched molecular pairs and series, this article offers a valuable perspective on this issue. There are several aspects of this article that are particularly valuable. For example, Figure 3b is an important control showing that using assay hit rate does not overstate promiscuity, in that target hit rate is similar, linking the results to a biological mechanism of action. In Figures 4c and 4d, the exemplified compounds appear to be Michael acceptors, and could react with Cys residues covalently, or sequester thiol reagents used in the assay, which could explain their promiscuity. It is worth pointing these out, as they would not be picked up in PAINs filters and only by a knowledgeable chemist. Overall, this work is as important contribution to the ongoing effort to reduce the occurrence of false positive hits serving as starting points for discovery programs.
