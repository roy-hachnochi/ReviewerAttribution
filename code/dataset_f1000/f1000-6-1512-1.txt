This is a wonderful article describing an increasingly necessary resource. I have very little to add to this manuscript. The article mostly focuses on decentralized data analysis, however figure 15 highlights the preprocessing and output stages. It would be useful if the article included some information about the expected input formats. For example, does COINSTAC offer preprocessing tools? At the end of the first paragraph of the introduction the authors critique meta-analyses by suggesting "heterogeniety among studies caused by varying preprocessing methods applied to the data". Does COINSTAC offer tools to harmonize preprocessing, and if so what are they? Similarly, it would be good to have a summary figure of the output formats available. Can you visualise brain images online or do you have to download these? Figure 8b is cropped I look forward to seeing more additions and extensions to COINSTAC in the future.
