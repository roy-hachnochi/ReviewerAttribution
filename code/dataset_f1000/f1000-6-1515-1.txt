I appreciate the wish for the authors to move past this set of experiments and communicate their results to the field. Nevertheless, I must reiterate that, without testing the efficacy of their RNAi, their results cannot be interpreted, rather than be "interpreted with caution" as the authors suggest in the discussion. Indeed, the authors themselves agree in their response to my previous review that "providing evidence for RNAi targeting arrd genes is a key for concluding that knockdown of arrd genes does not affect lifespan." The authors suggest that performing qPCR on a new set of RNAi experiments would not demonstrate whether the knockdown worked on the worms followed for lifespan curves. While technically correct, I think it is fair to assume that their RNAi results are reproducible enough to warrant the assumption that whatever happens in a new set of RNAi experiments has happened in a previous one. The authors bring forth a third reason for not testing the efficiency of their RNAi by claiming that their results are still useful to the field as they are. In fact, as I have suggested in my previous review, without qPCR testing of the efficacy of their RNAi, their results cannot be distinguished from the natural variation in lifespan of a control population of N2 worms, and are thus potentially meaningless. In all honesty, I do not think that performing 24 qPCR reactions is an unreasonable request, especially when it is agreed that it would be "key for concluding that knockdown of arrd genes does not affect lifespan", which is the main point of the manuscript.
