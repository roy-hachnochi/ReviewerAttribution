The authors took effort to address most of the concerns we raised in our initial review, but did not address at all our major concern, apart from a note in the discussion about the limitations of their results. Thus our major concern stands: the authors must provide evidence that RNAi knockdown is functioning for each of the genes tested before their lifespan results can be interpreted correctly. Until such evidence is provided, there is no way of determining whether knockdown of individual arrestins really has limited effect on lifespan.
