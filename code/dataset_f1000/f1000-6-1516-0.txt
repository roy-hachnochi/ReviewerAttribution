The article reviewed medical support activities and patient characteristics during a triathlon event. As the authors stated, injury patterns of triathlon races are very according to locations and weather conditions, and reports from eastern Asian countries such as Korea would add significant knowledge to those preparing medical support for similar events. However, the manuscript needs some modifications for improvement such as: Abstract: The acronym 'EMT' should be explained at the first appearance in the abstract. Methods: The number and locations of the aid stations should be described in the Methods section, as the authors claimed in the Discussion that increased numbers of drink stations takes part in reducing heat-related injuries.
