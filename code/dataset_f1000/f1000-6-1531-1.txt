As we have very few literature and data in Nepalese populations in this field, this study is a good initiation. In this study eGFR at presentation was lower in hemorrhagic stroke group as compared to ischemic stroke. One explanation could be due to much higher blood pressure at presentation in this population as compared to ischemic stroke. As this is a small single center study larger multicentre studies are needed to draw further conclusion.
