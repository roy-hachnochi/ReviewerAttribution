This is a very interesting study. I congratulate the authors on this unique analysis. I, however, have found some issues with the data. The hemorrhagic group appears to have more statistically significant renal impairment than the ischemic group. Rather than comparing data with regards to blood clot volume, surgery etc., It would be more pertinent to look at the basic management for these patients in terms of intravenous fluids, mannitol, glycerol, types of maintenance IV fluids, insensible los (fever etc.,), Nephrotoxic drugs, antibiotics used etc., If the above mentioned analysis is added to the paper, it may have some value. Also, then, specific recommendations may be given regarding the overall management of such patients. I believe the differences in the two groups is artificial because the general management differs. I would not recommend the paper be published in it's present form.
