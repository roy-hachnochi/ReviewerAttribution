The manuscript from Hernsquez and Rosselli reviews the state of art on sofosbuvir and HCV. This analysis leads to the notion that the contribution of Latin American Institutions to the field is marginal, which is likely an anticipated outcome. The authors move out of the main field of interest of the manuscript, HCV, to Zika virus (ZIKV) to highlight a Latin American contribution to the improved comprehension of the pharmacology of sofosbuvir. As sofosbuvir became an antiviral of major interest, not only towards HCV and ZIKV, but also for Dengue virus (DENV) ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5524696/ ) – my suggestion is to compare the studies on the pharmacology of this drug on HCV and Flavivirus members. The study on ZIKV and sofosbuvir cited in this manuscript ( https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40920 ) was preceded by a pre-print, which was the first contribution to open the field of sofosbuvir against flaviviruses ( https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/06/061671; https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/46585/title/Sofosbuvir-Shows-Anti-Zika-Activity-In-Vitro/ ) – around six months after the ZIKV outbreak. I presume that the proposed comparison will demonstrate the installed capacity of response to novel (re)emergent viruses in Latin America.
