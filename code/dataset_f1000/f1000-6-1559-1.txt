Given my knowledge about Vietnam's education system, publishing experiences, I have found the paper's results compelling and cogent. This represents one of the first attempts in Vietnam to study its social sciences research efforts from the community and collaboration perspectives. The authors intentionally employ network data analysis to explain what cross-section data could hardly tell. Scientific soundness of this research is based on earlier work on social networks and basic network metrics. The authors use a precise and unbiased definition of connectedness based on Newman’s study 1 . The network visualization tools are not only original in this thread of research, they are especially useful in facilitating understanding of the statistical analysis. The paper is well-structured, striking a balance between data and discussions. The results are clear, easy to understand, and presented logically. Despite the focus on Vietnam social science researchers, the approach can also be productively applied to other researcher populations. This study of co-authorship patterns can be used to help researchers and research directors understand the structure of research collaboration in social sciences in Vietnam and thus develop procedures, platforms and incentives to increase the robustness of networks and reduce the risk of networks disintegrating with the departure of a highly-connected individual researcher. The authors identify the potential emergence of an “intellectual elite.” More study on the effect of this group and ways to increase the benefits and reduce the risks would be interesting as it is not clear whether this intellectual elite is detrimental or beneficial to the maturation of a robust social science research community in Vietnam. I sincerely hope that the authors will continue this direction of research in social network analysis and look forward to their new results.
