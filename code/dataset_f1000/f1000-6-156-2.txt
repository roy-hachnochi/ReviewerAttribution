In this study, the researchers discussed well the inhibitory effects of a specific anti-RTF scFv and compared between three types of prostate cancer and two types of glioblastoma cells. The results are interesting where it has been found that the selected anti-RTF scFv antibody could be an effective new alternative for prostate cancer immunotherapy. The present study provides scientific evidence regarding that. Data and references are update and sufficient information has been provided for replication of the experiment. The anti-RTFscFv which is selected in this research is a novel antibody. The anti proliferative and apoptotic effects reported here make this antibody an attractive agent for immunotherapy against prostate cancer and other cancers express this antigen. As the authors mentioned the unique properties of scFv antibodies have made these small libraries ideal antibodies for targeted therapy. The anti- RTF scFv which blocks RTF will lead irregulation of extracellular and intracellular pH in cells and would lead to cancer cell death as shown by the authors. The in vivo study using this antibody is recommended.
