This is a simple but functional piece of software for logging tics, and automating a reward schedule based on them. The hardware/software combination will be useful for researchers and possibly for behavioural analysis/clinical training – though this publication does not aim to describe clinical outcomes. The software does not appear to actually detect tics automatically – there is no interface to accelometry for example. Rather an examiner seems to have to observe the examinee constantly, and enter manually when a tic occurs, presumably by pressing a button. However, this requirement is unfortunately not specified directly in the text. It also means there is a subjective component: how does the examiner judge what is a tic and what is, for example, a voluntary action: these are tricky questions which face researchers in this area. The data is logged in a simple way that is clearly explained, and suitable for postprocessing using standard packages – but the user seems to have to write their own scripts to produce synthetic reports. The package logs occurrence of a 10 s period in which no tic is reported – but this time window appears arbitrary: it would be useful (a) to justify it, and (b) to allow the user to change it, either at run time, or in subsequent sensitivity analysis of the log files: how long a period of tic-free behaviour should count as a success event? The strength of the tool seems to be the automation of reward scheduling for studies of voluntary tic suppression in children.
