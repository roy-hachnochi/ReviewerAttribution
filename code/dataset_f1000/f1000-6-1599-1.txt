Overall, an interesting topic with implications for developing interventions to improve neonatal mortality. Still neonatal mortality is high in developing country specially in south Asia. This training methodology has significant public health implications. I have few comments. Investigators should also assess compare theoretical and clinical skill of health care providers as direct impact of intervention. Design effect should be considered for sample size estimation as health facilities may have diverse situation and availability of facilities. Investigators should share statistical plans in details and also consider linear regression model to observe association of different factors and confounders.
