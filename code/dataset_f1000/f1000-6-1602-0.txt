This is a very interesting paper which can provide clear differences between two species of Ligia which have been mixed up in papers published up to the middle of last century. I agree that the main differential character between L. baudiniana and L. exotica is the shape of male pleopod 2 endopod, even if several other morphological characters differ between the two species (e.g. shape of telson). In the text and Figure 1 the male pleopod 1 endopod is called “appendix masculina” or “gonopod”. I would avoid using these terms, since they are not in use in the taxonomy of terrestrial isopods, also because they might not refer to the same appendage. In Ligia the male modifications are present mainly in the pleopod 2 endopod, but in other genera of Oniscidea they are present on the pleopod 1 endopod or even on both pleopod 1 and 2 endopods. Ligia baudiniana is reported also from the Galapagos.
