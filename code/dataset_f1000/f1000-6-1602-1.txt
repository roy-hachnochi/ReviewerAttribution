Very nice work, well supported with clear diagrams and photographs. Double-check spelling: Introduction line 4: doubt has or doubts have...I wonder if further work will show that the reports from the eastern Pacific constitute a sibling species but this information is not pertinent to acceptance of the current manuscript. It might be worthwhile to point out that mangroves either do not occur or do not support characteristic communities in the northern Gulf of Mexico.
