The manuscript describes using 2D MRI images to create a 3D printed model of a MS lesions in a patientâ€™s brain using 3D reconstruction algorithms. While the techniques employed in this study have been previously used to model other organs, the use of MRI images to model progression of MS in a patient specific manner is novel. The objective of the authors is to demonstrate the feasibility of building such a model to track disease progression for the purposes of patient awareness and education, which could potentially provide the patient with better perspective as the authors suggested. The authors describe the methods followed for segmentation and 3D rendering of the images obtained by MRI in sufficient detail and the resultant images look convincing. However, the following points have not been sufficiently addressed: If the objective of the study was to demonstrate the feasibility of 3D reconstruction and modeling, no effort has been made to discuss the parameters being assessed to indicate that the model was an accurate representation of the actual brain. For example, there are no measurements to show how the volume of lesions in 3D reconstructed model obtained based on the manual thresholding operations to identify brain sections compared with the calculations from the 2D MRI images. It would be useful to perform these measurements on multiple samples with statistical analyses to validate the methods. The discussion should include an examination of the benefits of this approach with relation to the time and cost involved in comparison with alternative approaches. The title presumes that there has been no precedent for 3D printing brains with MS but since the technology described in this paper is not novel and has been previously used for modeling other organs, this cannot be proven.
