[Overall comments] The authors have described an extremely interesting three-dimensional (3D) model for MS, with precise segmentation of the MS lesion. However, the usefulness and applicability of this model is unclear. Although the authors have mentioned various points in the “Conclusions and Future Directions section,” they have not emphasized on the necessity to use 3D models in their study. Research is to discover the unknown. However, in this paper, it has not been thoroughly achieved. The authors must initially apply a suitable research design to demonstrate the usefulness of a 3D model for MS. For “Future Directions,” the basis shall be stated in each item. [Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?] The method of fabrication of the model is clearly and accurately presented. However, the purpose and results of this study are unclear. In addition, the authors have stated that the 3D models assist in increasing patient awareness and knowledge without providing substantial evidence. This study has essentially succeeded in fabricating a 3D model for MS; however, there is no new knowledge. [Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?] There is no description regarding the study design. [Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?] No analysis has been conducted. [Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?] The results are not described. [Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?] Because the results are not shown, the conclusion cannot be evaluated.
