This article is a valuable and welcome contribution to the ongoing discussion of antibody quality. The suggestion of a two-tier approach is helpful to distinguish between simple descriptive data and the validation of an antibody for a specified application. For an updated article some minor changes should be considered: Validation is a very old concept in analytical chemistry and therefore, some definitions have already emerged and many regulations and guidelines, e.g. Thompson et al. 1 , have been put into effect. Validations of antibody-based methods should make use of these established and proven approaches and should be seen in this context. In Table 1 the declaration of "Specified IgG in g or mg" should be discussed briefly, since only in very rare cases the relevant amount has been determined properly. Either non-specific IgG (e.g. antibodies based on ascites) and IgG of a different species (such as bovine IgG) may contaminate the product. In many cases, only the protein content was determined with a semiquantitative spectrophotometric method. "Comparison between wildtype and knock-out is in all cases the best validation and is not incorporated in this schedule." I want to mention that there are research antibodies against non-proteinaceous targets, which can not be validated this way. Furthermore, in the case of chemically defined antigens (e.g. peptides), the use of LC-MS/MS is perhaps the most powerful approach to validate an antibody-based method. "This omission has been recognized and publishers are no longer expected to accept a paper without the catalogue numbers of the antibodies used." I do not think that a catalogue number is sufficient for this purpose. A clone number or a real antibody ID would be much better to make an antibody fully traceable 2 . References 1.
