There is no doubt in the methodology and result of this research, but we are concerned about the conclusion which was pointed out that “We strongly recommend and encourage Thai health professionals promotion of the development of NAFLD targeted screening and prevention programs focusing on post-menopausal women and DM risk groups.” This research surveyed a very specific population which does not represent Thai population. There was no information supporting that the prevalence of NAFLD in people who have never had liver fluke parasite infection is similar to the one from this study group. We are serious about this point because it could lead to a wrong policy.
