I would criticize and recommend the following: Introduction The review literature about Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is not up to date. Example: Younossi et al ., 2016 1 Methods The researcher should report the number of participants who were enrolled and excluded. The word “participants” in the second paragraph of page 3 is wrong. If there were comparison groups, the researcher should explain the purpose of the comparison group which was mentioned in the second paragraph of page 3. The researcher should explain what “other underlying disease” is. Figure 1 (Flow of participants) should be written with inclusion criteria before exclusion criteria. Results and discussion What is the purpose of reporting educational level and occupation in table 1? Were these factors used for adjusting the result? The age category should be similar in every part of the paper. In the discussion, the researcher categorized into groups ranging 10 years each (the prevalence increases after the age of 50 years, peaks at 60–69 years) but in the methods the age was categorized into groups ranging 5 years each. In the discussion, it was reported the prevalence of NAFLD declines after age 70, but in the results table reported the prevalence of age greater than 65. Conclusion This research studied only prevalence of NAFLD which is only one of many kinds of metabolic disorder, so it is not appropriate to conclude that “post- menopausal women should be concerned about metabolic disorders”. This research surveyed a very specific population, so it is not appropriate to recommend NALFD screening and prevention programs focusing on post-menopausal women and DM risk groups because the prevalence of NAFLD in normal population might be different from this population.
