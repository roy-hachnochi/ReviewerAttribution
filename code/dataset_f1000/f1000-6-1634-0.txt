I have no recommendations to the authors that must be addressed. This report is part of a larger study, to identify core competencies for biomedical journal editors. The methods seem appropriate, and are well described. The results are presented clearly. The supplemental materials provide the materials (survey questions) and data. The conclusions are apt.
