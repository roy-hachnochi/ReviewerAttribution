While a number of changes have been made to address the concerns I and others raised, I find the revised version too weak, and biased, to recommend for indexing. Most importantly, on inspecting Dataset 1 - Survey Response , I see that 88% of respondents who answered Q41 ( country of origin ), and 94% of respondents who answered Q43 ( country of PhD ) gave the response Israel . This to me suggests that there is a huge distribution bias that needs to be seriously confronted. To attempt to make broad claims about postdocs, based on such a biased distribution and in conjunction with otherwise fairly uninspiring data, is flawed, and misleading. In addition to this bias, the correlation is still poorly explored, and the methods are not explained in detail at all, and are instead only briefly mentioned in the results section. Considering these points, I currently cannot recommend this article for indexing.
