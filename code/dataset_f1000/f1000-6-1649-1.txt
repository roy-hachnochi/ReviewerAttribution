The manuscript presents an opinion paper concerning the outcomes of the workshop that took place within the context of the strategic planning of ELIXIR and PhenoMeNal consortia. The article describes the actual level and the diversity of efforts within the European Metabolomics community. It represents main bottlenecks in reporting QA/QC, the metabolite identification, and the lack of comprehensive and coordinated metabolite databases. The authors describe their plans how to address challenges in metabolomics mainly within the ELIXIR platforms. The paper is undoubtedly, informative for the major part of common efforts of the European Metabolomics Community. It is mainly focusing on ELIXIR plans yet the intentions of the authors are to inform the community on this issue and this is clearly reflected in the title. This reviewer feels that the complexity of the non human metabolome (plant, microbe etc) is not appropriately addressed and the relative databases of secondary metabolites existing worldwide should be more seriously considered. Comments: Some corrections should be considered before indexing. In page 5 the statement “For NMR, a few and sparsely populated repositories provide raw data for individual metabolites, such as the metabolomics collection in BioMagResBank” is somehow contradictory with the fact that HMDB is mentioned just few sentences later and MetaboLights is also mentioned in a completely different context in another paragraph. The sentence “ELIXIR Greece has included a computational metabolomics and protein interactomics Use Case” is repeated twice in page 7 and page 10 In page 6 the reference Pavlidis and Noble 2001 appears without any relevant number and is not mentioned in the references section
