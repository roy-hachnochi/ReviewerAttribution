This article is a nice summary of a meeting of European scientists who have a range of interests in metabolomics-based science. The review provides a summary of the main areas that the investigators considered critical to move move both the technological aspects of the work forward, with securing the identification of 'unknown' metabolites found in biological samples, as the primary need. The group also identified various aspects of data science, data science and bioinformatics as other high priority needs. I found the review to be detailed, informative and well referenced. The review is unabashedly Eurocentric, appropriately so given that it was generated with the goal of highlighing European efforts. Thus, it sometimes reads as an advert for ELIXIR, but that does not distract measurably from the fine recitation of the opinions of the participants.
