This is an important piece of work which contributes to the management of an one challenging but common clinical scenario and additional therapeutic interventions which may be of benefit are to be applauded. The study is well designed and results robust. There are a couple of further issues which I would like to see addressed or clarified in the text. Address the limitations of a retrospective review. Did the patients have blood work up to exclude any coincidental compounding factors causing effluvium e.g. thyroid/ vit D deficiencies? It would be helpful to know this and indeed see whether is this was the case there was any effect on treatment response in the presence of abnormal blood workup. If they did not have blood work up this should be clearly stated. I assume all the patients included had undergone a scalp biopsy. The dose used was not standardised. This should be mentioned again in the discussion/ limitations of this piece of work and it would be good to know whether side effects - or indeed efficacy - were related to the higher doses used or no difference found. These are small details on an otherwise really valuable piece of work which will be be very valuable to those practising in the Hair Disorders clinical setting.
