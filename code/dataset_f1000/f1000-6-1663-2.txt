This manuscript is a narrative overview of methods of blinding in trials of procedures, using the previous review by these authors as the source of data. It explains the rationale for blinding and gives examples (subgrouped) of how blinding was achieved in previous trials. The authors wisely avoid a detailed discussion of the placebo effect and concentrate on the need for blinding based on empirical evidence of bias resulting from not blinding. The paper reinforces the need for blinding in procedural trials which is a reasonable demand that is increasingly being heeded. In other words, the message is important. The paper is very well written. I only have minor comments, below: Page 2, second last paragraph, “crucial element of believed to be the cure” should read “crucial element believed to be the cure” The evidence of bias resulting from not blinding may be one sided. Opposing evidence should be discussed, such as Berkmann ND, The Empirical Evidence of Bias in Trials Measuring Treatment Differences 1 which shows that the effect of blinding may even be in the opposite direction and the classic Schultz article from 1995 1 which gives a lower estimate of effect exaggeration from unblinding. There are several other summaries and meta-epidemiological studies in this area.
