In this manuscript, Sobel et al . present fungal microbiome data from 39 different beers as the culmination of a crowdfunded citizen science campaign. These data will be of interest to citizen scientists and financial backers of the project, as well as those in the fermentation (especially beer) industry. Overall, the data seem sound, but I have some concerns: Major comments Were any controls for contamination used, i.e. , are all of the fungi identified actually from the beer samples? The sequencing of a non-beer sample such as water that had been handled in the same way as the beer samples would help to determine if fungal DNA contamination occurred during sample processing. In line with the comment above, the manuscript states that “…microorganisms, or their DNA, could be carried over from the ingredients to the final product.” Can the authors comment on whether they know if they are detecting the fungi themselves or DNA remnants from fungi that came from the raw ingredients of the beer? Again, one could add purified control DNA to a mash, brew and bottle a beer, and then try to detect that DNA by PCR in the end product (or even at various stages along the brewing and fermentation process). Attempting this with various concentrations of DNA would also yield information on how many cells of a particular species would be necessary on malted barley, for instance, to be detected in the final beer. Minor comments In the introduction, the authors state that “…sour beer…[is] produced without the controlled addition of known yeast cultivates.” Although this may be true for some types of sour beer like lambic and gueuze, many sour beers made in the U.S. are inoculated with known strains of yeast. In those cases, the souring bacteria are usually the unknowns. Why was a fecal DNA prep kit used for DNA extraction? The authors collected 120 beers from 20 countries but only sequenced the fungi from 39 (mostly from Switzerland). Is there an explanation for this attrition?
