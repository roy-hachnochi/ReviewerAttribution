I appreciate the authors for their initiative. They have selected an interesting topic for study. Certain points are given below so that they can work on them to make it better. In result section of abstract (line 2 of result) authors have reported two P value for non-differences in maternal anxiety between the two groups before intervention. Why two P value? Result section of abstract (line 4 and 5 of result) does not match with results in Table 2. Please see mean of anxiety score immediately after the intervention in two groups. In sample size calculation, how much α and β is considered? Please mentioned. Please correct attrition rate (10%.??) In Table 1, income per week or month?? In table 1: why mean rank for Job Status? Mean rank for nominal variable is not correct. Results (In Table 2 and 3) show reduction of anxiety score in both groups and further reduction in the control group Immediately after the intervention, but in discussion section (paragraph 1) authors have written: "The GEE showed a significant difference between the two groups in the mean score of anxiety immediately and three weeks after the intervention, as this mean score was lower in the trial group." Reported results did not indicate whether the statistically significant mean difference between the two groups is Immediately after the intervention and/or in lasting? Discussion section will be according to results.
