I appreciate the opportunity to read this manuscript. It is a population-based study with a well-planned and scientifically rigorous methodology, about access to dental care (dependent variable) for children 12 years old in Peru. It discusses some independent variables, and exposes the absence of dental care, especially for younger children (5 years old). It uses the theoretical model of Andersen (1995) and points as factors associated with access: age group years, natural region of residency, type of health insurance, quintile of wealth and caregivers' educational level. In my point of view, the manuscript has quality, is a relevant study and is suitable for this journal. Only one suggestion. On page 5, at the end of the first paragraph the authors report: In contrast, the adjusted model indicated that the language spoken by caregivers was statistically associated with the access to oral health services (Table 2). However, this association was not observed in the adjusted model and was not part of the study's findings. I suggest that this statement should be revised.
