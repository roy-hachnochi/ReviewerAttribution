The following points need to be corrected, otherwise it is approved is based on the micro-mechanical interlocking of the infiltrated resin monomers into porosities created by demineralized inorganic part of dentin 4. Comment: created in demineralized in organic part.... Chemical analysis of the interface Specimens slabs were then placed in freshly prepared 50 weight/volume % ammoniacal silver nitrate solution for an additional 24 hours at 37C in the dark. Comment: Specim en slab s were placed....... lower mean gap distance values than Group B (p0.001), as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 and Figure 2. Comment: and Figur es 1 and 2 The SEM with EDX analysis results revealed that Group A showed significantly lower mean silver atomic % values than Group B (p0.001), as shown in Table 2 A. Selected SEM/EDX analysis is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Comment: The SEM with EDX analysis results revealed significantly lower mean silver atomic % values for Group A compared to Group B (p 0.001). A selected SEM/EDX analysis is shown in Figu res 3 and 4. A proper marginal sealing is essential to improve the durability of resin composite/bonding systems 7 Comment: A proper marginal se al is essential This may be attributed to the fact that phosphoric acid included in acid-etch step demineralized the smear layer, exposing the collagen fibers of superficially demineralized dentin. These could increase micromechanical interlocking of the bonding agent within the dentin surface 10 Comment: The presence of exposed collagen fibers could increase....
