This is a relevant manuscript from a public health standpoint because one of the main contributions of the present work is to determine quality of life indicators in the Romanian Roma, but methodologically it has significant shortcomings: The comparison between the population of Burkina Faso and the population of Romania is not adequate. They are very different populations. This aspect is a methodological problem. Discussion of the results is limited. Some aspects are not adequately discussed. There is no information about the survey's non-response rate. Few references and some of them unrelated to the purpose of the study. It does not seem correct to incorporate a press article as a reference. Sorry but, I do not recommend the indexing of the article.
