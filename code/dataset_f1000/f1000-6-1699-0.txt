This is an interesting research note identifying MOOCs relating to emerging and re-emerging diseases. The work in its current form is acceptable as a research note, and the conclusion that such MOOCs need to be available in more languages is an important point. If the authors are to extend their work there is scope for improvement: The search window was very limited, it is possible that MOOCs that had completed would not be found. Adding MOOC aggregators (such as Class Central) to the search areas could have identified more courses, than those on offer in May 2017. There are many barriers to accessing MOOCs, especially in developing countries, for example access to computers, connectivity, digital skills, as well as fluency in international languages. Consideration of all potential barriers will be important in future work. The target audience of the MOOCs is not clear in this report, and there may be benefit in classifying courses that are aimed at health professionals and those aimed at the general public. Then considering whether there is benefit in a direct linguistic translation for particular MOOCs.
