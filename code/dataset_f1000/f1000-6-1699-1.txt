This is a nice short report from the study conducted by Bendezu-Quispe G et al. about the existence of MOOCs with focus on emerging and re-emerging diseases. The idea is simple, and so is the methodology. However, I have concern regarding the time frame selected for the study which was limited to the year 2016. Some of the outbreaks highlighted in the background started in earlier years and were terminated in 2016. I think that more valid and strong data could have been provided if there were no time limits thus allowing for exploration of MOOCs presented at the time of epidemics. Otherwise, authors have properly presented their data. I believe their work would be a good start for further exploration of this area.
