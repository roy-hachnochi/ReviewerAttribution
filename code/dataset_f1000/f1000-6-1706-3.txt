The paper describes an HMM clustering methods of a data set that I published. I would have liked to be able to run the model. It is difficult from the definitions to understand how it runs and performs. Therefore I would suggest that the author make the source code available. I will not further comment the cluster method itself. Assuming I would implement the method, I would not be able to replicate the analysis. The dataset has expression values from 7 time points: 0 hours - 48 hours for 5500 genes. They can be read counts or RPKM. It is not clear which input data were used and how those were then filtered ( alpha threshold in Le Roch et al . 1 ). We think that at least 3300 genes are expressed, but in this analysis, just 1700 are clustered. In the blood stage of plasmodium, expressed genes follow a clear pattern, as can be seen in Bozdech et al . 2 , and the results should be compared to this and other similar papers (at least mentioned in the introduction). To emphasize the PfEMP1 is interesting, but those genes should not be expressed in parasites in culture(or at least their expression has no biological context), and they are expressed at around the same time. Just as a suggestion, the paper would also more robust if other datasets would be used and the results compared: Ln et al . 3 Minor: The dataset was generated from RNA-Seq data, not microarray, as mentioned in two parts of the paper. It would be good to have the version of the GO terms. I think that those GO terms were significantly represented, what the cut-off? 40% of Plasmodium genes are of unknown function. Those won't have any GO terms. I think is wrong to deduce that they are likely to have the same function if occurring in the same cluster.
