The authors present the application of an approach to model-based clustering of RNA seq time course data to data on the life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum . The clustering was performed with an iterative training based approach based on Hidden Markov Models. An advantage of this approach is that there is objective information on the optimal number of clusters that best fit the data, which was 3 in this case. The clusters that were discovered with this method separated proteins with distinct functional roles into different clusters. For instance, genes involved in catabolic activities were clustered together in cluster 3, which also contained some structural elements. The authors use software to clearly define the extent of enrichment of different functional categories in each of the three clusters identified. The findings may prove valuable to researchers working to identify new therapeutic targets to combat P. falciparum .
