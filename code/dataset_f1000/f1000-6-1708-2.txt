This is an interesting study that draws attention to an important area - open access to the data underpinning research papers allowing assessment of reproducibility. It is of course limited by it's focus on one journal as data-sharing policies vary between journals. In addition, requested statements by journals often become formulaic as the tendency is to copy what other papers have said previously. Some journals have tried new approaches in an effort to encourage data-sharing such as the NEJM 'Sprint Challenge'. However, the major limitation is a lack of further data on why data was not shared. Some providers such as the UK primary care data repository CPRD do not allow data-sharing, even if the authors of articles are keen proponents of open data-access. More in depth work will be required to understand the true barriers and way ahead for data-sharing.
