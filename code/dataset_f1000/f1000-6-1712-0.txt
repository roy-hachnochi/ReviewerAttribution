This is a quality and important review by Vekaria et al from the Dermatology program of Mount Sinai in New York with Emma Guttman-Yassky- a leading clinician and researcher in the field of Atopic Dermatitis worldwide as corresponding author. The nature of Atopic Dermatitis as a systemic inflammatory disease with comorbidities has been significantly accelerated over the past five years, especially with the initiation of the International Eczema Council (IEC) by Dr.s Guttman-Yassky and Paller. Of interest are the 3 meetings the IEC has had with the International Psoriasis Council (IPC) comparing the imuunopathogenesis and comorbidities of Atopic Dermatitis and Psoriasis. Of interest, in this C-reactive protein review of 59 patients in Atopic Dermatitis Reference #11 (B. Strober et al 1 ) mentions the increased levels of CRP in psoriasis. It is important to recognize now that psoriasis has been demonstrated to be a systemic immune-mediated disease that CRP levels in psoriasis patients with moderate to severe disease are significantly lower than in psoriasis patients who develop Psoriatic Arthritis and also are lower than other immune-mediated systemic disease, e.g. Crohn's or Rheumatoid Arthritis. We do believe it should be emphasized in the title and abstract that this CRP review was carved out in adults only. In addition, it should be clarified in the method section that data was obtained retrospectively. We all recognize that CRP is an acute phase reactant that can increase with infections/autoimmune/cancer as well as cardiovascular disease. Thus, reference should be made in this article to comorbidities in this group of 59 Atopic Dermatitis patients which could have possibly played a role in the increases of CRP.
