1. This is an interesting and considered study, a single-centre series of 59 adult patients matched 1:2 with controls from the nationwide NHANES survey. CRP, LDH and sIgE were correlated with AD severity, assessed by SCORAD and BSA. Was there a reason for choosing SCORAD over objective SCORAD or EASI, which rely only on objective measures? Of interest, was CRP in adult AD vs non-AD using the NHANES data itself done (cf Silverberg Pediatr Allergy Immunol 2015)? 2. CRP, a marker of cardiovascular risk, was found to be elevated in AD, and correlated with AD severity. sIgE correlated with AD severity, but not with CRP. LDH did not show significant correlation with AD severity or CRP. In addition to the Silverberg pediatric paper, Park et al 1 presented a pediatric inpatient study of 67 children examining the relationship between eczema severity (mild-moderate vs severe) and a number of laboratory markers. They did not find correlation with CRP, LDH or skin cultures. That paper was pediatric, written in Korean and also has limitations, but may be worth referencing for comparison. 3. Some potential confounders were considered. Sensitivity analysis was performed for non-asthma AD patients; this subgroup still showed correlation between CRP and AD severity. The patients did not have clinical infection. Were any swabs done? Some patients in the dataset had other co-morbidities that could have contributed to the CRP. The nature of the control group may not allow ready comparison of these, but a comment about possible or unlikely confounding from co-morbidities as the case may be worth considering.
