Vekaria, Brunner et al. present a nice and clear clinical Investigation into AD severity and CRP levels. The title should be adapted to "Moderate-to-severe AD patients ..." as you have really investigated just this population. In the correlations, the patients with high CRP Levels are omitted for some (graphical?) reason. Please state why and whether the Pearson r is calculated with or without them. I don't think this changes the conclusion of the paper but IMHO should be shown. If you have access to the raw SCORAD data, you might be able to check whether subcomponents of the SCORAD have a closer connection to the Serum CRP than others: - eczema involvement of some body regions - crusting, oozing - excoriations (scratch marks) I think it may be worth adding to the abstract that 50% of the moderate-to-severe AD patients were in the range of cardiovascular high-risk CRP levels. Also, you should probably discuss all ways to lower the high CRP. The best of them may be anti-IL6R, which also works in atopic dermatitis according to a case series.
