This review article brings forward a recommendation of mitigating the current issues of reproducibility in academic research by encouraging authors to perform post-publication self-review on their studies in 5 years. The authors of the review article suggest that the implementation of self-review will allow for academic research to be undertaken with better judgment, as accountability in their work is emphasized. The value of self-review post-publication provides in principle, an excellent platform for authors to reflect on the impact and influence of their research while also providing insight on what led to possible reproducible concerns. The review article appropriately includes limitations of their proposal, such as the adoption rate by the scientific community and implementation into research programs. I believe this is an important point that should be emphasized as the value of self-review is highly dependent on the acceptance of the community. The authors insightfully recommend that self-review be included as terms for publication by "Journals, funders, and research institutions" to promote this process. In summary, this is a well-written review article introducing self-reflection as a means to identify sources of irreproducibility by the authors of academic research. By encouraging self-review, peers will be able to properly place academic findings into the appropriate place in their knowledge base.
