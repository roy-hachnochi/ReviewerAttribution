The long term relevance of our published works is a point for both secret pride and disappointment for many continuing in careers with active engagement in research. This opinion article suggests that compelling researchers to reflectively evaluate their past publications and to produce a published commentary on these works (after 5 years) will improve the reliability of published work. In my opinion, this is an idea that may have reached its time and in some ways is long overdue. While it remains to be seen if this strategy improves the quality of published work (if implemented), the user friendly and low cost proposal made by these authors at least represents a feasible approach toward improving the quality of publications by causing researchers to think twice about what they submit for publication. And this by knowing that publication involves a long term commitment and accountability to the ideas presented and to be revisited by reflective review 5 years later. Certainly, this is a well written and interesting concept that in my opinion merits consideration by journal editors and publishers, and the support of researchers committed to research excellence.
