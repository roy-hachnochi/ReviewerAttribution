Scientific irreproducibility is indeed a serious problem nowadays. In the current opinion article, the authors state the reason that govern irreproducibility and for the first time they provide a potential method to treat such results. Importantly, their suggested method is based on a self-evaluation by the authors of a published article after a 5-year period. Indeed, this “self-review” process is simple, quick and with no additional cost. The article is very well-written for a broad audience.
