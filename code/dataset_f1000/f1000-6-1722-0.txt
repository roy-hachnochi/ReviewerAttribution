In this paper, the authors describe Fragger, a web server for retrieving fragments from a database of structures based on a query fragment. Their program allows for customisation in terms of number of fragments output and in terms of sequence constraints. The paper is made up of previously published methods put together as a potentially useful package. The Super method (mentioned in the introduction of the manuscript) seems to fulfil the same purpose as Fragger. No comparison is provided between the two methods in terms of performance and quality of fragments output. It is unclear from the Methods section how the reference fragment set is selected. It is mentioned in the Results that these fragments can be selected at random, but the authors never discuss whether this choice can have an impact on the performance of the algorithm.
