The manuscript by Baird and colleagues is a useful contribution to the literature. There are however a few minor edits that are necessary to make this short contribution publishable. Firstly, the title is inaccurate, or at least misleading. Doldrums is a maritime term that refers to the low-pressure area affected by the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the prevailing winds are generally calm. The doldrums are considered to lie between 10 o N and 10 o S. Using the term doldrum-like conditions, instead of calm conditions, for a reef that is located at latitude 24 north confuses the terminology. I understand that NOAA, the US agency, has been using the term to refer to atypically calm periods irrespective of latitude, but again that doesn’t make it correct because they are also misusing the term. Change the title to reflect a short, atypically calm period. Table 1 should not simply have the corals in alphabetical order, but instead sort the table from most to least impacted. Introduction Again, revise the use of the term doldrums. Methods Several periods are missing at the ends of sentences in the Methods section. Specify the aspect of the site. Which direction is the site facing? Data were pooled and were collected, not data was. Results Delete the word “who” in the sentence “who were also badly affected (Table 1)” Discussion “was different from…”, not different to Revise doldrums-like conditions in several places. Again, different from, not different to. Periods are missing from the ends of sentences in several places of the Discussion. Split infinitive: change to : has not been previously… Data availability Data are provided, not, data is provided
