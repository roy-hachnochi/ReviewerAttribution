Author has made good case report- Mucus plug in bronchus mimicking a bronchial solid foreign body obstruction. We often encounter a child with sudden shortness of breath on emergency department which after nebulization get stable. It would be better if they have done bronchoscopic examination. This case report helps to think other clinician that mucus plug can cause obstruction. Author describes the case history, clinical presentation and management in detail. I feel there is space to discuss more on obstruction by other agents. I hope this case report is good and help to other clinician as well.
