The authors report a whole genome sequence dataset for a halophytic wild rice species. These data will be useful for discovery of novel alleles for rice improvement, and for comparative/evolutionary genomics within the Oryza genus. The report would benefit from more details on the plant accession used as source of DNA for sequencing. It is stated O. coarctata is tetraploid. Was that determined by the authors, or is there a citation to include? Is it known whether O. coarctata is typically self or cross-pollinated, or other information about expected degree of heterozygosity? When grown in greenhouse to generate the plant tissue used for DNA extraction, were the plant(s) established from seeds, or via clonal propagation? Was the genomic DNA used to prepare sequencing libraries from a single plant, or a pool from multiple plants? This information is important to assess expected frequencies of variant types such as alleles or homeologs due to tetraploidy, which are likely collapsed to varying degrees in the subsequent assembly. There is mention of an assembly and its quality, but not about the method(s) used to produce it or key parameters that guided the assembly. Can the authors provide that information, so that others have a benchmark upon which to compare future assemblies using the datasets? The sentence “Further, we also found that the repeat contain 19.89% of the genome.” Is not completely clear. I believe what the authors intend to say is that approximately 20% of the genome assembly is comprised of repeats. How was this sequence fraction defined as repeats, via tool for matching to known repeat sequences, or a de novo approach? By inference, it is also likely that the approximately 100-kb of the estimated genome size not covered by the assembly is comprised of high-copy repeats, leading to an estimate of about 30% total repeat content.
