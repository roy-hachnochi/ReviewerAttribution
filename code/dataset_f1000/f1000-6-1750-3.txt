The authors report a draft genome sequence of a halophyte Oryza species collected from Sunderbans, and provides a glimpse into the adaptive strategies employed by Oryza against salinity stress. Undoubtedly, it will be an useful resource for future functional characterization, comparative genomic studies, and developing salinity tolerance in rice. I understand that the present format is only for reporting, and look forward to reading the full manuscript with all the analysis. There are small language edits that that authors need to incorporate. Comments: Please add a reference or sufficient information for general readers as to how genome types of rice (for instance, KKLL in case of O. coarctata ) was assigned. Language corrections: Change “have been used” to “has been used” Change “We report for the first time that more than 85.71 % of the genome coverage and the data have been deposited in NCBI SRA, with BioProject ID PRJNA396417” to “deposited in NCBI SRA, with BioProject ID PRJNA396417” Change “and established to our institute NET” to “and established at our institute NET” Change “resulting 85.71 % genome coverage” to “resulting in 85.71 % genome coverage” Change “we also found that the repeat contain 19.89% of the genome.” to “we also found that the 19.89% of the genome is repetitive in nature”.
