This is a descriptive report on the use of capsule endoscopy for the investigation of a quite heterogenoeous population. I suggest to better specify: In patients with Crohn's disease: was this diagnosis suspected before CE or Crohn's disease was already Known before CE specify if, in patients with known Crohn's disease before CE, the subsequent endoscopic examination turned out to be negative if the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was only suspected before CE, please specify how the diagnosis was made on the basis of the capsule findings did the authors observed any complication after CE (ie capsule retention)? in the discussion please underline that patients with known Crohn's disease are at increased risk of capsule retention and therefore every effort (patency capsule; MRE before CE) should be made in order to minimize this risk. with reference to this last point please quote: Pennazio M, Spada C, Eliakim Small-bowel capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy for diagnosis and treatment of small-bowel disorders: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Clinical Guideline.
