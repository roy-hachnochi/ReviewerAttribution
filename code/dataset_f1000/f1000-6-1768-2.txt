The authors should clarify the reasons for the 10 days delay in the operative management of their patient. More insight should be provided on the choice of aggressive operative treatment as compared to a percutaneous drainage. Perhaps the drainage would have been more readily available and also less expensive as compared to elective surgery. Keeping in mind the age of the patient, it might have been a reasonable option proceeding with conservative management and percutaneous drainage trial. Did the authors investigate the use of somatostatin (provided in the form of Octreotide) in such case? It is currently a first line approach for uncomplicated pancreatic-cutaneous fistulas and might as well work with the Gallbladder considering the physiological functions of the hormone. All in all the case is interesting and, considering the rarity of the event, it deserves publication.
