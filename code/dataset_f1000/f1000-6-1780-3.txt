 Introduction: Do not explain the epidemiology of breast cancer too long, but explain more detail about TNBC and its subtypes (Basal-like and non basal-like), such as differences in histological type, behaviour, prognosis, treatment etc. So, the role of p63 and SOX2 on TNBC becomes clearer. Method: Statistical analysis predictive diagnostic value of cytoplasmic p63 expression of basal-like and non basal-like TNBC, as far as I know there should be also negative p63 expression. Therefore I suggest to ask a qualified statistician. Discussion: Explain the importance of negative correlation between p63 expression and metaplastic carcinoma. Compare with previous studies. Conclusion: Mention also other important results of this study such as: The frequency of non basal-like is higher than basal-like. The most common histological type of TNBC is metaplastic carcinoma. Negative correlation between p63 expression and metaplastic carcinoma SOX2 expression in TNBC, even there is no stattistically significant
