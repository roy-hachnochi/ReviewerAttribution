The article as it stands, although on an important topic specific for malaria research, needs further improvement to achieve sufficient scientific relevance for indexing. The work describes the diversity of a very polymorphic gene, pfmsp2 in P. falciparum in various sites around Sudan adjudicating the multiplicity of infection. They compare the genetic diversity between different regions where samples were collected as well as with patients’ characteristics. Considering the Figure 2, that should represent the results for all the samples, the results are very difficult to extract, questioning the true genotyping and consequently the MOI of the samples. The nested PCR method used is very delicate and demands a good quality of agarose gel pictures, that is not the case of Figure 2. Unless all samples were run in the same gel (which is not the case), the bands from the molecular marker has to be evident to be able to evaluate the band sizes of the samples. The families IC1 and FC27 can differ of just 50 bp difference, making the resolution of the Figure 2 an impossible task to achieve. This technical issues have to be resolved for the accuracy of the data. In the article should also be described the malaria epidemics in the regions where the samples were collected to understand if the number of samples herein analyzed are representative. The method to identify plasmodium species is lacking the reference and is not really understood if other species were identified. Some of the authors of this article have published 1 before submission of this manuscript a similar study on samples collected in one of the regions herein studied in the same year and the same genotyping of the msp2. They don’t mention this publication not even in the discussion section. Are some of the samples overlapping this study?
