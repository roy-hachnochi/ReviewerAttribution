Paragangliomas are a type of infrequent head and neck tumor originating in the paraganglionic brachymeric tissue involved in the development of the branchial arches. Five families of paragangliomas have been described: Brachymeric, intravagal, sympathetic, viscero-autonomic and adrenal. At the histopathological level, this type of tumors has an identical configuration regardless of its origin. Sporadic cases of this class of tumors are more frequent in females. A high frequency of this class of tumors has been established in patients who live at high altitudes and those suffering from the chronic obstructive disease. It has been suggested that chronic hypoxemia plays a role in the genesis of this class of tumors Munakomi et al. presented a very well documented case and with successful resolution managed in a resource-limited setting. The therapeutic choice depends fundamentally on the location of this kind of tumors, the size of the lesion, age, health status of the patient plus the experience of the surgeons. The use of various resources as angiography and preoperative embolization suggests that this type of tumors should be ideally managed in third-level care centers. The case managed by Munakomi et al. testifies that the preparation and expertise of the surgeon are fundamental for the successful resolution of this class of injuries. Finally, it is important to mention that this type of tumors has a significant risk of urinary complications and several postoperative complications have been described, including cranial nerve lesions, cerebral infarction, hemorrhages among others.
