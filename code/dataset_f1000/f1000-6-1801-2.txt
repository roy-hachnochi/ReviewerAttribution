This is a well-written case report about how to manage a Shamblin Grade 3 carotid body tumor (CBT). Though surgery is first-line treatment of CBT, it remains a challenge because itâ€™s highly vascular and adherent to the vagus nerve in high-grade CBT. The authors discussed the diagnosis and treatment of CBT in detail. In large tumors like this case, cerebral collateral circulation should be evaluated in case of vessel transplantation or ligation performed. HyperForm might be used for intra-operative distal vascular control if tumor is very large to reach the skull base. However, in a resource-limited setting it is difficult for detailed pre-operative evaluation and intra-operative vascular control.
