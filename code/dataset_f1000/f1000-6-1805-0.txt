In this review, Illustrative examples of probable transfer of resistance determinants from food animals to humans: strepothricins, glycopeptides and coilstin, these authors provide a timely update on this important topic of interest to veterinary public health. The three selected antimicrobial agents highlighted are described so as to provide the reader with a background on their uses; the emergence of resistance to these compounds and possible routes of dissemination. Two of the three examples provided (streptothricin- and glycopeptide-resistance) are historical in nature, whilst the colistin-resistant chapter is more recent. The selection of these topics clearly demonstrated the consequences of antimicrobial compound usage and the subsequent response from bacteria of importance to animal- and human-health. The manuscript is well designed and clearly written, as presented. It is scientifically sound. The topic is of immediate interest and would serve as a very useful and comprehensive review of our current understanding of this subject. In places the authors highlight some of the limitations in current approaches to the study of some of these resistance mechanisms, particularly in regard to colistin.
