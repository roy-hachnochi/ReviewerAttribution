Manuscript “Illustrative examples of probable transfer of resistance determinants from food animals to humans: Streptothricins, glycopeptides, and colistin” describes evidence for antibiotic resistance gene transfer from bacteria colonizing / infecting livestock to bacteria colonizing / infecting humans by means of three examples: streptothricine-resistance and glycopeptide resistance as historical examples, and mcr mediated resistance to colistin as an important recent example. Altogether this review is well written and based on a very careful literature research together with a balanced selection of the really relevant publications. Above all the comprehensive and condensed presentation of studies on colistin resistance is impressing. A few points will need attention: A short discussion on the consequences of the ban of avoparcin as growth promoter would be of interest (e.g. significant reduction of gastrointestinal colonization of healthy humans in the community, Klare et al., 1999). It should also be mentioned that despite this ban several European countries faced an increase of VRE among isolates from blood cultures (EARSnet) since 2004. The question whether the ban was of little significance for the VRE situation in human medicine or whether it could have come much more worse in case of a continuing existing van gene pool in the community cannot be answered in retrospect. For the chapter on colistin resistance I suggest to mention that the extent to which mcr contributes to colistin resistance in clinical isolates cannot exactly be assessed so far, and that there are cases of acquisition of mcr by carbapenemase producing K.pneumoniae (Newton-Food et al., 2017). Furthermore, the emergence of E.coli harbouring mcr -1 and bla KPC-2 after meropenem and colistin therapy is of interest (Tacao et al., 2017).
