The manuscript by Mackeh et al. is a collection of the gene expression datasets of oocyte, cumulus cells, and granulosa cells of normal and PCOS patients undergoing IVF. It is a good compilation of related datasets already published in public repositories. However, there are some concerns that are not addressed here. How were the expression values, as shown in the graphs, obtained from the raw data files? The details of the methodology used to analyse the raw data and to generate the ranked gene lists should be given. In the present form, it is difficult to make use of the data for any meaningful scientific analysis. The purpose of this study is to browse a single gene across multiple projects to evaluate its expression profiles in multiple biological systems/conditions in web-based customized graphical views. However, the gene expression data is shown as expression values for some datasets and as Log 2 expression values for the others. There is a typographical mistake in the spellings of granulosa cells. The Pubmed articles linked to the data sets are not available. Although putting together these data is helpful for the analysis of transcriptome data from normal and PCOS patients undergoing IVF, it would be meaningful but not mandatory to include the data available from similar platforms for theca cells. It is a good effort done by the authors to put together several studies.
