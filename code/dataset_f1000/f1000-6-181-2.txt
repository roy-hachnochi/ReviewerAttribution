The manuscript by Mackeh et al. presents a very interesting and novel approach to identify genes that are potentially linked to embryonic development. The authors introducing a valuable resource collecting gene expression profiling datasets from oocytes and surrounding stromal cells of healthy subjects or those with polycystic ovary syndrome, in correlation with IVF outcome. This resource is quite beneficial by providing a catalogue of genes that show altered expression in negative IVF outcome. The transcriptomic datasets are presented in an easy-to-use interactive web application that enables users, including those who are not experts in gene expression profiling, to identify altered gene expression in oocytes and associated cells in normal and diseased situations. Overall, I would give the manuscript in its current form a high priority to be indexed. I have minor comment and suggestion. In page 3, the first paragraph (line 10) of the introduction, the secondary oocyte is also commonly known as ‘egg’. I would suggest that both terms are mentioned. It will be interesting for the authors to check whether adding the term (Egg) in the queries will yield extra datasets. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.
