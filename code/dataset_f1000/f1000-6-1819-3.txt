 In the methods, the author used SatScan and used 50% of population at risk to be a radius at the province level. Using such technique at the provincial level (large geographic area) may lead to inaccurate cluster as you can see in the result that one cluster cover the whole region. In the result, Moran’ I present very low spatial correlation (0.07), although it presented statistically significant. The correlational value cannot accept the spatial correlation that exists, and therefore all following spatial data analysis may not be necessary. LISA and Local G were used for different purpose, I don’t think comparison between this two is needed. The number of CRD may relate with the accessibility to healthcare service in Bangkok metropolitan and some surrounding area. The author may explain whether this point may affect the study result.
