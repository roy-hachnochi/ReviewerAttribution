The authors are to be congratulated for conducting this work and submitting it for publication. It contributes to the very limited body of knowledge about pulmonary arterial hypertension in the bovine species. This clinically relevant work, although with very small numbers of animals, relates on a preliminary basis, potential influence of intestinal disease on pulmonary disorders. The authors aptly discuss limitations due to small sample size as well as the confounding that occurred during the experiment. Results testing the original hypothesis were confounded by intestinal disease in two of the three control animals. However, findings from the two diseased animals provided preliminary evidence that might prove to be a basis for further exploration. Results are clinically plausible and warrant further investigation. There is not evidence in the manuscript that any attempts to identify the etiologic agent or agents involved with the bloody scours cases. Coccidiosis should be considered a presumptive diagnosis rather than confirmed. The authors clearly defined their hypotheses and carried out the study as planned with the addition of the adaptations required by confounding disease cases in control animals, which led to unexpected findings. Results appear to be fully reported and are very informative to the reader. As the authors state, this report should be interpreted as preliminary evidence.
