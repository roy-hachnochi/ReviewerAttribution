 Many parts of the report need good English editing and avoidance of long sentences. The discussion does not report comparisons between anaemic and non anaemic in terms of anthropometry. Nor is there any emphasis on iron deficiency without anaemia. Are there any interactions between iron, zinc and cooper?, needs speculating! May be above the scope of this study but no data is reported on food intake or at least food behaviour in terms of frequency (skipping breakfast for example?). The parasite status is not brought significantly in the results with their interaction with micronutrient status. They are also omitted totally in the discussion. The conclusion is very weak and general. It needs to reports the main contributions of this study
