 “The ECLIA methods offer a wider analytical measurement range for CSA and TAC than CMAI methods.” It would be helpful to include the upper limits for the CMIA assays for comparison. “The claimed functional sensitivity of the ECLAI ISD methods are improved for TAC and SRL compared to CMIA ISD methods.” It would be helpful to include the CMIA data for comparison. “Overall, all three ECLID ISDs met our acceptance criteria, with SRL slightly exceeding the limit for slope.” The two parts of this sentence are incongruent. SRL did not meet your pre-determined criteria. It is inappropriate to set pre-determined acceptance criteria and then not use them. “In conclusion, the overall analytical evaluation of ELCIA method for CSA, TAC and SRL met acceptable performance” The same comment applies here. One of the strengths of this paper is that pre-determined criteria were established. I think it’s fair to state the in spite of not meeting all pre-determined performance criteria, the ECLIA methods are of sufficient quality to accept them for clinical service. Some re-wording should correct this.
