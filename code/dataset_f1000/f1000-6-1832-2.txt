Fung et al. present data evaluating three new ECLIA assays for the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and sirolimus on a Roche Cobas e411 analyzer. Overall the study design is sound generally following CLSI guidelines for method validation. The introduction provides a thorough background on the drugs/assays being evaluated and the methods section clearly describes each portion of the method validation that would easily allow another researcher to replicate the study if desired. The results/discussion section succinctly presents their data in a cohesive and systematic manner and the authors do a great job at highlighting the novel aspects of their study. Their conclusion that these three new assays are fit for use for therapeutic drug monitoring is supported by the data presented.
