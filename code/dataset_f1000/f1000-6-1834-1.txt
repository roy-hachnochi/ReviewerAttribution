The revised version of "Laboratory growth of denitrifying water column microbial consortia from deep-sea shipwrecks in the northern Gulf of Mexico", allows a better interpretation of the data thanks to the new mat and met section. I still have concern about the fact that the method used by the author can't really test that each shipwreck has a particular DN consortium. I can understand that samples are difficult to obtain but I would recommend to change a little bit the last paragraph to temper your words. For example instead of saying "Each shipwreck site" say "The Water mass passing by each shipwreck site". It is a small difference but I think a reader that only read the last section of the discussion would think that the shipwreck itself has its own DN consortium. It might be true but it is not what you test for.
