The paper entitled “Laboratory growth of denitrifying water column microbial consortia from deep-sea shipwrecks in the northern Gulf of Mexico” by Haridas et al . explores the potential of steel shipwrecks to host a specialized community with a focus on denitrifying bacteria. Overall the paper is well written and easy to follow, their results are relevant but before suggesting the acceptance of the manuscript, I suggest that authors resubmit a modified version of the manuscript that include a detailed material and method section. 16S amplicon sequencing section : Please provide the DNA extraction kit details Please provide the name of the sequencing platform and primers Please explain the bioinformatics treatment including the taxonomic affiliation used Denitrifying microbial consortia : Why did the authors extend the incubation time up to 30 days, I am wondering if they checked for contamination from external source. 16S amplicon sequencing : I am very surprised about the very low diversity they obtained, I agree that they enriched the community in DN bacteria but with only two tubes for two conditions I am not convinced they do not just select for a contaminant or a bacterium in each tube. How did the authors obtained these percentages, BLAST ? Discussion I think the conclusion that shipwreck are good prospecting area for novel microbial consortia is highly speculative based on these data especially without a reference point before the water mass flow across the wreck.
