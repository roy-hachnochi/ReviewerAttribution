The structural properties of a protein site in the native state of the protein are known to strongly influence its evolutionary rate, according to research of which the corresponding author has been a prominent exponent. This finding gives useful insights on how natural selection targets the structural properties of proteins. This paper presents computational protocols for measuring site-specific substitution rates in protein families, either at the amino-acid or at the codon level, and mapping them to the site-specific structural descriptors that have been found to influence the rates most strongly, such as relative solvent accessibility and weighted contact number. All the necessary software is clearly illustrated and all the relevant input and output files are made available to researchers willing to repeat the exercise, to whom this report will be for sure useful. However, I think that the paper falls a bit short in motivating why it is interesting to perform this computation for a protein family of interest, besides recovering the known correlations between evolutionary rates and structural descriptors. Secondly, different methods and software exist to compute substitution rates. The authors show that, for the protein family that they choose, rates at the amino-acid and at the nucleotide level obtained with the same software yield almost identical results. How do results compare using different software (Rate4site versus HyPhy)? How do the authors interpret the sites with estimated dN/dS1, which is considered an indication of positive selection, in the context of the protein structure?
