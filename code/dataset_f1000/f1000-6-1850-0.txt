Kalkeri and Murthy offer a valuable brief review of tissue reservoirs and its implications for transmission and treatment of Zika infection. Since studies of persistence of Zika virus infection in tissue reservoirs are limited in humans and hence not well understood, insights from rhesus macaque and mouse models of Zika infection are important to characterize persistence and its relevance to transmission and pathogenesis, as well as addressing challenges in treatment and diagnosis. Not mentioned in the review is the finding of persistence in whole blood, and in particular RBCs, after clearance from plasma (several publications) and the potential risk for transmission through bone marrow, cord blood and peripheral blood stem cell transplants. Transfusion transmission has been documented as another mode of transmission. Co-circulation of related Flaviviruses in Zika endemic areas is a concern for ADE of subsequent antigenically similar viruses as mentioned in the review. However evidence for ADE in humans is lacking. ADE from previous Dengue virus exposure has been demonstrated in vitro and in mouse models, but not in rhesus macaques and is not confirmed by human epidemiological studies based on several recent publications. Conclusions about ADE should therefore be made with caution. Briefly mentioned are issues with serological diagnostics, which are challenging due to cross reactivity and anamnestic response in serial infections by similar viruses as well as Arboviral vaccination. There are limitations with many existing assays, however newer assays have been more successful in differentiating Zika from Dengue. Access to samples from ZIKV/DENV infected macaques could allow for advances in this important area. Reference 37 (ZIKV in saliva) is incorrectly placed in the context of ADE second paragraph of page 3. Suggest adding references at the bottom.
