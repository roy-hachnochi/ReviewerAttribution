I thank the authors for addressing my feedback on the first version of the paper. Most of my reservations were adequately addressed. A few grammatical or typological errors remain (e.g. “metain-vasion”, “data” treated as a singular) but these are very minor concerns. There is, however, one point that I think warrants a follow-up comment from the authors. Fruit fly responses typically involve heightened trapping for monitoring eradication. The 3-generation guideline operates from the time that the last insect is detected. Similarly, the agent-based simulation (ABS) implicitly assumes that no further fruit flies are detected - otherwise this would influence decision-making around the appropriate quarantine period. However, there might be some simulations in which the ABS population becomes large, and these would most likely be those that persist for the longest and have the greatest chance of generating further detections. This might introduce a slight bias in the results, such that the ABS potentially overestimates the quarantine time required since the last detection. This does not at all alter the conclusions from the study, but it does highlight the importance of surveillance trapping in informing eradication decision making.
