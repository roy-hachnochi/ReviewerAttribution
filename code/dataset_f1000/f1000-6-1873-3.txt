The authors address an important issue. I have the following comments: Most of the literature is old, and the authors should use more up-to-date literature. This also includes the methods and how to calculate default rates. The authors chose a method whereby they exclude patients who were lost to follow-up. However, this is a too simplistic approach. The authors should read the latest WHO recommendations on doing such calculations. The biggest problem with this paper is how they handle missing information. They state that: "We analysed only patients with confirmed drug sensitive pulmonary TB, and we excluded from the analysis patients who transferred out or had missing outcomes." Also, as there is a high prevalence of drug resistance in their country, the exclusions of these patients can affect the result of this paper. Even if they wish to examine only patients with bacteria sensitive to antituberculosis drugs, the numbers should be mentioned so the reader would understand the total picture. From the paper, I understand there are about 1200 new patients with tuberculosis in their Oblast. This calculation is based on the population in the province and the incidents estimate the authors provide. They find only 562, and of those, 380 were expected to complete the treatment. The authors should explain the discrepancy between what was expected and what was found. Patients who were lost to follow-up were excluded from their analysis. This is not how it should be done according to the latest WHO recommendations. Also, the authors should do some sensitivity analysis on data. So, if we include those who were missing and those who were transferred out, the treatment complete rate is only 56%. In the discussion, the authors do not discuss these major weaknesses and how they analysed the data. In addition, they need to explain the seeming discrepancy between incident cases during the year and the numbers they analysed.
