The mast cell (MC) was discovered by Paul Ehrlich in 1876. The MC is a unique bone marrow-derived cells since mast cells (MCs) are not found in the blood stream. They are located in tissues of the body where they can reside for many months or years. The first historical MC path led to the understanding of its role in health. The next path of MC research led to the discovery of the rare, yet well accepted disease mastocytosis - a primary malignant process that had systemic MC-mediator induced symptoms. The next remarkable discovery was that mutations could lead to active MCs and be responsible for over 48 symptoms throughout the body. This confounding presentation of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) usually causes confusion and frustration to the physician as well as to the patient. Once MCAS is diagnosed, treatment is often helpful and allows most patients to regain a better quality of life. The next query posed by Molderings et al is whether or not the MC plays a role in cancer in humans. There are four animal models to suggest that there was a modulating effect in cancer development. Other studies show potential suppression of cancer by MCs. The human connection has been explored in this journal in a large population of MCAS patients. In this study, 828 MCAS were investigated. A history of solid malignant lesions was queried prior to establishing the diagnosis of MCAS. The authors suggest that this data should be compelling evidence for physicians to perform more intense screening for malignancies in those who have MCAS. The ultimate challenge is to see if modulation, suppression or stabilization of MCs and/or MCAS can decrease the risk and/or progression of cancer.
