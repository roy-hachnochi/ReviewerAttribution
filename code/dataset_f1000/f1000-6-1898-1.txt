The study is carefully done and the topic is interesting for clinicians. Comments/remarks: You write the exact number of preoperative and postoperative medications the patients used. As there are differences in the IOP-lowering effects of the different types of these drugs, it would be interesting to see what type of IOP-lowering drugs the patients applied and if there was a difference in the type of drugs used pre- and postoperatively. You state that you used postoperative needling with Mitomycine C, but you do not clarify when exactly ("impending failure from a contracting bleb" is not specific). Please give a comment in which patients you used the needling and add also in how many patients a needling was necessary. In the "Conclusions" of the abstract you state that "the bleb features failed to predict a successful outcome" while in the "Conclusions" at the end of the manuscript you say that an augmented vascularity in the bleb should be carefully observed. Please add this sentence in the "Conclusions" of the abstract.
