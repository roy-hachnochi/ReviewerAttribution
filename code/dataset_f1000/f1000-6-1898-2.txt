This is a carefully done study containing interesting results which merit indexing. It is very useful and can provide a proof for ophthalmologist to decide how long the patient should be re-visit postoperation according to IOP change. For the benefit of the reader, however, a number of points need clarifying and certain statements require further justification. A few minor revisions are list below. There are mistakes in the study results and we listed some examples in the following and you should revised it in your paper carefully and discreetly. 1.1 In the article, they describe that collect IOP outcomes on Day 7, but it was Week 2 in table 2. In the results part of Line 3 Page 1 (All Pâ‰¥0.2), but it was 0.193 in day 1 in table 2. 1.2 IOP change more than 3mmHg in Page 1, but it was less than or equal than 3 mmHg in Page 6. There are some misunderstanding in the article. 2.1 The first sentence in the results of page 1. (Age and gender were equally distributed (62.313.1 years, P=0.911).) 2.2 The anterior chamber was formed by injection of BSS a paracentesis, and the filtration was titrated by adjusting the tension of the scleral flap sutures.(Page 3). The releasable sutures were removed as needed after 72 hours depending on bleb appearance to achieve IOPs near 10 mmHg. (Page 3, Marked in yellow and underline). In what time the releasable suture were removed for most of them (for example 7-10 days or something else for 70%(or ?%) patient), and you removed the two releasable suture for one time or two time respectively. If you removed the suture for two times, how much time will pass between them.
