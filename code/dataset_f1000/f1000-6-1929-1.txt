There is rationale for investigating how to standardize contouring. Hepatocellular carcinoma is an excellent site to investigate neural networks, since there is variability in contouring, and sometimes, the full extent of HCC is challenging to delineate. However, normal tissues and OAR atlases already exist, so there is less rationale to include some OARs where automated segmentation is already in the clinic. Design of the research is reasonable, with one exception. Training two residents to contour is likely to be associated with inaccuracies in contours. It would be better to have experienced faculty radiation oncologists contour, and a radiologist to provide input, especially for challenging cases Datasets are described, but more details are needed. E.g. what exact cases are to be used? Early stage HCC, or HCC with vascular invasion. Snapshots of the exact cases in an appendix may be helpful.
