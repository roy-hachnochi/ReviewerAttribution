My main concern is the discontinuity between the introduction and the research conducted. The introduction focused on problems of pharmaceutical purchased which were laced with counterfeit fentanyl. This is true and is a major health hazard as pointed out by the authors. Fentanyls are a deadly pharmaceuticals and again this was emphasized by the authors. However, the paper's research focus is on tweets from people who are interested in purchasing fentanyl illegally. It wasn't on the counterfeit fentanyl laced products. I suggest that the intro be rewritten and I mention the legitimate uses of fentanyl. Please mention that one of fentanyl's major uses is as a pain reliever in hospital surgical suites and must be carefully controlled by medical practitioners. To reiterate, the introduction doesn't match well the research content. The methodology approach was was appropriate and innovative. I know they provided a link for a full description of the search terms, but in reading it I suggest that they provided at least a partial list of the names used i.e. different spellings of fentanyl, different names for the same product (foreign names). Searching tweets was original, but it didn't produce huge number of tweets. This is worth reporting in that few people tweet to purchase fentanyl . The first thing I thought of was why tweet when you can do a google search and get right to the web sites? This needs to be put in the discussion as to why the results were so low. I am sure there are other methods to find the product.
