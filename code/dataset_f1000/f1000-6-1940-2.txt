This manuscript describes a single 32 year old woman with Ring 18 and rheumatoid arthritis. Overall the manuscript is well written, however there are several items that need further work before publicaiton. Most of the literature on Ring 18 has been omitted. The paper would benefit from a better review of Ring 18 as opposed to mostly 18p- and 18q-. Has the lung disease eve been reported? The methods and data that determined the actual chromosome content are missing. The percent that each cell type is present in the blood as well as the FISH studies definitively demonstrating each should be included. From the text it is not clear if the “duplication of the long arm” is present as a ring or an isochromosome. The aCGH showing net copy number suggests that not all of the long arm is duplicated since a larger proportion of cells have an 18q terminal deletion than have an 18p terminal deletion. What percent of the cells actually have a ring chromosome? The interpretation of the FISH data needs to be described more fully. Why are there two BCL2 probes? I don’t see a D18Z1 signal? The table needs to be made more clear in its title that it only includes RA cases and not all Ring 18 or 18q-, 18p- cases (at least I think that is the intent). In the first paragraph of the discussion, the last sentence needs a reference.
