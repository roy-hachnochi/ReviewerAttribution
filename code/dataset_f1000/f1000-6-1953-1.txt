This paper contains data clearly presented showing the relevance of inflammation in dysglycemic states. The group investigated is adequate in size and selection of the population in the city of Maracaibo. It is interesting the demonstration of different factors promoting prehypertension and sustained arterial hypertension and how inflammation acts when blood pressure is above 140/90 mmHg. The article in its present format is scientifically sound albeit the only caveat is that it refers only to the population of a single city.
