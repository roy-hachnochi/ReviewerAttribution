Authors have addressed the majority of the concerns except few. Eg. No correction of epithelial sarcoma to epithelioid sarcoma, expanding on the physical and gross examination for thigh mass and adrenal metastasis. There is some problem with spacing between the words as well, eg- "AMRI", "withNF1". Please consider addressing these issues.
