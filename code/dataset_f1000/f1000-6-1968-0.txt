The authors have responded well to each individual point raised. We would recommend that fish populations used in experimental infections including immunological studies are routinely screened for pathogens before entering experimental infections, and not just assessed by measuring mortality. The lack of mortality may not warrant freedom of infection. The presence of low virulent variants of virus may be missed, but they could still have impact on parameters used for measuring immune responses.
