Thank you to the authors for writing a summary of what seems to be a very successful collaborative coding event, with this manuscript in particular focused on preparation for the event, managing logistic concerns during the event, and an overview of the projects supported. The manuscript is quite well written, and I have no concerns about the content presented therein. I especially appreciate the recommendations for how to solicit diverse leaders/participants, engage with partner organizations, and carefully craft a sense of community among attendees. Moreover, the authors include suggestions on how to improve similar events in the future. The data reported here provide an important context for comparison for events which continue to encourage participation from underrepresented groups. Although not highlighted in the paper, the itinerary for the three-day meeting described here includes a number of additional details which would be useful to other coding event organizers. For example, while the majority of meeting time was dedicated to team work, extra workshops and talks were offerred (e.g., introduction to git) that would be encourage skills development for students or other participants new to the field. I'll be interested to see whether this model for hosting a hackathon continues at ASHG or other meetings.
