This data adds information about this important organism in the standard format to report a draft genome these days so it looks fine. They used hiseq and sequence coverage (BUSCO) looks appropriate and expected although there are relatively large differences between the two isolates (i.e .different final genome sizes and busco completeness scores). One suggestion is to add information on how many libraries they sequenced, and if it was only paired end and not also mate paired.
