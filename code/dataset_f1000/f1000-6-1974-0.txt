This is an interesting case report of an angina bullosa hemorrhagica of the tongue. This is a rare condition of oral bullae, that is most frequent in hard palate and buccal mucosa. Authors said that the cause is unclear, however most of this bullae are of traumatic origin. For this reason it is important to mention to avoid any traumatic agent, like a malpositioned tooth or a restoration with defects, and the derivation to the dentist. Authors discard other common cause of these bullae that is the thrombocytopenic purpura. This is a good article about angina bullosa hemorrhagica and it is well-written, but I think that they have to mention how important is to consult with a dentist, and to consider thrombocytopenic purpura as differential diagnosis, including the number of platelet count in the article (authors only said that is normal).
