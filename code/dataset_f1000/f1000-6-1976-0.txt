The updated manuscript is well written and describe a very useful R package for the quality control, exploration and statistical analysis of RNA-seq data. The changes in the new version make this a better resource, by adding a useful section on Functional Analysis and by fully leveraging the SummarizedExperiment and GRanges Bioconductor infrastructures. However, the following (mostly minor) issues are still outstanding and the authors need to address them for me to approve without reservations: 1. As pointed out in my previous review and by the other reviewer, the authors refer to bcbioRNASeq as a Bioconductor package, when it is not part of the Bioconductor project. I again suggest that the authors submit their package to Bioconductor. Until then, this should be referred to as a R package. 2. Although the authors addressed my comment on the description of the plots, some figures remain a bit opaque. For instance, what is the interpretation of Figure 2F? Similarly, the range of the x-axis in Figure 3A makes the plot hard to interpret. 3. Figure 8 is not rendered correctly in the PDF and HTML versions of the article. 4. There are some inconsistencies between the code in the article and the code in the Github repository. For instance in Figure 13 the code in the text says "vst", while in the repository it uses "rlog". It is unclear which is shown in the figure. In addition, when describing plotPCACovariates, in the text the authors say that the used FDR0.05 but in the code they use 0.1. Please double check all the code. 5. The function `enrichMap` is deprecated. The authors should use the function `emapplot`. In addition, it should be made clear that these functions are part of the DOSE package.
