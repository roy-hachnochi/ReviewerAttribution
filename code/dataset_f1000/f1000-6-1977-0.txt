The manuscript titled “The decision to delivery interval in emergency caesarean sections: Impact of anaesthetic technique and work shift” is a well written study with limitations due to the retrospective nature. I have three comments for possible revision: Please specify the top-up timing: The most interesting result as the similar onset of epidural top-up to spinal anesthesia without any given information about the used local anesthetic volume. When were top-ups injected? (in the delivery unit just following c-section decision or in OR?) Please specify the type of spinal bupivacaine (hyper-/ iso-baric?) The main limitation is the lack of details about cesarean delivery indications. It is not surprising that general anesthesia allowed to quickest possible operation start. But particularly general anesthesia group includes possibly more emergent cases leading to lower Apgar scores. It may give more insight to the reader, if the authors can give data about the number of neonates with pH7.1 at birth.
