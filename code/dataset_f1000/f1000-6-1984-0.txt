Thank you, here are some comments about the contents of the article. In the background it has not been explained specifically why the characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the grouper intestine. The question is that the bacteria will be mixed with fish feed in order to increase the digestibility of the food or the prevention of pathogens that attack groupers. Procedure of taking bacterial inoculum in the grouper's bowel. Is the fish fasted first? This is to know the bacteria do live in the intestines of grouper fish instead of bacterial contaminants derived from food given. In the discussion section has not been submitted phenotype characteristics of three types of bacterial isolates LAB. These traits include color, colony shape, surface roughness of the colony and will be better when displayed images with given information. The RNA sequence results also need to be displayed to make the right conclusions in the characterization process. It would be great if supported with comparative literature. It would be great if the discussion section uses more literature to discuss especially the latest journals.
