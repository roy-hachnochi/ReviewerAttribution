The alpheid shrimp guard, Alpheus lottini , also should be noted as defending pocilloporid corals from COTS attacks. This shrimp guard occurs world-wide on pocilloporid corals. It would also be worth noting the defensive behaviour, if any, of the crustacean guards toward the fish corallivores. ‘White feeding scars’ are referred to in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 (supplementary image). These are difficult to make out in the photographs. I suggest adding arrows to make these easier to see. Also, it would be useful to know the approximate diameters of the P. eydouxi colonies.
