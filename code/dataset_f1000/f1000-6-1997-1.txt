The most interesting is 1. Sevo is much faster at FGF 2 in Aisys. 2. Des is much faster at FGF 4 in Aisys However, the results report is confused, as Table 1 indicates that it contains both times to fastest deployment and time to plateau, while the table only contains one time per machine and gas. Figure 1. Is it exactly the same principle of the circles in the two respirator machines? There should be 1 Figure for each machine, as the design of the circle may affect gas consumption. Fig.2. Put labels on all shoulders in the Figure instead of caption. Put headlines in the Figure to facilitate reading. In 2a, there should be Flow-I SEV, 2b Flow-I DES, in 2c Aisys SEV and 2d Aisys DES. Both Sevoflurane and Desflurane interfere chemically with the absorber, especially when dry, as in these experiments. This might give a certain difference in the consumption of gas. How does the authors comment on this? Is it exactly the same principle of the circles in the two respirator machines?
