The authors have addressed my concerns appropriately in the revised version. However, there are some issues that need additional revision. The authors should insert a reference for "1 MAC adjusted of a 40 year-old (2% for sevoflurane and 6% for desflurane)" in the Methods. The sentence "There are slightly lower values suggested." in the Limitations should be changed into "There are slightly different values suggested." since, according to the study of Nickalls RWD. BJA 2003; 91: 170-4, 1 MAC adjusted of a 40 year-old for sevoflurane and desflurane are both lower and higher, ie. 1.8% for sevoflurane and 6.6% for desflurane. Please also insert a reference for this sentence.
