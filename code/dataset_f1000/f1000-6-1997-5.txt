Thank you for asking me for a peer review. I have some questions to the authors regarding the study: The impact of fresh gas flow on wash-in, wash-out time and gas consumption for sevoflurane and desflurane, comparing two anaesthesia machines, a test-lung study. by J. Jakobsson. Is there a difference between the two vaporizer used in the experiment? Comment on the difference in a direct-injection and a bypass affect how respirators works. Why the maximum inflow of the two gases? This is not clinically relevant. Would not it be better for another group with half the inflow, 4% and 8%? Why non-parametric tests? Is this normal distribution of data? The figures are not sufficient quality, high solution pictures please. Explain in an educational way how you calculate gas consumption. Do you have any theory why Aisys is faster at low flow with desflurane? Do you have any theories? Why does it take longer to wash-out desflurane than sevoflurane in a mechanical lung model? This does not correspond to the clinical picture. Does desflurane have lower density than sevoflurane? Is that why it takes longer to wash-out the desfluran? Can you come up with some theories about the most remarkable result in the study? I can not find sevoflurane wash-out in Figure 4.
