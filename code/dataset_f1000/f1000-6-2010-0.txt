GSEA analysis methods do not all produce same results. Score-based gene set analysis methods like the Broad Institute GSEA tool are considered to perform better than normal Fisher’s exact test (overrepresentation analysis). But analysts often use methods they know to be less than ideal in order to reduce complexity and save time. So it is good to have a unified interface for GSEA analyses with R – it helps save programming time and reduces complexity. In addition EGSEA is a unique method that combines up to 12 gene set analysis methods into a single score. Independent test also corroborate that the tool using the 12 has more specificity and good sensitivity compared to using some of the tests alone. The EGSEA 1-2-3 workflow is easy to use and generate good-quality figures with the ggplot2 R package. So9me of the figures are novel compared to other packages e.g., scatter plots designed to compare different contrasts. It is also very useful that the tool can be applied to multiple contrasts at a time, although if there are too many contrasts then the number of plots becomes unwieldly (increases combinatorically). Some more technical comments: The results object is very complicated for retrieving individual method analysis results (although summaries are readily available). I quite like the "biobroom" Bioconductor package that does "tidy" data frames from limma results objects. All in all a very useful package both for automating the running of lots of methods at the same time and of course for the "ensemble" method. It is recommended to be considered to be part of a standard bioinformatics workflow.
