This article describes a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) workflow for the "Ensembl of GSEA" (EGSEA) R/Bioconductor software package . EGSEA is an ensemble-like method recently published 1 by the authors of this workflow that allows the user to simultaneously apply different GSEA algorithms on a high-throughput molecular profiling data set, by combining p-values associated with each algorithm using classical meta-analysis approaches such as the Fisher's method. Because the statistical methodology is already described in detail in the corresponding publication, the present software tool article focuses on showing a step-by-step workflow with EGSEA. However, the vignette of the software package already provides a very detailed description about how to use EGSEA through its 39 pages. Therefore, it would be useful for the interested reader to find upfront when he/she should be consulting the vignette and when he/she should be consulting this workflow. Besides this introductory aspects, the following issues should be addressed before approval: The code given in the article breaks, at least in my computer, more concretely, at this line: gsa = egsea(voom.results=v, contrasts=contr.matrix, gs.annots=gs.annots, symbolsMap=symbolsMap, baseGSEAs=baseMethods, sort.by="med.rank", num.threads = 8, report = FALSE) EGSEA analysis has started ##------ Mon Nov 27 12:37:42 2017 ------## Log fold changes are estimated using limma package ... limma DE analysis is carried out ...

EGSEA is running on the provided data and c2 collection .......camera*....safe*...gage*.padog*....gsva*..fry*...plage*...globaltest*...zscore*...ora*...ssgsea* Error in temp.results[[baseGSEA]][[i]][names(gs.annot@idx), ] : incorrect number of dimensions while running it with the latest release version 1.6.0. This is strange since the package builds and runs the vignette without problems. So, this might be related to the different sample data sets. A possible hint may come from the fact that the 'buildIdx()' call is not returning the expected class of object, according to the workflow: class(gs.annots$s2) ## [1] "NULL" summary(gs.annots$s2) ## Length Class Mode ## 0 NULL NULL The workflow contains a rather high amount of code, often with a non-trivial use of externally instantiated objects and nested calls to functions. It would be helpful for the interested reader to be able to easily copy and paste the instructions, but the fact that R commands are given with the R shell '' and '+' symbols makes it less easy. A non-expert user may even copy those characters and get an error. I would recommend removing those characters from the illustrated code, just as it happens with the vignette. The workflow assumes that the user has a 'DGEList' object with gene metadata including the mapping between Entrez identifiers' and HGNC symbols. This is a rather unrealistic assumption and I would recommend that the workflow starts building that object from scratch and showing how to build that table of gene metadata. Below I also describe other issues that I would recommend to be considered in future versions of the software but which I do not consider them to be required for approval of this article: The so-called "summary plot" shows the -log10 p-value on the x-axis and average absolute log fold-change of the set genes on the y-axis. Because this is in a way analogous to a rotated volcano plot, I would suggest to use the same arrangement of axes as in the volcano plot, which is a rather standardized display of significance and magnitude of the effects of interest. One of the key features of the Bioconductor project, to which the EGSEA package is contributing to, is enabling software interoperability through sharing the use of common data structures across different software packages. Using specialized data structures, where analogous ones have been already designed by the Bioconductor core team or by a wider community of developers, locks the user into that package and limits the possibilities of using it as a building block in other more complex workflows. I'm making this comment because I have the impression that the EGSEA package would benefit of using the infrastructure provided by the Bioconductor GSEABase package , in which data structures are defined to store and access gene sets and collections of gene sets of different kinds. A salient feature of that infrastructure is the possibility to seamlessly map gene identifiers of different kinds. This would simplify and improve the user experience of EGSEA since mapping between genes coded with a particular kind of identifier, and gene sets defined with another kind, is one of the most common tasks in a GSEA-like analysis.
