The method article from Niederer et al. describes the identification of organic pigments in the complexes matrices of tattoo ink and permanent make-up using Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. The authors created a reference library of 150 colorants and analyzed a total of 451 inks. The qualitative method described in this article was validated and counter checked with a complementary HPLC analysis suitable for soluble colorants. The method is highly valuable to identify tattoo pigments in the course of market surveys. Their results show, that false declaration and fraud are frequent among tattoo and permanent make-up inks. In the following minor amendments are suggested: Despite the common use of the plural form in the abbreviation PMUs, make-up itself comes without a plural and is considered uncountable. The authors used both the color index and names of pigments to facilitate readability for scientists from different fields. In the section market survey an additional abbreviation PG7 appears. This might be replaced by either of the other identifiers. In the abstract and section "market survey" the authors refer to the ban of pigments because of the hazardous properties and toxicological concerns. Although this might be correct for some pigments, the ban for tattoo inks might also derive from missing toxicological data instead of data claiming hazards, e.g. in the case of pigment green 7. In summary, the presented method is of major value not only in the field of tattoo and permanent make up compliance, but may also be applied to cosmetic products or used in forensic analyses.
