In the current manuscript, the authors have investigated the impact of positive selection and negative selection on the activation, function, and proliferation of monocytes. It is an important study as many researchers use these techniques interchangeably, greatly impacting the final outcome of the study and erroneous conclusion. Though the current study has used only a few experiments to draw the conclusion, their study design was neat. The authors may clarify some minor points to make the manuscript better: In the introduction section, the authors have written: "CD14 lacks a cytoplasmatic domain and such cells are reported to function in a restricted manner" - a brief explanation of what is meant by restricted manner would be helpful. The sentence on page number 5 reads: 'These were the cells from which the microbeads were either degraded or " detected " and cells were without microbeads.' : Probably instead of detected, it will be detached. Is the size of the beads known? Can there be a size-dependent effect due to steric hindrance of the CD14 bound beads to the TLR4? If only antibody is used, can we see the same effect? The main function of CD14 in LPS signaling in monocytes is it binds with LPS binding protein (LBP). The role of LBP appears to be that of aiding LPS to dock at the LPS receptor complex by initially binding LPS and then forming a ternary complex with CD14, thus enabling LPS to be transferred to the LPS receptor complex composed of TLR4 and MD-2. As in these in vitro studies, LBP has not been used, probably CD14 may not directly affect the LPS binding with the TLR4 receptor.
