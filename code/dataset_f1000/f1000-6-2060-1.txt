This article describes the setup of a multi-cloud architecture that can support the execution of META-pipe jobs for marine metagenomic data analysis. And META-pipe provides assembly of high-throughput sequence data, functional annotation of predicted genes, and taxonomic profiling. R emarks: The introduction of META-pipe backend architecture and deployment is detailed and clear It achieves the goal which is to provide a powerful analysis service that is easy to use and to maintain since META-pipe has web app and GUI that the users just set parameters and then they can make analysis of data. In the chapter concerning resource provider (page 6), “The tools described in the previous section simplifies this task“ needs more details like names of the tools since there are some tools referred in the previous section. It would be easy to understand. There is less example to indicate tasks in META-pipe can be easy and fast. It would be better to give some data like running time and volume to state. Giving other projects differed from this as ‘ control group ’and setting characters to make comparisons will be more persuasive. There are some spelling mistakes like ‘manger’.
