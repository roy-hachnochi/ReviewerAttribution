Findings of this study add further evidence regarding the burden of healthcare expenditure amongst the poor people in a developing country like Cambodia. The authors have explained the rationale for conducting this study well and utilized secondary database to answer the research question. Data comparison between 2010 and 2005 in the Figure and Table were informative. It was good to observe the changes regarding use of other facilities in the third instance in 2010 compared to the data from 2005. However, use of private facilities in the second instance did not change over years, which was not an unexpected scenario in developing countries although not acceptable. Hence policy makers should address the factors to increase utilization of public healthcare facilities. The major portion of the out of pocket expenditure was from either savings or wages/pocket money, which did not change over years as well. The authors have nicely indicated policy implications of the evidence generated from this study, which should be communicated to the policy makers in Cambodia to expect changes in future.
