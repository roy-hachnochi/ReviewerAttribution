This is very timing report addressing the most important public health issue, prediction of influenza vaccine efficacy. While we certainly are better prepared to flu epidemics in 2018 than in 1918, low efficiency of vaccination in recent flu season in Australia and currently ongoing flu in the US with increasing numbers of severe cases among children and elderly patients raised reasonable questions regarding prediction of correct vaccine formulations. Influenza viruses are moving targets and we have to do better job to predict and manufacture effective vaccines in timing manner. The authors applied innovative Informative Spectrum Method and analysed an extensive collection of influenza isolates from Australia and the US during July â€“ September 2017. Based on this analysis they have predicted sub optional vaccine effectiveness for ongoing flu season in the US. The manuscript is well-written, results are solid and supported by well-developed bioinformatics tools. Discussion is appropriate. The manuscript is recommended for accelerated publication.
