This is a very interesting report describing a technique for computational assessment of potential vaccine efficacy of H3N2 influenza viruses. It is clear that improved techniques for predicting seasonal influenza virus vaccine efficacy are needed and this could become one of a group of evaluations that yield more precise predictions. I am not competent to evaluate the mathematical underpinnings of these analyses, but it would seem like some statistical analyses should be invoked; I leave it to the other reviewer(s) and editors to indicate if that is the case. The other comment I would make is that it seems as if a more historical set of evaluations would be valuable - the 2017 season is not yet over and, as the authors repeatedly indicate, things make change in terms of the viruses that come to predominate, especially in the U.S. Overall, I think this is a valuable contribution to forecasting for influenza virus efficacy and encourage the authors to use additional historical datasets for further evaluate the utility of the technique. Minor comments: In the 2017, flu season in Australia VE was only 10% - In the 2017 flu season in Australia, VE was .. In this study, we compared HA1 of H3N2: you haven't defined HA1 yet - might say the sequence of hemagglutinin HA1
