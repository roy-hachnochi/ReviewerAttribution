Authors of the paper "Dyslipidemia: Genetics, lipoprotein lipase and HindIII polymorphism‚Äù summarizes several papers published by Latin American researchers about lipid disorders. The document highlight the need for more studies about genetics of dyslipidemia in this region. The main limitations of the study are: The paper covers a large number of topics. As a result, information is presented without a critical analyses. Since the HindIII polymorphism is the main issue under review, a large proportion of the review could be summarized and the HindIII polymorphism data extended. For example, the genes involved in familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia are enlisted partially (i.e. ABCA1 was not mentioned). It is not clear the reason to devote several paragrapjs for FH genes when they are not related with the main topic of this review. Reasons for the large differences in the prevalence of the lipid disorders between Latin-American surveys could be critically discussed. The style of the manuscript could be upgraded. The flow of the information should be improved. It is kindly suggested to consider a redesign of the structure of the document.
