This review deals with the following genes involved in lipid metabolism: CETP, LCAT, LDL receptor, apoE, Lp(a), hepatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase. However it misses out details of the apoC3 gene which is the only one in which a specific therapy (volanesorsen) has been developed. A review of this can be found in Galton (2017) 1 . The authors then go on to deal with the Hind 111 polymorphism of Lipoprotein lipase. A common Hind III polymorphism in intron 8 (T/G) of the LPL gene has been found to be associated with altered plasma TG and HDL-cholesterol, and CAD risk in several studies, but they do not comment on its functional significance. It is known that certain intronic sequence contain regulatory elements that are important for transcription and translational regulation of a gene. A recent study (Chen et al. (2008) 2 ) showed that this Hind 111 polymorphism affects the binding site of a transcription factor that regulates the transcription of LPL gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the Hind III site binds to a transcription factor and that the mutant allele has lower binding affinity than the wild type allele. Transcription assays containing the entire intron 8 sequence along with full-length human LPL promoter were carried out in COS-1 and human vascular smooth muscle cells. The mutant allele was associated with significantly decreased luciferase expression level compared to the wild type allele in both the muscle (3.394 0.022 vs. 4.184 0.028; P=4.7 10 âˆ’6 ) and COS-1 (11.603 0.409 vs. 14.373 1.096; P0.0001) cells. This study demonstrates for the first time that the polymorphic Hind III site in the LPL gene is functional because it affects the binding of a transcription factor and it also has an impact on LPL expression.
