The paper presents a very nice overview on how ToolDog is used to (1) generate new tool descriptors for Galaxy and CWL from code analysis, and (2) improve documentation for current tools from the bio.tools registry. This provides a valuable service to the bioinformatics community and in particular to ensuring that tooling information is consistently described but also updatable. In my opinion this should be accepted, with some minor suggested revisions. Speaking of ‘suggestions': The current title ‘Using bio.tools to generate and annotate workbench tool descriptions’ suggests the paper will talk more generally about bio.tools, whereas the text focuses primarily on the specific component ToolDog. The title should be modified to reflect this. The graphs in Fig.2 would be more effective if they were displayed in an integrated manner (single bar chart?), so that the improvements that ToolDog makes are more easily compared to one another. The discussion about the challenges in autogenerating tool documentation (language, code practices, etc), in the discussion, are spot-on. However not much is discussed on if / how ToolDog might address some of these challenges, though there are suggestions on how to more readily map existing tool descriptions to add to or update. Maybe this could be elaborated on, even if it’s indicating the problems may not be easily overcome? I’m wondering whether the information in Fig. 5 might be better displayed (or augmented) as a before / after comparison to more readily demonstrate how ToolDog could automatically improve tool descriptions. Another option is whether this information could be somehow connected to the data in Fig. 2 to show how ToolDog improves the overall documentation.
