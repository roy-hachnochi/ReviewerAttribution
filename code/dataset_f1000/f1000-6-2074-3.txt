From the point of view of a software tool author, it is not a simple task to provide high-quality metadata and software tool descriptions. Any tooling that supports DRY (don't repeat yourself) in this regard is most welcome. The authors describe a path from the bio.tools bioinformatics software registry, which uses a rich metadata schema for syntax, the EDAM ontology for semantics, and strongly written guidelines to ensure high-quality entries, to tool descriptions for the Galaxy workbench and in Common Workflow Language (CWL) for use on various workflow execution environments. Much of the metadata in the tool descriptions is generated by the ToolDog utility from an entry in bio.tools, ensuring proper mapping between metadata concepts. This would be a great help when bootstrapping Galaxy and CWL support for a new software tool. The authors also describe and implement a use case for enriching existing tool descriptions. I am curious if there are practical benefits to enriching tool descriptions with EDAM ontology terms, in addition to quality of metadata from using well defined terms from a controlled vocabulary?
