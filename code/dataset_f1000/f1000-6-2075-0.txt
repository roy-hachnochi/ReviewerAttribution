The authors provide a historical overview of silk cultivation, followed by a bibliometric analysis of literature ranging from 1892 to 2016. Their findings identify an increase in published research and the growing number of keywords over time. In addition to the analysis, the authors provide technical information on the software used for the analysis, namely R package Bibliometrix and SciMAT. Despite the interesting topic, the reviewer has identified several weaknesses, including the need for description of data processing and more clear interpretation of results. Exact pre-processing steps and WOS/SCOPUS query extraction are essential to ensure the reproducibility. In addition, the review of literature on bibliometric analysis is highly recommended. Several figures are not clearly described. For example, Figure 3 states "Collaboration between countries", whereas in the text it refers to isolated publications by country. It is also desirable to re-render figures with a better quality, if feasible.
