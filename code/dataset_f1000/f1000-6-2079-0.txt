The case report suggests that dual inhaled antibiotics are feasible as an option for treatment. There were two treatment courses with dual antibiotics using aztreonam and tobramycin on both occasions. One was associated with a 5 percentage point increase in FEV1 by the end of treatment while the other was associated with a more modest 2%. There were 4 courses of intravenous antibiotics: 1-2) piperacillin/tazobactam + colistin with a 2 percentage point increase with course 1 and a 2 percentage point decrease with course 2; 3) piperacillin/tazobactam + colistin with a 0 percentage point increase; and 4) piperacillin/tazobactam + tobramycin with a 2 percentage point increase. The response to the first course of dual inhaled antibiotics was the largest. Unfortunately, it is difficult to make more of the results in terms of significance testing, as the authors note. Overall, the case report suggests that it is feasible to use dual inhaled antibiotics for treatment of worsening CF. Clinicians may be helped by having this possibility pointed. out. Colistin is misspelled as colostin in the 2nd sentence, 4th paragraph of the section entitled Case report.
