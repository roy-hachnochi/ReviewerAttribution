Mann et al report an interesting case demonstrating that inhaled antibiotics may be useful for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in CF. The authors accurately describe the background and much of the evidence relating to the use of inhaled antibiotics in acute exacerbations including the Cochrane review of 2012. However, the Cochrane review preceded the most recent clinical trial in this field. The study demonstrated and discussed both pulmonary and renal benefits for nebulized tobramycin in the treatment of exacerbations and the authors should consider including it in the introduction. 1 In the fourth paragraph it should be clarified whether “typically one inhaled antibiotic is used at a time” refers to the routine practice in the chronic setting or previous studies in the acute setting. The case itself is well described however the authors may wish to consider including some relevant extra information. Firstly, had the patient cultured any other organisms aside from P. aeruginosa in their sputum in the preceding 12 months? Secondly, were all the treatments completed at home or in the inpatient setting? Differing settings with increased physiotherapy input as an inpatient could theoretically account for some of the differences. Finally, were other adjunctive therapies such as oral corticosteroids used in the management of each exacerbation. The discussion is balanced and recognises the limitations of the case as well as potential adverse events related to nebulised therapy. Overall, this is an interesting case worthy of publication and we wholeheartedly agree with the authors that this is a management strategy that warrants further investigation.
