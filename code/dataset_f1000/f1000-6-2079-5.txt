This is a useful case report highlighting the potential for treating certain pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis with inhaled antibiotics. The background is well written. References are appropriate and balanced. The case is well described and the adherence data prior to the exacerbations is helpful. The clinical response in terms of FEV1 is well reported and favourable by comparison to response to iv therapy. Paragraph 2 of the "Case Report" section should in my view more clearly specify that the colomycin 2MU three times a day was given intravenously rather than nebulised alongside the intravenous Tazocin for 14 days in month 1 and month 4, given the overall title of the case report and the similar iv/nebulised dosages for colomycin. It would also be instructive to know whether the intravenous antibiotics were administered at home or in hospital. In paragraphs 3 and 4 of the "Case Report" section, it would be useful to know if the subject was also taking nebulised dornase alpha during this period, i.e. was she achieving six nebulised therapies per day? Also, if available, adherence measures during these 2 week pulses of inhaled dual antibiotic therapies would be useful, as many clinicians do have concerns that this intensity of nebulised medications may be difficult to achieve for many people with CF, despite the good clinical response seen here. The conclusions, acknowledgements of limitations, are all well written and appropriate. In summary this case report is valuable and will be of interest to the CF community. I support publication but would recommend the clarifications I have suggested are considered.
