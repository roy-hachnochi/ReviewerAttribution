Overview: The authors test the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the cellulose degrading bacteria in soil and ground dwelling termites such as eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes . The authors study the cellulose degrading bacterial profiles in two termite colonies and the soil samples corresponding to one of the colony. Microbiota groups present in the samples were identified using 16S rRNA bacterial marker. Results supported the hypothesis that there is a tight correlation between the cellulose degrading bacteria in soil and termite gut. Also, there was a significant difference between the bacterial profiles between two different termite colonies. Overall comments: Authors fail to describe the rationale for the experimental design. Particularly, the reason for sampling soil from only one termite colony but not two is not explained well. If the differences between the two termite colonies are attributed to the difference in the soil where the colony exists, then sampling the soil sample from the second colony would have provided clear evidence. Moreover, the experimental design is not balanced. Why wasnâ€™t the termite-AX colony uncultured gut extract sequenced with 16S rRNA? Would the authors expect the uncultured termite guts from both the colonies cluster together? Authors also did not refer to the R. flavipes bacterial studies performed earlier in the following 2 citations 1 - 2 . A comparison of the microbial groups to these studies would be insightful as the termites used in the above mentioned studies used lab reared colonies. By addressing the above concerns the article will be complete and much stronger.
