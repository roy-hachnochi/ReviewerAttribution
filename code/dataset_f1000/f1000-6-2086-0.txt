Although this article has many merits, the presentation and organization of the authors ideas and work render it insufficient for indexing at this time. Unfortunately, the title and the content do not match one another. Additionally, traditional research paper structure is not followed. This paper should be held from being indexed until the structural and editorial modifications are completed, reviewed and approved. The title of this paper suggests that it is simply a demographic summary of users in J, Indonesia. Upon reading the abstract, another research question, the impact of Fatwa, which would be very interesting to look at comes into play. Then throughout the paper, the authors move from the Fatwa to the demographics to other analyses. this makes for a very disjointed article that is challenging for the readers to follow. Other structural issues arise, as information about the methodology is spread around the paper and the results are have no clear flow to them. The attached PDF provides detailed comments and specific locations where the authors must revisit the writing and structure of the paper. Please click here to see the annotated PDF.
