This paper utilizes the results of a previous survey that explores opinions relating to funding and policy among a group of biomedical scientists in the US, the UK and Italy. The authors have used a section in the questionnaire that asks for further comments to isolate views relating to ‘science communication’. Conclusions are drawn about the attitudes of those surveyed toward science communication and public engagement more generally. Unfortunately, there are some serious methodological problems with this work. The original purpose of the survey (which I have read, including all the feedback) was to explore views relating to funding and public policy issues directly affecting the basic research in the biomedical sciences. There were no questions that asked specifically about science communication or public engagement. The feedback analysed by the authors was obtained from a final section that asked for comments as follows: Do you have ideas about other policies that can increase both the societal benefit potential of basic research and the scientist satisfaction, without affecting the fundamental nature of basic investigation? You can use this space to tell us about them or for any additional considerations related to the themes of this survey. Again, this is not directly related to public engagement although a small proportion of the statements made by 145 of the respondents do contain some general statements relating to science communication media coverage of science, communication with clinicians and patient’s groups and formal science education in schools. It is possible for new insights to be gained from work exploring a different research question. However, after reading the entirety of the feedback it is evident that much of the individual feedback has been taken out of context, and that the substance and meaning of the data has been greatly overstated. The statements made don’t feel like they have been made to communicate views about PE, but have been made within the context of wider funding and policy issues that the survey was designed to address. I can’t help feeling that the authors are squeezing this data for something substantive, when there isn’t really much there – certainly not enough to draw some of the conclusions that they have made. Sweeping statements are made about the views of bioscientists toward public engagement, and statements such as ‘many believe…’ simply cannot be backed up by the sparse data. The authors need to be more specific and open about their dataset. Actual numbers need to be given (e.g. 10 respondents expressed this view etc…). It’s not enough to generalise or to extrapolate this feedback to bioscientists in general – this is a very diverse body of scientists. The authors need to give more detail about their methods of analysis. What specific approaches were taken? Did they undertake a thematic analysis. Use grounded theory? Some supporting references are needed here to signpost their approach to qualitative analysis for the reader. It is good that they attached their coding scheme, but some explanation of each theme would have been helpful. Also, I would like to know who coded the data. Was it coded by more than one individual? How was the reliability of the coding ascertained? Did they account for inter-coder reliability. If only one person coded the data – was this checked by someone else. Again, values for inter-coder reliability, or even an acknowledgement that this needs to be addressed in qualitative analysis would have been welcome. The use of the theory of planned behaviour as a framework for analysis is questionable. At no point are scientists questioned about their intent to take part in public engagement activities. Looking at the raw data, there is nothing that stands out as an expression of intent. It is unclear why this framework has been applied to the data. In addition to methodological problems, there are some other concerns about the contextualisation of the data within current work on public engagement. The authors appear to have focused on ‘science communication’ yet have used the terms ‘outreach’ and ‘public engagement’ interchangeably. The first paragraph of the paper gives a definition of science communication from 2003 that appears to encapsulate a rather one-way movement of information from informed scientists to uninformed public. This is quite different to more recent definitions of public engagement, which reflect a move from a deficit model of communication, to one that is based on dialogue and a greater understanding of the social and cultural context of communication. By presenting this definition of science communication in the opening paragraph, I am unsure whether the authors are aware of the cultural shifts taking place in the public engagement landscape. The use of the term ‘outreach’ is also problematic. Outreach can (but not always) refer specifically to public engagement work in a school setting, often with the goal of increasing diversity in those who choose to study science at a tertiary level. While it is true that terminology in the public engagement literature can be confusing, there has been some work on this, and I would encourage the authors think about what public engagement means to them and also how the scientists they survey define it. Some of the references cited are a little out of date and much work has been done on public engagement and the greater emphasis on dialogic approaches. This work needs to be consulted to address this underlying issue which detracts greatly from the work. There are other issues which need attention. On several occasions, the authors make reference to the ‘social value’ of research without defining what that means, or how it can be measured. I am not sure how this relates to public engagement or the views expressed in the survey. Using the terms ‘scientists’ and ‘non-scientist’ is problematic. For example, the authors refer to clinicians as being non-scientists. It is likely that many clinicians would disagree with that assessment. It may be more helpful to talk about ‘specialists’ and ‘non-specialists’. This allows for the fact that some groups who aren’t professional scientists, can be specialists in a given area. For example, patient groups. Also, scientists have different specialisations, so may not understand another discipline any better than someone who isn’t a professional scientist. The geographical categories don’t make sense. Why not just divide them into country groups? I am assuming N/A in Table 1 means these scientists come from somewhere else – where? Is geographical origin relevant – there is no evidence that this has been considered in the analysis. Despite the above criticisms, the authors allude to an interesting question about public engagement and basic research which could be addressed in more detail in a new study. Are views about public engagement related to whether a scientist carries out basic science or applied science? Given their previous contact with a substantial pool of scientists, the authors could re-design a more rigorous study. They could question scientists above the public engagement work they have actually carried out (rather than their intention) and explore whether activities and views were related to the kind of research that was carried out – bearing in mind that there are many other factors that influence public engagement activity. As a public engagement professional working with scientists in basic research, such a study would be of great interest. As it stands, this study has too many methodological and theoretical flaws to be indexed. The body of data is insubstantial and the analysis is problematic.Too many sweeping generalisations are made which simply are not supported by the data. Within the work however, is the kernel of an interesting research question about public engagement within applied vs. basic research. I would urge the authors to consider this question and design a new study that can address this, paying attention to adequate data collection and a rigorous analysis.
