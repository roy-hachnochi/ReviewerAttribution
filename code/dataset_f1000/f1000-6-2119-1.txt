This article is a descriptive account of five case studies involving the work of NICE International and HITAP in LMICs. This being an opinion piece not all arguments are supported by evidence from literature. The Theory of Change (ToC) model is excellently conceived and can be a very useful tool for future analysis of HTA work in these countries. However, this paper would benefit from the following: There needs to be updated information in places. eg. page 4, 2 nd line, mentions country partners of NICE International and HITAP as of 2015. Considering the fact that this is end of 2017, an updated information would be better appreciated. Also, in page 5, in the section on Philippines, it would be good to update whether the HPV vaccination schedule was adapted as a two day/three day schedule. Currently, it reads incomplete. The limitations of this paper are well articulated especially the acknowledgement that other view points exists. The author’s mention in the limitations that “However, these experiences have been published as scientific findings in peer-reviewed international journals”. In this context, a list of references of these experiences/other view points (perhaps one/two from each country) can be included in references. There are some minor editing/typological errors which can be corrected. With the above changes the paper can be indexed.
