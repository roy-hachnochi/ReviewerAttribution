I tried to simulate the toy example from the BioNSi website, following the step by step guide. It doesn't work. Tried some other examples (cellcyclesB, Testcase1_network) and no results. Maybe there is a bug (I am using Cytoscape 3.6.0) or there is something I'm missing. In the second case the step by step guide should be improved. This doesn't allow me to provide a complete evaluation of the tool and the paper that seems interesting and well written. I will be happy to reconsider my review once such problems are solved.
