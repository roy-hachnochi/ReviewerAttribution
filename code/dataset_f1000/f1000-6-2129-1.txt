This paper is a commentary on a study by Phallen et al . who developed and applied advanced DNA analysis techniques for circulating tumor DNA from patients with untreated breast, colorectal and ovarian cancer. They were able to detect cancer in about 60-70% of patients with Stage I or Stage II disease. Diamandis and Fialaâ€™s Commentary examines the feasibility of applying these techniques to small tumors that are not reliably detectable by other means. They extrapolate original data from Phallen et al ., making the assumption that the number of tumor-derived genomes in the circulation is proportional to tumor volume. Diamandis and Fiala reasonably conclude that tumors smaller than about 10mm in diameter result in less than one tumor-derived genome per 10ml blood draw and are therefore, in principle, undetectable in practice. This logic is probably conservatively based because small, low grade tumors are likely to produce proportionally less ctDNA than high grade tumors. This Commentary is a useful contribution to the literature.
