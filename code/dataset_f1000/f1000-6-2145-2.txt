The article is well written, structured and argued. The methodology used is appropriate and well applied. Bibliography, notes, and references to the state of the art appropriate. The article addresses an important issue regarding gender bias in the evaluation of scientific research on which analysis of empirical evidence is still scarce. I fully recommend its indexing.
