The article by D.O. Ricke provides details of the experience of an individual research participant in a longitudinal study that involved wearing physiological monitors, allowing a comparison of personal tracking of nighttime vasomotor symptoms (VMS) with the parallel capture of VMS data via the monitor’s recording of electrodermal activity. This is essentially a case report of a single individual’s experience/data and serves as a “proof of principle”. The report achieves its goal for this limited purpose; however, additional information about the background study leading to this report, the participant’s daily (daytime and nighttime) frequency and severity/”bother” of VMS if available (the report focuses on night-time tracking), and any use of medications for VMS by the patient would be helpful for the reader. Also, the literature review is limited, especially in terms of reviewing other investigators’ experience with objective monitors for VMS (results have not always been concordant with subjective reports). Readers would benefit from an expanded reference list addressing prior relevant research on this topic and from the author’s recommendations regarding integrating and/or reconciling data that may conflict from patient-reported and objective monitor sources. Nonetheless, the Research Note does provide a compelling illustration of the potential utility of commercial fitness devices, which have the potential to advance our understanding of the correlates, lifestyle/behavioral “triggers” of VMS, and the response to interventions/treatments. The present study does make a contribution in showing that high resolution data captured from these devices may add to patient-reported methods such as diaries, particularly for nighttime events. Additional research is clearly needed to follow up on this N=1 study; such research will fill important gaps and will ultimately support (or refute) the value and utility of the approach.
