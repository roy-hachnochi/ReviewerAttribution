Its great to see that this is available on dockerhub and bioconductor! In my opinion, this is approvable for indexing! That said, I have one additional comment (that should not stand in the way of indexing). I like the way the perlscript for preprocessing is written, but in line 135, where it tries to fastq-dump out of SRA when it cant find the other files, I would highly encourage you to try streaming out of SRA using https://github.com/ncbi/ngs rather than fastq-dump.
