This work is an important example of building and advertising easy-to-implement yet powerful bioinformatics pipelines with established, popular algorithms. That said, in my opinion, three minor additions would make this manuscript much more robust, and therefore, acceptable for publications. First, the authors state that these pipelines should work on a variety of cloud architectures, but all they explicitly provide is an AMI for AWS use. Containerization through Docker (not an endorsement) or some other containerization protocol should simply bridge this gap. Second, there are many mentions of bioconductor, but it is not clear from the manuscript whether this particular pipeline is available in bioconductor. Please clarify. Third, given that the components of such pipelines are continuously evolving, there should be some documentation, either in the manuscript or the github repo about switching in new modules for mapping, differential expression, or visualization.
