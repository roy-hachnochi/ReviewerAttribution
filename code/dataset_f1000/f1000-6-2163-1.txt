In this report, a novel frameshift insertion in exon 13 of the ASPM gene in an Indian patient with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly has been reported. This finding adds to the spectrum of mutations in ASPM gene using whole exome sequencing (WES) for premarital screening and prenatal diagnosis to prevent affected births in at risk pregnancies. This report justifies the use of WES in delineating MCPH as compared to candidate gene approach. It is a descent short report, and hence recommended for indexing in its present form.
