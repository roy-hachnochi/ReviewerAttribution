The authors reported an Excel front-end for PubMed search by using NCBI E-Utilities. The tool supports searching literature in PubMed, importing search results into excel, adding notes into individual literature etc. Here are some minor issues that the authors may consider to improve the usabilities of the tool: Currently, the tool has a limit of 5000 results for a search. This makes sense when considering excel performance, however, it will improve the usability if the tool can support pagination and/or have the user to select which literature to import. The term search/count feature in the main sheet can be improved by restricting the "searched term" to be a "real term". For example, "gene rat ion" that has nothing related to "rat" should not be highlighted as a 'rat term'. In the landscape view, the authors may consider linking chemical name to chemical databases, such as PubChem, to view chemical structures. The authors may consider connecting this tool with "My NCBI" ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/?back_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fmyncbi%2F )
