Page 3: What is TTO? Not defined prior to its introduction in the Methods. It is defined in the Results instead. Assumptions regarding income, health waivers and stipends are not well-described. In table 1, what income level is this based on? In the results, it is stated that “this student” is on sustaining fees and not full tuition. How would one know that? The assumptions should be plainly described in the methods section AND in the caption of the table. It seems that the authors are actually following the tax burden of a single graduate student where each year (2013-2016) represents that students year in graduate school. This is not clear at all. The methods need to be substantially improved. The increase to 386% is misleading. It would seem relevant to calculate change from the most recent year of data, not 2013. The “sustaining” status is not clearly defined. This is obviously critically important. In Table 1, why does 2015 have an asterisk in the top row but not other rows? It would seem more logical and less confusing to take a single year (e.g. 2016) and compare the tax implications for students in each of the different settings. That is, showing the 2016 tax burden under each plan for students with full tuition, sustaining fees, stipend, different levels of other income or filing status, etc. The way it is now, because the methods do not emphasize (nor do most of the figures), it looks like 2013 is very odd. Why does that stipend double when filing jointly? There is no actual ‘data’, but the author provide the numbers on which they based their assumptions. I have serious concerns that the results will be misinterpreted due to the presentation of results.
