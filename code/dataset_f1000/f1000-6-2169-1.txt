I have reviewed the Research Note “Early language development in preterm children without neurological damage: a longitudinal study”. I think that the paper is well written and offers a relevant contribution to studies on the early communicative and language development in preterm children without neurological damage. I accept the work with minor revisions. In particular: I think it's necessary to add in the Reference list a more recent article on the preterms early language developmental. There is a mismatch for the citation of Questionnaire “PVB” (1995 or 2017?) between Reference list and text. I suggest adding a very brief passage about the reasons why the authors chose those measures over others.
