The main work is outside my expertise and I was struggling to make some meaningful contribution. The bulk of the work is in molecular experimentation and I have limited knowledge in their methods. However, my major concern with the entomological aspect is that the authors did not show how long (the number of generations) the mosquitoes were exposed to the heavy metal during the selection. This would be helpful if someone wants to repeat the work. Furthermore, the study did not show the impact of the biomarkers identified in the development, enzyme activities and insecticide resistance of the mosquitoes used for the study.
