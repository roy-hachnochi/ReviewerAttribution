This brief opinion article describes the authors' proposal to rename a domain found in a discrete group of proteins, which was originally named DUF1220 (domain of unknown function 1220) and subsequently reassigned as NBPF. The NBPF nomenclature referenced the fact that this domain is found in proteins encoded by a family of genes initially reported as the "Neuroblastoma BreakPoint Family"; however, as human gene nomenclature tries to move away from directly referencing specific phenotypes and conditions, the reference to neuroblastoma has been removed from the names for the NBPF genes, and they are now simply the "NBPF family". Interestingly, as well as this family the only other protein this domain is found in is the large "myomegalin" protein in mammals, encoded by the PDE4DIP gene. I think the fact that this is not mentioned anywhere in the article is perhaps an oversight on the part of the authors which could be remedied. It should be noted that the authors have already contacted PFAM to request this change and HGNC were also consulted and agreed this update would not create problems from a gene naming perspective. As we said then, we think it would be more informative for the new domain name to reflect functional information as opposed to something more esoteric, but the authors are not advocating any parallel change in the NBPF gene family nomenclature which is quite widely used for this family. A parallel change to the gene names would perhaps be more difficult to justify. Therefore we told the authors that we see no issue with their proposal. Importantly, this article represents the collaborative effort of two independent groups, who easily could be viewed as "rivals". Therefore this article effectively shows that such collaborations are possible and beneficial to the scientific community at large; this kind of activity should be encouraged wherever possible and I applaud the authors for making the effort to work productively together.
