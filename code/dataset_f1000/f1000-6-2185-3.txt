This paper proposes to change the name of a protein domain from NBPF (Neuroblastoma Breakpoint Family) to Olduvai, arguing that this new name illustrates the fact that the domain copy number has been linked with human evolution. Although, it is in principle not recommended to multiply the names for a domain, the fact that the change is submitted by two major players in the field makes the proposal acceptable as it should rapidly spread in future works on this promising domain. In addition, the limited distribution of the domain should facilitate its diffusion. However, it should be noted that although having a very limited distribution found in roughly two protein families, i.e. NBPF and myomegalin ( PDE4DIP ) , neither of the current names, NBPF or DUF1220, is commonly used by the myomegalin community. In this respect, I think that a paragraph presenting the myomegalin family and discussing the presence of a single Olduvai “repeat” amongst its members should be added prior to indexing. The previous name, NBPF, was derived from a breakpoint in the first member identified and was also applied to the protein family. In the future, the use of the new name Olduvai only for the repeat will avoid the confusion between NBPF designating both the protein family and the repeat.
