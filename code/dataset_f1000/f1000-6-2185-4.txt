This manuscript describes a straightforward proposal to rename the NBPF/DUF1220 domain to the Olduvai domain. This is welcome because the domain has been referred to by two different names in the past. The authors are the major players in the field, who have used the divergent nomenclature and thus will be able to ensure that the proposed naming does become the standard. The authors had already contacted me to ask about having the domain renamed within the Pfam database, which has now been done (although not visible on the public website yet). Perhaps calling this paper a proposal is a bit weak. The authors should consider renaming the article to “Changing the name of the NBPF/DUF1220 domain to the Olduvai domain”. There are no agreed upon standard naming schemes for protein domains or families. To date the most popular schemes are based on naming after one or more proteins that contain the domain, sometimes based upon the initial letters of these members. A few domains are named after scientists. I don’t recall any domains or families named after places. However, the renaming makes sense within the context of the evolution of this domain and human evolution. I think it would be worth mentioning the reasons that the NBPF nomenclature is retained for the gene family. I understand this is to fit with the HGNC guidelines. Minor points Please change PFAM to Pfam throughout the text.
