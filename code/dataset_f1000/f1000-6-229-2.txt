The manuscript has been improved throughout (including a beautiful new figure), but several of my concerns have not yet been addressed. For example, please make it explicit that your survey is intended to cover experiences within the UK *academic* biomedical system. "Researchers" is misspelled in the first sentence of "survey design," and the sentence beginning with "the large majority that" has a grammatical error. In this sentence, it would be helpful to remind the reader that question 10 allowed respondents to select all that apply. Figure 2 is still difficult to read - please see my original comments.
