I think the article takes a comprehensive approach to capacity building, its importance, opportunities and how to conduct it. However, I would suggest to include a definition of capacity development - it is not very clear how the authors understand capacity at the environmental level for example. I think that the frameworks that the authors refer to are good however I would suggest using those that take a complexity lens as well, since the problem that is discussed is complex and involves multiple stakeholders. I recommend taking a look at the ITAD framework http://www.itad.com/knowledge-and-resources/capacity-development-2/ or an even more comprehensive one 'Context Matters' http://www.politicsandideas.org/contextmatters/ Related to the above I feel that the article could take a systems approach that takes complexity into account. What does it take to change and improve systems? Usually, the problem lies beyond technical capacity but it is more about understanding and sharing a common problem, being able to identify and relate to different points of views and realities, ability to find solutions jointly, an ability to work with different parts of the system, etc. Some of these are addressed in the article (like leadership skills) but drawing on further systemic thinking could help (see Ken Wilber).
