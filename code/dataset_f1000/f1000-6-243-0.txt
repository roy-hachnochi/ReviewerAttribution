Most of the remarks have been followed. The only thing left is that this study remains restricted to changes present in dbSNP, in which a number of known mutations are missing. However, I understand that the main goal of this paper is to show a nice bioinformatic analysis strategy rather than to be exhaustive about FOXC2. Thus, it is good as such.
