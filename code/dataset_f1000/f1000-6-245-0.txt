Thank you for asking me to review this work. This is a clearly set out and easy to read manuscript, covering all major avenues of current research in non-neovascular AMD. I only have a couple of minor comments. Perhaps the title could be altered to better reflect the manuscript content: “Therapeutic strategies under current investigation for dry age-related macular degeneration”? I think the manuscript could be improved by expanding the section on “stem cells”. A couple more trials may be worthy of mention (a) Oracea Phase 2/3 trial and (b) Drusen clearance with laser - Laser Intervention in Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration Study (LEAD).
