The authors present a concise and yet comprehensive review on current therapies and ongoing clinical trials for non-exudative (dry) age-related macular degeneration. The authors list and comment on current trials registered at government website. As such, this represents a useful update for ophthalmologists in this area. Few minor comments for the authors: 1. I would suggest to expand the second paragraph dealing with associations between vitamin supplements and genetic profile under Nutritional Supplements section. While some studies suggest genotypic influence on clinical response to vitamin supplementation, there are opposing studies as well 1 . Nice recent review by Rowan Taylor (2016) 2 is also worth mentioning. 2. Apart from therapies as part of registered clinical trials there are few investigation running independently such as testing oral trimetazine (anti-ischemic agent with cytoprotective effects) by Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier; neuroprotective agent tandospirone by Alcon Research; oral crocetin; oral curcumin; or intravitreal LFG316 by Novartis (NCT01527500) and oral doxycycline (Oracea)(NCT01782989). 3. For section on stem cell-based therapy I would update literature on recent (even though not fully convincing) study by Schwartz SD et al (2016) 3 or the same author in Lancet 2015. References 1.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Thank you for asking me to review this work. This is a clearly set out and easy to read manuscript, covering all major avenues of current research in non-neovascular AMD. I only have a couple of minor comments. Perhaps the title could be altered to better reflect the manuscript content: “Therapeutic strategies under current investigation for dry age-related macular degeneration”? I think the manuscript could be improved by expanding the section on “stem cells”. A couple more trials may be worthy of mention (a) Oracea Phase 2/3 trial and (b) Drusen clearance with laser - Laser Intervention in Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration Study (LEAD).
