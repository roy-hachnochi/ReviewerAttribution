This is an interesting and extremely important study reporting specific neuroanatomical features in patient group suffering from a rare disease affecting the visual system: aniridia. I have listed my comments and suggestions below. Introduction The introduction is fine and discusses the current literature. However, I would suggest to improve a bit the study question. The study question as it is used in the current version is very broad and does not come to the point (e.g.,"The current study sought to investigate gross anatomical correlates of aniridia in a new population sample. Results from this study will serve as a comparison for previous studies, as well as contribute to what is known about the distribution of neuroanatomical phenotypes in the aniridia population as a whole."). I would suggest to include a few statements what this new study will add to the literature and what the "problems" of the older studies are? In addition, it could be helpful for the reader to learn the very new and maybe innovative aspects of this study. Methods Subjects: Some additional information about the subjects could be helpful (cognitive ability, handedness, language lateralization). Some of these variables have been shown to be strongly related to the anatomical measures for which the authors are reporting the specific aniridia features. Statistics: It is not entirely clear how the authors did their between-group comparisons. Did they compare the patients only on a visual-descriptive basis or did they perform a statistical analysis (which I would suggest). When doing a statistical analysis, one could compare single subjects to the mean of the control group. Thus, it would be possible to test each patient against the mean of the healthy control group. Using this comparison it would also be possible to calculate effect size measures for each subject. By the way, did the use a priorly defined regions of interest? Discussion The discussion is fine.
