The authors describe a patient with VHL disease who demonstrated arrested growth of a CNS hemangioblastoma while being treated with propranolol and propose a causal relationship between propranolol therapy and hemangioblastoma growth arrest. The authors should provide more detail on mutational subtype and family history. The authors should provide more detail on imaging studies, in particular the size of the hemangioblastoma at specific timepoints, and overlay the time period and dose of propranolol. The authors should discuss potential mechanisms of action of propranolol and other reports on propranolol efficacy in the context of known hemangioblastoma biology. If the above points are addressed this case series may be useful.
