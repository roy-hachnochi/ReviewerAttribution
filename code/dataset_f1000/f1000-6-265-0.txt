The authors described that Intramammary lymph node metastasis of an unknown primary, probably occult breast, undifferentiated carcinoma. These findings in this manuscript are interesting, and this manuscript is worthy of indexing. There are some problems should be resolved before publishing. What is the TNM classification for staging of this breast cancer patient? Do you think that this ectopic breast tissue may be accessory breast cancer? You should reveal breast pathological diagnosis of the lumpectomy specimen, for example, papillo-tubular carcinoma or scirrhous carcinoma with mammary gland. What is the result of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) and Ki-67 marker? You should refer to an article of Egan, because intramammary lymph node metastases in the breast were reported for the first time in the world by Egan and McSweeney in 1983 1 . Are additional ancillary studies, including immunostainings, beneficial to evaluate site of origin (in case of this tumor is CD10 focally positive)? What are the second line therapy options for this rare pathology, when this patient will have recurrence of breast cancer? What is the role of family history and its impact on therapy?
