It is a well-written paper concerning an infrequent case of intramammary metastases without a known primary tumor. The case description is adequate and nicely presented. We only have to add some minor requirements to the authors. It could be adequate to add the MR and PET images demonstrating their findings. Did the authors consider that carboplatin could be added to the treatment. It seems that this agent offers good results in TN breast cancer. Finally, do you consider to expand the genetic study, even with a negative BCRA, due to a possibility to express other gens like PALB2?
