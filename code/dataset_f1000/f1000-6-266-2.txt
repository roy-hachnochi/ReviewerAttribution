The article is well written. However, there is some minor comment. 1. The authors mentioned that "The metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) currently available for inhaled corticosteroid delivery do not offer an integrated dose counter". This statement was true at the time when this study was performed. But currently, there are some MDIs that have dose counter. So this statement needs some amendment. 2. Method: the authors mentioned that "Participants needed to participate in a regular schedule every 8 weeks to obtain a new FLIXOTIDE 125 inhaler." And the duration of treatment was 24 weeks. So it means that each participant would receive 3 inhalers. A total of 52 children was participated. So I wonder why only 100 MDI canister was evaluated. It should be 52*3=156?. This may need the clarification.
