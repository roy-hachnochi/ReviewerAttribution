This well presented study describes an interesting trend in melanoma incidence in three industrialised nations and proposes an explanatory hypothesis. The major caveat is that, as the authors acknowledge, this trend could be due to any number of cohort effects (i.e. changing environmental and social factors that unequally affect different age groups and cohorts). The decrease in acceleration of melanoma incidence could, for example, be due to changes in skin cancer prevention campaigns, foreign travel, fashion, sunbathing behaviour, sunbed use, or frequency of dermatological examination. As the authors do not control for any such factors and provide no evidence for or against any particular hypothesis, they can do no more than speculate about how the observed pattern arose. Also importantly, it is unclear to me exactly what the authors mean by a “restraining process” or “protective mechanism” that might have become less effective over time, nor how such a process might be affected by “a change in environmental exposure patterns” or “more intense environmental challenges”. I suspect they mean to suggest that a germline mutation that inactivates a tumour suppressor gene has become more prevalent due to natural selection or genetic drift, but I am unsure if this interpretation is correct. In any case, it would be useful to have more details of the hypothesis and its testable predictions. Would the authors expect to see a similar trend in other cancer types? Why might some countries be more affected than others? And why might men and women be affected differently? The study might also benefit from using a mathematical model (as, for example, in reference 14) to estimate how much decrease in prevalence of the protective mechanism would be necessary to explain the observed trends.
