The authors replicate the ascertainment of worldwide population structure obtained by Li et al. (2008). They perform PCA to capture population structure. The PC axes closely match the ones obtained by Li et al. However, the authors found that some Bedouin individuals don't belong to the population they should belong to. The authors should read and cite the 2 following papers that found related results Jakobsson M, Scholz SW, Scheet P et al: Genotype, haplotype and copy-number variation in worldwide human populations.

The webpage ( https://github.com/ThomasChln/reproducible-hgdp ) should be improved and should include a more detailed tutorial.
