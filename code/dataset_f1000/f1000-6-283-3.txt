In this review Dr. Jin-Hui Wang and Shan Cui proposed a model named “associative memory cells (AMCs)” that could be used to explain associative memory formation and functioning at the neuronal circuitry level. This novel cellular model was first established in Dr. Wang’s laboratory. Based on their serial studies, they proposed the hypothesis that AMCs encode both new and innate signals based on their mutual synapse innervation in the sensory cortical area. Furthermore, they suggested that the primary associative memory cells innervate the downstream neurons in associated brain areas, and the downstream neurons encode dual associative signals and serve as the secondary associative memory cells (sAMCs). The formation and functioning of the AMCs are very interesting and important as they may help to reveal novel mechanisms for learning, memory and cognition.
