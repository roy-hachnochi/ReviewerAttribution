This review summarizes current studies about cellular mechanisms underlying associative memory, in which associative memory cells are recruited for the integration, storage and retrieval of cross-modal signals. The contents in this review are and advanced concept. To improve this review, I would suggest that authors include the following information. 1) The physiological and pathological impacts are caused by the quantity of associative memory cells. 2) How many kinds of associative memory cells are present in the cerebral cortices?
