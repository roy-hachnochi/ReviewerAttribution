This is an interesting article which makes a number of robust criticisms of the application of IPR to germplasm and linked to this consequences of food security. It is very wide ranging and treads a sometimes difficult and not always successful path between the global and the local. Indeed while the current global IPR regime is clearly unsatisfactory, and this is a case well made, it is not always clear if the solution also lies at a global or more nuanced local and diffuse level. For clarity given the potential international readership it should be made clear what aspects and information are USA located and what not. More use might have been made of literature and examples from Africa and India in respect of food security, IPR and seeds/germplasm. Nevertheless, this article makes an important contribution to the debate on the stranglehold of the current global regime and usefully identifies a number of areas needing further research. A further strength of the article, which is introduced but not yet fully explored, is drawing from other disciplines and theoretical models to challenge the claimed benefits of the current regime.
