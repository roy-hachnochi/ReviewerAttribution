In this manuscript, the authors analyzed the effects of physical activity on the connection between muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), circulating Irisin and uncoupling protein one (UCP1) of white adipocytes in humans through a systematic review. The authors review the evidence connecting PGC-1α, FNDC5, Irisin and UCP1 with physical exercise, which might play an important role in diabetes and obesity. Moreover, they have addressed a controversial topic since, though Irisin was initially described as a hormone potentially regulated by exercise and also with a potential role in obesity and diabetes, conflicting results have been reported. There is an ongoing intense debate on different results from different Irisin assays. In effect, in 2014, we were the first to underline those discrepancies and inconsistencies. For that reason, I feel this review is timed appropriately and is interesting for the scientific community. The review is effectively organized and the sequence of points is logical, and follows PRISMA guideline. In my opinion, both results and discussion are properly presented, although the discussion section should be slightly shortened. Also, references 8 and 87 are not needed. I recommend changing PGC-1a by PGC-1α throughout the manuscript. Furthermore, the following manuscript that was recently published deserves to be included and discussed: Perakakis et al. (2017) 1 .
