The presented review is timely and of common interest since energy expenditure by “browning” of white adipocytes may be a mechanism to reduce body weight and a potential way to fight obesity in humans. Beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism are long known although not completely understood. A recently proposed pathway linked physical activity with increased PGC1-alpha and FNDC5. Cleavage of the transmembrane factor FNDC5 results in circulating irisin which in turn starts a sequence to induce a brown-like phenotype in white adipocytes. Consequently, numerous studies focused on this proposed link in different experimental settings in humans. The presented review systematically retrieved and analyzed such studies to further elucidate different steps of the proposed cascade PGC1-alpha – FNDC5 – Irisin – UCP1. The value of this review bases on its rigorous quality assessment of the included studies. The authors analyzed all published reports with established tools on the risk of bias and the quality of the data. This part of the analysis demonstrates a rather low quality of many studies hampering the deduction of valid conclusions. The analysis of the reported results is given in different sections considering the analyzed parameters and the design of the studies. Results on PGC1-alpha and FNDC5 as well as on UCP1 are presented and discussed in an appropriate manner. In contrast, the data on irisin are much more problematic. As the authors mention in the discussion, the missing validation of the used ELISA kits for irisin is a major issue in these studies. The values vary greatly and, more importantly, are mostly higher by magnitudes than the values determined by mass spectrometry. In some studies irisin was measured with different assays: Kurdiova et al. (ref. 18) measured irisin with a RIA (RK-067-16, Phoenix) and a subset of their samples additionally with ELISA (EK-067-29, Phoenix) and concluded “… The correlation between both assays was very weak, and definitely not admissible for two products that claimed to measure the concentrations of the same molecule…”. Albrecht et al. (ref. 27) re-analyzed all samples from Norheim et al. (ref. 17, EK-067-52) with the ELISA of Adipogen and found no correlation between both measurements (r = 0.03). Finally, Montes-Nieto et al. (2016) 1 analyzed irisin in human plasma with two different lots of EK-067-29 (Phoenix) and stated an almost complete lack of agreement between the data. Latter reference should be included in this review. These results cast doubts at least on all irisin levels determined with those kits used in more than half of the included studies. Consequently, a meaningful discussion of the data is hardly possible. The authors should mention these points at a prominent position and shorten the detailed discussion of the – most likely – invalid ELISA/RIA results from the included studies. Moreover, it should be noted that the studies using mass spectrometry delivered contradictory results. Bostrm et al. (ref. 2) and Lee et al. (ref. 25) used an antibody (Abcam, now discontinued) recognizing a peptide of FNDC5 which is not part of the secreted irisin to identify the bands subjected to mass spectrometry whereas Jedrychowski et al. (ref. 74) employed an antibody of Adipogen against the irisin peptide. This explains the discrepancy in the molecular weight of the analyzed peptides (~ 22 kDa [ref. 2, 25] vs. ~ 12 kDa [ref. 74]). There is some redundancy in the description of results and repetitions in the discussion which should be omitted. It is e.g. not necessary to repeat several times the values for irisin determined with mass spectrometry. It would increase readability if more summarized results are presented. Additionally, some minor points should be corrected: Introduction Reference 8 is not suited to support this statement because it comments the results of Bostrm et al. and is no independent confirmation Table 1, page 5 Aydin 2013: They used EK-067-52 for measurement of serum irisin.

They used the irisin ELISA produced by the Czech company BioVendor. The given Scottish company does not sell irisin ELISAs. This is misleadingly described in the original article. Discussion, page 16 Reference 87 is not suited to support the statements regarding mass spectrometry (3 times). I guess ref. 87 (Lee DV et al.) was mixed up with ref. 25 (Lee P et al.). Please check whether ref. 87 is needed at all. page 17 Reference 26 is not suited to support the statement regarding mass spectrometry. It was probably mixed up with ref. 25. Taken together, this systematic review is a valuable contribution to guide through the confusing literature concerning the relationship between exercise and the proposed PGC1-alpha – FNDC5 – irisin – axis. The evaluation of the included studies with well-acknowledged quality measures adds additional value and makes the article unique in the reviewed field. References 1.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions The authors have addressed all of our concerns in an adequate manner. Importantly, all uncertainties resulting from methodological problems of the irisin measurements in the included studies are now clearly named in the re-structured discussion. There are three minor issues left: (I) + (II) The authors used the term “molecular weight” two times (page 16, last paragraph) when addressing “concentrations” or “circulating levels” of irisin. (III) Again, not the similar molecular weight of irisin compared to leptin, insulin, and resistin makes a biological function of irisin likely but the similar circulating concentrations (discussion page 15).

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions In this manuscript, the authors analyzed the effects of physical activity on the connection between muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), circulating Irisin and uncoupling protein one (UCP1) of white adipocytes in humans through a systematic review. The authors review the evidence connecting PGC-1α, FNDC5, Irisin and UCP1 with physical exercise, which might play an important role in diabetes and obesity. Moreover, they have addressed a controversial topic since, though Irisin was initially described as a hormone potentially regulated by exercise and also with a potential role in obesity and diabetes, conflicting results have been reported. There is an ongoing intense debate on different results from different Irisin assays. In effect, in 2014, we were the first to underline those discrepancies and inconsistencies. For that reason, I feel this review is timed appropriately and is interesting for the scientific community. The review is effectively organized and the sequence of points is logical, and follows PRISMA guideline. In my opinion, both results and discussion are properly presented, although the discussion section should be slightly shortened. Also, references 8 and 87 are not needed. I recommend changing PGC-1a by PGC-1α throughout the manuscript. Furthermore, the following manuscript that was recently published deserves to be included and discussed: Perakakis et al. (2017) 1 .
