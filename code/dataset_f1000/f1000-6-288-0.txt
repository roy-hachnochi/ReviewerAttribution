Recurrence and multidrug resistance is a major problem in cancer therapy. The authors discuss this important issue and it becomes clear that the first line treatment should be designed in such a way to eradicate all cancer cells, having in mind that at a time of diagnosis they are heterogenous and some of them are already drug resistant (in an otherwise nave population). The authors highlight that numerous mechanisms responsible for resistance to therapy have been identified, mainly thanks to in vitro experiments. They also mention disadvantages of such an approach, including lack of original microenvironment which is unstable in its nature. Thatâ€™s why, probably, none of the known mechanisms fully explain multidrug resistance. However, there is experimental evidence that microenvironment conditions during tumor development (pH or oxygen level changes) might drive genetic and phenotypic changes in cancer cells leading to their more aggressive character and multidrug resistance (for example, Taylor et al. (2015) 1 or Verduzco et al. (2015) 2 . In my opinion, this aspect should be mentioned by the authors, as the tumor microenvironment might be a good target for an adjuvant treatment, also to prevent the recurrence of the more aggressive tumors.
