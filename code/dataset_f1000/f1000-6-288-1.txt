The article is supposed to focus on the possible resistance mechanism to drug therapy in breast cancer. Yet, most literature review and examples cited are based on colorectal cancer, and none of the breast cancer trials are mentioned. The article is not articulated in a way to guide the readers point-to-point and rather scarce in consummating all the points systematically. The author also did not clearly point out what are the current problems and resistance mechanism in breast cancer, what are the current approaches to overcome these problems and what is the possible outlook in overcoming drug resistance in breast cancer.
