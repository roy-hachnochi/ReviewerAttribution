In this well-written mini-review the authors discuss important questions concerning mechanisms of tumor resistance which result to low concordance between in vitro and in vivo models. Minor comment : Authors have made a mistake by citing GERGOR trial data (FOLFOX vs. FOLFIRI). They write: "As a result no difference in overall survival was observed (21.5 versus 20.6 months; p = 0.99), but what is important is that no difference was observed in the progression free survival of first line (8.5 versus 8.0 months; p = 0.26) or second line (14.2 versus 10.9 months; p = 0.64) chemotherapy 20 . Small differences were noticed in progression free survival of second line (4.2 versus 2.5 months, p = 0.003). " PFS in second line was 4.2 vs. 2.5 months. However 14.2 vs 10.9 months was a second PFS (from the days 1 of 1-st line to the progression on 2-nd line). I suggest to omit data which I underlined.
