This is a very important pilot study characterizing variations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Armenian patients with family history of breast cancer. It provides a good background for further large-scale study in Armenia. I have few notes to consider: In the section Methods, the authors used 1000 Genomes phase 1 genotype data for variations filtration. Is there any reason why they prefer phase1 data but not phase 3, which they used for assessing allelic frequencies? I noticed that the authors did not verify the NGS detected variants by other methods, e.g. by Sanger sequencing. It is especially important to confirm the detected novel mutations to exclude that they could be false positive. In the Table 3, the authors report a frameshift variant 13:g.32913172delC, which has a high functional impact on BRCA2 . Is it detected in a patient or in a healthy relative? Could it be a novel mutation specific for the Armenian population? It is known that PolyPhen and SIFT may fail to predict the impact for some variants. The authors might consider to verify this mutation by other methods, e.g. Sanger sequencing, and report it to the appropriate databases. I would suggest to mention about this variant under the section Discussion.
