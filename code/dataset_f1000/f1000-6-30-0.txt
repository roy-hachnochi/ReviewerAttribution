I appreciate the Authors' efforts to address most of my major concerns/suggestions. I approve this manuscript to pass peer review, however I believe it would still benefit from these minor corrections: Specific comments 4. " ICA derives spatial features that can remove artifacts that have static scalp topographies and time courses of activity that are distinct from that of EEG sources." I believe that what the Authors mean is "ICA derives spatial features that can be used to identify artifacts that...". Please confirm. 5. I believe that the Authors forgot to include this relevant reference: Urigen, J.A., Garcia-Zapirain, B., 2015. EEG artifact removal—state-of-the-art and guidelines. J. Neural Eng. 12, 31001 1 . Please confirm. 6. I feel that further details are still needed regarding AR1 because presently, it is not clear the rationale underlying AR1, nor its differences in relation to AR2. References 1.
