This paper looks at the use of data and data submissions to the AgTrials initiative. To assess what was productive and effective in this initiative and what could be improved if the initiative was developed further. The survey of users, data collection, data analysis and conclusions are clearly described and understandable. It would be helpful if the paper had provided a clearer introduction to the AgTrials project perhaps with some examples of data that AgTrials holds. It would also be useful to understand what similar projects or initiatives are being undertaken elsewhere in the world and how they have dealt with the issues raised in the paper. For example the paper notes that 17% of respondents published their data on a different platform. As funding bodies, donors and governments push for greater open access/open data the important issues raised in this paper (at both the technical and sociological levels) will need to be dealt with and most importantly coordinated at the international level to help ensure the effective use of agricultural trial data in improving agricultural and agricultural practices.
