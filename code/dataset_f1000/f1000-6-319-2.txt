The authors present a clear description of a tool that is simple in concept but will be of use to the cancer genomics community. They identified a clear need for researchers to be able to easily identify and download datasets from GDC and dbGAP sample attributes and have designed a solution that is conceptually sound. Most helpfully, they have taken care of not only the manual search but the mapping of the non-homogeneous metadata fields to save users time. My detailed comments are listed below: 1. (Major) After installing the code and running the first command, we received this error: $ bin/python bin/fetch_dbGaP_with_TCGA.py id -i TCGA-BRCA -s project -l low Traceback (most recent call last): File "bin/fetch_dbGaP_with_TCGA.py", line 332, in sys.exit(main()) File "bin/fetch_dbGaP_with_TCGA.py", line 322, in main +outDict[outStringKeys[returnType][2]]+","+"\\".join(outDict[outStringKe +ys[ returnType][3]])+","+outDict[outStringKeys[returnType][4]]+"\n" TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, list found As the authors are targeting users with minimal coding experience, it is important that error messages are far more informative. From the above it's completely unclear without looking into the code itself whether this is due to the input being in an incorrect format or if there is an actual problem with the code itself. Much more user testing and error handling is needed. 2. (Major) In general, more user documentation is needed. The instructions are brief and again, do not account for the case of everything not working on the first try. Input examples and example commands should also be provided for fetch_dbGaP_with_TCGA.py. Notes on how to interpret the output would also be helpful, perhaps by annotating the output file examples provided, which are a good inclusion. 3. (Minor) Currently the only way to see the re-mapping of metadata is to look in the code itself on github. Could a txt file of the field mappings be provided? This would be helpful for users to understand the assumptions being made with the metadata vocabulary. 4. (Minor) In the results section, could the authors summarize the results of the testing they did to ensure that the results being returned are correct? At minimum, it is important that users are assured of the completeness of the search. This could, for example, be demonstrated by searching on a TCGA disease type in GDC and comparing the number of results with the TCGA cohort size. Specificity and accuracy of the search results should also be demonstrated, perhaps by showing and summarizing the results of some example searches in both sites. 5. (Minor) GDC currently hosts not only TCGA, but also TARGET data (which is mentioned in the manuscript), and will soon be hosting other datasets. Is this tool limited to the TCGA datasets in GDC? As far as I know from our submissions to the GDC, the other datasets will have the same controlled metadata fields so the functionality should extend naturally to all of the data hosted at the GDC and it would greatly increase the utility if this were the case. I think this tool will be beneficial to the cancer genomics community and will facilitate and encourage users to mine the rich NGS datasets that have been made available in the past decade. It would be good if the authors are able to provide a revision of the code that works and make some improvements to the user documentation, so that these benefits can be realized.
