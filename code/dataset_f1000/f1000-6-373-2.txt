First, we would like to thank the authors that they have illustrated the clinical importance of taste disorders and related diagnostic procedures based on this interesting case report. Thorough medical history and validated assessment of sensory acuity is mandatory during the management of patients with smell and taste disorders. Consequently, we would like to suggest some revisions to the case report. Although important causes of taste disorders are mentioned, some other causes, e.g., surgical causes, such as tonsillectomy and middle ear surgery, as well as psychogenic causes should be added (1-3). It would be interesting if there was a decrease in body-mass-index within the last year or if it was stable. It would also be interesting if there were any changes in medication since the accident and why and how often the patient took naproxen, as it may cause stomatitis and glossitis. It would be interesting if the patient reported complaints of flavor perception. With regard to the performance of the three-drop taste threshold, it should be mentioned that the usual way of testing starts with the lowest concentration in order to avoid adaptation. Moreover, this test measures gustatory function of the whole mouth similar to the swish and spit test. The authors used a two-alternative forced-choice taste test and concluded that every deviation from a 50 percent result in ageusic patients might be suspicious of malingering. However, it has to be stated that this is not always the case and that simple and quick tests cannot guarantee the suggested confidence in detection of malingering. In some circumstances more elaborate tests (e.g., event-related potentials) are needed. In summary, we would like to thank the authors for this interesting case report, as further research in the field of rare causes of taste disorders are necessary.
