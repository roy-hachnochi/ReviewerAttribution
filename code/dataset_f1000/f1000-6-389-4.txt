This is a straightforward and simple, in a good sense, model study on the wash-in and wash-out of an anesthetic gas in a test lung model. Comparison has been made between two commercially available anesthesia machines, Aisys and Flow-i. A major finding was that with increasing gas flow, wash-in and wash-out times were reduced, as might be anticipated. The difference was small between the two anesthesia machines but there was a slight difference that in itself was unexpected, i.e. the Aisys being a little faster than the Flow-i. The Aisys uses conventional reservoir bag whereas the Flow-i uses an internal reflector that, at least in theory, should reduce any dead space effect and thus shorten time constants in gas dynamics. I have some comments. Firstly, the wash-in and wash-out times have been measured in a lung model, the same for both anesthesia machines but the gas concentration has been measured with built in equipment in the Aisys and Flow-i and thus different for the two anesthesia machines. At least I interpret of the results this way. This means that there might be a difference in results that are not caused by the different techniques of internal gas reservoir. With different gas analyzers the results may be related to how the analyzers have been calibrated and what algorithms have been used. Ideally, one should use the same gas analyzer for both machines if the intention has been to test the effect of the design of the gas reservoir. This is my major comment and I suggest that the gas analyzers should be compared to an independent reference. Other comments follow below. Abstract line 14: 300 ml/min .
