New version has taken in account suggestions about limitations and they are mentioned now in this new version. However there are still some uncorrected elements mainly in results that are important to clarify. In table 1. Put in the title that the frequency of affectation of different organs corresponds to this particular report. It leads to confusion because the affectation of cardiovascular compromise in this table is very high, because of the selection bias of the information. Cardiovascular compromise in chikungunya infection is low. Following the methodology of systematic review there should be a table with the references, authors, years included, number of patients contributed, findings and outcomes. Mainly to differentiate it from the rest of the bibliography of this article and quick access to the information. In supplement 1, on PRISMA check list, the mentioned pages of appearance of the topic treated do not correspond to the page in the article. In results it appears as having done the study selection and study characteristics, however, the presentation is poor and there is not as complete as it is established in the check list. Supplement 2 flowchart, does not mention the reasons why certain articles were excluded.
