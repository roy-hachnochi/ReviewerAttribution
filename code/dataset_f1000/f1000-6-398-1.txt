In general, it is an interesting and well written opinion article. Some comments: TITLE: Okay. ABSTRACT: Okay. INTRODUCTION: 1. I consider it to be desirable to include in the introduction the name of the virus (species) which causes yellow fever. 2. Please review the punctuation of this sentence: .."In Asia, but also Europe and North America, Nevertheless, potential spreads beyond the borders of the endemic countries is a matter of global concern." RECENT OUTBREAKS 3. Because this section is referring only to information outside of Americas, I respectfully suggest modified the subtitle as: RECENT OUTBREAKS OUTSIDE OF AMERICAS THE CONCERN RAISED FROM BRAZIL In the introduction was stated.."the lack of efficient health policies", however in the development of this idea in this section there is very little (a sentence) about what are the Brazilian health policies for yellow fever or for vector-borne disease. This information could be very useful to go in deep to discussion about the "lack of efficient health policies" CONCLUSIONS Again, the statement "the lack of efficient health policies" needs a deeper discussion in the previous section to be included in the conclusions. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I strongly recommend to include the comments outlined above.
