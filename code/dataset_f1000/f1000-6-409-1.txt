 Summary – The current manuscript has reviewed the literature on relationship between autophagy and airway fibrosis in chronic lung disease, especially asthma and COPD. This topic is of great interest and very little work has been done to understand the underlying mechanisms. I think this article is a timely reminder and will stimulate research into this area, which is much needed. Overall, this a well presented article but I have some suggestions, which will enhance readability and understanding on the diseases discussed. Major comments – Before authors go into the details for role of autophagy in asthma/remodeling, I think they need to add a separate section on airway remodeling and autophagy first. Please list the airway remodeling changes described in asthma so far and then discuss which might be related to autophagy. I think authors need to add a reference if there is any work done on fibroblast populations in asthma to make the case for fibrosis or suggest as potential future work. Similar changes I think need to be made for the COPD section, especially listing airway remodeling changes described so far, for example Rbm fragmentation, vascularity, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) etc. Authors stated in the evidence for autophagy in COPD section that major features are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. I think it is very important to describe small airway destructive pathology in COPD. The classic fixed airflow obstruction described in COPD comes from the small airways. These airways are destroyed by up to nearly 40% well before the diagnosis of COPD. So damage starts quite early on and it is this site where fibrosis really occurs and EMT is central to this. Airway disease is the primary phenomenon in COPD. EGFR has also been regarded as one of the important drivers of airway remodeling in asthma and COPD, that needs to be discussed.
