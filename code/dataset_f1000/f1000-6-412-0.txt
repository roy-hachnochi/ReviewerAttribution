 The author has reported that the choroidal tubercle is a characteristic finding in cases of military tuberculosis in an immunocompetent cases. Unlike other types of systemic tuberculosis (for example, pulmonary, lymphadenitis) which could be associated with several different ocular manifestations, it is interesting that choroidal tubercle is the only presentation observed in military tuberculosis. Providing the fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography images of choroidal tubercles along with radiological images of military tuberculosis cases would add additional value to the manuscript. The author has mentioned that systemic steroids were used at the discretion of the treating physician. Addition of treatment details in the Data set 1 will give a more clear picture regarding the management of individual cases to the readers.
