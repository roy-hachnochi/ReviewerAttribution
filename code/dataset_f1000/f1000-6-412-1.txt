The study provides information on the patterns of ocular inflammation in patients with milliary tuberculosis over a 10-year period. The finding of choroidal tubercles in the presence of normal visual acuity and in the absence of associated anterior chamber inflammation or significant vitritis highlights the importance of screening posterior segment in patients with milliary tuberculosis. The examination can be easily done as a bed side procedure. A few points mentioned below, if further analyzed, can help to improve the understanding of disease behavior in these patients. All patients had choroidal lesions detected on fundus examination. It would have been better to know at what time points the patients were examined. Were any of these patients already on anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) at the time of presentation or were started on it only after the presentation. The course and time of resolution of choroidal tubercles following initiation of ATT using OCT imaging at least in patients who were ambulatory will be an important addition. Did any of the patients have persistent lesions after the completion of ATT requiring prolonged continuation of ATT or some additional form of treatment? Did any of the patient have a resurgence of the disease following discontinuation of ATT, after an initial cure. Information regarding the recurrence pattern can further provide an insight into the etiopathogenesis of this manifestation.
