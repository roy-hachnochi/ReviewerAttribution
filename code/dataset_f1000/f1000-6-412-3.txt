Author reported the pattern of ocular lesions in patients with miliary tuberculosis. He analysed the record of the patients with the clinical diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis over ten years period seen in a hospital of Western India. All the patients were immunocompetent, had normal anterior segment findings but fundus examination showed single or multiple tubercles in the choroid. This is a rare cohort of patients of miliary tuberculosis who have got an ophthalmic examination done. It would have been better if authors could put some photograph of the fundus of these patients showing choroidal tubercles. We have studied 1005 patient of systemic tuberculosis in TB hospital in 1985 and found in 1.39% patients had ocular tuberculosis and only one patient had miliary tubercles in choroid (Biswas et al. 1996). New imaging system like optical coherence tomography particularly enhanced-depth and swept source of optical coherence tomography could show, the lesion location elegantly. Interestingly these lesions are in the periphery, not in the macular area and the patients preserve good visual function. I feel this article will be good addition to ophthalmic tuberculosis and systemic tuberculosis literature.
