This is a very interesting and stimulating opinion article in which the authors try to make sense of the current state of the Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) pharmacotherapy. They present in a very objective fashion the disappointing scenario we are facing in this area, and at the same time they provide very insightful food for thought on how the research should move forward. I would like the authors to spend some additional words on the followings: 1. The multifactorial nature of sporadic AD, and because of that a multi-target and may be personalized approach versus a one-size-fits-all solution is more likely to work. 2. While the large GWAS studies have provided evidence for good genetic leads, there is strong evidence indicating that environmental factors (i.e., lifestyle, diet) can ultimately influence the clinical phenotype.
