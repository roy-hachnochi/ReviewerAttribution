I approve the article by Liu et al. DYRK1A has developed into an interesting pharmacological target. The assay described in this paper offers an interesting alternative to previously published assays. For assay validations the authors made however a poor choice. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been identified as a DYRK1 inhibitor but this compound is highly reactive and not a meaningful inhibitor for assay validation (even though there might be clinical benefits using this natural product due to the broad spectrum of published possible cellular activities). Recently the diverse problem using promiscuous, reactive and chemically unstable inhibitors (PAINS) has been highlighted in the literature. Certainly EGCG should not be used as a control compound in any assay. However, the data is well presented (antibody source should be described) and a good addition to the kinase assay repertoire that can be used studying DYRK1A inhibitors.
