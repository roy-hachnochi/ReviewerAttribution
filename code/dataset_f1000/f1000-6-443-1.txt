The authors present a tool that finds potentially problematic regions for small variant calling, based on mappability and previously called SVs. It's an interesting and useful tool, and I have a few suggestions for improvement: It is worth noting that the 1000 Genomes SVs were discovered using only short reads in thousands of individuals, and the GIAB SVs were discovered using short and long reads in only one mother-father-son trio. There are nuances to this that would be useful to discuss. In particular, GIAB SV locations may or may not be SVs in other individuals, and because they are not highly curated, they may contain FPs around repetitive regions, but these are still good regions to identify as problematic for small variant calling I don't see the script for running SURVIVOR commands and generating the dangertrack bed files in the GitHub site, which would be useful to include to reproduce the results. When the authors say "Furthermore, we identified 48,891 5 kb regions (7.9% of all regions) that are not trustworthy," what dangertrack score threshold do they use (e.g., ==1, 0.9, 0.5, ...)? It may be interesting to compare to the GIAB high-confidence bed file for NA12878 ( ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/NA12878_HG001/NISTv3.3.2/GRCh37/HG001_GRCh37_GIAB_highconf_CG-IllFB-IllGATKHC-Ion-10X-SOLID_CHROM1-X_v.3.3.2_highconf_nosomaticdel.bed ) and the Platinum Genomes bed file for NA12878 ( ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/technical/platinum_genomes/2016-1.0/hg19/small_variants/ConfidentRegions.bed.gz ), since these are both regions where they purport to make high-confidence small variant calls.
