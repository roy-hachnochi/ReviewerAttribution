Introduction- "The patient waiting time varies across settings. In Ireland, a study conducted in an outpatient clinic showed that 50% of patients waited 60% for their appointment" What does 60% mean or is this an error that required minutes? Results: The average waiting time from registration to preliminary diagnosis in 2014 was 50.41 minutes and in 2015 was 42.05 minutes- Please write the SD in the text In table 2 you have p values calculated but there is no mention of this in the text when describing the waiting times in each time category. Were they significant or not? Your tables are not presented in the conventional manner. We do not place p values in tables. We highlight significance by * for 0,05 and ** p=0,01 and have the notion at the bottom.
