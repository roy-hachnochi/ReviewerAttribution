Thank you for providing me the opportunity to review the article. An important topic indeed. However, I think that the introduction is very superficial without adequately contextualising the waiting time problem. Methodology is very superficial indeed. There is no indication of what additional parameters were added to the hospital management system. What parameters were used to obtain the data? Who enters the data? When is patient waiting time measured from? Why did the authors do a secondary data analysis and did not conduct primary data collection? Results - There is no general profile of the patients provided. There is no standard deviation or confidence intervals provided. The results could be better presented using histograms for times of the day. Discussion - This is highly superficial. There is no mention of queuing theory or application thereof. The study does not provide any human resource data and therefore cannot link the discussion on human resources requirements. The findings were not disaggregated by health insurance and therefore the last paragraph of the discussion cannot be linked to relevant data. Conclusion - Are tailored to suit the authors agenda but not based on the findings of the study or the aims.
