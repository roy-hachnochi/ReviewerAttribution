The authors studied the response of the antioxidant protein, peroxiredoxin-6 to treatment with PDGF and hydrogen peroxide. By using a commercially available kit, the authors discovered oxidation in one of the cysteine residues at high concentrations of H2O2. My only issue with this work is for Figure 1A. The authors state that they tested three time points of hydrogen peroxide, but only one is shown in the figure. By showing all three time points could further verify the finding of this report as the 40kD would be most potentially pronounced at 30 min.
