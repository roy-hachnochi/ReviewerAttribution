Tracy Rimington and colleagues present a novel preliminary analysis of the inflammatory signature of human lung explant tissue. They correctly identify that limitations in human lung tissue models has hindered pre-clinical and mechanistic studies and provide data to suggest that a simple explanted lung tissue model may have some utility in this area. A significant advantage of this model is the lack of requirement for complex model development and should allow the technique to be utilised in any tissue culture facility with ease. The model takes multiple small pieces of human lung tissue and cultures them in a standard growth media for periods of up to 24 hours. Media is removed and then can be used for downstream assays. In this case media was used in a custom Luminex assay to detect a range of inflammatory mediators. The results suggest that the model allows for the detection if secretion of 12/21 analytes chosen and shows that secretion of these was modified by inclusion of the pro-inflammatory mediators, bacterial LPS and interleukin beta into the media. This preliminary data suggests that this type of model could be further developed and may become a valuable tool for pulmonary research. The current data shows how there is a high level of variability between different explants, both in terms of basal and stimulated levels. The reasons for this will need to be explored. Does it represent true variability between different donors or could it be due to the way in which individual donor explants are generated? Maybe the size of each tissue fragment will have a significant influence on responses? It will also be helpful to explore the tissue viability and to investigate extending the time frame of the explant cultures? Again perhaps tissue fragment size will be an important variable. Overall, the data provide a useful primer to the further development of lung tissue explants as a research tool.
