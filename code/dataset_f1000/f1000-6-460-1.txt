This interesting report describes the use of human lung tissue explants as an in vitro model to study responses to various proinflammatory stimuli. The authors showed that the model can be cultured for 24 hr and retains responsiveness to LPS and IL-1Î² with the production of different cytokines and growth factors. Interestingly, the proinflammatory potential of cultured human lung tissue explants can still be modulated by dexamethasone, suggesting that the model would be ideal to test novel anti-inflammatory drugs. Overall the manuscript is clearly written and data are novel. There are some minor points that need clarifications. It would important to state how tissue viability was assessed following the 2 days culture Please also provide, if possible, some representative picture of the histology of human lung tissue explants before and following the 2 day culture It would better to express the data in Figure 1 as net cytokine increase rather than % of LPS.
