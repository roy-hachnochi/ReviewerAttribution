This manuscript describes a valuable resource for the Brassica research and breeding communities. It is logically and clearly written. I felt that some of the methodology was inadequately cited. For example, on P4: the terms "PostgreSQL RDBMS technology”, “Ruby on Rails”, “Nginx” and “Elasticsearch” are used without any external references. Ideally scholarly or technical journal articles would be cited; if not available, then the publisher's name or project website. Some minor edits required: P3: The phrase ‘assist and help’ contains a tautology. Choose one of these terms, not both. P3: Replace ‘steming’ with ‘stemming’ P6: Presumed typo in the header “0.1 Content navigation”?
