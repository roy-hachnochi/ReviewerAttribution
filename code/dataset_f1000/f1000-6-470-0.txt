The authors present the insidious course of an infrequent subtype of FSGS, the TRPC6 -related glomerulopathy, that is an extremely rare renal disorder with ca.100 families diagnosed worldwide. Most likely an individual nephrologist will see no more than one-two such cases during his/her years of practice. The presented paper is an excellent source of information on how to comprehensively handle such patients, not only from medical but also emotional and ethical perspective. The strong points of the work are 1) presenting the recent advances in diagnostics resulting from rapid improvements in genetic sequencing technologies making kidney biopsy (almost) obsolete; 2) including the patients perspective and highlighting their engagement not only in clinical management but also in research . The weak point is too superficial presentation of the current standards of preemptive genetic testing in minors for late-onset conditions. I would recommend at least adding a reference to European Society of Human Genetics position on the issue (for details see: https://www.eshg.org/eshgdocs.0.html) and/or paragraph discussing the ethical, legal, and psychosocial implications of such genetic testing. I would also suggest to modify Figure 1B (family pedigree). Currently it seems to report results of genetic testing in the entire family, but most of the family members were not subject to any genetic testing, the affected grandmother included. Therefore, I recommend that the graph reports on phenotype and not genotype, ie. the individuals with phenotype expressed should be marked as “fully filled-in” while the information re: mutational status is to be provided below where available.
