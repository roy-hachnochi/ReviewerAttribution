The present article is a follow-up of Humble’s previous paper in F1000Research ( Humble SR. Neurosteroids are reduced in diabetic neuropathy and may be associated with the development of neuropathic pain [version 1; referees: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]. F1000Research 2016, 5 :1923 doi: 10.12688/f1000research.9034.1 ). The current article could be considered as an extended version providing further clarification on involved mechanisms. Therefore to fully understand the presented results, I recommend reading first the previous article. However, in order to reach a broader leadership illustration and description could be improved. Figure 1 could be improved by highlighting the difference with Humble’s 2016 paper; action sites of Diazepam, Flumazenil and Finasterid could be indicated. Likewise, results description focuses on difference between both mice strains without fully presenting individual results (Finast, Diaz, Flumaz…). This required a strong background in the field. My last comment concerns the primary effect of diazepam on GABA A R. The experiment consists in a 2 h incubation and it has been shown ( in vivo in other brain structure, Zeitler et al. Eur J Neurosci, 2016) that Diazepam acts within 15-30 min then is relayed by neurosteroidogenesis. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude on the primary effect alone.
