The manuscript, while very simply descriptive and short, provides interesting information on early warning indicators for HIV/AIDS in 42 outpatient clinics in 25 northern provinces of Vietnam. The introduction provides sufficient understanding of the topic and orientates the reader to the pattern of HIVDR as well as EWIs in Vietnam. However, the background data should be up to date, the authors provided more data from 2009 to 2012 and we will publish nowadays on 2018. The first paragraph on HIV epidemic in the world may be shortened to put the reader in the situation. However, the number of people who live with HIV in Vietnam should be cited to show the current state and the coverage of ART in Vietnam. The discussion should be revised to compare results with other countries and the meaning of the results should be discussed more in depth, as it may show how the data would be useful for Vietnam, how this can be comparable with other countries, and why this needs to be published.
