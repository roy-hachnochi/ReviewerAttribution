Thanks for your revisions, Corina. I repeat here what I stated in my first review: "Judging whether an opinion is scientifically valid makes no sense to me; it is still worthwhile to discuss the contents nonetheless." Having said that, I appreciate your extensive consideration of my comments. I only have one remark, which is meant as food-for-thought: Does ethical principle 1 really work like that? Art is publicly funded, but you still pay to go see it often times. It seems to me this is still a bit of a relatively easy answer to a difficult problem.
