Notwithstanding the impressive successes achieved by the Russian government and civil society since 2005 in the reduction of the excessive alcohol consumption and the associated harm, the alcohol consumption in Russia still remains very high and constitute the single most important cause of the excessive mortality in this country 1 . That is why it is so important to identify new measures that could contribute to the further reduction of the alcohol consumption in Russia, and that is why the reviewed article appears so timely and significant. Indeed, the authors demonstrate quite convincingly that the illegal internet sale of counterfeit alcohol undermines various alcohol policy measures introduced in Russia over the last years to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, such as restrictions of sale locations and sale times and the fixed minimum price on alcoholic beverages. The only problem with the article is that its authors do not offer any effective recommendations whose implementation could result in the elimination of the illegal internet sale of alcohol. In fact, they recommend two measures: "consistent monitoring of the entire production and supply chain of alcoholic beverages as well as effective denaturing of alcohol not intended for human consumption". However, I do not think that the authors themselves believe that the implementation of these two measures will result in the elimination of the illegal internet sale of alcohol. Thus, I would suggest that they should think about some additional policy measures. In this respect, it would be very useful if they could study how other countries have managed to solve this problem. In addition, the recommendation to establish "consistent monitoring of the entire production and supply chain of alcoholic beverages" does not appear to be sufficiently specific - the authors should specify what measures should be taken in order to establish such a monitoring.
