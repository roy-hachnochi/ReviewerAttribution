The population studied needs to be accurately defined - do all the LP (Lumboperitoneal) shunt patients in this study have a diagnosis of IIH? Have the authors used fluoroscopic guidance for LP shunts at their institution? This should be mentioned and if yes, then a comparison of proximal catheter placement could be made with and without fluoroscopy. Some of the introduction would be best moved to the discussion (probably paragraph 5 onwards) as this mostly elaborates on possible causes which may explain the results of the study. Result section - clarify the indication for LP shunt (do all patients have a diagnosis of IIH)? The drive for quality in healthcare in general and a reduction in revision surgery specifically, continues to gain momentum worldwide. The authors discuss the possibility that intraoperative fluoroscopy can improve accurate LP shunt placement and should be praised for providing an honest appraisal of their results / misplaced proximal catheter rates.
