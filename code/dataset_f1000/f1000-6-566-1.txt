This opinion article deals with a highly relevant topic, the validity of the concept of no evidence for disease activity "NEDA" in multiple sclerosis. Prevention of disease progression may possibly be achieved in patients, when treatment completely blocks ongoing disease activity and NEDA has been suggested as a tool to check, whether this is achieved in individual patients. However, clinical detection of disease activity, as suggested in the NEDA concept is far from being complete. Thus, this opinion article suggests to supplement current NEDA criteria with additional para-clinical markers. Such potential biomarkers are non-conventional new MRI sequences, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (N-acetyl aspartate) for evaluation of mitochondrial injury and biochemical markers such as chitinase 3, neurofilament or glial fibrillary acidic protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. Whether these additional markers will increase the reliability of NEDA criteria, will have to be established in prospective clinical studies. However, so far none of them are perfect para-clinical predictors of disease activity and currently no tools are available to monitor major pathological substrates of disease progression in MS, such as for instance the dynamic development of demyelinating lesions in the cortex, the expansion of pre-existing white matter lesions or the presence of more subtle changes within the normal appearing white and grey matter of the MS brain.
