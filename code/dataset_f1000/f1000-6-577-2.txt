In this manuscript the authors Courtial et al. validate the use of commercial ERK antibodies for the detection of MAPK-like proteins in Coral. Although the paper is well written and has the quality to be indexed, a few issues should be figure out before its final acceptance. In terms of samples preparation and to allow future replication by others researchers would be appropriate to give more information about how to prepare the samples. For example, “Briefly, coral tissue was removed from the skeleton in 1 mL Laemmli buffer” so, how much coral tissue will be dissolved and resupended it in 1 mL of Laemmli Buffer? Less than 0.5 gr? More? While it is true that the authors note that immune-detection were performed as in Courtial et al. (2017), and that DTT (Dithiothreitol) and BFB (Bromophenol blue) were added to the samples and heated (5 minutes at 95) before loading the gels, it is not specified how tissue extraction was performed. I must assume that the Lysis Buffer used was Laemmli Buffer? And in this case, how they have been unable to detect phosphorylated ERK? As far as I know lysis buffer for phosphorylated proteins usually contents EDTA or EGTA to chelate Mg2+/Ca2+, DTT for reduction of disulfide bonds, serine protease inhibitor (Aprotinin/Leupeptine), phosphatase inhibitors to block dephosphorylation like Na orthovanadate, or Beta-glycerophosphate (false substrate for phosphatase, between others… They also keep everything ice cold? Also, it surprises me that they used 3% low fat milk for membranes blocking, due to also screws up phosphor-tyrosine detection. Regarding the presence of an ERK ortholog in coral, the authors show the sequence with code Spi_isotig05348 (Spi_ERK) has the best hit with the human ERK protein (NP_0011035145) and they make reference to Liew et al., 2014. I was looking for this sequence into this paper, and I could not find it. The authors should provide in which database is the transcriptome, as well as, the Spi_ERK sequence itself.
