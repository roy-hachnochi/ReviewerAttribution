I commend the author on the edits and revisions to this article. They have strengthened the work. The expansion of the methods section, as well as the new figure and additional language discussing differences between STEM and SSH disciplines enhances this article and situates it for broader, cross-disciplinary discussion and impact. Further, these revisions have allowed the author to articulate areas for further study. These revisions have addressed the majority of my previous comments. Those comments that were not address by the revisions pertaining to disciplinary economic disparities introduced by article processing charges as well as further delving into differences between STEM and SSH disciplines, are out of scope for this article. Related to the article's discussion of the "wastefulness" of traditional peer review models, my hope is that this thread, which introduces and discusses areas for future research along this vein, is captured in the scholarly conversation and written record.
