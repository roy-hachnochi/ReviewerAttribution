In their manuscript, Suzuki and Hao report the finding of a peptide in Peroxiredoxin 6 that shows a mass increment of 32 in mass spectrometry analysis. NanoLC-MSMS analysis maps this increment at the site of a proline residue (P45 in the protein). This mass increment is found to affect approximately 7% of the peroxiredoxin 6 protein present in the samples. In view of these results the authors interpret that proline has suffered an oxidative modification leading to its conversion in glutamic acid. Our impression is that the information provided is not sufficient to establish this point. The mass increment of 32 Da could also be due to dihydroxylation of proline, which is a known posttranslational modification. Please see: http://web.expasy.org/findmod/findmod_masses.html Therefore, additional experimental evidence will be required to confirm the authorsâ€™ conclusion. Specifically, we would suggest several of the following approaches: -Synthetize both the peptide with proline and with glutamic acid -Analyze the two peptides by HPLC. If they separate, do the same type of analysis with the peptides from their samples -Attempt to oxidize the proline-containing peptide in vitro (or the intact protein) to monitor the changes in proline -Perform amino acid analysis to confirm the presence of glutamic acid -Employ other derivatization or detection strategies to confirm the presence of glutamic acid. Ideally, the modification described could be explored in other cell types under different oxidative conditions. If the authors cannot obtain an unequivocal confirmation of the presence of glutamic acid, the title of the manuscript and the main interpretations should be changed.
