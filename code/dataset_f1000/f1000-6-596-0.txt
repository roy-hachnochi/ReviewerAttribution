This manuscript does a great job of describing RNA-Seq Viewer, a tool to visualise genome-wide co-ordinate based clustering of gene expression in a sample. It's a neat project and great to see such a well polished product coming out of a hackathon. Such a responsive tool is impressive, and the user interface is simple to use. Minor concerns: The abstract says that RNA-Seq Viewer is a "web application" . However, to use it users are required to run a series of command line tools to prepare data and then edit a HTML file before getting to the web page. So whilst the tool certainly uses web technologies, I would not say that it's a fully fledged (eg. online only) web application yet. A minor change in wording would be sufficient to clear this up. The abstract says that "The backend data pipeline was developed and deployed on a shared AWS EC2 instance." - however, this seems to be the only mention of AWS in the manuscript or repository. If the authors mean that they deployed it for a one-off run, I think it's a little misleading (my assumption was that it is running as a service on AWS for anyone to use). Additional documentation as to how users can use AWS to run the tool would also be useful. There are example reports in the GitHub repository, but they're not mentioned anywhere that I can see. It would be nice if the readme clearly pointed towards these in the introduction with links using http://rawgit.com so that they can be loaded directly. Other than this, I think that the manuscript fairly describes the project. I'd love to see the additions that the authors propose at the end (support for multiple samples and use with a wider range of input data) and hope that the manuscript may get a future revision with such additional features! I see that another reviewer mentions the generic name - I agree that 'RNAideogram' or something else may be a little more specific and useful!
