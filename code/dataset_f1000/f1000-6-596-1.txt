The authors have succeeded in integrating multiple disparate software resources into a useful and well-motivated tool, RNA-Seq Viewer, that was largely put together within a three-day hackathon, which is even more impressive and speaks to the strengths of hackathons in general, particularly when there is a clear motivation and goal in mind that play to the strengths of everyone involved. I'm particularly happy to see that NCBI is more actively engaging the open-source community though organization of workshops and events such as this. One key item: I couldn't find an online example, if there is one available this would be very useful as a live demo and would be particularly useful in garnering feedback, including possible directions for future development. I should note: there are already a few 'RNA-Seq Viewer' tools out there, not sure if you would need to change the name (if so please no horrible backronyms): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5320319/ http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/software/RNAseqViewer/
