Overall, I like the idea of PubRunner. However, as a potential user of the tool, I have three problems described below. While the motivation of the work is clear, what was not clear to me was the benefit of using a specialized tool like PubRunner instead of utilizing a more general scheduling tool like cron. I guess the authors know the benefits, but as it was not clear in the manuscript, I suggest the authors to explain it more clearly in the manuscript to better motivate potential users actually to choose to use PubRunner over alternatives. In the manuscript, the protocol between an instance of PubRunner and the "central website" is not clearly described. It is even completely missing in Figure 1. I think designing such a protocol is not a trivial work, and it has be to clearly explained in the manuscript. For the PubRunner to be more useful, I also think the method of publishing the results has to be more generalized. In fact, I have a big question about requiring the results to be uploaded to a FTP server. Can't it be a HTTP server? If PubRunner allows its user to choose the way of publishing the text mining results, it will become much more useful. This problem is actually related to the problem 1, e.g., if I choose to utilize cron, I can freely choose how to publish the result of my text mining pipeline.
