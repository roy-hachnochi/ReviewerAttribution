The authors have addressed the comments in my initial review and the genome assemblies are now public. I have a few minor comments on this revised version. In Table 1, I would recommend removing the top row and instead in the table title referring to the kmer size and sequence coverage, or alternatively to merge the cells in the top row- as is, those cells appear to refer to the columns below and not the entire table. For Table 2- the Spades Hybrid has the same read stats as the other nanopore only assemblies but lists using both illumina and nanopore data. For Figure 4- was the 'before' data computed for the 2 Spades assemblies- seems odd that there were no BUSCO hits in those pre-pilon versions.
