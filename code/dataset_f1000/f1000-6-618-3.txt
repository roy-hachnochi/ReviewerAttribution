Jansen et al . used Oxford Nanopore Technology with other short read sequencing technology, HiSeq 2500, to perform high-quality de novo genome assembly and classify yeast strain isolates, Candida vartiovaarae DDNA#1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C and Cyberlindrena jadinii CBS1600/NBRC 0988. They also exploited two versions of Nanopore flowcell chemistry and related software. Especially AT-rich mitochondria assembly using R7.3 and R9 comparison is very interesting. Using similar short read data, N50 of DDNA#1 is 2.2kbp and that of S277C was 124Kbp. Probably authors want to perform repeat analysis for both strains to further study what makes such a performance gap. For assembly approach two and three, authors used Canu to correct Nanopore reads with short reads. So basically all three approaches adopted short reads for correction or assembly purpose. Since Canu can perform self-correction with only long reads, it would be very interesting to compare self-corrected Nanopore reads assembly contiguity vs. short reads corrected Nanopore reads assembly contiguity. Authors used two error correction methods; Canu and PILON, It would be helpful to consistently compare the correction performance of two software. Although C. jadinii stains are proposed to be the closest strain, given Figure 4, S288C looks much closer to DDNA#1. Probably authors want to take a close look at this. All sequencing data should be available online for reproducibility.
