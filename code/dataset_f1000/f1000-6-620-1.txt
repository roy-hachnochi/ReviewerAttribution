General: This is a small retrospective study that adds to the evidence that those with HCV (genotype 1)-HIV co-infection and low viral load can be treated successfully with 8 weeks of Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir. Adherence matters as the one treatment failure did not complete treatment. The data from this cohort (two patients not described) are not strong enough to recommend this strategy for those with established cirrhosis. On-treatment monitoring of HCV PCR adds little to treatment. Specific comments: 1. The introduction is a bit dated. We should no longer need to justify treatment of those with HIV co-infection as a priority population. The simple fact of HCV infection means that these individuals should be offered treatment. 2. Introduction points out that HIV infection status no longer independently impacts treatment outcomes. The introduction should ALSO point out that those with HCV without HIV, NO cirrhosis and low viral load can be successfully treated with 8 weeks of SOF/LDV. 3. Two patients were thought to be cirrhotic but clinically compensated - how compensated? They should be described further and they should be pointed out in Table 3 - what were platelet counts, INR, albumin, Bilirubin. 4. The discussion is repetitive - should not repeat what was said in introduction 5. Study presents data of on-treatment HCV PCR monitoring. Do the authors think that this is required?
