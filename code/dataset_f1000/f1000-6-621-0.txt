The authors have carried out SNP genotyping in from a New Zealand cohort of men with self-reported European ethnicity that have been clinically diagnosed with aggressive and non-aggressive PCa, and healthy controls. They have identified a number of SNPs from the GWAS from various European populations and described SNP-SNP interaction as a risk factor for aggressive PCa in a New Zealand cohort. The intronic SNP rs2121875, an on chromosomal position 5p12 near the fibroblast growth factor 10 ( FGF10 ) gene24, has been identified to be associated with the intronic SNP rs4809960, an intronic SNP present in chromosomal position 20q13 near the gene cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1 ( CYP24A1 ). The protein encoded by CYP24A1 initiates the degradation of the physiologically active form of Vitamin D3 (VD3) 26 which is an important hormone that is actively involved in regulating cell proliferation in the prostate, and has also been identified to have increased expression in PCa cell lines. The epistatic effect of the SNP-SNP interactions suggested by the authors may be relevant in view of many recent studies showing intronic mutations which can exert their effect on protein coding exons. The recent observation of decreasing Vitamin D3 levels worldwide further support the role of environmental factors in these gene environment interactions. Future studies may help in understanding the role of SNPs and environmental interactions.
