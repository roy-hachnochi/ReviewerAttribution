The question regarding the low number of 2D sequences was addressed by the authors as the effect of different versions of basecalling algorithm and sequencing chemistry. The authors further explained the differences in ligation conditions, concluding that the short ligation is better at preventing chimeric reads than long ligation. Based on these observations I am satisfied with the report.
