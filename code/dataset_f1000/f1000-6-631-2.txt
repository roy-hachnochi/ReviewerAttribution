The authors have provided a useful report on technical aspects of the emerging Oxford Nanopore MinION DNA sequencing technology. As noted in the paper, the library preparation methods scrutinized here are commonly found in multiple advanced DNA sequencing technologies, and so lessons learned in this work are likely applicable elsewhere. In the methods section, the authors report injected "dead infectious" worms, but not how the worms were killed. It would be greatly preferable for all of the input DNA amounts to library preparations to be given in both mass and fmol. While it is common to report masses of DNA, the ligations really are dependent on the availability of DNA ends. The point Figure 8 is trying to convey would be greatly enhanced by adding a zoom of the region around 8s in the plot in which the temporal sequence barcodeNB11-open pore--stall-barcode NB06 is seen. Zooms of other transitions should be considered as well.
