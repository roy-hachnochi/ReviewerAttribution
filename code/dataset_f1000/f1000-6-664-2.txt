The paper has already two reviewers and they have addressed many of the issues that I would have raised. My main concern however is that the interpretation of the results depend highly on the accuracy of the reference used and that the human reference is still incomplete (non-haplotypic), error-ridden, and evolving. It is unclear how the tool will adapt to the future when large number of accurate haplotypic whole genome references will become available. What makes it even worse is that the software is built on a group of intuitively justifiable heuristics with many hyper-parameters hard-coded. However, all the other tools it competes against also suffer from these problems and the genomics community has been strangely oblivious of these foundational problems.
