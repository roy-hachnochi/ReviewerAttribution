This article examines in detail the phenotypes of mast cells in the uterus – depending on their tryptase/chymase content and their steroid hormone receptor status. The work is solid, and well presented. The methods are well described so that others can validate the data. While tryptase/chymase phenotypes have previously been described across the menstrual cycle (referenced), the information regarding a tryptase-/chymase+ phenotype is new, as is the steroid receptor phenotypeof ERβ+/GR+/ERα-/PR- in tryptase positive cells. Where the data particularly varies from that previously published is in the activation status of the mast cells. This variation could be explained by different fixation protocols or different antibodies. Activation is very important as mast cells are only functionally relevant following this release of the potent molecular contents of their granules.
