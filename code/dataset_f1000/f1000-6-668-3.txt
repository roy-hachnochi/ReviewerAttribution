This study assesses the possibility of using recycled polyethylene terephthalate from used bottle waste as a membrane material. A topic that highly relevant in waste-to-value perspective. The fact that the study was a success make this report worthy of publication. Moreover, the approach of using recycled PET as membrane material is rather new with only few references available. I believe that by addressing comments below, the quality of the manuscript will be improved. Major comment: When discussing the membrane formation mechanism, the authors mentioned the roles of evaporation time. However, by looking into the properties of phenol (melting point of 40.5 C and boiling point of 181.7 C), the rate of phenol evaporation is too low. As seen in Figure 4, phenol in the presence of residue in the membrane matrices is obvious. Another aspect to be discussed is the effect of falling temperature on the solution (I assumed that the casting was done at room temperature) as well as inhibition of water from humid air. Those phenomena occur simultaneously and contribute to the formation of membrane structure. The authors are expected to address minor comments below and fit their answer into the revised manuscript. Add information about the permeability in the abstract. Please revise typo error far description of parameters in Eq. 2: C p and C f instead of Cp and Cf. What is the solubility of phenol in a mixture of 1:12 of water:propanol. Is there any preliminary study on selecting this ratio? What will be the impact of non-solvent composition on the produced PET membrane? Figure 8: A simpler scatter plot will be more informative rather than overlapping 3D plots in the current version of the manuscript. Also, information on the testing pressure should be included in the caption.
