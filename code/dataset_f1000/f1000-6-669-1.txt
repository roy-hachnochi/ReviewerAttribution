This clearly-written and well-argued manuscript highlights recent pertinent findings concerning mechanisms underlying exon skipping and splicing in determination of disease severity in patients with CEP290 mutations. Evidence cited is consistent with the notion that the severity of disease is inversely proportional to the level of normal or near-normal protein generated. It is suggested that phenotypic rescue, could be achieved in patients with the most common, severe nonsense mutations of CEP290 by in-frame splicing. This has important potential for personalised therapeutic intervention in the future which envisages induction of exon skipping to up regulate normal mRNA, increase near-normal protein levels and thereby reduce the severity and progression of for instance nephronopthisis, a rare disease but common cause of renal failure in children.
