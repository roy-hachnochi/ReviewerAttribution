Essentially the article is concise and well written. The problem is the small number of patients studied, there really have not been a sufficient number to be able to justify the conclusions stated in this article. Other comments are - There must have been many more patients treated by internal fixation over the 5 year study period. This is a selected group of patients. How were they selected? Numbers not just percentages must be given in the abstract. There are only very limited presentation of the patient demographics. There is only need for one decimal place. Were there more displaced fractures in the de-rotation screw group? The treatment of the complications should be in the results not the discussion.
