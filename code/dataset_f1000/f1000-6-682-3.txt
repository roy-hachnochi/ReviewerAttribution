In this manuscript, the authors present a new application of NMR to measure MOSH and MOAH in raw materials or in final products (e.g. cosmetics). They present a carefully performed validation of the method and compare the NMR-results with those of established LC-GC methods. Especially, the findings of a possible overestimation of the MOAH fraction or underestimation of the MOSH-fraction by LC-GC seem to be very important in terms of risk assessment. Further, advantages and limitations of NMR are presented very detailed and in an objective manner. Indexing of the article is recommended because of novelty and technical quality. This paper will be of interest to many scientists in this field of research, especially for toxicological evaluations and for market survey purposes of cosmetic and medicinal products. In my opinion, this manuscript is clearly presented and well organised. It gives adequate references to related work and the abstract provides a quantitative summary. Remarks: The discussion section could be supplemented with the possibilities of LC-GCxGC-MS in order to characterise components of MOAH. Discussion, Page 9, last section: “Due to the higher specificity and selectivity of NMR, it must be assumed… We therefore conclude that …” Please move these statements from the discussion to the conclusion section.
