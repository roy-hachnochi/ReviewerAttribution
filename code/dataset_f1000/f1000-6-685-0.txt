In the presented case report the authors explain the complications after a laparoscopic ventral hernia repair leading to mesh removal with an allergic reaction to Physiomesh. A revisional reoperation due to severe abdominal pain on the same day as the primary operation and high levels of leucocytes and CRP at the time of the second reintervention deliver arguments pro chronic mesh infection. We know from experimental studies that the histological findings of the incorporation of Physiomesh into the abdominal wall show different pictures compared to other composite meshes induced by the absorbable membrane on both sides of Physiomesh (Kckerling et al. 2017 1 ). As an allergic reaction to synthetic hernia meshes is not reported until today, the authors should discuss other possible explanations for their findings.
