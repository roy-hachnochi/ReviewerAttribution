This paper reports on the qualitative of polyp bailout for the coral species Pocillopora damicornis under heat stress in mesocosms. The study remains qualitative and the authors are clear on this point. The only remark I would have is in the discussion. The sentence "Detached polyps appear to be viable, able to settle near the parent colony and capable of being dispersed short distances in a reef environment." sounds like that resettlement of the bailed polyp were observed. However it was not observed and remain a speculation. I would suggest to rephrase it to something like that: "While resettlement of the bailed out polyps could not be observed, the polyps appear to be viable, and could be able to settle near the parent colony and to be dispersed accross short distances in a reef environment."
