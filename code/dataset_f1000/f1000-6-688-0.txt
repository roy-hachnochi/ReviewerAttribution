The manuscript describes the generation of whole genome shotgun sequence data from two separate DNA preparation methods. The methods for data generation are clearly described and the sample that was used has ample information about its origins publicly available and referenced. This dataset will be useful for SNP discovery and comparative genomics of sugarcane cultivars.
