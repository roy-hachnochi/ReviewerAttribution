The bioinformatic approach presented in this study is potentially highly interesting, providing to scientists a useful data set to investigate the different pathways activated in Cannabis sativa at different developmental stages, and in different organs. I would only ask to the Author if some of the gene sets identified could be further divided into sub-clusters: e.g. there is a “green” area in Fig.1 – cluster 4 in leaves and flower buds (about in the second quarter from above). On the opposite, this area is "red" in cluster 5 – first quarter. Could be these results interpreted under the light of the considerations exposed in the discussion?
