This is a nice comprehensive review regarding advantages of close proximity and metabolite channelling in energy supply to cellular processes. Role of phosphotransfer enzymes – creatine kinase, nucleoside diphosphokinase and glycolysis is analysed in “on site” fuelling energy dependent processes. New evidence is reviewed. Some parts of the review could be improved and clarified. For example in Fig. 3 presented glycolytic pathway represents an old classical view which has undergone changes in recent years including localization and spatial cluster arrangement of glycolytic metabolism. Localization of hexokinase close to mitochondria enables pickup of high-energy phosphoryls generated in mitochondria and to transfer on glycolytic intermediates and deliver to ATP consuming sites. Thus, first stage of glycolysis is better to call Energy Investment, energy is not released and not consumed (-2ATP?) but rather transferred on other molecules. So the total energetic balance of glycolysis is 6 ATP or 6 ~P (2~P from OxPhos and 4~P from glycolysis) transferred and delivered to remote ATPases. Since glycolytic rate can be high and close proximity to ATP consumption sites makes glycolysis energy efficient pathway delivering over 30% of OxPhos and rest of glycolytic ~P. This could be addressed, not to repeat textbook mistakes. Second, an important seminal paper directly demonstrating how positioning of “energetic” enzymes affect energy supply and cell motility is not discussed and cited: van Horssen R, Janssen E, Peters W, van de Pasch L, Lindert MM, van Dommelen MM, Linssen PC, Hagen TL, Fransen JA, Wieringa B. Modulation of cell motility by spatial repositioning of enzymatic ATP/ADP exchange capacity. J Biol Chem. 2009 Jan 16;284(3):1620-7[Ref-1]. This can improve an overall nice review.
