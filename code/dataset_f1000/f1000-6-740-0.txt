I must congratulate the author for reporting such a rare medical entity. The case has been nicely described and I am sure that this is going to be useful for other practitioners. However, I feel, few points to be considered in this case report are: Sixth CN palsies may be better demonstrated on all directions of gaze. In the given picture, it looks like the patient also has BL ptosis! Histopathology of lung mass if included, would be better. The patient has been on follow-up at cancer center. It would be interesting to know the neurological status at follow up. I think the author should discuss more with data on brain metastasis of choriocarcinoma 1 .
