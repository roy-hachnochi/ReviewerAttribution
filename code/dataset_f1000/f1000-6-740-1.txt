The paper tells us “Her immune status was normal”. I think the authors should show us the date of the immune test. Since the patient was found by multiple hemorrhagic metastases to the brain, and the primary lesion from lung, how about the tumor marker from lung? Has she had a gene test of EGFR, ROS1, ALK, T790M, which could be useful if she needed target therapy? Did she need radiation for the lung tumor and when? The author need to discuss these questions.
