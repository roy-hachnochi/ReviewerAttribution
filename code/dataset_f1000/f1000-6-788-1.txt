This is as close to 'publish as is' as I've ever seen. Excellent work, well articulated, good overview of literature. My only suggestion is that a paragraph at the end would be helpful, laying out the experimental implications of this theory, i.e. if this theory holds or if such analyses pan out, how would an experimentalist change their research plan?
