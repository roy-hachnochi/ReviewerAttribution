This is an original and nice contribution to the field. The authors propose a mathematical approach to analyse the relation between polypharmacology and polyspecificity, that are, as presented here “two concepts running on the same avenue”. I particularly like the idea of extracting latent information to describe relationships between the degrees of these two complementary features. This work highlights the inherent complexity of biological systems providing a view of drug-target interactions as a pattern where both sides have an array of possibilities. Pattern recognition involved in the perception of odorants provides an additional example (See for instance DOI: 10.1038/81774) of the complexity involved in the recognition of ligands by biomacromoleules. It could be envisioned that the mathematical approach described in this paper will be attractive to parallel areas of biological processes governed by pattern interactions.
