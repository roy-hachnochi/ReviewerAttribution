The article investigates and compares color discrimination in chronic smokers and healthy individuals. The authors found a lower significant color discrimination in chronic smokers. However, I believe that in order to clarify the cut-off point of color discrimination, authors should write in Methods the standard of normality used to rate low or high color discrimination. In addition, in the description of the results , for better understanding, the authors should explain better the results (which are below the expected) and then the significance of them. The results suggest a possible, even small, important change to the color discrimination of smokers which deserves attention and should be better studied. Therefore, I believe that the paper should be accepted for publication with the aforementioned suggestions. References 1. Mollon JD, Regan BC: Cambridge Colour Test Handbook.

We will try to answer your questions below: However, I believe that in order to clarify the cut-off point of color discrimination, authors should write in Methods the standard of normality used to rate low or high color discrimination. We appreciate the suggestion. These changes were made. We stand by calculating the average of the control group of all studies using Trivector in Brazil and using the normative data for age groups used by Paramei et al. 1 In addition, in the description of the results, for better understanding, the authors should explain better the results (which are below the expected) and then the significance of them. We appreciate the suggestion. Although the description of Trivector's results is quite directive (for details, see 2-5 ), we agreed that the way the results were presented was below expectations.These changes were made. The results suggest a possible, even small, important change to the color discrimination of smokers which deserves attention and should be better studied. In agreement. Based on this suggestion, we added a few paragraphs on the importance of the present study, see Introduction and Discussion. References: Paramei GV.
