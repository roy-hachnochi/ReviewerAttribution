Antibody validation and its contribution to scientific reproducibility is a topical area. While there are several recent reviews on the subject each brings a slightly different perspective that adds value. This is true of the current article, which provides some very helpful and practical advice. The article also highlights the key role of dialogue between antibody vendors and end users, between academic laboratories and the importance of a partnership within the scientific community to improve the standards of antibody validation and publishing antibody-based data. While commercially available antibodies have the advantage of being easily accessible it would be worth mentioning the published literature earlier than section 7 as a resource for finding antibodies. In some instances the best antibody may be produced by an academic laboratory and might not be commercially available. The section on recombinant antibodies gives the impression that these reagents are always generated by library screening, “without any dependence on animal immunization”. It would be helpful to clarify that any antibodies, including classical monoclonal antibodies derived from hybridoma cell lines, can be produced in a recombinant format by isolating and cloning their immunoglobulin genes. Indeed recombinant therapeutic antibodies used by the pharmaceutical industry are commonly derived from classical monoclonal antibodies and efforts are underway to convert many monoclonal antibodies used as research tools into a recombinant format to ensure their longevity. While the authors indicate they have no competing interests it would be worthwhile for full transparency to declare that two of the authors work for a commercial antibody vendor, particularly as the article makes strong recommendations regarding criteria for vendor selection.
