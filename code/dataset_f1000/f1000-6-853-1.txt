This manuscript reports response and ERP (N170) difference to human facial expression in the different phase of menstrual cycle of women. The study is well designed and the result is clear and meaningful. However, the authors should address some issues. #1 The cause of the result should be clarified or discussed. The result (slowed reaction time and enlarged N170 in late luteal phase for emotional stimuli) is impressive and apparently affected by menstrual cycle. However, what factors of the menstrual cycle did affect this data? As the author pointed out, menstrual cycle has many aspects. It is caused by several types of hormones and their cyclic increase and decrease. Such hormones cause emotional changes, fluid balance change etc. during menstrual cycle. Is the result caused by hormonal changes directory or by emotional changes driven by hormones? This matter should be clarified or discussed better. #2 Method to obtain N170 should be clarified. The method to obtain N170 (recording ERP during presentation of emotional face) is not noted in the method clearly.
