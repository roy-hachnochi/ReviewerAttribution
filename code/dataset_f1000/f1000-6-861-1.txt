The data note entitled ' Draft genome sequencing of the sugarcane hybrid SP80-3280 ' is perhaps the first report describing the whole genome of sugarcane, a complex polyploid and its availability in NCBI will be a boon to sugarcane researchers. The study is well planned, executed and well drafted. The data presented here would be particularly useful for functional genomic studies in sugarcane.
