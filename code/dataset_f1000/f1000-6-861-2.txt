Summary: The Data Note, "Draft genome sequencing of the sugarcane hybrid SP80-3280", describes a sugarcane genome assembly that is available at NCBI. The TruSeq method was applied to a monoploid sugarcane cultivar to generate a 1.2 gigabase assembly with a 8433 contig N50 according to GenBank. This is the first sugarcane genome assembly so it will be of interest to the field. This data note is especially useful because it describes the sequence filtering by size, blast, mirabit, and cd-hit prior to release. Suggestions: The sentence, “there are not whole genome assemblies available”, probably should say “there are no whole genome assemblies available”. The text could be made clearer by presenting all the statics for underlying short reads before getting to the synthetic long read stats, and by specifying that the blast filter was applied to the long reads. I would appreciate a reference for Celera Assembler, but that is just me.
