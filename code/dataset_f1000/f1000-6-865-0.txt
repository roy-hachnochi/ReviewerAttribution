This is a nice academic paper that deals with haematological parameters in malaria. Using a case control approach, the authors have identified a mean platelet distribution width and mean platelet volume as possible markers of acute symptomatic malaria in their setting. This is interesting but of limited practical application. Therefore, this paper should emphasise the academic aspects of their findings. I think this paper can be accepted but with major revisions in two areas, in particular. Sample size calculation – this has been determined using continuous variables yet we do not see any examples. This must be addressed. Discussion – this should be more thorough comparing and contrasting the current data with previously published data. Moreover, readers will want to know important causes of increased RDW, PDW and MPV and where in haematological practice these parameters play an important role. The authors should let us know if their research has led to any new research questions and future avenues of research. Minor comments The number of malaria related deaths are higher than those reported by the WHO. The authors should obtain the latest data. No mention of the role of malaria rapid diagnostic tests The second line of the Discussion does not follow. Did the Yemeni study report PDW and MPV ?
