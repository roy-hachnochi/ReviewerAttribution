The article was well written but is deficient in terms of methodology design. Given below is a list of points which if addressed will greatly improve the quality of the paper. I have also attached an annotated pdf version of the manuscript - please download to access the comments. Your Introduction suggests that you are mistaking large urban open solid waste dumps for sanitary landfills. Best waste management practices require that material and energy recovery processes be applied to solid waste streams before disposal in landfills. What you have described fits open dumps and not landfills. I suggest you change the term landfill to open dump. Why was the Finnish government decree for soil remediation used? You argued that Nigeria has no such standards. If that is so, you should have used USEPA guideline values. However, it may interest you to know that the Department of Petroleum Resources has published guideline values for heavy metals Nigerian soils. Please see the article published by Wuana and Okeimen (2011) which can be assessed with the following doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.5402/2011/402647 . It is suggested that you also use the DPR guideline values even if you would like to retain the Finnish guideline values. Your experimental months contain too much detail which can easily be found in standard methods or equipment manufacturersâ€™ manuals. The major weakness of this paper is that very few samples were analysed. Taking four random samples from a 21 Ha waste dump is inadequate and the results can hardly be generalized. One would expect that there would be a spatial variation of these heavy metals in the soil which should have necessitated a systematically staggered/spaced sampling points in order to obtain representative results. Both table and graphs were presented for the same dataset. You should either use tables or graphs for your data depending on which you find more suitable, but you cannot use both for the same data. Discussion of results is shallow.
