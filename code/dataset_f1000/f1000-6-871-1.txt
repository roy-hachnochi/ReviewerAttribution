The paper is interesting as it focuses on some of the heavy metals which find their way into food via wastes disposed in the city. The authors have taken pains in bringing out the salient features of the heavy metal contamination. The analytical methods used are appropriate. They can be reproduced by other scientists. To strengthen the outcome, the study should have looked into the composition of the wastes being dumped at the landfill and also compared with age of the wastes and their heavy metal composition and leachability. The type of soils and the composition is not adequately described. The sample size of the soils should have been more than what the authors have collected, sieved through a specific particulate size before processing. This should have given a better and homogenous sample. Also, finding the levels of heavy metals at various depths of soil may have been useful. Heavy metal levels of control soil samples should have added the value to the work.
