This manuscript presented seven perspectives for investigation of GPCR structure using H/D-exchange with mass spectrometry. The manuscript was well-written and clarified many misconceptions in using H/D exchange in getting GPCR rough structure information. It is nice that the author put emphasis in the description of how to maintain the solution structure of GPCR with its relevant lipid environments during the H/D exchange reaction. It can be accepted after further addressing the following questions. 1). HDX can be used to illustrate the effect of post-translational modifications 1 on protein dynamics, ligand binding, and substrate specificity. It is an important part of application of this intriguing technology and should be included in this manuscript. 2). Crosslinking (XL) mass spectrometry of GPCR in its native state (with proper lipids and solubilizing detergents) may be a rival to HDX in the future. XL may be used with endogenous GPCRs. This should be discussed. 3).The manuscript need to be further proof-read. There are many typos and grammar errors. One example: (Page 4, Line 25) “How the presentation methods” should be corrected as “how the present methods”.
