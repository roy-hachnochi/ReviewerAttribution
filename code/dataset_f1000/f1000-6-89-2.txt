The author has provided a description of the methodological issues that were resolved by the author for a 2010 paper using hydrogen deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry to characterize the beta adrenergic GPCR. The article may be a response to another article published by another group in 2015 also on the use of hydrogen deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry to characterize the beta adrenergic GPCR. A recently published review 1 attempts to summarize how hydrogen deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry has transformed not only GPCR characterizations (the author of the submitted opinion article here, Dr. Zhang is credited for his work in the review 1 ) but also the study of peripheral membrane proteins. In the Opinion article submitted by the author, Dr. Zhang, the two-step approach for the characterization of the beta-adrenergic receptor is indicated in section 1 and Fig1. Detergent considerations are indicated in sections 2,3 as well as Fig2. Proteinase digestion is considered in section 4, monovalent cation considerations in section 5, buffer concentrations in section 6 and automation in section 7. Three supplementary figures are used to compare sequence coverage using different protocols and an extensive 7 page supplementary section on detergent ( solubilisation) choices. It is difficult for this reviewer to see the conceptual advance in this submitted Opinion piece and that of the recent review by the same author ( Dr. Zhang) in a 2015 review in Molecular and Cellular Proteomics ( indeed some of the figures are similar for GPCR coverage and credited as such in this submitted Opinion piece ). One innovation that may be an extension of hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry may be the application of “Native” mass spectrometry 2 to integral membrane proteins such as the beta-adrenergic receptor. Perhaps the author could consider the important biological discoveries made through hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry for integral membrane proteins using, as an example, the beta adrenergic receptor and the hope that this can be extended though “Native” mass spectrometry, especially for resolving the dynamics of the interactions with the intracellular subunits of the hetero trimeric signaling complex.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This manuscript presented seven perspectives for investigation of GPCR structure using H/D-exchange with mass spectrometry. The manuscript was well-written and clarified many misconceptions in using H/D exchange in getting GPCR rough structure information. It is nice that the author put emphasis in the description of how to maintain the solution structure of GPCR with its relevant lipid environments during the H/D exchange reaction. It can be accepted after further addressing the following questions. 1). HDX can be used to illustrate the effect of post-translational modifications 1 on protein dynamics, ligand binding, and substrate specificity. It is an important part of application of this intriguing technology and should be included in this manuscript. 2). Crosslinking (XL) mass spectrometry of GPCR in its native state (with proper lipids and solubilizing detergents) may be a rival to HDX in the future. XL may be used with endogenous GPCRs. This should be discussed. 3).The manuscript need to be further proof-read. There are many typos and grammar errors. One example: (Page 4, Line 25) “How the presentation methods” should be corrected as “how the present methods”.
