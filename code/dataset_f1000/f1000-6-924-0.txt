I find the authorâ€™s revision satisfactory. I understand that the author is writing under several practical constraints, and my assessment is that the new Appendix strikes a good balance between maintaining accessibility in the main text and providing entry points into the literature for the reader who wants to learn more. With luck, this series of articles will inspire a new generation of biologists to tackle these important problems.
