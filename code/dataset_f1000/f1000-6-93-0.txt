The authors proposed a sample sorting method for fetal MR images. Below are several suggestions to potentially improve the clarity of the paper. The Introduction stated that the goal of this work is to further improve the MaZda software. The authors may consider enlarging its audience size by introducing how this data could benefit other researchers in the fetal research community. The sample sorting seems totally manual, which may be more efficient with the help of some machine learning algorithms. Experiments could be added to evaluate the performance/correctness of the sample sorting process. Some details of the data itself could be useful for readers, such as the final data number, demographic information. The dataset 1 for downloading seem only contain 3 subjects.
