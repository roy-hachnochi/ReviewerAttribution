To my understanding this manuscript provides a description of a data repository containing fetal MR scans and a description of an analysis software package. This is a very nice idea. However, the manuscript is currently not clearly written which hampers reading and understanding of the paper. In my opinion the purpose of the paper needs to be clarified. Description of the data repository can be more concise, and description of collected images could be more specific. It is good that patient inclusion is provided but it would be nice to know how many images acquired with what protocol are collected, as well as the patient characteristics. Furthermore, exact purpose of the software is currently unclear. Reading descriptions available at provided links provides some clarification but it would be much better if this manuscript is self-contained. The manuscript contains many specific terms that are to the best of my knowledge not generally known and hence need to be introduced and explained to allow understanding of the work. For example, the introduction starts with “sample sorting” which is not introduced. In the same paragraph, the authors mention “target recognition semantics” but it is not known what is meant by this. The authors mention that personal information has been removed according to agreement, but it is not clear what agreement. It would be important to describe in the manuscript if and how scientific community can benefit from this image database and the described software. The title does not reflect the content of the paper well. I would advise to change it accordingly.
