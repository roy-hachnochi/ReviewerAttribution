This study attempts to explore the molecular motor, Myosin XXI, using computational methods in order to assist discovery of new therapeutic approaches for leishmaniasis. The authors designed a nanocircuit with a coupled bistable switch inducer, in silico, using Tinker Cell. The basic premise for this study was that the intended targets could be impaired either through antisense RNA for the calmodulin binding motif or protein phosphatase 2A. The simulations carried out showed that the nanocircuit acted as a nanomachine when a chemical gradient was applied. The authors concluded that their designed circuit was found to be a good biological network which could be manipulated to potentially disrupt several processes such as intracellular trafficking, metabolite efflux, motility by Myosin XXI and the survival mechanism of ABC transporters causing mortality of the leishmanial parasite. Overall, the article is well written and the experimental approach appears to be well thought out. I cannot comment on the specifics of the computational methods as I have limited experience in this area. I recommend indexing of this article as it contributes a new strategy for elimination of the Leishmanial parasite.
