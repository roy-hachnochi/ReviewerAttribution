The article by Kosey and Singh proposes a novel molecular motor intended to impair the activity of Myosin and ABC transporters as agents of Leishmaniasis. A wide array of simulations and measurements seems to support the authors' claims, specifically the claim that the addition of an inducer increases the possibility of avoiding undesired basins of attraction in the circuit's dynamics, and the claim that both, Myosin XXI motility and the metabolite efflux will be hindered as result of the action of the proposed circuit. Design and simulation are by themselves a significant undertaking. Molecular motors such as dynein or myosin are engineered by Nature, and the artificial replication of these remarkable designs is one of the greatest challenges of biological engineering. A still limited understanding of the laws of molecular mechanics at different scales in a biological system prevents a design based on solid theoretical principles. Genetic circuit design is yet an experimental art. And mostly as a result of early experimentation in protein and metabolic engineering, a wide variety of tools that include several computational methods, have been developed and are currently used to predict the effects of a genetic circuit design in a larger biological system. Besides the novelty of the circuit design, this article is an excellent display of the tools and methodological approach to design verification. My sole critique is not about the novelty of the design or the strength of the tools and methodology but rather the limited discussion of the results. I think that the article would be greatly benefited by the addition of interpretations of the statistics and the Boolnet and GRENITS outputs, which in the current version are mostly left to the interpretation of the reader.
