This is an unique and excellent study that is focused on open online courses in Latin American medical education. Minor comments: It would be great if authors can comment on: Why Latin America is having low rate of medical online courses and potential answers for these problems? - For example: Many universities in USA have free provision of internet access to medical students while in campus and students are made aware of the available courses in many possible ways. Do they have this kind of feature in Latin American countries? If not- it may be one of the contributing factors. This opens doors to many questions- like the fee charged in USA medical schools vs the fee charged by Latin American medical schools -- one of the few potential factors that may be contributing to the difference.
