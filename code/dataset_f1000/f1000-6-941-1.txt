The manuscript by Bakri et al. describes the evaluation of antimicrobial activity of two plant extracts collected from geothermal area in Malaysia. However, several points should be corrected/clarified before acceptance. 1- The criteria for collection of those two plants; the existence in an extreme area is not a guarantee for antimicrobial activity. 2- The introduction section should survey previous work on the plants under investigation. 3- The name of the botanist with complete affiliation in addition to herbarium number should be mentioned. 4- The exp. section is not complete. 5- Please report the diameter of inhibition zones of each test. 6- No need to mention the structure of cpd isolated from marine organism.
