In the present study the authors have mapped the miRNA involved in cervical cancer on to Latin American genome using in silico predictions. As cervical cancer has the highest mortality rates in low and middle income countries we do need to advance our understanding on mechanism of its progression. It is an interesting study however, there are few shortcomings in the current MS which need to be addressed. It is not clear how human genes near to viral insertion sites have been identified. It was observer that near integration sites mostly only one or two genes are present. The method and parameters used for finding the genes should be detailed so that the results are reproducible. For example have the genes been identified within a particular distance of the insertion sites. Why the authors have mapped the integration sites for 8 types of HPVs collectively and not HPV-16 and 18 alone which are the high risk HPV. Is there any basis for it? The authors have stated that a total of 2028 miRNA binding sites of which 432 were detected in miRBase. In my opinion the analysis should have been restricted to only these sites as they are experimentally identified sites for miRNA binding. As I understand the authors have mapped 42 miRNAs on Latin American genome. It is not clear how 42 miRNAs were selected for this subsequent step. Minor comments: In the supplementary data the headings of the tables should be in English. Are there 578 or 568 integration sites. It appears from Dataset 2 that there are 568 integration sites. Sheet named "VPH integration sites" Page 4 (last 2 lines) instead of 12 it should be 13. As per the data in figure 3 there are 13 genes in the intermediate category. Methods in Abstract: miRNA sequences associated with CC ……were obtained from miRBase. Shouldn’t it be literature?
