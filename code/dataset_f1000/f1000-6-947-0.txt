This is an interesting case report of an unusual variant of cutaneous leishmaniasis. It is infrequently reported and therefore worth recording. I'm not sure that these lesions resemble plane warts - they are certainly flattish but the lateral borders appear slightly curved. I would call them large flat topped papules instead.
