I read the case report. The differential diagnosis of lupoid cutaneous leishmaniasis is difficult and may depend on the detection of a few Leishmania amastigotes in the histologic sections. The case provided will most likely be highly favorable for management of this disease in Turkey. I think this case report is appropriate for publication and will contribute to the literature.
