I evaluated the case report entitled ‘Lupoid cutaneous leishmaniasis mimicking verruca plana’. Leishmania is currently endemic in 102 countries, areas or territories worldwide and 2 million new cases are recorded annually 1 . This sentence can be added at the introduction of the article. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is still considered an important health issue in many parts of the world. Lupoid CL is a very rare form of CL. The lupoid CL mimicking the verruca plana may lead to delay in the diagnosis. It is thought that the very rare case will contribute to the literature. This case report is appropriate for publication.
