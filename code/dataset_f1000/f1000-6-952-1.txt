This paper provides a comprehensive description of the ELIXIR-UK training activities and plans, though it was unclear whether the aim was to focus on ELIXIR-UK or ELIXIR overall, as the focus changed between these in the paper. It describes a well thought out process for evaluating training needs and attempting to address these. Challenges and future plans are discussed, and the issue of funding is raised repeatedly. The paper is interesting and useful, though I have a few minor concerns raised below. The paper is quite long and I think some fine details could be removed, as the reader would not necessarily be interested in every name of who did what. The continual reference to funding issues is a bit annoying for the reader, these could be discussed once off in a section under challenges. On page 6 there is mention that it is unclear how impact assessment would be supported after the grant ends, but if there is funding for training then it is not much extra overhead to assess the courses. Personal interviews would not be necessary for every course if resources are limited. Page 7 - mention of working with BD2K on developing core competencies, is the group also working with the ISCB core competency group? Is the BD2K portal not called ERuDIte now, rather than BigDataU? Page 8 line 2: "...ND2K TCC were discussed in the upcoming.." doesn't make sense. The meeting has now already taken place. Note, the USA was of course also involved among the countries listed. For long term sustainability and addressing the demands, there could perhaps be a stronger focus on training trainers, and potentially live streaming some courses to cover a wider audience.
