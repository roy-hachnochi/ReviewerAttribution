Data processing and normalization are critical in large-scale metabolomics studies. Different choice tends to have a significant impact on the downstream analysis. It is well-known that optimal normalization is study-specific, as most normalization methods have been developed with certain data distributions in mind. However, research on this issue is challenging due to the lack of well-accepted benchmark metabolomics datasets and evaluation criteria. Common approaches include using simulated data in combination with a well-studied data, or using multiple datasets in order to generate a less biased conclusion. In this paper, the authors reported their experience using 5 different normalization methods on an epidemiological metabolomics dataset generated from GC-MS. Therefore, the conclusion may not be directly applicable to data from other platforms such as LC-MS or NMR. Nevertheless, the authors described the pitfalls and challenges in processing such data, and shared their insights which may be useful for other researchers under similar experimental setup. My comments are on two aspects: 1) Although I have no problem understanding the content, I think the authors need to invest more time and efforts improving the readability of the paper. I have noticed many grammar issues. Almost all sentences in the Background section in Abstract needs to be carefully checked. Figures: Figure 2 - Including result based on raw data will be very helpful; Figure 3 legend - mPCA or msPCA? Figure 4 legend - "are under the curve" == area? 2) Some normalization methods are rather complementary. For instance, some adjust technical variations and some for biological variations. It will be interesting to test whether combining two different normalization methods will give better results.
