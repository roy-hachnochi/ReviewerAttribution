The authors investigated five different representative methods and examined the performance of these methods against each other in an epidemiological study of gestational diabetes using plasma. Normalization is an important step in the analysis of metabolomics data, and hence, evaluating different normalization methods is of great importance. However, I have some comments, which are summarized below. Comment 1: Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are also the most commonly applied tools to achieve metabolomics studies. The authors should discuss what renders GC-MS datasets different from LC-MS or different from NMR. Comment 2: Normalization is an important step in the analysis of metabolomics data and a variety of normalization methods have been developed for addressing the complex datasets generated. But their performances vary greatly and depend heavily on the nature of the studied data. Hence, how to choose the most appropriate method can be challenging for those without a background in bioinformatics. The recent published paper referred to identifying the well performed normalization method by taking multiple criteria into consideration ( Nucleic Acids Res , 45(W1): W162-W170 (2017)). So, just to clarify the reader should be alerted when to use any of the best performing methods, plus should be alerted when not to use them. Comment 3: Sparsity of data: in many cases metabolomics datasets contain zero values. Discuss in the manuscript how zero values affect the normalization and the relevant sections referred in the paper ( Sci Rep , 6:38881 (2016)) could be discussion points.
