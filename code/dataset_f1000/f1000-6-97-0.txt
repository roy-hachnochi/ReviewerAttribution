The authors have addressed my concerns. I only have few minor comments: There is a repetition in the last part of the introduction (The package connects to the web site...) In the text you mention the 'package website'. If I understand well, this is actually the package repository on GitHub, right? Just make that clearer in the text. R CMD check shows that there is a mismatch between documentation and code for function queryRegulome(), please fix argument 'timeout' (default value in Code: 100 while in Docs: 10) Many thanks to the author for their hard work on this revision.
