The authors describe an R package named haploR for querying the HaploReg and ReglomeDB web-based databases. Because querying can be carried out in R , haploR adds convenience for querying these databases when subsequent downstream analyses in R are desired. The R package is easy to use and works as described. However, the potential application of haploR is only vaguely described. The authors should include concrete examples of downstream analyses in order to demonstrate when haploR would be preferred to traditional queries executed from the web. In addition, addressing the following items would add clarity to the manuscript and the tool: The authors should describe when the results returned by haploR differ from the web-based results. For example, whereas the results table from querying HaploReg on the web may indicate that a particular variant has "4 altered motifs", providing links to the variant entry where the motifs are listed, haploR directly returns the motifs present. This is an advantage of haploR that should be described. There are several spelling and grammatical errors which make the manuscript difficult to follow in some parts. For example, the Introduction states that "Large projects...are devoted to bring together", instead of "bringing together".
