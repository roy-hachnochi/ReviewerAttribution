I thank the authors for carefully considering my comments and revising accordingly. I have a few major comments that still remain to be addressed: 1) I believe the manuscript needs at least a few convincing examples to show that it does the right thing in terms of providing recommendations to users. I don't see how the yeast datasets used currently serve this purpose. 2) I do not see how the simulation used is going to be appropriate for the diversity of users that this app hopes to cater. How will a user know that the recommendations from the app are not appropriate for their system? 3) The relative abundance of a transcript is indeed a critical parameter that determines how easily it can be picked up as being differentially abundant. Ignoring this aspect is likely to give a misleading impression to a user.
