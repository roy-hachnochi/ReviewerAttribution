This review examines a specific question of whether general or neuraxial anaesthesia for fractured hip surgery affects 30 day mortality. The paper is well written with appropriate methods and analysis. The deficiency of the paper is that it only addresses 30-day mortality and not any metric of quality of survival and quality of recovery. However, these variables may not be available in the SPOR. The data source is not open, but can be obtained with permission from the Swedish Perioperative Registry. Add to the narrative review The study identifies that the majority of fractured hip surgery is performed under spinal anaesthesia in Sweden. Only around 20% of patients undergo general anaesthesia. This could introduce bias. However, the groups appear well matched and the sample size remains large enough for meaningful comparisons. Propensity matching would have increased the fidelity of comparisons but was not performed. The research adds to the current literature identifying that there is no difference in mortality according to the type of anaesthetic administered.
