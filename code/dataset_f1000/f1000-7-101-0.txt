The article would benefit from the inclusion of definition and context for health information technology. For example, by HIT, does the author describe full EMR implementations, which are quite complex, versus other HIT tools? Is the proposed framework suitable and needed to all forms of HIT efforts? Second, the author briefly describes other methodologies at the end of the paper. It would be helpful to consider a few other methods in a bit more detail to compare and contrast the potential of the proposed/modified UTAUT approach. Lastly, the piece could benefit from examples of the proposed recommendations, even if hypothetical, that would provide some practical grounding and understanding of the proposed enhancements to the UTAUT framework.
