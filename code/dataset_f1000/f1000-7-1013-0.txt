This retrospective study demonstrates outcomes after in-hospital cardiac arrest as abstracted from a Swedish cardiac arrest registry. This study demonstrates a significant number of non-shockable initial arrest patients with a good neurological outcome, particularly those in PEA. To make this study more robust, it is essential to clarify the code response team, both personnel and process, as well as to ensure consistent definition of cardiac arrest, which in the study was defined as “CPR was initiated”, which needs more clarification (i.e., chest compressions initiated). Finally, there are multiple studies demonstrating similar positive results after in-hospital cardiac arrest. This study represents another study demonstrating the importance of resisting premature prognostication after in-hospital cardiac arrest, regardless of initial rhythm, as many survive with meaningful neurological recovery.
