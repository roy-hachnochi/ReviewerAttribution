As outlined in previous reviews of this m/s there is no laboratory evidence that this patient had chronic hepatitis or chronic hepatitis B infection. He was diagnosed with HBV infection only 1 month prior to the investigation described in the manuscript. At the end of the introduction the authors state the virus was obtained from "A patient having HBV infection for a long time". There is no evidence presented for this, he was only diagnosed 1 month prior to investigation. In results and discussion, paragraph 2, we are told "the patient was diagnosed with chronic HBV infection" there then follows an attempt to justify this statement.:- he had minor surgery a few years back, his brother was diagnosed with HBV a few years ago . This is circumstantial rather than clear proof that this patient had chronic hepatitis. It appears that without retesting the patient more than 6 months after initial diagnosis, there is no way that this patient can be said to have chronic hepatitis or chronic HBV infection. Introduction 2nd paragraph " In Bangladesh, there is scarce of complete genome sequence of HBV chronic strain of sub-genotype C2" might be better expressed as ' In Bangladesh there is a lack of complete genome sequences of HBV sub-genotyoe C ' - as outlined above, there appears to be no concrete evidence that the strain of HBV analysed in this paper caused chronic hepatitis.
