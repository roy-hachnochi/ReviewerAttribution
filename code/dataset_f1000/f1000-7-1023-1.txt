The reporting of a sequence analysis of complete genome of subgenotype C2 of hepatitis B virus is new in Bangladesh perspective. The article as ‘research note’ is quite acceptable. But, regarding the ‘chronic status’ of patient, it may be changed at all portion of the article except in ‘results and discussion’ part where it may be kept as a possibility of being chronic (because ‘history of minor surgery few years back and brother was positive for HBV years ago’). The chronic status of the patient was not established by serological evidence (e.g. HBsAg positivity 6 months back).The change of ‘chronic’ status starts from title- where ‘from a patient with uncomplicated chronicity’ may be changed to ‘HBV infected patient’ In the abstract, ‘a patient with chronic HBV infection’ may be changed to ‘HBV infected patient’ and from ‘to identify potential therapies against chronic HBV infections’ ‘chronic’ word may be omitted. In the introduction part- ‘Most of the HBV cases are chronic, …. hepatocellular carcinoma’ is misleading. It needs rewriting as ‘Most chronic HBV cases have a high possibility causing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma’. In last line, ‘from a patient with chronic HBV infection carrying the virus for a long time’ may be replaced by ‘from a patient having HBV infection’. In the methods part- ‘The infected patient……..determined by USG. The Patient was diagnosed with chronic HBV infection, suggested by presence of the presence of ascitis…..high viral load in the plasma.’ These two lines need rewriting, mentioning the possibility of being chronic. But, again lack of serological evidence needs to be mentioned.
