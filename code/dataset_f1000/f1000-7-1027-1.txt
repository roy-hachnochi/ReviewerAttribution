The DNA damage response involves the setting of specific chromatin marks that are important to recruit or maintain DNA repair factors at the damage site. One such mark is H4K20me2, which has been linked to doublestrand break repair (DSB repair) (Fradet-Turcotte 2013 1 ) and more recently to nucleotide excision repair (NER) (Chitale et al 2018 2 ). H4K20me2 is read by 53BP1 or Crb1, respectivley, which bridges the interaction with other DNA repair proteins thereby playing an essential role in chromatin signaling events at the damage site. Telomeres can be considered specialized DSBs in that they suppress the DNA damage checkpoint activation. One potential mechanism to explain this phenomenon was put forward by Carneiro and colleagues 3 . In their research paper it was reported that 53BP1 (Crb2) and H4K20me2 do not locate to telomeres, which would partially explain why the DNA damage checkpoint activation was suppressed. However, this exciting finding was never recapitulated by other research groups. Here, Audry and colleagues carefully reassessed the occurence of H4K20me2 at telomeres. To this end H4K20 mutant S. pombe strains were generated and most of the comercially available antibodies specifically recognizing the H4K20me2 mark were tested. Importantly, the authors found an antibody that shows the desired specificity when probing it against recombinant proteins and protein extracts from mutant strains. Employing this highly specific antibody in ChIP experiments they can unequivocally show that telomeres are decorated with H4K20me2, even in taz1 knockout cells, which is in stark contrast to the previous findings by Carneiro and colleagues. Thus, the findings presented here refute the idea that the DNA damage checkpoint is suppressed by exclusion of H4K20me2. This important finding will create a profound repercussion for the research field of genome stability as it shows that the mechanisms for checkpoint suppression at telomers have yet to be uncovered.
