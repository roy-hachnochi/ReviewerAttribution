 General Comments: The authors have investigated the oxidative potential of POA and SOA from two different sources namely alpha-pinene and gasoline engine exhaust. The experimental setup included an UV chamber (oxidation flow reactor), to mimic the sun light’s UV rays, to compare primary and secondary organic aerosol-induced radical generation under light and in dark. The comparison could contribute great value to the manuscript if additional parameters as listed below are included in it: Page 3: Right column: Line 4: The authors can address why they have selected only Hydroxyl radicals in the investigations. In some experiments, where UV rays are used to excite the organic aerosols, the elicitation of superoxide radicals is also possible. Page 3: Right column: Lines 28-30: The statement “aerosol stream was sampled while a UV lamp was on, following a 90-minute reaction period.” is not clear. Does that mean the whole sample streaming is done for a continuous 90 minutes? Was it the same for the aerosol sampling done in dark OFR? Page 3: Right column: Line 33: The information of the control sample needs to be included here. Page 4: Left column: Line 23: The analysis part has some information missing such as incubation time for cell growth, and are the same generation (life cycle) used for analysis? Page 4: Left column: Line 25: The cell exposure study has some basic information missing - PM dose, route of exposure (directly on filters or on PM extracts), number of times analysed (duplicate or triplicate). Please include for clarity. Page 5: Figure 4: The biogenic organic compounds (for example: the alpha-pinene) are believed to be more hydrophilic compared to engine exhaust organics. Please include a discussion if the water solubility of samples is also driving the difference in oxidative stress.
