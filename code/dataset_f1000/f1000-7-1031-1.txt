The work of Lovett et al. presents interesting data on the possible inflammatory effects of SOA from traffic as well as biogenic (pinene) origin. The method setup is well designed, although the variables, such as conditions of relative humidity and temperature, could have been studied in different values. On the other hand, the results show that the biogenic SOA have similar high inflammatory effect in the test compared to traffic SOA, which is an important fact, and indicates that effects have been observed in real-world data. However, the study could have been more complete and higher quality if the researchers would have made an effort to detect and quantify the molecular chemical compounds that are present in the SOA fractions. The work is suitable for indexing.
