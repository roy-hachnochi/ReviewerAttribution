I am very interested in this report. This article was well written without any over discussion. Although the roles of GSK-3beta on neurological disease were well investigated for long time, that was not fully resolved at this time. Authors indicated the possibility that GSK-3beta modified the state of neurological disease through the regulation of Nfr2. In this regard, however, authors only mentioned Alzheimer's disease and ischemia among neurological diseases. I hope that they discussed the roles of GSK-3beta through the regulation of Nfr2 in other neurological disease.
