This is in interesting short opinion piece about RWD. I worry that it exhibits the kind of unbridled enthusiasm that I fear ultimately undermines efforts to appropriately incorporate RWD into healthcare decision making. There are real limitations to RWD studies and the authors should acknowledge these. See, for example, many of Ioannidis’s papers or Madigan, D., et al. (2013) 1 . The CPRD is not a particularly good example since the data are available to researchers under severe restrictions, e.g., “A dataset may only be used for the study for which it has been approved.” As I understand it, Sentinel queries require multi-week/month turnaround times. The notion that an observational study could have uncovered the rosiglitazone problem early is speculative. The section on privacy concerns pays lip service to some really complex issues. These data are de-identified in superficial ways and identification of specific individuals is entirely possible. The implications for health insurance, employment, etc. are highly complex. The paper should discuss common data models. Shared data with idiosyncratic data models are of somewhat limited value. In a similar vein, the article should discuss OHDSI.
