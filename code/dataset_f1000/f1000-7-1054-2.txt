I would suggest adding commentary on the reproducibility of RWD studies by better sharing of code and data. Those practitioners of RWD are all aware of the intricate nuances that lead to variable definitions and sharing of these may enable better reproducibility. Perhaps the better use of technology to better develop transparency and reproducibility would be beneficial in these areas, leading the clinical trial setting 1 . The importance of RWD is a combination of the potential regulatory use within the context of the 21st Century Cures act, being able to reinforce clinical decision making with information at the patient bedside and to also support policy making decisions. Having been part of the team on the weekend mortality paper, this analysis was less influential but more supportive to larger initiatives at hand. I would also support that with the outputs from international disease registries in oncology which highlight how poor/late presentation of cancer within the UK system leads to the significant gap in cancer outcomes and led to better public health initiatives around recognising symptoms of cancer 2 .
