In this correspondence, Wideman et al. comment on a recent seminal study by Hirabayashi et al. , which describes the biochemical characterization of the SMP domain-containing protein PDZD8, as an ER-mitochondria tether important for the regulation of Ca 2+ dynamics in mammalian neurons. Although the functional data presented by Hirabayashi et al. is sound and of great interest, their interpretation of the homologous relationship between PDZD8 and the yeast SMP domain-containing protein Mmm1 is incorrect. Mmm1 is part of the ERMES complex, which tethers the ER to mitochondria in yeast and is important for the exchange of phospholipids between these organelles. This complex contains two further proteins of the SMP family, Mdm12 and Mdm34. Wideman et al. 1 and we 2 have previously shown that some eukaryotes contain all three of these ERMES proteins as well as PDZD8, indicating that they are paralogs. Hirabayashi et al. , however, misinterpret PDZD8 to be a functional ortholog of yeast Mmm1, and substantiate this relationship experimentally by substituting the SMP domain of yeast Mmm1 with that of PDZD8 to rescue the phenotypic defects caused by the deletion of Mmm1. Here, Wideman et al. present convincing data to show that PDZD8 is a paralog of Mmm1 and not its ortholog. The arguments presented by Wideman et al. are sound and will help to clear the confusion regarding the evolutionary relationship between these proteins. Minor comment: The human PDZD8 protein contains a C1 domain as well as a coiled-coil segment at its C-terminal end. Do other orthologs also contain these domains? If so, the domain composition of PDZD8 shown in Fig. 2 should be updated to show this. Also, HHpred searches suggest that the PDZ domain in human PDZD8 is inserted into the C2 domain; is this the case for other orthologs too?
