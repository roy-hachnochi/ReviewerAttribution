The authors develop a computational approach to assess the volume of the stomach tumor. The tumor volume is assessed from multi-slice computerized tomography images of patients with type 2 cancer. First, the approach automatically detects the morphopatological shape of adenocarcinoma of the stomach. In this sense, an image enhancement technique to correct non homogeneities in the image's background is initially considered. After, a regions growing based technique is used to segment the pathology structure. Then, the segmented structure is reconstructed using a marching cubes based algorithm implemented with Toolkit VTK-6.3.0. The proposed method is well explained. The validation of the proposed approach is performed based on Dice coefficient. The segmented structures are compared with respect to the cancer shapes delineated by the clinician by means this coefficient. From this comparison the authors reported that their computational approach generated high Dice score values, and therefore, low error values.
