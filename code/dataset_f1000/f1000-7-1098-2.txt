Authors propose a method to asses a stomach tumor volume. They use multi-slice computerized tomography images that present a cancer of type 2. The method include three steps: first, an image enhancement to correct non homogenities in the background.The enhancement is based on the LUT. Then, the segmentation is carried out by the region growing technique widelly used in segmentation problems. Finally, a reconstruction is made using the Toolkit VTK-6.3.0. The validation use the Dice coefficient to compare to the clinical manual segmentation. The method is well explained, however more detail would be suitable to the enhancement algorithm that seems the core of the paper. In paticular, in the Equation of Flevel the index j is well used afeter the sum? More details would be benefics to understand the method. In the segmentation method there are some parameters to tune? If it is the case it is suitable to add in the text.
