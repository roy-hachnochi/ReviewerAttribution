The paper describes a protein annotation visualization tool for R/Bioconductor that has already been in use for more than a year. The software is mature, I was able to install it easily, all the examples of code in the manuscript are functional. I only noticed a small deviation in the biomaRt example, most likely caused by slightly different data returned by biomaRt. The manuscripts describes the purpose and functioning of the package in sufficient detail. However, I found the introduction a bit too brief, especially in terms of mentioning other similar software and advantages of drawProteins. For example, I found a Bioconductor package called Pviz that may be able to generate protein annotation visualizations. As a minor remark, the last sentence in this paragraph on page 3 seems unclear to me: "The feature_to_dataframe() function will also add an “order” value to allow plotting. The order goes from the bottom in the manner of a graph." Finally, a suggestion. The software would be even more useful if it could handle reading and writing of standard protein annotation files in GFF or similar format. UniProt wikipedia page describes how it is applied to proteins in this example: https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0A7B8.gff Although GFF is much more popular with genomic data, it seems to be ocassionally used for annotating protein sequences.
