This is a brief review of the literature pertaining to Tourette Syndrome in 2017. This review appears to include the main studies from 2017, summarizing them accurately. They provide a conclusion section that highlights what the authors believe are the most important themes in research for 2017 and important areas to investigate for 2018. Overall, I feel that this is a nice way for researchers in the field to quickly come up to speed with what is being done in TS research, and a good collection of references for closer review.
