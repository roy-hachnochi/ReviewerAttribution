Molinari et al. present a well written and clear description of the methodology required to image the transient developmental zebrafish organelle, Kupffer's Vesicle (KV). Overall, they clearly show KV development using light microscopy and a confocal image of cilia in KV stained using acetylated-alpha tubulin. Their method will definitely facilitate research to study the structure of KV and its cilia. They provide useful tips on how to overcome practical challenges. However it would be informative to include information on how to measure cilia length (for example software used) and how to calculate KV volume. Similarly, additional methodological information will have to be added relating to studying the "function of KV", perhaps using live confocal imaging to study cilia motility, or this comment amended. Minor points, which would help the reader: I suggest delete "easy" in the Methods section on "Fixing for KV imaging" as this relatively contradicts the challenge of imaging KV which you describe in the introduction. Consider including a magnified image of the white arrowed area of the lateral views in Figure 2. Add information on how you identified the location of KV from the bright field image in Figure 3B. In the notes section, add the number of KV you advise mounting on each slide for imaging. Finally in the discussion, add some references to support your statements:"Nearly all new cilioopathy syndromes,,," and "genetic therapies and pharmacological agents" (the time window to do this will be relatively short). Overall an informative methodological article for the zebrafish research community.
