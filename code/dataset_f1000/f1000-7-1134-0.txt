First of all, please allow me to congratulate the authors for attempting to undertake this project which I found very interesting and of valuable additional knowledge. The manuscript itself is well-written and well-structured and I have to also commend the authors for this matter. However, I may require some clarifications on the following issues: What would be the arguments of dividing into the 3 groups as well as using such media treatment for each group (GSPC, + and - groups). This would be beneficial for readers to replicate in future use. What would be the reason for determining the evaluation of osteogenic differentiation on Day 7, 14 and 21 cell groups? At the end of that sentence, there was a quote of another work. However, I think it would make this manuscript even clearer if this could be briefly mentioned.
