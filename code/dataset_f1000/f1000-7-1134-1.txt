The authors of this study have investigated the role of GSPCs cultured in PRF in increasing the CBF-α1/Sox9 expression ratio during osteogenic differentiation. Based on the study results, the authors have concluded that the GSPCs cultured in PRF increased CBF-α1/Sox9 expression on Day 7. The results are certainly interesting and the authors are commended for executing this study. However, the authors need to address the following minor concerns: General : Paper is well organized and easy to follow. Novelty is sufficient and high impact. To improve the readability, It is recommended that the text is checked by a native English speaking person as many of the sentences might be misunderstood. I suggest a revision of the English grammar structures by an expert editor in revising manuscripts. Introduction : The authors have mentioned “Furthermore, a second objective was …”, however, I didn’t find the first objective. Please change this section The Introduction section is too long, you can try to simplify this section (please move some of the key mechanism of the materials in enhancing CBF-α1/Sox9 expression in the discussion part Results: Please provide and add some information about standard deviation of the data in the diagrams. Please indicate whether the difference is significant or not in your graph/ diagrams as well, using some symbols (asteric). Discussion : Discussion of the results is quite comprehensive. In analyzing the results, the authors also show citations from the previous study to support the explanation of these results. The answer to the hypothesis of this study should be included at the beginning of the discussion section. Please mention the limitation of this study in the discussion section for References : The supporting references are too long for the medium article
