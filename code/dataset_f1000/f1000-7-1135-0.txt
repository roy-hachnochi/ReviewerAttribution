Manuscript deals with the characterizarion of Pseudomonas clinical isolates by PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Only twenty isolates were used for sequence comparison, and actualy only five sequences are compared by BLAST and deposited on Genbank DATABASE. Authors claim that sequencing of 16S rRNA gene is useful for Pseudomonas identification, but this fact has been shown in hundred of papers. It is not a novelty. Moreover, no other molecular analysis is done with the isolates, as for example, identification of resistance mechanisms. In addition, isolates were already identified as Psedomonas aeruginosa by biochemical methods. A more useful analysis would be to take the full number of isolates and without previous identification, characterize them as P. aeruginosa.
