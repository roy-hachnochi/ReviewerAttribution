The authors have thoroughly addressed my comments. Based on the new revised results, I have the following minor comment: - The authors note that "We found substantial differences in the performance, run time and stability between the methods, with SC3 and Seurat showing the most favorable results." Please clarify what metric(s) you are using to assess "most favorable results" ie. "most favorable results in terms of overall accuracy in cell-type identification", "in terms of run time", "in terms of stability", etc. Based on your new Supplemental Figure 9, it seems that SC3 would not be favorable in terms of runtime/scalability. With this minor comment addressed, I find this article now suitable for indexing in F1000 and look forward to the authors' future follow-up work.
