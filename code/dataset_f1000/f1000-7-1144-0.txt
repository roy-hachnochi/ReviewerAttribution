This report brings machine learning approaches to the classification of patterns of viral control in HIV infected individuals. This is welcome because, although this is a mature field in HIV, it signals the opportunity for new models in this and in other infections. Strengths : very well developed models and excellent reporting of the results through figures and documentation. The code and datasets are available in Github. Weakness : the model is trained and implemented on a suboptimal dataset. Treatment response in HIV infection (and thus the modeling of viral response) is well understood and best modeled with the knowledge of the time of treatment initiation, and a full understanding of variable influencing treatment response. Having a cohort that is described solely by “time from first measured viral load” is to all purposes, suboptimal. An additional issue is the reliance of a limited number of viral load determinations for an unclear number of individuals. Depending on the circumstances of sampling, having three viral load over an undisclosed time period is note devoid of many uncontrolled biases. Lastly, the text is equivocal in the utilization of the last time point – the reviewer understands that the information contained in the last point may be weighted because of the possibility that it is noisy. Unfortunately, in real life, that is the moment where strong predictive models are needed. It is possible that this was actually the goal of the authors. Summary : this work is a valuable contribution to the field, and the basic concepts and models will hopefully be deployed in the study of datasets that are more appropriate for this exercise. It is desirable that future modeling includes a more ambitious plan to move from the current train-test approach to one that establishes the generalization of the model. It will also be critical to observe the predictive value of the model on longer term outcomes.
