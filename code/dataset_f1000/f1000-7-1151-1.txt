The article entitled ‘ Extraction, purification, and activity of protease from the leaves of Moringa oleifera ’ by Banik et al. appears to be an interesting topic related to purification of protease from an economically and medicinally important plant species Moringa oleifera . Overall, the manuscript is well composed, the background and objectives of the study has been mentioned clearly and also justified. The introduction part also appropriately reviews some of the relevant information. The results are sound and explained properly and supported with further explanation in the Discussion part. Therefore, in summary, I’m recommending acceptance and publication of this article. However, for future research interest, the introduction section could have been more extensive, indicating relevant information from recent past and current studies for getting meaningful insight into the background of this research as well as the lacunae which motivated to set the objectives for carrying out this study. The methods part is quite sufficient. However, for the purification part, describing the isolation of the indicated protease activity from Moringa leaf extracts may be more extensive and apart from Coomassie blue staining, quality of purification may be assessed by silver staining procedure to compare the results and enrichment of purification after the column chromatographic techniques. Finally, a discussion section may be included to compare and discuss the findings in light of the related research. In concluding note, application and future research possibilities using the gained knowledge and information may be mentioned.
