In the introduction, 3 rd paragraph: “… HypoKPP and hyperthyroidism due to Hashimoto…" is written instead of “hypothyroidism”. In the same paragraph: “This combination is rare and previously has only been reported in women”. Such a combination has been reported at least once previously in 2017 1 . Since I am one coauthor of this paper, I am not sure whether I can insist that this should be quoted. In the Case report section 2 nd paragraph: It would have been preferable to mention the hypokalemia first and then mention secondary investigations such as thyroid profile and magnesium/calcium. The TSH of 5.5 is normal for many labs. If it was slightly higher than your lab limits, it would be preferable to label it subclinical hypothyroidism, since TSH is 10. Family history of thyroid disease or other autoimmune diseases can be mentioned. Also, did the patient have a goitre? Did the ECG also show low voltage complexes or bradycardia suggestive of hypothyroidism? It is not mentioned whether he was treated with bicarbonate supplements on an outpatient basis when a diagnosis of RTA was made. Was TTKG considered if the facilities for urine osmolality were available? In Table 1: Magnesium appears low in the table, but in page4/7 last paragraph, it is mentioned that the patient did not have hypomagnesemia and hence Gitelman was not considered. It is also mentioned that Gitelman will have elevated K levels which is untrue. Since the patient had high urine K loss and hypomagnesemia, Gitleman was considered except that ABG showed metabolic acidosis.
