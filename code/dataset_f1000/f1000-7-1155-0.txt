 Overview The authors characterised PVL phenotypically and also investigate the presence of gene coding for PVL production, antibiotic susceptibility and agr production. The study is interesting as it goes further from detection of PVL gene to semi quantify the product . Introduction Line 3, remove first `and` or recast in ``such as pneumonia and skin and soft tissue infections`` Spa typing is not part of the stated objectives. Method Characterization of isolates ``In this study we made use of an already existing database which has been published 6 .`` It should be clearly stated the data used from the referenced study above. The Method section should be rewritten so that all previously described method in Ayepola et al (2015) should not be rewritten in the present article but only referred to. Results and discussion It will be interesting to also expatiate on the proportion of isolates that are PVL positive molecularly and phenotypically i.e. the isolates with the genes and also producing PVL and those with the genes without PVL. Spa typing reported in this study should be discussed too in relation to its epidemiological significance.
