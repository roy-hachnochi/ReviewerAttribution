 Abstract needs rewriting with focus on role of hospital infection control committee (HICC), if existing in hospital. How HICC has helped or not or will help in near future in preventing such infections in burn unit. Name of organism in abstract: staphylococcus typhi? No such organism exists either it is staphylococcus aureus or salmonella typhi . There are many grammatical errors throughout the manuscript and very long sentences needs revision. Study is not useful if you do not involve hospital infection practices and corrective action. Is there an antibiotic policy in the hospital? If yes, are they drawing data to take care of antibiotic resistance? Are microbiologist active? Could be mentioned as corrective action in discussion or as it is suitable. Role of hospital infection control committee? What disinfectants were used? Why they did not go for anaerobic culture? Inclusion criteria of study needs redefining. Why patients above 60 were not chosen - justification needed, is it due to weak immunity or no such patient was admitted during study time?
