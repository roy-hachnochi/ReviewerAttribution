 Considering the intense method developments in time-course microarray data analysis, the authors should include a more rigorous literature review in background section supporting their claim about the existence of no pathway-based feature selection method. As the proposed method is selecting both significant genes and significant time-points, the authors should explain “feature selection” in introduction in order to clarify the study objectives for the reader. In method description, the authors should describe how they calculated p-value and explain the corresponding permutation procedure in each of the steps. This method is able to detect the genes with different “levels” of expression over time and it fails to detect differential temporal patterns of gene expressions. The figure 3 also shows that the significant genes are different in expression levels and similar in temporal patterns. This limitation should be discussed by the authors. How the method performs when one gene expression is a noisy realisation of the other one? Does the method fail to detect the similarity of these two expression trajectories? If yes, please discuss. More specifically, if xbar(D)=xbar(C)+E and mean(E)=0; then xbar(D) is a noisy realisation of xbar(C) and the test should fail to reject the null hypothesis. However, by this method, we may get very large statistic and reject the null hypothesis. In the second step, the proposed method treats time as quantitative variable and disregards the temporal order of measurements. According to the authors: “each gene’s expression profile over time was viewed as a gene-set”. What limitations will this feature impose to the analysis?
