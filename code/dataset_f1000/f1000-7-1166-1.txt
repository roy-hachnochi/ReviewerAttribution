This study proposes to use a two-level SAMGSR method for feature selection in longitudinal microarray data analysis. The idea of considering the over-time expressions of a gene as the expressions of genes in a gene set is quite interesting. The following are a few concerns that can be further clarified in the revised version of this paper. The longitudinal SAMGSR model, which has not been published before, was only briefly introduced. Since it has not been published, I would suggest to formally introduce the longitudinal model and include it as an alternative option in this paper. Data normalization is considered an important step in high throughput data analysis. It would great to provide a brief description. The t-like statistic is used in SAMGSR, and the focus of this paper is microarray data. I am wondering if it is possible to have a very brief discussion on the feasibility of applying the proposed method to RNA-seq data after certain data transformation, e.g., “voom” normalization. The inserted texts in Figure 1 do not seem to be consistent in size and font. Please provide the link (and last access date) to the online Venn-diagram plot tool. The first sentence in the abstract and introduction sections are identical. I would suggest making some minor modifications, e.g., using a more concise version in the abstract.
