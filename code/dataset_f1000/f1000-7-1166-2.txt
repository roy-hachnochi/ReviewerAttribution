In this paper, authors intend to propose an extension of a pathway analysis method, SAMGSR, for longitudinal gene expression data. Both real data analysis and computer simulations are used to compare the modified method with the existing methods, which demonstrates some benefits of the proposed method. The proposed method is interesting, although the novelty is limited. Some other detailed comments and concerns are: More explanation on “a gene’s expression profiles over time can be considered as a gene set”. Right top on Page 2: When the SAMGSR is used for the first time, the reference should be provided. Bottom right on Page 2: The sample sizes (the number of patients) are inconsistent on two different paragraphs. English may need to be further polished.
