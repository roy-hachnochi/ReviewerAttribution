This is a case report of a complicated situation. An old lady with many chronic pulmonary problems was presented with what was considered at first as an ordinary lung infection complicating her COPD and/or bronciectasis. Despite antibiotic treatment her dyspnea was not improved despite improvement of inflammatory indices. This led to an additional work up, revealing the existence of an unsuspected cirrhosis with HPS. The presentation is informative, well written, the diagnosis of HPS is fairly well documented and the discussion is very informative on the differential diagnosis of HPS. My reservation is that the authors classify their patient as having severe HPS based on PaO2 measurements. Although they accept that the other confounding comorbidities may influence the results, the subsequent progress of the patient seem to condradict their conclusion. Severe HPS is not expected to lead to an uneventful course after treatment of the other comorbidities. I feel that this should be commented in the discussion.
