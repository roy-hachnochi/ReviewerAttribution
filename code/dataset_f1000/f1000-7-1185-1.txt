The paper from Ansaloni and co writers, touch on some crucial aspects of scientific divulgation. The first is about the quality of teaching: especially for young surgeons or others specialists the meetings are probably the first and most important instruments of updating. However, meanwhile some international meetings represents the masterpiece in their fields, many others give a less impact or appear redundant with a lower quality. Having a standardized method to rank the meetings you can address young to achieve the best quality information avoiding waste of money and time. On the other hand a sort of scientific meeting ranking could help company to address their investments to the best offers of scientific training. Only a final consideration to take in account, the meeting ranking should consider that also local up to date meetings have still a value to improve the medical or scientific culture in the periphery because more accessible respect an international one. Could be reasonable to cure this aspect with a different standardised event classification, for example; international meetings, nationals, inter-study groups or up to date. In my opinion the paper is for sure worthy of publication and then open for discussion in the scientific arena.
