This paper reports a very rare occurrence of the spreading of periapical infection to a healthy primary molar root. The non-vital tooth causing the infection was treated endodontically without any intervention to the vital neighboring primary molar. After 8 months, arrest of the resorption was evident along with improved periapical healing. Minor comments: Please discuss the effect of coronal restoration on the prognosis of endodontic treatment. Please discuss the fate of extruded root canal medicament.
