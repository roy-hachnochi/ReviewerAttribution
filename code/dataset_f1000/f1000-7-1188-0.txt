In present study the authors share there preliminary experience with automated vascular mapping to identify sub-group of patient who are high-risk of developing post-operative vasospasm following aneurysmal surgery for spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. It will be beneficial if an evidence based algorithm can be generated and can be used to improve clinical outcomes. Although the article is well written, however the study includes a small number of patients; data were acquired retrospectively and does not include all consecutive cases. As authors have suggested transcranial Doppler study (TCD) at frequent interval can be used as a non-invasive tool to determine the velocity in the cerebral vessels and can be correlated with FLOW 800 studies. Additionally we need to determine the cost-effectiveness of the procedures particularly in settings where the resources are limited. To better understand the benefits of FLOW 800 we need a larger and long term experience.
