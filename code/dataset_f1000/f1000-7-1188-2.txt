Intra-operative Neurosurgical Armamentarium to deal with vasospasm development following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Authors reported utility of intra-operative FLOW 800 vascular map model with indigo cyanine [ICG] fluoroscopic angiographic images obtained with microscope with appropriate facility in predicting onset of clinical cerebral vasospasm during post-operative period and delayed cerebral ischemic deficit in a cohort of forty patients suffering with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and managed microsurgical clipping. Factors predicting risk of vasospasm onset included parameters obtained with FLOW 800 vascular map model like the difference in the absorption intensities and time lag. However, major disadvantages of the vascular map model include the cost factor as advanced microscope along with appropriate software is a pre-requisite, in addition to the availability of dye, and part of vessel evaluated is very limited to microscope field with direct line of-sight of target vessels but affected by obstructed microscope field by presence of blood clots and aneurysm clips. The anatomical factor of vessel and aneurysm can also impair image quality of atherosclerotic plaques, aneurysmal sac calcifications or thrombosis. Authors rightly advocated vascular model with ICG angiography can act as one of adjunct for aneurysm surgery in neurosurgical armamentarium besides vascular Doppler, endoscope, with capability of predicting vasospasm and appropriate measure can be applied right from intraoperative period like drainage of hematoma, installation of papavarin, Omaya reservoir and installation of papavarin in the post-operative period besides stellate ganglion block, and hemodynamic interventions can definitely aid in improving outcome. However, the size of the cohort sample was modest.
