This paper by Munkley and colleagues identifies in a comprehensive manner novel alternative mRNA isoforms regulated by androgens. Interestingly most isoforms result from a choice between alternative promoters, suggesting that regulation takes place mostly at the transcriptional level, but they identified also a few alternative cassette exons and 3' ends. They show experimental validation for 17 isoforms. Beside increasing the number of identified genes in the context of androgen-treated prostate cancer LNCaP cells, the authors analysed the expression of those new isoforms in a large cohort of prostate tumours. They found the expression of some of the mRNA isoforms is positively correlated in the androgen-treated cell and in cancer versus normal samples, and find further correlation with the tumour grade and stage for 3 alternative isoforms. Overall this is an interesting work that clearly deserves to be published, as it reveals new potentially interesting target genes for prostate cancer. I have only a couple of comments/questions that may help to improve the strength of the manuscript. Did the authors try to experimentally validate the regulation of alternative isoforms for the 3 most interesting genes, i.e. OSBPL1A , CLK3 and TSC22D3 , which is correlated to tumour stage ? As these new isoforms are predicted to alter the protein sequence, is it possible to discuss or predict what could be the impact of these modifications for these proteins, with regards to what is known about their function and/or in the context of prostate cancer? Looking at the RNA-seq profiles for the validated examples, it seems to me that in some cases, especially for RLN1 and RLN2, regulation of promoter choice correspond also to changes in the 3 end of the transcript (the peak seems to be shifted to the 3' end). Such examples may have escaped the in silico prediction, but can you make any comment on this ?
