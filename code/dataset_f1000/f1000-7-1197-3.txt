This report documents predominantly negative data by showing that NLRX1 does not seem to substantially alter the innate immune response during murine urinary tract infection. NLRX1 is a member of the Nod-like receptor family, which plays a role in mitochondrial activity and has mainly been implicated in negative regulation of anti-viral and TLR-triggered inflammation. The report is well written, all data are explained in sufficient detail and presented well. By comparing wild type and Nlrx1 -deficient mice that were infected with an uropathogenic strain of E.coli , the authors detected transient differences in the inflammatory response (chemokine) and bacterial clearance (bladder, early timepoint), without any consequence on later bacterial elimination (i.e. 48h) and progression towards pyelonephritis. Likewise, using whole blood assays (cytokine secretion and phagocytosis), NLRX1 did not confer any alterations in the inflammatory or phagocytic response to LPS or whole bacteria. The "conclusion sentence" of the article sounds somewhat stronger than the conclusions drawn and discussed in the entire manuscript (including the title): stating that “NLRX1 is important in attenuating the early bacterial burden in the bladder by enhancing the local pro-inflammatory cytokine response” exaggerates the fact that only MIP2 levels were reduced in Nlrx1 deficient bladders (without any consequence on MPO levels). I suggest rewording this sentence. Comment to source data: Dataset 3 and 4 are mixed up (therefore I checked “partly”). It seems that these experiments were only performed once, i.e. no replicate experiments. I suggest stating this in the methods, possibly also providing an explanation for this.
