This paper describes the ELIXIR Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure (AAI) which enables researchers to access ELIXIR services and resources using a single set of credentials. The authors start by presenting the requirements extracted from the analysis of the use cases that were collected during the design phase of the ELIXIR AAI. The different requirements are described in detail and cover aspects related to the ELIXIR identity and its attributes, the authorised access to data, the need for stepping up the authentication strength via multi-factor authentication and the interfacing with service providers based on standard technologies such as SAML and OpenID Connect. The authors then describe the key features of the ELIXIR AAI design that was driven from the analysed requirements. Following the presentation of the design, the paper discusses the set of policies pertaining to the end users, relying services and AAI operators. The paper also provides information related to the uptake of the ELIXIR AAI during its first two years of operation in production. The inclusion of links to the ELIXIR AAI documentation and the relevant software repositories is particularly useful for implementers/operators of AAI solutions for research collaboration.
