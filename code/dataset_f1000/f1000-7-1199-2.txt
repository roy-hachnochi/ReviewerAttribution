Given the broad, multinational applicability and utility of the ELIXIR AAI, this article is of high value, and I recommend its acceptance with some modifications. Regarding explanation of the "method," although Section 2 is titled "Requirements for ELIXIR AAI," which begins "This section presents the requirements that have driven the design of the ELIXIR AAI," in actuality, no "requirements" are articulated. Instead, the section describes the ELIXIR AAI system as implemented, so the reader is left to surmise what the "requirements" might be. Also, as described in section 2.1 and reinforced throughout, ELIXIR seems more akin to a broker of identities authenticated by multiple IdPs than an identity provider. With respect to providing sufficient detail to enable replication, without clearly articulated requirements, it would be difficult for anyone to replicate this implementation. For example, Section 2.3 (within the "Requirements" section begins by explaining that the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health is "promoting a tiered access to sensitive human data..." Does this mean that anyone attempting to replicate this work must join with GA4GH in promoting this access model? Regarding whether the "conclusions about the method and its performance adequately supported by the findings," this article does not present any conclusions or performance data.
