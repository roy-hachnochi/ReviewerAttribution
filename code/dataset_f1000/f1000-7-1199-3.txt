This is a well-written article giving a clear presentation of the ELIXIR infrastructure for researcher authentication and authorisation (AAI). The AAI service enables for a life science researcher to obtain an ELIXIR identity that can be used for getting access to restricted ELIXIR services. The authors describe the AAI service systematically and thoroughly, including the rationale behind and the initial requirements, the AAI design and the different components of the system, AAI policies, and examples of applications. Links to software repositories and appropriate references are provided. In conclusion, this is an excellent contribution to the F1000Research.
