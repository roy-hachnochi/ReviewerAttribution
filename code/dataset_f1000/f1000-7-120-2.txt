This is a relevant paper providing needed perspectives on interventions to reduce the harm caused by alcohol. It is presented as a review of reviews, but in fact it goes a bit beyond it, as the contents of table 1 are in themselves a valuable side-product. I think the paper is acceptable to be indexed in its current form, and may be useful to many practitioners.
