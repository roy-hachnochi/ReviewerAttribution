The study presents results of retrospective analysis conducted to estimate the overall prevalence of EBV infection and identify high risk groups among children. This study included 253 patients under 15 years of age positive for EBV DNA by PCR, were admitted to the Pediatrics Department in China during a 4-year period from 2014 to 2017. Patients were divided into three groups; 0-4years, 4-6years and 6-15years. The percentage and prevalence of EBV DNA-positive cases was calculated on that basis. The highest rate of EBV infection (74.7%) was observed in the group under 4 years of age, 11.06% and 14.22% in the 4-6 years and in the 6-15 years group, respectively. The authors mention increasing number of EBV-infected individuals in recent years. Noticing the highest number of cases in children between 6 month to 1 year. Certain limitations of the study were visible: The authors confirm EBV infection by PCR, however I could not find the information concerning the type of the specimen – blood, saliva, urine, anything else? Significant proportion of EBV infected patient may be asymptomatic; the term infection is not equivalent to the disease, therefore it is a pity that data concerning clinical symptoms are not mentioned. Minor comments: Citing articles are not equivalent to given numbers e.g –study conducted in Poland is given at the 25 positions in the list, not 18;
