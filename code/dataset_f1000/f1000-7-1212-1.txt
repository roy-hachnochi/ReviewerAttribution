There is a fundamental flaw in the research question - clinical competence improving academic performance. Clinical competence was improved, not necessarily academic performance. No other intervention was tested. It is not known whether this specific intervention improved competence specifically. We are left wondering, isn't any education on mental health nursing likely to improve competence? There seemed to be a number of assumptions made in the introduction. It seemed that the authors were mixing up clinical competency and critical thinking. This is obviously an international study. I would have liked to see an argument built around the deficits in nursing education in this country and why this tool was necessary.
