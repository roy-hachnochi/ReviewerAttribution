The studyâ€™s subject is one of the most important issues for mental health nursing in the world and especially in Iran and their authors clearly and accurately presented its background and rationales. The work is technically sound with sufficient details. It was better to have a brief history of used checklist due to varied competency indicators all over the world but this is not so serious. There are sufficient details of statistical analysis and the datasets are clearly described. Although there is a sufficient discussion included the necessary details but the study has no final conclusion statement. Finally, the study is valuable and approved.
