The manuscript “sPop: Age-structured discrete-time population dynamics model in C, Python, and R” by Kamil Erguler provides a comprehensive yet well summarised description of a novel software tool to model age-structured discrete-time population dynamics. The software tool is implemented in three different programming languages: R, Python and C. All three languages are most commonly used in scientific programming and therefore the presented tools are easily applicable and adaptable for a wide range of users. The manuscript highlights well the differences in implementation for the three programming languages. While R and Python implementations are easy to use and provide an excellent introduction to modellers new to age-structured population dynamics models, the C implementation provides computational speed, which is particularly relevant for parameter optimisation problems in this field. The manuscript guides the reader through three examples of the Python implementation. For each example, all necessary scripts are provided to reproduce the figures and the results described. While I have not had much experience with age-structured population dynamic models, I found it straight forward to follow the concept of the underlying model described in the manuscript. Overall this manuscript is well written and provides a hands-on guide to scientists to implement the discussed methods into their existing workflow.
