This is an interesting pilot study examining the relationship between forest fires and visits to the hospital for asthma. The main limitation of the study was the data available, in particular large forest fires of above 300 acres were included, and asthma treatment in emergency departments was only available as a yearly figure. There are many studies which show that the rates of hospital admissions increases in the days/weeks following a woodland fire, so the analysis which was able to be undertaken in the present study may not be sensitive enough to detect increases immediately after fires. This perhaps could have been mitigated if there were several years in which there were no fires and and several with, or counties without any fires versus these with fires. Another limitation of the study was the inability to be able to predict the "normal" and fire induced PM load in the townships near the fires and explore the impact that this had on admissions for asthma. I am not familiar with the geography of this region, but do for example people burn wood fires for heating in winter, what effect does this have. This study could be improved by inclusion of a set of recommendations for the type of data that should be analysed.
