In this manuscript, Borcherding, et al. describe an interactive web interface (implemented in R using Shiny) that allows for the visualization of cancer patient survival data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) based on protein expression measured by RPPA (Reverse-Phase Protein Array). The software is easy to use, well documented, and flexible enough for most common use cases. The code is available in a public github repository, encouraging further development and expansion of the tool to suit users' needs. There are no major flaws in either the implementation of the tool or the associated manuscript, but two minor issues should be addressed: 1. As noted by reviewer 1, the manuscript should be carefully proofread for typographical errors and standard english grammar. For example: the common R package ggplot2 is referred to in the text as "ggplots2". 2. The web interface indicates that the TCPA data included with the package were downloaded on 2017/11/10, but the current TCPA release (4.2) was made available on 2018/07/18. This tool is substantially less useful if it is not updated when new source data is released. A plan for updating the packaged TCPA and survival data should be included in the manuscript (and implemented in the package). Automating this process as a function in the package would be ideal, but detailed instructions for updating the packaged data for local installations would be acceptable as well.
