This report by Borcherding et al. deals with the creation of a tool to visualize the impact of proteins represented in the Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) on the survival of patients used in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The tools are straight forward, uses a common standard (it is an R module) and thus has the potential of being highly utilized by the cancer research community. There are no major flaws with the module, the code is deposited in github, allowing easy access to users. Two minor issues need to be corrected: The manuscript will benefit from editing by a native English speaker. Phrasing and grammar are uncommon at times. Reference 5 is referred as “updated TCGA clinical data”. This is incorrect. The paper referred to is an interpretation of the clinical data in the context of the Pan Can Atlas effort by the TCGA, but it is NOT the official clinical data. It is a derived product of it.
