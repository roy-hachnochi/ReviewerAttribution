The manuscript describes the association between STI screening and antimicrobial resistance development of N. gonorrhoeae. Although of interest there are several questions which need to be answered: Material and Methods: The number of participants reduced over time: 10,030 in 2005 and 8,012 in 2011. Also there was a difference in participation rate in the different cities. What is the influence of the decreased participation rate over time and the variation in the participation in the different cities on the interpretation of the data? In 2008 (only syphilis) and in the two other years in addition N. gonorrhoeae, other STI or Chlamydia were tested. What was the reason for this difference? How many N. gonorrhoeae isolates were included in the different years? Was the microbiological method to isolate, identify and antibiotic susceptibility testing over testing similar over time? Which method was used for susceptibility testing? Please provide range and GM MIC values of the three antibiotica testing in the different years, Figure 1: The horizontal axis mentioned an increase in MIC. What was the reference MIC? Dicussion: Was there a change in therapy over time among the participants. All three antibiotica are mentioned in the guidelines, but is there information concerning the therapy prescribed over time in the different cities / participants?
