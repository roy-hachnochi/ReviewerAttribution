 Summary This study is studying about comparison of heavy metal level (Pb, Hg, and Cd) in the gills and stomach of two different mussel species: Crassostrea iredalei and Crassostrea glomerata . This study also explains about the absorbance capacity of those mussels to Pb, Hg, and Cd. The result showed that MT level in the gills in both mussels are higher than that in the stomach, which is correspond to the higher heavy metal content in the gill than that in the stomach. This result indicate the relation between the MT production and heavy metal level in mussel. Question 1: This study is clear and accurate. The literature used by the author are also correspond to the article. Question 2: This study showed appropriate design. The selection of study site in several place (Probolinggo, Surabaya, and Gresik) is suitable, since the high population of heavy metal industries in those area. Question 3: The methods and analysis used by the author is proper to be use by another author. The using of ELISA technique is common to be used to analyze MT level in marine bivalves. Question 4: The statistical analysis and its interpretation are also correct. Therefore, there is no doubt in it. Question 5: The source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility. Question 6: The author have concluded the results in very simple and easy to be understand sentence.
