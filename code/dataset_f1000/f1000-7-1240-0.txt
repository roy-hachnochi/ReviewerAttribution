The description of the process is clear. The interpretation of the results is accurate. I recommend the authors to consider the following options to strengthen the study: Search query The data collection used "machine AND learning". A more robust search query should take into account additional keywords that may be important to ensure an adequate coverage, for example, AI or deep learning. Versions of CiteSpace It is mentioned in text that CiteSpace version 5.1.R8 SE was used. However, several figures show the signature of version 4.4.R1. Coauthorship network More recent versions of CiteSpace support the use of fullnames of authors as opposed to using initials and the lastname. Using fullnames is preferable in such cases. Burst detection Burst detection may be a good addition to the study. For example, it will provide more specific information on which institutions are particularly active in recent years. Dual-Map Overlay Another potentially useful function is the dual-map overlay feature. It allows researchers to identify where relevant studies are published and which areas are highly influential in terms of how they are cited. Co-citation networks CiteSpace has several more specific functions to analyze co-citation network, for example, generating clusters and automatically selected appropriate cluster labels. These functions are highly recommended for this type of study. Using the dataset shared by the authors, I created a visualization to illustrate how one may take advantage of these functions for such studies: http://cluster.ischool.drexel.edu/~cchen/citespace/images/f1000/f1000.png In summary, the current study is clearly reported and should be reproducible. On the other hand, there are several functions that are readily available in CiteSpace but they are not utilized in the current study. I hope the authors may consider updating their studies with the features I recommended here.
