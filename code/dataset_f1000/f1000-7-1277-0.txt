The authors of this paper sought to clarify how synaptic efficacy and intrinsic excitability of small-scale neural networks might be affected by neuromodulatory impulses. In a two-dimensional computational model simulating 210 excitatory cortical pyramidal neurons in a cortical microcolumn, they assessed spike synchronization under different conditions of network topology and density in order to assess the relationship of inputs and intrinsic excitability to output. They found that intrinsic network properties influenced output with asynchronous neuromodulatory inputs, whereas synchronous inputs were associated with driving of neural activity such that intrinsic properties disappear. The authors conclude that this effect may underlie flexibility of cortical computations, since the nature of inputs allows networks to shift between transmission and intrinsic readouts based on the synchrony of inputs. Neural networks are known to have the ability to perform differently under different input conditions, allowing intrinsic information to be accessed or ignored depending on the state of the network, and this study provides insight into mechanisms underlying these processes. Notably, these observations are somewhat limited by the fact that they are based entirely on simulations with no confirmation in an actual experimental model, so there is a risk that the observed phenomena might be artifacts of assumptions used to build the model in the first place. The simulation is relatively simplistic, consisting of a small-scale model of exclusively excitatory neurons with excitatory connections driven by a single ion channel type. Nevertheless, this information suggests that the frequency specificity of synaptic neuromodulatory might affect synchrony of outputs as assessed by spike rates, and this has intriguing implications for informational capacity and conditional intrinsic memory.
