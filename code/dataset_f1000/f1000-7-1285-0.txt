I am not satisfied with the responses of the authors. Such an important compound has to be tested in these experiments. For scientists even if the research is for applied uses, it is fundamental to have the results of the control to get the necessaries pieces of evidence that the other components of the exudate are producing the effects on cell viability and on the inhibition of bacterial growth. Therefore, I have not approved the manuscript. They should run again the experiments with such important compound present in the leaf exudate.
