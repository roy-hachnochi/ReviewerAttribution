I read the revised manuscript entitled: “ Aloe barbadensis Miller leaf exudate is a potential treatment for bovine mastitis” . The manuscript is very interesting. In general, I found it clearly written and errors were found as listed in the attached file that already were corrected. Overall, I believe that this is otherwise a very good manuscript and can be published in F1000Reasearch.
