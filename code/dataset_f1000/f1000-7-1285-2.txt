The work is interesting since the infection of bovine mammary epithelial cells by Staphylococcus aureus it's a problem in cattle farming. However, the study they performed is incomplete. I do not understand, why the investigators did not try the Aloin that they purified to determine the inhibition of bacterial growth and the degree of toxicity on mammary cells with this compound as they did with the total leaf exudate? The leaf exudate has too many compounds. Not only phenols, the exudate may have amino acids, anthraquinones, chlorophyll, and other pigments, etc. At least testing the Aloin then you could know if this compound has an antibacterial effect by itself and/or, causes the toxicity of mammary epithelial cells. If the results are positive for Aloin as antimicrobial without causing toxicity they will know that Aloin can be used for the mastitis treatment. If not, they will know that the leaf exudate has to be free of Aloin to treat the mastitis. The literature of the manuscript is missing important new and relevant literature on the uses of Aloe barbadensis Miller as a prebiotic and inhibitor of colon cancer development. In my opinion the need to perform the analyses considering the aloin. In my opinion, the manuscript should be approved after the authors complete these analyses.
