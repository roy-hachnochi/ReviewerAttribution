The authors introduce a tool for identifying the migration region in microscopy images from an in vitro experiment for metastasis in cell lines. Mathematically, the problem is to find the largest circle that contains the fewest cells. There are a couple of issues/inconsistencies in this paper that I will outline below. Why do you need to train the tool on a negative control? Please specify which parameters are being learned? Are you learning the value of parameter p? Please be specific. More motivation is needed Is the Oris cell migration assay the only assay where a circular stopper is used? How often is this assay used? Please describe this so that the reader can understand if your tool is widely applicable. Description of related work is missing In computational geometry, there is a problem that is called minimum enclosing circle (MEC). Please describe how and if your problem is different. (I'm not convinced it is - as there is a weighted version of MEC.) Tool needs a name Right now the tool is called code.m. Please give it a name. Notation Please don't use #M to denote the cardinality of M -- rather use |M|. Equation (1): don't use c_i, c_j this clashes with m_{i,j}. Use c_x and c_y. Equation (2): don't use M in arg min. For consistency with (1) use c_x, c_y, r. What is the relevance of p=1? Is this what you used in your experiments? If so, no need for this parameter in (1).
