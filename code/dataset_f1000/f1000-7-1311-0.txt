The review entitled “Milestones achieved in response to drought stress through reverse genetic approaches” by Singh et al., presents recent advances in understanding the response of drought stress in crop plants using reverse genetic technologies. It is well known that drought stress is major concern in the era of climate change. Therefore, it is important to address the recent updates on drought stress response in crop plants to scientific communities. The review article is written and organized very well but minor points need to be taken care. Authors have explained several techniques available to study the functionality of different genes involved in response to drought stress but should also include the advantages of these techniques in monocots/dicots. In VIGS, authors should explain the functional analysis of DREB transcription factors using VIGS technology citing some latest references. In ESTs analysis, authors should include the analysis of drought responsive ESTs generated through chemical priming studied in crop plants.
