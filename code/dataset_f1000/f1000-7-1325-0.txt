Emanuel N van den Broeke provides a very interesting overview on how the term ‘central sensitization’ (CS) was originally characterized, how the use of the term developed in the scientific field and how extensively it may now be overused in basic and clinical research. The author lists several “historic” and recent scientific examples, which shine light on the mechanistic origin of central sensitization. It soon becomes clear that there is no actual consensus on the definition of central sensitization and that scientific evidence is sparse as well as contradictory on some occasions. Newer studies show that the intensity of thermal and mechanical stimuli increases most probably due to central sensitization processes but that this increase of intensity is not necessarily perceived as painful. Therefore, non-painful aspects of central sensitization are lacking in the current definition of CS. The further, we need to think of a more specific definition, which may guide researchers and clinicians in the use of the term. I have two suggestions: It might have been useful to add some sentences on peripheral sensitization and its possible role in driving, as well as maintaining central sensitization. A short conclusion/summary including the authors thoughts would also be helpful.
