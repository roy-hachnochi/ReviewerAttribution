This article is a very good summary of the state of play in BCI research as of 2019. It will be of interest to the BCI and general neuroscience communities. Numerous funding sources with deep pockets, coming from very well established, and successful companies, start-ups, as well as the government signal that the time for BCI breakthroughs is clearly anticipated. It may be appropriate to mention some of the already met needs of some users, such as the various P300 Speller systems in use by patients with motor neuron diseases. This population lacks any other communication means, and recent studies with ALS subjectsâ€™ use of BCI in their homes have shown reasonable success. The authors have touched on the major and significant challenges. The challenge of safe, easily deployed high density electrodes, disposed in some 3D configuration inside the brain is extremely great. The reliable readout of these electrodes, and their connection to some external computing means is similarly difficult. Integrating the computational means with the sensors is clearly desirable but very difficult. For fifty years this reviewer has seen technologies compared to that of the transistor, which grew from transistor radios with seven individual transistors, to 100 million transistors per square millimeter today. Approximately a 5e6 fold improvement. Unfortunately no other technology has had a similar arc, and BCI is unlikely to be similarly blessed with inexpensive scalable improvements. Some comment on the possibility of using Artificial Intelligence of the type currently in use to learn, master and dominate games of chess and GO. Recommend indexing.
