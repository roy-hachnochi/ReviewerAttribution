The ancient Greeks recognized the dangers of “overvaluing” one’s self and hence coined the word Hubris (Ύβρις), meaning a highly exaggerated sense of self-importance that is an insult to the Gods. Anybody in position of power, in any sphere of life and the authors comment on scientists being afflicted by hubris as much as others. Very rightly they point out that scientific knowledge continuously grows and reinvents itself. In fact we can confidently (but not hubristically!) say, scientists will never manage to know everything! The growth of knowledge in every sphere is infinite. The authors comment on the “intellectual celebrity status” which has afflicted scientists. “Nobelitis” is mentioned as a syndrome of considering oneself as more able than one is, because of the high level of recognition afforded to them, which encourages hubristic behaviour. Is prize giving, in general, feeding into hubris? It would have been good to expand on this. They recommend the cultivation of humility as a way forward and they urge mentors to teach the importance of humility and the dangers of hubristic behaviour. Can humility be taught and hubris prevented? The public’s thirst for celebrity status, which doesn’t spare the science world, works against this.
