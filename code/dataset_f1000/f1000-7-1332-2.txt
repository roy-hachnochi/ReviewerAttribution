The study by Kosach et al. clearly shows for the first time differential nucleo-cytoplasmic localisation of S6K1 in response to cell density and migration. It also provides some information about the type of role that S6K1 may play in the nucleus and the biological processes that may be associated. The results shown are convincing and the quality of the data is sufficient to support the conclusions of the authors. Therefore, it is the opinion of this reviewer that the present manuscript should be accepted. However, the authors may want to address the comments below so as to improve the quality/impact of the manuscript: At the end of the fourth paragraph of the Introduction, the authors refer to EGF as “endothelial growth factor”. This should be corrected to “epithelial growth factor”. The value of the first paragraph of the Results section (There are several... of different function.”) is not clear and should be deleted. On Page 13 of the manuscript, the authors refer to 2 residues on TRB2, Tyr421 and Tyr423, as potential sites phosphorylated by S6K1. S6K2 is a Ser/Thr kinase and therefore unable to phosphorylate Tyr residues. Are the authors referring to Thr sites instead? Please clarify. The authors argue that interaction of S6K1 with TRB2 may be involved in the migration of cells out of microspheres onto 2D layers. This is an interesting proposition and the manuscript would benefit from an experiment being performed using siRNAs to TRB2 and showing that this impacts either S6K1 distribution or the movement of cells out of the microspheres. The style of the paper is poor in places and could be improved prior to indexing.
