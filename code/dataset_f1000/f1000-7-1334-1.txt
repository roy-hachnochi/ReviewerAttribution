The manuscript by Knox et al., tries to compare the response in biomarkers of cardio-metabolic health in Caucasians and South Asians in response to resistance exercise. The study appears to have been done in a careful and competent manner. I have few comments that require further clarification. Method part: Why were samples selected from male participants in the study? Please explain more in this regard. While more details of method will provide to allow replication by others. Results and discussion parts: Also please include other anthropometric indices as CVD risk factors such as the waist circumference-to-hip circumference ratio, ect in the text, if it is possible because it has been proposed to assess central obesity and as measures for cardio-metabolic disorders and events. Therefore, insert and explain the associations them in the result and discussion sections.
