In this paper Wingett and Andrews describe FastQ Screen a program for quality control and source species identification. The paper is well written with clear example use cases and I am very happy to recommend FastQ Screen for indexing. I have personally used FastQ Screen for over 6 years and now consider it to be an essential part of my analysis pipelines. The documentation for the program is excellent and it is under active development.
