The 2nd version is improved much over the first version in readability and completeness. However, there are still quite a few language issues, unclear statements, and improper expression of concepts. See the commented manuscript in the PDF format for details. In addition, the robustness test is not conclusive. Given that RNA-seq data themselves are noisy, I am not sure why it is necessary to add further noise to the RNA-seq data. In the 2nd version, the authors compared their MSF tools to two existing tools for network or gene set enrichment analyses of an RNA-seq data from an experimental EBOV infection. But it is not clear how MSF outperform the other two tools. The authors claimed their tool is fast, but no runtime is provided.
