The manuscript has further improved and it seems scientifically sound. Based on these standards, the manuscript can be accepted for indexing. However, the quality of the writing still leaves something to be desired; the text is quite hard to follow at times and it still contains several grammatical errors. I've made some suggestions before, but I don't have time to point out all grammatical errors in each new version.
