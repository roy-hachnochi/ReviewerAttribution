The manuscript has been improved based on the comments. However, I recommended the authors to consider the following 2 points before approval for indexing: The authors replied: "We corrected the method section and clarified the details. For the site location map, we think it can be found on the internet nowadays.". I do not agree, please add the Figure because the common audience doesnâ€™t have much time to find the location. Conclusion is not quite sufficient in terms of relating to previous findings.
