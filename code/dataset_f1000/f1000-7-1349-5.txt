The authors of "Rice cultivation reduces methane emissions in high-emitting paddies" present an interesting manuscript with great effort to demonstrate the balance between riceâ€™s emitting and suppressing function changes according to overall methane emission levels. In general, the manuscript is well-written. However, I recommend the authors to do a major revision to the manuscript before being potentially accepted for indexing by the Journal. The Introduction section should add research objectives or in terms of research questions that help readers to promptly understand the paper's content. In the Methods section, description and activities are needed in more detail; additionally a map of the case study would be useful. In the Results and Discussion section, I expected more discussion that enhance more work on comparing findings with previous studies. In addition, the limitations and future outlooks need to be elaborated upon. A Conclusion is important to add into the manuscript since it presents the real implication of the research based on the authors' perspective.
