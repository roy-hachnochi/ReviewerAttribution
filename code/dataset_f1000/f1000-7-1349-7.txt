The authors of "Rice cultivation reduces methane emissions in high-emitting paddies" present an effort in collecting and measuring the CH 4 emissions, in three rice cropping cycles during the 100 days of the field experiment. The overall paper has been written in good English and in a logical manner. The major concern in this manuscript is the methodology and conclusion. The methodology is not clear enough, for example the authors do not make clear the explanation of water treatments in fields with rice and without rice. The authors claimed lower CH 4 emissions due to absence of rice plants, but the difference in the first week (Fig. 1) after seeding when there will be hardly any significant role of rice seedlings is not justified. Furthermore, the methodology section is much confusing with the use of decomposition of straw and addition of straw (study site section). It is hard to follow the inputs of straw in fields with and without rice. The authors clearly need to modify the methodology section to make the description of treatments and to justify the results. Further, there are no conclusions drawn from the manuscript. The authors forgot to give the conclusion at the end of manuscript. In general, the manuscript is not acceptable in its current condition.
