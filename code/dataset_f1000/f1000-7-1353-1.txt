The reason I ticked "Partly" in the above checkboxes is that the article has omitted clear discussion of the key concepts in OAIS for preservation, which are also key to the "R" in FAIR i.e. Reuse. These may be addressed by including a discussion of the OAIS Information Model. OAIS defined Long Term Preservation as The act of maintaining information, Independently Understandable by a Designated Community, and with evidence to support its Authenticity, over the Long Term. To explain what I mean briefly, to ensure understandability the archive should collect the appropriate Representation Information, and ensure that as the Designated Communities Knowledge Bases, the Representation Information must be supplemented. For example if the ontology, which is used to understand the biomedical data, goes out of use over time, for example the URL for its location no longer works, the archive will need to ensure that the original ontology remains available. Similarly, as evidence for Authenticity the archive should collect Provenance about the data, as is briefly mentioned in the article. The Archival Information Package, which is the AIP shown in the Functional Model, is a way to ensure that the archive has captured all the information required for Long Term Preservation, including Representation Information, Provenance Information and several other items. In order to create the AIP for a dataset the archive should ensure that the required information is captured during Ingest, and is maintained over time. The data management plan should help to ensure that the appropriate information is captured over the course of the project in order to provide to the archive. One last point which is worth mentioning is that the evaluation of the ability of an archive is also possible through ISO 16363 audit and certification.
