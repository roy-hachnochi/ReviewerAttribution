This paper compared the efficacy of dolutegravir-based monotherapy vs dual therapy using the methodology of systematic review and meta-analysis. The topic is of great interest as many different studies with these simplication strategies have been done. Although dolutegravir monotherapy is not recommended at present due to the risk of virological failure with development of resistance mutations and dolutegravir dual therapy seems a promising strategy with recent evidence from large clinical trials, this systematic review and meta-analysis is timely because there are almost no direct comparisons between dolutegravir-based monotherapy vs dual therapy. The design and the methods (including PRISMA reporting) are adequate, as they are the interpretation of results. It is interesting that not only monotherapy was inferior to dual therapy but the difference resulted highly increased from 24 weeks to 48 weeks of follow-up, thus indicating that the risk of failure with the monotherapy strategy may greatly increase after the initial 24 weeks of follow-up. This is remarkable as many exploratory studies had 24-week results only.
