The manuscript reports inhibitory effects of plants against hemolysis induced by the venom of Bothrops asper snakes, and it postulates the use of plants as antivenom. However, the results are too preliminary to mention that such plants could be used to treat snake bites, since envenomation by Bothrops species produces a myriad of toxic effects such as tissue necrosis, edema and hemorrhage. At the least, more activities should be tested instead of only one; the authors choose an in vitro activity, the indirect hemolytic test, which is not the best to perform in order to postulate a molecule as antivenom. Some in vivo tests must be performed as well to strengthen the manuscript. Thus, I must reject manuscript as it is presented.
