Authors should provide an overview of the major life-threatening effect of an Ecuadorian bothropic snakebite. Major components of Bothrops snakes, particularly B. asper and B. atrox are myonecrotic and immflamatory phospholipase A 2 s, hemorrhagic metalloproteases, and thrombin-like enzymes, whose substrates include components of the blood clotting system such as factors XII, X, and fibrinogen. What is the relevance of venom-induced hemolysis? This should be clarified, and, when available, the hemolytic toxins briefly described. Table 4: The results of the reduction in the hemolytic effect of different mixtures of various plant species extracts pre-incubated with the MHD of the B. asper venom (ratios of 1: 7; 1:10; 1:20; poison: extract) should be better quantified (-, +, and ++ is too vague..). "The cases of snake bites "equis" on the Ecuadorian coast represent the largest number of reported ophidian accidents, which usually occur in remote areas of health centers or hospitals, making patient care not timely". Authors conclude that "the four evaluated plant species could be used in the prevention of the symptoms of a bothrophic accident". However, and given that the authors propose "the consumption of the extracts sampled as a preventive measure against the effects of Bothrops asper venom in the absence of adequate and timely professional medical treatment", the i n vitro results should be supported by in vivo experimentation. Without these results, any conclusion is purely speculative and the recommendation of using these plant extracts can be more harmful than beneficial (by giving false confidence to the victim of a snake bite, thereby relegating more an appropriate but expensive medical treatment).
