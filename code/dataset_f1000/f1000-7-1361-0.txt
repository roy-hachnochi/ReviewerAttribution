This appears to be a sound paper. Methods are modern, standard and referenced with versions cited when appropriate. Sequences are vouchered by herbarium specimens and have been deposited in Genbank. I have checked the accession numbers given and they are correct. Figure 1 is very clear and detailed, and the legend is adequate and complete. My most important comment is to point out that very recently, Landrum (2017, in Canotia 13:1-101) has treated Psidium galapageium Hook.f. as a synonym of widespread P. oligospermum DC. He comments in his paper that “As recognized here Psidium oligospermum is a widespread and variable species” and that “A geographically broad study with molecular techniques of Psidium oligospermum , including related species ... would be valuable.” Reatini’s paper relates directly to this comment by Landrum (2017) and the fact that the independent species status of P. galapageium is not accepted by all should be made. Other studies however (Proena et al. 2014 Flora de Sergipe: Myrtaceae; and Tuler et al. 2017, Flora of Esprito Santo: Psidium (Myrtaceae). Rodriguesia 68:1791-1805) do not include P. galapageium within P. oligospermum. A minor quibble is with authorities for scientific names in the paper, that are either erroneous or missing. Psdium galapageium Hook.f., is the correct form (authority erroneously given in the paper as Hook who is actually a different botanist from Joseph Hooker who described the species). Psidium acidum (Mart. ex DC.) Landrum (authorities absent in the paper) is how this species should be cited.
