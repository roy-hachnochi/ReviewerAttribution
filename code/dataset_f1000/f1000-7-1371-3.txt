The table is not acceptable in present form and should be corrected accurately by an expert physician, for example, the platelet number should be shown per ml (mm3), the leukocytes count should be present as number per ml, or hemoglobin level by g/dl. The authors should include a figure of bone marrow smear. The bone marrow aspirate is the gold standard for confirming diagnosis. A definite diagnosis requires the demonstration of the parasites in tissue smears of the affected organs. The details of patients are very brief and has been not described precisely for instance in second paragraph of discussion authors have argued that “the cases were referred to hospital more than two months after the onset of symptoms” whereas such information is not seen in description of case one in page 3. Did the authors check the possibility of cutaneous leishmaniasis, tuberculosis and malaria infections in patients? What about congenital transmission? Did the authors check mothers? Because there are evidences that vertical transmission might occur either transplacentally during pregnancy (in utero) or, most likely, during labor via blood exchange from the mother to the child (although in the vast majority of congenitally infected children, the symptoms and signs of VL develops during the first 12 months of life) Discussion is weak and should be rewritten and I cannot approve the manuscript in this form.
