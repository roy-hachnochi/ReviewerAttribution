Ciancio and colleagues present a new protocol for preventing skin necrosis for patients undergoing treatment of dermal fillers. As the use of dermal fillers become increasingly common, this could offer a new approach to mitigating potential serious adverse events. This study offers an interesting new proof of concept with two cases that underwent the protocol. Ideally, the authors will next present a larger observational study to further support their concept and demonstrate the benefits of this regimen. To make sure that others would be able to duplicate such a procedure, it's important to be specific. The authors should take the time to explain in more detail why each of the components is included in the regimen, i.e. what each piece is adding. Also, would recommend detailing when systemic corticosteroids should begin (prior to rest of the regimen? after?). If doses/timing is all done on a case-by-case basis, then this must be stated. Overall, nice outcomes in two cases from an interesting protocol. Will require a larger study to demonstrate if this protocol warrants more widespread uptake.
