Sorry to say: but these 2 cases are not representative for an outcome of any therapy; they would have been solved by themselves, i.e. by Nature within one week. Check your own publication (below) or google images: much worse superficial necroses and infections healed without obvious scarring. - My PC contains at least 10 serious cases from Brazil and elsewhere, where cosmeticians and even hairdressers are allowed to inject dermal fillers. The reason for skin necrosis in the face is always intra-arterial injection: therefore, its prevention is using a cannula or better: moving the needle or a cannula back and forth during injection. The facial artery can easily be palpated from intraorally just above the mucosa and way beneath the nasolabial fold. To inject HA soo deeply shows the lack of knowledge of the anatomical layers of the face. Hyaluronidase is a logical therapy (and the present Gold Standard, I know) - if it could be injected into the embolized artery. DeLorenzis experiments on blocked dead arteries in hyaluronidase are not convincing that this enzyme dissipates through the arterial wall from the outside. I just reviewed a manuscript from Beijing where similar experiments in a living rabbit ear showed slight recovery of the necrosis only when hyaluronidase was injected intra-arterially within the first 4 hours. It is difficult to demonstrate an effect of any therapy in emergencies. To make it short, as long as there is no proof that hyaluronidase enters blocked arteries from the outside (why should it?) we should stick to an immediate physical procedure to try to spread the intra-arterial HA by retrograde scratching with a fingernail through the oral mucosa and emptying it thereby - or massive massaging of the blocked area in all directions hoping to distribute the HA to other branches. I have not done it - but it sounds logical to me.
