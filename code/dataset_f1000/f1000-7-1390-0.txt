Database identifier mapping services are necessary to make the information interoperable to be able to link to other resources. In the present work tbridgeDB added a new feature enabling mapping databases for genes-to variants and vice versa for the variants described in Ensemble. Implementation stages are explained in detail making the work reproducible. The use case scenario clearly demonstrates the value added from the service.The work is certainly scientifically sound. I have two points to be addressed: How do they handle the variants in case of splice variants of the same gene are present It is difficult to query and search the available gene to variant mapping databases
