This is a nationwide based study of Peru that measured self-medication by adults (15 years old) in 2016. The authors showed that poor access to health services increases self-medication. I would like to add three suggestions. First, investigate colinearity between independent variables to avoid type I errors. Second, discuss the measurement bias: the self-medication was self-reported and may be influenced by memory bias (last 12 months) or non-response bias (for drugs for special control, like opioids, etc.). Third, add reference from Latin America 1 .
