The study titled "Purchase of medications without prescription in Peru: a cross-sectional population-based study" is an interesting and relevant study from the perspective of Peru. The authors have done a good job. However, some of the following issues should be addressed prior to indexing. In the abstract, the author mention age range of 24-45, but in the study they have used 25-44 years. This should be addressed. I would suggest suing the Jungle region term consistently in the abstract as well (instead of Amazon). In the second paragraph of the Introduction, the authors mention "several studies" but only provide two studies as reference (1, 4). If it is only two studies, then it should be called a few or handful studies. Also, where were these studies conducted and how are they relevant in the context of Peru? In the third paragraph of the Introduction section, some important statistics are provided. But it might be more appropriate to mention when these changes happened etc. The weighted percentage column of Table 1 is confusing. Are they column percentages? If so, then why are they not adding up to 100%. The authors need to clarify this issue. In Table 2, there is a mention of "Other" reason to purchase medicines without medical prescription. I am wondering if the respondents were allowed to provide comments on them? If yes, then some interesting comments should be provided either in this Table or in the text somewhere in the Results section. And finally, although this manuscript is rather well written, but in some places English editing is required for clarification (e.g. - second sentence of the Methods section of Abstract is not very clear to me).
