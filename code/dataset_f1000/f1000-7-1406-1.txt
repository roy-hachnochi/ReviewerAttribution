 In the title, it should be mention ethanol extract, as the authors only evaluate ethanol extract of the leaves. In the figure 1, the quality is poor, so it seems the positive control do not have any inhibition zone! Only one strain of each bacteria was tested, it would be more authentic if more types of strains as well as some wild or environmental strains were tested. MIC/MBC of the extract against these bacteria should be determined. Data of this study should be compared with similar data published already. It is understood, that there may be no data of this particular species, but other species of terminalia can be consulted.
