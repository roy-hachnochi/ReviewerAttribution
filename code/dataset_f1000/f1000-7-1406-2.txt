The study is designed appropriately and and technical procedure has been taken sufficiently to answer the research question. Furthermore, methods and analyses process also sufficient to be replicated by readers. In addition, statistical method that used is also appropriate. They author need to highlighted and emphasized on the results and discussion with expanding their discussion with comparing another result that similar to this study. In the result and discussion part, it is better to compare phenolic and flavonoid content of Terminalia catappa to other plant extract that close to Terminalia catappa if possible. Or in other words, comparing other similar research that used plant bioactive compound for antibacterial to research. Therefore, this result and discussion part could be expanded comprehensively. In addition, simple and short explanation on how the mechanism flavonoid and phenolic inhibit bacterial growth can be added in this part.
