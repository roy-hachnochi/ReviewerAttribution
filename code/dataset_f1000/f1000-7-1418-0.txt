This report introduces an updated version of ITSx making the tool applicable to exact sequence variant analyses as opposed to operational taxonomic unit analyses. The tool is meant to be implemented upstream of sequence variant calling algorithms, producing dereplicated and merged reads. These reads can then be used in the deblur or dada2 algorithms for calling the exact sequence variants. Minor Issues: Methods/Operation: Because there is clear instruction for use of the ITSxpress product in qiime2, it would be helpful to add a sentence regarding the use of the product in the dada2 workflow, as most users are accustomed to running the forward and reverse reads through the dada2 algorithm separately, and merging afterwards. Would the correct methodology be to run dada2(ITSxpress file) followed by sequence table production (skipping the merge step)? Methods/Implementation: replace "sorted by abundance and clustered" with "sorted by abundance and dereplicated", for clarity.
