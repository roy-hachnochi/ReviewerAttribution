The authors present ITSxpress, an approach for trimming flanking rRNA regions from ITS sequence data. This is effectively a replacement for ITSx, which performed this process on fasta files after sequence clustering. By working with fastq data, ITSxpress allows this trimming to be applied to fastq files, which in turn allows for the application of modern amplicon analysis workflows. Major points: The user may also select dereplication from 98% to 100% identity. The above sentence should probably be replaced with the following, since dereplication usually refers to clustering at 100% identity: The user may also choose to cluster at between 98% and 100% identity. The start and stop position of each cluster representative is then used to trim each sequence in the cluster How does this work if there were insertions and/or deletions between the cluster representative sequence and each cluster member? Wouldn't the position numbers be incorrect in that case? How does a lower percent identity threshold for clustering impact accuracy (as compared to ITSx) and runtime? I'm wondering if it's worth it, for example, to run the clustering step at 98%, or maybe even lower, for quicker run time. Exploring accuracy and runtime as functions of percent identity seems like a missing piece of this study since in some cases the runtimes can be fairly long (e.g., 80 minutes) for a pre-processing step. Minor points: miss-assignments should be mis-assignments OTUâ€™s is used in several places where OTUs should be used It merges (if paired) and trims all samples Should that say "trims all sequences"?
