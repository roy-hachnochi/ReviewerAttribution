Authors present germination data for four species from the Chilean Mediterranean forest. I would like to focus on the first statement of the introduction: “Knowledge of the germination rates of a species means that future determination of this rate is unnecessary, preventing the waste of time and seeds” . I think this statement is not accurate. Germination rate, especially in wild species, could be different depending on the cohort of seeds, the years of collection and the location. Data showed in this paper are valuable as a single biological replicate of germination behavior of the species used in the studies but it is necessary to add more biological replicates (different years and locations) to have a better understanding of germination behavior of the studied species. Methods: I would like to know from how many trees seeds were collected. TG50 calculation could be more easily reproduced if the authors fit their data to a model (p/e sigmoid) and calculated first maximum derivate.
