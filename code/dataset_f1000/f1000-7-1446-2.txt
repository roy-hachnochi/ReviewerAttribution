The authors conducted germination trials on seeds of four Chilean forest tree species. They indicate that this information could be useful for conservation and restoration studies. Regarding the methodology, the description of pretreatments and germination trials stands out. The study design is appropriate and the work is technically sound. I believe that the authors could increase the number of replicates (Petri plate), but in this case it is correct as a first approximation to determine the germination rates of Chilean forest tree seeds. The manuscript represents a useful contribution to the theme of the germination of Chilean forest trees seeds and deserves to be indexed.
