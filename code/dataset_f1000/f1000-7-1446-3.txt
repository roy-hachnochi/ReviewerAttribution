The document provides valuable information on the germination rate of four native species. Quillaja saponaria and Vachellia caven are two of the most representative trees of the Chilean Mediterranean forest, Prosopis chilensis is in the category of threat and Caesalpinia spinosa adapts well to the conditions of the central zone of the country. The protocols for the collection of fruits and seeds, as well as the applied pre-germinative treatments, were based on methodologies recommended by the Centro de Semillas de la Universidad de Chile, CESAF Antumapu . Although they are described in the text, it would be convenient to add the references of Gold et al. (2004 1 ) and INFOR (2015 2 ) that complements the antecedents in pre-germination treatments for the species under study. With regard to the results obtained, knowing the time required to achieve 50% of seed germination is a useful fact that helps to plan the work of plant reproduction for research and ecological restoration purposes as proposed by the authors.
