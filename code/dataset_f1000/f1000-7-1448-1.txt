The manuscript is drafted very well. So, I would like to thank all authors for their attempts. Here under, There are some comments for improvement the quality of the manuscript which I hope to be helpful. In the last paragraph of introduction, there are redundant phrases which can be edited. It is better the manuscript mentions some challenges there were in similar mass gathering in the world. In Methods, the authors mentioned that they have collected data from June 2017 to March 2018, while the study settings have been only health care posts in Iraq and Iran-Iraq borders. I think these posts were active only during Arbaeen period (Oct - Nov. 2017). The second paragraph of participant selection part is very similar to the first one (redundant). In addition, the correct name of organizations should be mentioned. for example, Iranian Red Crescent Society or Medical Society of Basij. Some English editions might be needed. In the discussion part, it is better to explain statistically how education and other interventions can influence on controlling of communicable diseases based on past researches. Mentioning the importance of interventions such as hand-washing and .... is not a new matter. It is better to discuss the results respectively as the results mentioned. So, the reader can insure that all results have considered in the discussion part. It is better to explain what pilgrim-based education is and how it controls CD in discussion part and conclusion as well.
