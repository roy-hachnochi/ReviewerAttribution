This is an interesting and well-written piece of work. Infectious disease prevention strategies in mass gatherings, especially religious or cultural gathering, need to start with such the qualitative study. Having a predetermined program, implementation, evaluation, and upgrade of the strategies in preventing and responding to communicable diseases requires the proper recognition of the contextual factors and challenges, experiences and perception of healthcare providers and decision-makers of the key agencies involved. The authors carried out a qualitative study with conventional content analysis approach about the Arbaeen ceremony, a religious mass gathering in Iran and Iraq and found four main themes: 1- health infrastructure defects in Iraq, 2- poor control of the causative factors of infectious diseases, 3- the low perception of risk in pilgrims, and 4- ineffectiveness of health education. Emerging of All four themes has been verified by the participantsâ€™ comments which made results acceptable. The method of analysis is appropriately explained which can facilitate the reproducibility. The authors conclude that the main factor in preventing communicable disease is pilgrim-based training long before the ceremony. This conclusion is adequately supported by the results.
