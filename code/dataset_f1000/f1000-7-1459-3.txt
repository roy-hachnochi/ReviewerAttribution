Interesting investigation of the effect of a plant-based compound to change gene expression in muscle cells, however the study is very limited in scope. 1. All reported data show increases in mRNA. Are there no significant decreases that are noteworthy? 2. Have any changes in mRNA using microarrays been verified with Q-PCR? This is standard practice; 3. Could a few protein blots be included to strengthen the data and take the interpretation to the protein level? 4. The title assumes that the mRNA changes lead to protein changes which would impact oxidative stress.The title needs to be re-worded unless actual measures of oxidative stress are performed. this would be relatively easy with an oxi-blot, or ROS measure in cells.
