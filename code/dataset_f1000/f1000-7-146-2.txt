I would like to thank you the authors for their replies. As regards my comment about the number of aspects and subsets, I agree with the authors that detailed information is essential to get a good insight of the described topic; however, on the other side, this could make text reading less smooth. Maybe, some aspects could be inserted in an online supplement. However, I keep thinking that it is not to overlook the results about the dose-response evidence or the findings of the whole sample meta-analysis (OR 1.20); instead, it seems that the main message of the review is in favor of an absence of relationship between ETS and COPD. And this aspect is reinforced from the paragraph "Comparison with other recently published reviews", in which the reviews, reporting a significant association between ETS and COPD, are all discussed in terms of limitations and not to compare your positive results with those of other authors. I agree with the authors that it is difficult to define a causal relationship basing on the published evidences; but, on the other side, I think that the possible relationship between ETS and COPD should be better highlighted. The 2017 Global Burden of Disease study clearly reported that second-hand smoke is a risk factor for COPD deaths and DALYs.
