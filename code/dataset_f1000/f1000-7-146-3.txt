The review is interesting, because it highlights methodological issues and gaps in surveys assessing the impact of environmental tobacco smoke on COPD incidence. These gaps and inconsistencies in surveys, lead to inadequacy on assessing the impact, and showing non-confirmative results (OR, RR, etc) on the association between ETS exposure and COPD.
