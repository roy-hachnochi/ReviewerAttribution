The manuscript highlights the lack of international, regional and national capacity for reference laboratories and networks for neglected tropical disease diagnosis, research and training. This includes lack of hierarchical referral system that allows escalation of problem solving based on the nature of their complexity and offers supervision and quality assurance along the chain. The paper highlights these problems very well. The data collection was based on laboratory personnel self-reporting after the laboratories were identified by informants and web searching; both inherent with bias. The identification methods used are likely to select well known or well advertised centres while self-reporting is likely to be associated with higher claims of excellence that is real. The lack of information from African and European regions is very glaring and needs to be rectified. Informed willingness of these centres to work as regional reference laboratories needs to be assed, especially after the centres having been made aware of the terms of reference.
