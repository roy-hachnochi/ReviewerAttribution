This report by El Moshy et al. examines biomimetic remineralization of acid etched enamel using agarose hydrogel model. The authors' inclusion of Agarose hydrogel model has a remineralizing potential to treat early carious lesion. The study, although it is small, adds knowledge to the existing literature. Minor comments would help to improve the impact of this paper: Methods Specimens preparation: It is better to use premolars extracted for orthodontic treatment, the surface of enamel is usually intact and standard in enamel rods orientation, crystallization and size rather than mandibular third molars with the anatomical varieties, surgical instrumentation and surface irregulars. Remineralization: (Agarose hydrogel and phosphate solution were prepared as previously mentioned) there is no previously mentioned information about hydrogels and Phosphate Solution Preparation. Surface roughness (SR) analysis: The average SR was expressed in 1 μm only. how can you be sure that you measure SR at baseline, after demineralization and after remineralization of the same 1 μm every time. It is recommended to use another type of surface roughness analysis with wider surface area at least 25 μm like AFM. Results SEM examination: Figures x3000 is not good enough to show baseline, after demineralization and after remineralization changes also x5000 is not so clear please do not minimize them to save the magnification benefits. It is recommended to use 20000 to 50000 to show the crystals, regenerated mineralized tissue and crystal orientation. Discussion Needs more details about mechanism of growth of the enamel crystals and the mechanical properties of the regeneration tissue.
