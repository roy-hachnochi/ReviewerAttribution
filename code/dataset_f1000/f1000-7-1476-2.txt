The current study performed by El Moshy el al, is an interesting one that aims to investigate the possible biomimetic effect of agarose hydrogel in remineralizing a human demineralized enamel model. Overall, the study is well constructed and presented with the results efficiently supporting the discussion and conclusions. However some minor points might be helpful in adding to the study: SEM images used were croped from the original images which caused some blurriness in the images. A more detailed statistical analysis needs to be performed on the relatively large amount of data obtained. The discussion section needs to be more detailed as it is too short in comparison to the results obtained.
