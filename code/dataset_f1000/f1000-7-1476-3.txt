Excellent work: 1. The study design is appropriate to the work done. 2. Replication of this study could be applicable in the future based on the study results. 3. The statistical analysis is appropriate to the study. 4. In my opinion, the study results efficiently support the conclusions drawn. But, I had some questions about: 1. The acrylic templates: how to use it, and whether it is standard in size. 2. No references for the etching pattern. 3. Some pictures are hazy and with no arrows. Further comments: 1. In the Methodology: I would prefer if you could show us in one picture the differences between a defected specimen that you excluded and one that you choose. 2. In the Results: In Figure 1: no arrows to demonstrate the different types of acid etching. In Figure 1C: no arrows to show the closed rod cores. In Figure 2C: no arrows to show the areas of mineral deposition. No reference to the acid etching classification. Finally, I preferred to see a figure plate comparing the 3 states together to be easy to compare (i.e.: a plate of Figures 1A, 2A and 3A, a plate of Figures 1B, 2B and 3B, and a plate of Figures 1C, 2C and 3C). 3. The discussion is too short to clarify the findings of the study.
