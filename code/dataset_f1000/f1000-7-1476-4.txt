Good work, but I have some comments to clarify my confusion: In the Methodology: the acrylic template - why and how to use? And do you standardize the 2mm in this template? In the Results: In Figure 2 you mention acid etch type? Where is the reference of this classification and arrows to show the different type? Picture C is hazy, please change it. Figure 3: please put arrows to show us rod complete and empty one in Picture C.
