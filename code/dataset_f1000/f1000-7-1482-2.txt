The authors describe the use of regional anesthesia for cesarean section in a parturient with an unspecified inherited bleeding disorder. In this case, the clinical bleeding history in conjunction with the hematologic lab workup leading to the diagnosis of an ‘unspecified’ bleeding disorder is well described. The authors highlight both the importance of early multidisciplinary collaboration in the parturient with a bleeding disorder in an effort to minimize hemorrhagic complications. In addition, the role of informed consent for a patient with an unspecified bleeding disorder and unquantifiable risk of spinal/epidural hematoma should not be understated. Additional attention to the potential limitations of factor/platelet/fibrinogen replacement in the setting of qualitative coagulation defects to prevent hemorrhagic complications of neuraxial anesthesia may be warranted in the discussion. I commend the authors for describing the often challenging anesthetic risk-benefit assessment of a patient with an unspecified bleeding disorders. In addition to the cryoprecipitate transfusion, was von Willebrand factor/DDAVP administration considered given the unknown defect? Please clarify the institutional oxytocin protocol post-delivery. Following the postpartum hemorrhage, what guided the decision to transfuse two additional units of platelets postoperatively and not other factors/fibrinogen? Is there any published literature on the prevalence of ‘unspecified bleeding disorders’ and/or standardization of these clinical diagnoses in the setting of normal coagulation workups by hematologists? Please clarify post-operative neurologic monitoring plan, including nursing neurological check frequency and patient surveillance counseling (concerning signs/symptoms).
