This is a description of management of a challenging clinical scenario given the non-specific diagnosis of the bleeding disorder in this patient with a desire for neuraxial anesthesia. I was curious about the airway exam, considering that the team would have to prepare the possibility of inducing general anesthesia. I wonder if consideration was given to administering DDAVP or other treatment for von Willebrand's disease. Was an arterial line placed or considered, and what was the intravenous access in place? I am curious about the components of the intrathecal medications for the single shot spinal anesthetic. With the possibility for prolonged surgery, were any adjuvants, such as clonidine added to prolong the anesthetic? I would suggest editing the language in a few places. Instead of "epidurals", suggest instead, "labor epidural analgesia". Explain what is"routine oxytocin" in your institution. For what period postoperatively was the patient "closely monitored" and how? Were there nursing orders for frequent checks of neurologic status? Finally, I would suggest discussing the reasons for the low incidence of epidural hematoma in the obstetric population and including this reference: Lee L, et al 1 .
