This is an interesting, well written, and well conducted systematic review highlighting the lack of prospective studies comparing operative and non-operative treatment for wrist osteoarthritis, and lack of evidence evaluating the effectiveness of any intervention for osteoarthritis of the wrist. The introduction and method section is clear and appropriate, and the interpretation of the results seems suitable, given the lack of evidence and papers found. Reviewing, and cross checking the PROSPERO, the search terms used seem suitable for the inclusion criteria specified. There appears an error on the Exclusion: age 18 years in PROSPERO. Should read ‘age 18’. I assume no attempt to search for unpublished data? Are there any numbers and percentages for agreement/disagreements for inclusion/extraction/scoring? Only a discussion point. If ‘there is a lack of epidemiological research relating pain to structural change in this condition’, as mentioned in the introduction, is there an argument to be calling it ‘wrist pain’, rather than ‘wrist OA’?
