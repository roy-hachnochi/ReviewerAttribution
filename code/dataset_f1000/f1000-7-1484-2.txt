This is a well presented systematic review paper representing selection criteria, data for analysis, risk of bias very well diagrammatically. The interpretation and conclusion is clear and justified in light of the results, there is a lack of evidence for both patients and clinicians to decide if operative or non-operative interventions are best for osteoarthritis of the wrist being reasonable how important this is in the context of osteoarthritis in general. I would accept this paper for publication and have no amendments to make however I do not have appropriate statistical knowledge to fully recommend the forest plot data in the study.
