This paper describes the distribution of E-cadherin and the packing of cells within the developing epidermis of the zebrafish embryo. From 24-72 hours post fertilization the total amount of E-cadherin detected at all cell-cell contacts of the epidermis was found to increase. Over this same developmental period, hexagonal cells seemed to become more prevalent while tetragonal, octagonal and round cells become less frequent. Other parameters were quantified but were found not to be statistically significant between stages of development. A major concern with the analysis is the variability of the E-cadherin detection across the epidermis in single images (e.g. Figure 1e-h). The source of this variability was unclear. It was also unclear how the authors dealt with this variability for the quantifications. The authors also noted “dot labeling in the cytoplasm” in panel 1d, but these puncta were not apparent in panel 1g which displayed the same developmental stage. Statistical tests were not applied to the analyses of polygon classes in Figure 3. Also it was not stated whether SD or SE bars are shown in Figure 3b.
