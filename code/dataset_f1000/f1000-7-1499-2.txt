This article describes Vectools, a command-line tool that can do various kinds of matrix operations for tsv-like data with simple one-liner programs. Vectools is similar to sed and awk commands in Unix Coreutils but has more functionalities, thereby reducing the cost for implementing custom scripts for daily data analyses. The authors claim this will improve the reproducibility problem in recent bioinformatics studies. As a general comment, I think Vectools is useful and will be of interest for bioinformaticians who work in practical data analyses. Although I do not feel the tool has a theoretical novelty, its practical usefulness is worth post-publication evaluation by future users. I have several comments as follows: 1: Vectools is also similar to "groupby" function in Bedtools. Some functionalities of Bedtools groupby are not included in Vectools, and vice versa. The authors should refer to Bedtools, and if any, other command-line tools similar to Vectools. 2: For each analysis in Figure 1, please provide the size of input data (#rows, #columns, #sequences, etc.). Especially, I get the impression that SVM consumes a large memory. Although I partly agree with the authors' statement that the computational cost is a minor issue, it is still important to provide the information of memory usage along with data size. 3 (minor points): (Top left in page 2) However -- In addition (?)
