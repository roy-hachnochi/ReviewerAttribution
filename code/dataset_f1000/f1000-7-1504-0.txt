In the manuscript entitled ‘Computational genome-wide identification of heat shock protein genes in the bovine genome’, the authors have used in the silico approach to identify Hsps in the bovine genome. The authors identified 67 genes belonging to four Hsp families. The manuscript is well written and the observations do support the conclusions. However, the authors should address the following concerns: The purpose of the study should be more clear in the introduction. Have the authors checked the Heat Shock Factors similarities with human or mouse? The authors should discuss the functional co-relation of the identified Hsps.
