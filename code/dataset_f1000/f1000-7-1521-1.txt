In my initial review of the paper "Improved inference of chromosome conformation from images of labeled loci" a few concerns were raised. My comments mainly related to putting the current work of the authors in better context with respect to the previous work as well as explaining a number of the details mentioned in the paper in more detail. I believe the authors have satisfactorily addressed my comments. They have added an appendix giving more information on the convergence properties of the used equations. They have addressed differences between align3d and previous work explaining how they are quite different approaches. Some concerns were also raised relating to the effect of the number of colors on reconstruction quality and they have added another paragraph explaining in more detail why this effect is seen. In addition to this it seems they have addressed or responded to all of the other reviewer comments. We are happy to approve indexing.
