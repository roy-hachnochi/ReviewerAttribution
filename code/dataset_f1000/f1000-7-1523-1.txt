 The purpose of this research was to "investigate(d) the relation between the quantity of crop residue of the prior crop and the water infiltration rate". However, "All the crop residues were collected in each greenhouse, and the equal amount was returned each plot but different amount between the greenhouses". Therefore, the authors are not investigating the relationship between quantity of crop residues and the water infiltration rate, since the equal amount of residues were returned to all the plots. Instead, what the authors have investigated was the infiltration rates after each crop cultivation (with the same amount of residues returned and incorporated for each crop) with the combinations of nitrogen and mulch treatments. The experimental design is inconsistent with the stated purpose, and the conclusion is flawed. As I have suggested before, a proper purpose (research question) must be set and analyzed according to the actual experimental design for this current data set. The authors may use this current data as preliminary data to construct a better experimental design for the next experiment to test their current hypothesis.
