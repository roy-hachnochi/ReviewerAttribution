In the study entitled “ Genetic analysis of measles virus nucleocapsid gene identifies measles virus isolate of close similarity to Clade A viruses from Nigeria” , Faneye et al. analyze sequence data of the partial nucleocapsid gene of measles virus isolates recovered from a patient presenting with fever and rash in a hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria. The authors isolated measles virus and found evidence of a hitherto unreported measles virus, genotype A, in a child without previous vaccination history. Though the paper is clearly presented and provides seems to provide additional information on the circulating genotype of measles virus in Nigeria, the authors need to cite current literature to update readers on the molecular epidemiology of genotype A. Measles viruses of genotype A are mostly vaccine-like, and according to the authors the Nigeria isolate clustered with the vaccine Edmoston-Zagreb. Since measles vaccination campaign in Nigeria is widespread, I will suggest that the authors use a real-time assay by Roy et al., 2017 1 that can be used to differentiate a measles case from the commonly used measles vaccine to substantiate their claim of the uniqueness (wild type measles virus of genotype A) of the isolates from the unvaccinated child. Additionally, the sequence of the virus used in the study had unusual insertions of nucleotides (Ts and Gs). It is however not stated the number of replicates of sequencing that was carried out. To clear the ambiguity on the clustering of the sequence as shown in the tree, I will suggest that an additional sequencing of the isolate be performed. In conclusion, there are typographical errors across the manuscript that will require correction by the authors.
