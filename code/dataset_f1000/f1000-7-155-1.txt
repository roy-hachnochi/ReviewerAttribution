This appears to be a paper that was written in 2010 about the suggested identification of a genotype A virus from a child in Nigeria who was said to have not been vaccinated. Even a cursory glance of the literature would have provided more up to date information on the current status of measles epidemiology globally and in Africa. There is a standard convention for naming and characterizing measles sequences that has not been adhered to. For genotyping there is a minimum 450 nucleotide window, and yet the sequence submitted in the Gnebank file is only 445 nucleotides long. Examination of that sequence file clearly indicates that there a problems with the sequence with a long run of ts followed by gs and then a second run of ts. This has never been seen in the coding region of measles viruses before and indicates a serious problem with the sequencing results. By only showing the similarity of sequences in the paper and in the supplementary file this problem is glossed over and is not discussed or commented on in the manuscript itself. Finally, although not as comprehensive as some countries there has nevertheless been a substantial number of sequences submitted from Nigeria since 2010. Their suggestion that a genotype A virus is circulating in Nigerai has never been substantiated by any other studies.
