The current study performed by the authors is an interesting one which aims to determine the association between parathyroid hormone 1-34 administration and ectopic calcification formation in pulp and periodontal ligaments of osteoporotic rats. Results revealed that rats receiving PTH 1–34 showed ectopic calcifications in their pulp and periodontal ligaments. The study is well organized and the authors well documented their work in particular the images captured from rats of each group. However I have some minor remarks as follows: Aim: I suggest that the aim should include that the investigations were carried on dental structures (Pulp and periodontal ligaments) Results: I suggest that the histology of the calcified areas to be thoroughly examined to determine if its histology resembles dentin, bone or cementum in each area. Discussion: More information is needed to determine the mechanism by which the PTH 1–34 is involved in stimulation of odontoblast, cementoblast and osteoblasts functions.
