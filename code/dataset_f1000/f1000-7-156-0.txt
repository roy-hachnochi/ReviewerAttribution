Thank you for asking me to review this manuscript. Although this RCTs is of very low power, I understand the need to publish it as it might be a kind of research waste not to publish it. Nevertheless I have a couple of comments: 1. this study aims to evaluate the difference, or maybe the absence of difference, between two forms of manual therapy. As these concern two active treatments it is essential to know whether the study aims at evaluating superiority of one intervention over another or aims at evaluating equivalence. The method is quite unclear about that, but I think this needs to be clear from the objective, please revise. 2. This study clearly aimed at including more people that they actually did. This information needs to be presented. Furthermore the reader needs to know where patient recruitment was performed, during which period and what actions have been done to improve recruitment. Please add this information. 3. In the result section (in the abstract as well as in the main text) the authors mix within group differences and between group differences. Any mention of within group differences are irrelevant as the study is set up to evaluate between group differences. I would strongly recommend to take out all mention of within group improvements as this is misleading. 4. In the discussion the authors mention as one of the main finding an improvement of all patients. This is a logical finding as, apart from one patient, all had acute neck pain, so natural course will probably be responsible for the improvement. This needs to be discussed! 5. The conclusions are way too firm given the low number of included people. The main conclusion (i.e. the first sentence) is even incorrect as all people improved, but we cannot state that manipulations can be held responsible for that, as I believe this is due to natural course. As long as there is not a no treatment group in this RCT one cannot make such a conclusion.
