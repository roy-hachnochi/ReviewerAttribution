The manuscript is well structured and the format of the report on the details of the study is acceptable. There are two points to consider in the Meta-analysis: The results of Hawleyâ€™s study should not have been removed because of zero in nominators. They could use 0.01 instead of 0 and continue the analysis. Heterogeneity in time intervals is an important issue and if a significant heterogeneity has been detected the results of the meta-analysis would not be valid.
