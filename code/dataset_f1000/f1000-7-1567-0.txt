This is a well written paper that presents a very interesting case report that concisely describes and addresses a rare clinicopathologic entity in the realm of lymphoma, in particular oral lymphomatous proliferation. The case details were presented clearly and concisely. The relevant literature and studies were nicely summarized and addressed. All in all, I support a decision "to accept".
