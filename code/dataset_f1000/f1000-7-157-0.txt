The authors have described their reflections on the experience with Generalized Cost Effectiveness Analysis (GCEA) using the WHO One Health Tool (OHT), to aid other Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) looking to scale up their priority setting efforts. They clearly describe the rationale and aim of using this tool to support redefining the benefits package of the national insurer of the Philippines. Most importantly, they identify key limitations on various levels: 1) limitations of the OHT itself; 2) limitations in availability of models and data specific to the Philippine context; and 3) the unmet need to establish a single, harmonized priority setting process for the health sector that would enable multiple stakeholders (in this case the Department of Health and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation) to make better policy decisions based on the questions they are currently faced with. Based on these limitations and their experiences the authors provide general recommendations that are relevant to the Philippines and to other LMICs. The paper is valuable and sound, given that its aims are quite humbly to share reflections on the use of the OHT for a priority setting exercise. However, these reflections â€“however well described and sensible- should not be read as (and are not intended to be) the result of a systematic evaluation of experiences based on all stakeholders inputs. A degree of subjectivity should be acknowledged and the paper would have benefit from more specific or detailed suggestions to improve the priority setting exercise and experience, from the perspective of the different participants. That said, this paper is a valuable contribution to the literature and more examples such as these should be welcomed and shared to drive the HTA field forward, globally as well as locally.
