Overall the study was well performed and showed some interesting results. After looking at referees' reports which summarized some revisions required for this paper, I would like to add the following: A statement needs to be added in the methods outlining the power analysis performed to determine the sample size in each group. Despite the localized effect of BM-MSCs and PRF being applied on a scaffold, the authors should add in their discussion the potential systemic effect of both treatments especially that the choice was made to have both defects created in the same animal (Right and left tibis with different treatments). I am guessing that this was done to reduce the number of animals used in the experiment. However, the systemic effect of treatments should be addressed as a limitation of the study and/or a discussion should made to clarify how the systemic effect could not have contributed to the significant results. Statistical analysis: A two ANOVA analysis should be more approriate to use in order to investigate the single main effects of time and treatment as well as the possible interaction between treatment and time. This will add more strength to the results rather than using post hoc results and t-tests.
