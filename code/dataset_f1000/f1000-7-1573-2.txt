First of all, I would like to congratulate the authors for attempting to undertake this project which I found very interesting and of valuable additional knowledge. The manuscript itself is well-written and well-structured. The authors of this study have investigated the Healing capacity of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells versus platelet-rich fibrin in tibial bone defects of albino rats. Based on the study results, the authors have concluded that BM-MSCs promoted more adequate healing, with higher mean calcium and phosphorous weight percentages than PRF at all-time points, and showed greater integration into the surrounding tissues than PRF. However, the authors need to address the following minor remarks: Methods: The auhtors mentioned "experimental procedures under aseptic conditions as previously described", however I found no previously described information. Results: 1. In vitro evaluation of BM-MSCs: It is not clear in the text the shape of cells which were found belongs to which group, 3 days or 7 days? 2. Alizarin red staining was used however no sufficient information was provided for the benefits of using this stain. Discussion : Discussion of the results is quite comprehensive. In analyzing the results, the authors also show citations from the previous study to support the explanation of these results. Conclusions: I think the authors should have added more points to conclude the hard work they have done.
