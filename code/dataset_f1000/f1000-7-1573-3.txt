This report by Rady et al., examines the healing capacity of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells versus platelet-rich fibrin in tibial bone defects of albino rats. the authors' inclusion of PRF yielded inferior bone formation to that by BM-MSCs after implantation in rat tibiae. The study, although it may be small, adds knowledge to the existing literature. Suggested minor comments would help to improve the impact of this paper: Methods Isolation, culture and identification of BM-MSCs:(aseptic conditions as previously described) No previously described information found. Establishment of bone defects: what is the depth of the defect? Did it reach the bone marrow spaces? Preparation of PRF: taking 2ml of blood of rats used in the experiment may lead to death of the animal or affecting its healing capacity. it was more safe to use a donor like preparation of BM-MSCs. It was better to compare your results with a control group to evaluate the normal healing capacity with other groups. Results SEM/EDX analysis: Figures (B) x500 is not so clear please do not minimize them to save the magnification benefits.
