 It is an important report for activities of environmental planning of flooded areas of the Suwi river. Introduction: Beyond the importance for wildlife, is there any direct use by the population? In the second paragraph, the citation of “(see merdeka.com article)” could be revised and better detailed in the text. What are the threats to the wetlands on the site? What is the importance of habitat for birds in this location? Are there too many nestling sites? Is it one of the largest bird feeding areas in the region? Methods: A very important area for biodiversity, but no environmental descriptions are provided. When dealing with flooded areas, it is not mentioned if the ecosystem works by flooding pulse. What is the climate? I missed a detail on the map by locating the place in the world. It should explain the map better. In data collection the sampling efforts are not sufficiently explained. I think it should be "heavier" in the methodology to make the work at least replicable. So you could put the coordinates in a small table. How do you know if sampling was enough? How many events do you sample? From the analysis point of view, instead of applying the diversity index, it would be more interesting to rank the species in order to know which are the most abundant and rare species groups. Results: I believe that the documents used for the list of endangered species could already have been mentioned in the methodology. From the ecological point of view, which should be discussed better, which species are unique to wetlands and which are generalists? There is also one incorrect spelling of a scientific name.
