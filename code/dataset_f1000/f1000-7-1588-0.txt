This is a very interesting study with lots of potential for multiples areas in medicine and biomedical sciences. I have only a few comments that may improve the manuscript. Do not use microflora. Do you have any information about the soil characteristics? I am missing more details in the discussion regarding the mechanism behind the effect of soil in their immediate environment. The authors talk about coprophagy but do not mention anything about whether they observed this behavior in the animals. Also, if possible, it would not take much time and money to analyze the microbiota in the soil and to investigate whether there are any shared OTUs. In this regard, I hope the following paper is somehow useful for the authors 1 . Is it possible that the soil changed some parameters and behavior of the immune system and therefore the effect on the microbiota could be indirect? Could you please add information about any OTUs that were shared among the animals? The clustering of samples in Fig. 4 is simply too strong. For me, such a strong clustering would only be explained by processing and sequencing replicates of the same samples. Please explain anything you can add to explain such a strong clustering. Please consider performing any additional analysis on the 16S sequences you think is appropriate (e.g. PICRUSt, BugBase, etc). The link provided to SRA seems not to be working.
