This is an interesting paper that shows the influence of bedding soil on the experimental mice's microbiome, especially the differential effects on mice with different diet. The experiment results and statistical analyses are overall convincing, but there are a few minor points that the work can be further improved with more solid conclusions: The paper only described the soils used "was from the top 10cm of a farm ground with abundant goats, hens and ducks". No further information about the procedures of sterilizing the soils were provided. If the authors can conduct a systematic analysis on the biological and chemical characteristics of sterile and unsterile soil samples, more concrete results might be observed. Some of the observations reported in the paper was based on p-values that are not very small, like p=0.042 or 0.019. It will be better if the authors also present the effect size of those tests and discuss the issue of multiple tests. In beginning of the Introduction, the authors stated that "The main contributing factors are delivery mode, age, antibiotic treatment, diet, and the living environment". While those are the main factors that have been reported to affect gut microbiota, the statement was too strong and exclusive. Actually those factors only explain part of the variations, and there could be other important factors that have not been revealed yet.
