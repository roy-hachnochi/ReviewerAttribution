The study on Panchgavya by Patel et al . is an interesting observation. The formulation seems to have positive effect on the worms with bacterial infections, however, at this point the authors have not elucidated the mechanism. A follow-up study could answer the following questions: 1. What are the genes that Panchgavya may target? 2. Is the protection by killing the bacteria? 3. Does Panchgavya change antibiotic resistant patterns in the bugs used in the study? 4. Can it be used with polymicrobial infections and biofilm forming bacteria? Additional comments: 1. The study design is appropriate and the work is technically sound. 2. The conclusions drawn are adequately supported by the results.
