 Authors have used beta-lactamase producing antibiotic-resistant strains in their study. That is good, as resistant strains of P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens have also been listed by WHO as of high priority. Use of C. elegans as a model host by authors is also logical, as there is some overlap among the virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria damaging C. elegans , and those damaging human cells. While the current study may be approved for publication as a research note, in future authors should try to investigate the mechanisms through which 'Panchgavya ' imparts protection to C. elegans against infectious bacteria.
