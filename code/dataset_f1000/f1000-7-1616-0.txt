The authors report on the use partial pulpotomy procedure which they carried out on a symptomatic first permanent molars. As reported in the manuscript, the tooth presented symptoms of irreversible pulpitis which included acute provoked and lingering pain necessitating use of analgesics. This reviewer suggests major editing/revising on the manuscript in order to attain better readability. Of the sections of the manuscript, case report and discussion require major revision: In case report section a detailed history of the case including examination, diagnosis, treatment and post-treatment could be presented. For the discussion section, I would recommend addition of recent literature on the use of partial pulpotomy for teeth with irreversible pulpitis. The authors should also shed more light by discussing the treatment carried out and its outcome for that specific tooth. "Partial pulpotomy technique should also be tested in older ages with mature roots." The sentence could be discarded from conclusion as it is irrelevant. Proper citation of reference #8 should be made. The manuscript could also highly benefit from a professional editing/revision service for better service to the readership.
