The authors present a bioinformatic recipe for network-based functional analysis of CRISPR screening data. CRISPR screening has quickly become a mainstream tool for functional genomics studies. However, bioinformatics tools are lacking in this emerging field. This study provides a timely bioinformatic framework for functional analysis of CRISPR screening data. This new pipeline combines multiple existing bioinformatics tools and provides a streamlined data analysis process for general users, especially for those who are not experts in bioinformatics. To demonstrate the utility of the pipeline, the authors present a specific example by analyzing a public dataset. Overall, this study is well described. The website also provides very detailed step-by-step instruction for users to follow the recipe. I have a couple of suggestions for further improvement. It would be helpful to provide additional details on individual components of the recipe, such as the rationale behind adopting the widely-used MAGeCK tool (i.e. summarizing its advantages) for robust identification of sgRNA hits. Similarly, there are multiple tools available for network propagation, and it is not clear why a heat diffusion process is adopted by this recipe (i.e. summarizing its advantages). It would be helpful to implement version control for this presented recipe. It is likely that new bioinformatics tools, such as new versions of MAGeCK (or similar tools) or improved strategies for network propagation, will be available in the near future. Accordingly, this recipe needs to be updated to accommodate the latest progress in the bioinformatics field.
