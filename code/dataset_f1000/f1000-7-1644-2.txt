This article presents a study protocol for a needs assessment research project aimed at determining the substance use treatment needs of youth and young adults who currently use illicit substances (including the non-medical use of prescription drugs) in Northern Ontario. Overall, the study protocol is set to examine an important public health problem in areas that are typically under served (remote and rural communities). An innovative feature of the protocol includes a mobile research lab. Other strengths are the mixed method design, plans to interview service providers and community organizers as well as the youth and young adults, and to conduct 1-on-1 interviews with youth and adults if not enough are available for a focus group. Some points of consideration that may improve the study protocol are listed below: First, given that the areas of interest are likely not densely populated the inclusion criteria may be too stringent to get a large enough sample of youth and young adults to be representative of the substance using population in these areas. Specially, needing to have misused substances for at least 10 days in the last month (especially for prescription drug misuse where only 5-12% report misuse in the past year) seems as though it may eliminate a lot of individuals who would otherwise qualify if the threshold was lower. Information for why these thresholds were chosen would be helpful. Rationale for why there is no compensation for service providers for their participation is recommended. The authors mention solvent abuse in the introduction as a problem, however it is not clear if that was included in the screening of participants. It is noted that it was included in the data collection.
