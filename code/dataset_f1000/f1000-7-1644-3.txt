The study protocol provides a clear and realistic research design. The protocol should clearly indicate whether or not parental consent is required by law (in Ontario) to be sought for the participation of minors in addition to consent from the minors themselves. Some indication of what the legal requirements in this regard are in Canada would be useful. Provincial legislation and other applicable legal and regulatory requirements related to legal age of consent should be included in the protocol. The ethical principle of respect for persons recommends that parental permission and minor consent function together to protect the child. The researchers' decision to not seek parental permission because it would disclose the behaviour of the minors to their parents is understandable but it needs to be pitted against the possible risks for the minor and the rights of the parents. Acceptance recommended if the issue of parental consent is addressed in more detail with reference to the attendant legislation.
