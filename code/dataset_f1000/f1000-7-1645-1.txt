Methods: The authors did not mention how the examiners were calibrated, in order to reduce the inter- and intra-examiner variability when examining the preschool children, before grouping them into the early childhood caries and caries free groups. The authors may have been able to collect more information on the oral hygiene habits or dietary intake of the subjects, before taking the oral samples. Results: In the caption for Figure 2, the symbol *p0.05 should be indicated clearly. For Figure 2A, it is to show that there is a statistically-significant difference between the C. albicans in saliva and dental plaque in the ECC group, and a statistically-significant difference between the S. mutans in saliva and dental plaque in the ECC group. The use of top square bracket ( ⎴ ) with an asterisk would be better to indicate which parameters are statistically compared. For Figure 4A, the use of top square bracket ( ⎴ ) with an asterisk would be better to indicate the parameters which are statistically compared. Discussion: In paragraphs 3 and 7, the authors speculated that a high cariogenic/high sucrose concentration diet might influence the interaction between C. albicans and S. mutans in the tested subjects. The authors may have been able to draw a better suggestion if the information on the oral hygiene habits or diet is obtained during the recruitment of the subjects (See my comment in Methods (2)). In paragraphs 3, 7 and 9, the authors could have suggested what further studies are necessary to address the suggested theories/findings. General comments: The paper has a few grammar and language issues, in the Abstract and Methods sections.
