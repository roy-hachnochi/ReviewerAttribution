This study assessed the performance of four monoclonal and four polyclonal antibodies to VAMP7. Six commercially available antibodies, and two antibodies generated by the researchers, were compared by Western blot, immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation. Lysates from HeLa and HeLa-VAMP7 knockout cells, and extracts from wildtype and VAMP7 knockout mouse brain tissue were used to examine specificity and background of the antibodies. The findings indicate some of the antibodies outperform comparators in blotting, immunocytochemistry, with reduced background and higher specificity, and perform well in immunoprecipitations. This work offers careful characterization of VAMP7 antibodies for use by other researchers in making decisions about antibody use for analytical studies of this protein. The study is well conceived and executed. The approaches used are suitable, and the description of work is adequately detailed. Data are clearly presented, and for the most part conclusions are reasonable. There are a few points that should be addressed to strengthen the study: For the Western blot analyses, the antibody concentrations used (ug/ml) should be provided to allow more accurate comparison of antibody performance. In the IF specificity index graph (Fig. 2C), it appears that the authors only measured the intensity profile in one cell for each antibody. These results would be more convincing if the intensity profiles of multiple cells were shown, as there can be variations in staining patterns that can arise from different cell morphologies, etc. It is not clear why some of the antibodies, which performed reasonably well in Western blot and immunocytochemistry (Creative Diagnostics, Synaptic Systems), were not analysed in immunoprecipitations. An explanation for this, or information on their performance in this regard, would be useful.
