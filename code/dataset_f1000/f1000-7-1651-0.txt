The functionality provided by KnetMaps is very useful for molecular geneticists (and the bioinformaticians who support them), whose aim is to identify the best candidate genes to use in trait improvement (I am coming from the bioinformatician/geneticist side). Using heterogenous evidences (omics experiment results, literature, function by association inference from sequence identity, GWAS results) is a common exercise in order to get a more informed list of candidate genes to work with. This is the strength of the visualization of Knetmaps: the ability to display the evidences incrementally, and to visualize the connection of evidences into an intuitive network display, which is very helpful for biologists in order to make decisions on which genes to select for further (expensive) experimental validation. Network rendering and response is fast, thus providing an enjoyable end user experience. I do share one reviewer's feedback on how to revert the network view back to the original state prior to clicking on an icon in the interactive legend, I also seem to miss the step on how to do this. A suggestion on the implementation section, it would be nice to have a graphical block diagram that shows the steps and inputs required for KnetMaps to be installed in an end-user's system. A statement reporting on installation and functionality of the system under 3 dominant OSs would be appreciated (Linux, Unix/MacOS, MSWindows?), as upfront knowledge for users who wish to install this in their own systems.
