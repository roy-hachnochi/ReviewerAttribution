This article describes a package KnetMaps that provides a JavaScript-based tool to visualize content-rich biological data. KnetMaps is suited for a website with heterogeneous biological information by integrating results in a network format. The examples listed on the demo page ( http://knetminer.rothamsted.ac.uk/KnetMaps/ ) allows users to taste the flavor of KnetMaps. The interface is intuitive and straightforward. Below are suggestions to further enhance the clarity and completeness of the user experience: It would be beneficial for both the developers and end users if the author could provide a step-by-step guide to reproduce one example dataset as on the demo page. The ‘interactive legend’ feature allows users to add an additional layer to the default network. It is not completely clear to me: i) how was the visible/invisible edges/nodes set in the first place? Ii) is it possible to remove the once added information? For example, clicking on a ‘Domain’ symbol in the legend will add ‘Domains’ linked to visible nodes. A user may review and find the information not needed and want to hide those edges. I may have missed it but I did not find a way to cherry pick the symbols once the associated edges displayed. The PNG is working on the demo page ( http://knetminer.rothamsted.ac.uk/KnetMaps/ ) but not the use case pages ( http://knetminer.rothamsted.ac.uk/Zea_mays/ ) ( http://daisychain.appliedbioinformatics.com.au/ ). A blank window popped up when I hit the PNG icon.
