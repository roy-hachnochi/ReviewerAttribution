In “Publishing peer review materials,” Beck and coauthors present the outcome of a workshop that assessed the current state and best practices for the technical representation of peer review material and metadata. The report is well-organized and proposes guidance on XML tagging that the group hopes will be adopted by JATS4R. This article is an important contribution to the conversation about increasing transparency in peer review and will facilitate its development as a valued, linked, and preserved class of scholarship. I don’t feel that any of the following comments need to be addressed before the manuscript is indexed in PubMed, but I do believe that the report could be strengthened by attention to these areas: Presentation This piece would benefit from more illustration of workshop outputs. For example, is there a file you can point (or embed inline) that demonstrates best practices for tagging? In a similar vein, there is great information in Supplementary File 2. Can the process information be used to generate an in-text table? XML proposal Note that I lack practical experience with JATS. Could the tag also be used to identify student or postdoc co-reviewers? Is intended to represent the publication date of the review (presumably the same as the article) or the (in this case probably more useful to readers) date that the review was submitted? Or is that captured in ? Clarification would be helpful. Why is disallowed? I would like to imagine a future in which peer review is recognized as a valuable scholarly activity, something that funders would like to know they are supporting. Text edits Please define “BMA.” “Past experience has taught us that making content available is just the first step toward increasing transparency.” What does this refer to? “The term manuscript does not map to anything we’ve discussed.” What does this mean?
