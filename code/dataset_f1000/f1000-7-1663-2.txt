1. Introduction - fairly good and can be improved i. Dadih from Indonesia has- Lactobacillus , Streptococcus , Leuconostoc and Lactococcus - How did they identify the bacteria? Biochemical tests or using molecular approaches? ii. Is there any data on dadih from Malaysia as well for comparison. 2. Methods - can be improved 2.1 Sample - Subtopic sample suggested to change - Bacterial strain The month and year of the bacterium should be mentioned for ex: in June 2009. Why too long to continue the partial sequence 16s rRNA analysis? 2. 2 Isolation of bacterial genomic DNA We used lysozyme-change to "Twenty(20) mg/ml of lysozyme was used to break down ...." Please state where did you keep the genomic DNA. Example in -20 o C freezer or 4 o C refrigerator prior analysis 2.3 16S rRNA gene amplification Please state the reference after forward and reverse primers is mentioned. 2.4 Electrophoresis 1% change to 1% (w/v) in 1x change to1x TAE, 100 V The marker should be mentioned in this section, 1 Kb ladder? What kind of dye did you used? Red dye, syber green, ethidium bromide? State their brand as well Results and discussion Good - due to a single strain/isolate was studied, thus, the explanation is straight forward.
