Authors wanted to identify and characterize GABA producing LAB isolated from “Dadih”. However, authors have taken a strain already isolated and identified in 2009. Authors have not mentioned anything about the gap in the previous research that necessitated undertaking the present exercise. Authors may clarify the issue. Authors have done elaborate molecular testing and phylogenetic analysis of the bacteria taken from the stock. Authors should elaborate the achievement of this exercise. As emphasized by the authors, they should elaborate, about characterization and GABA production potential of the strain Authors should elaborate on the novelty of the study.
