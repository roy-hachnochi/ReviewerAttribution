The authors detailed the 16S rRNA gene-based to be a good lab protocol without demonstrating any scientific value. There is no experimental data to support the GABA production from isolate DS15. They have to present the GABA data in terms of GABA yield under defined fermentation conditions. Meanwhile, they have to demonstrate the pathway in isolate DS15 that is responsible for GABA biosynthesis and GABA export in this strain. Secondly, the authors just use one isolate to achieve the claim "GABA producing LAB isolated from indigenous dadih was Pediococcus acidilactici" . This is not a rigorous way. Here are my questions: What is the level of GABA in dadih? How is GABA production capacity of DS15? There is no massive bacterial isolation from dadih; neither no microbial community profiling for dadih, nor pathway identification of GABA production for microbial community of dadih; so one isolate from dadih does not mean anything.
