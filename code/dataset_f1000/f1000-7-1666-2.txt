 The study uses functional proteomics and specifically Activity-Based Probe proteomics to identify the active proteases in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF). CVF is an interesting biological fluids because it contains high level of protease (and up to now their activation status was not known) and very low pH (4.5). The study is well designed. There are a few minor comments that will help the readers to understand better the findings. Specifically: What is the structure of the ABP used in the present study? (the ref 19 describes the synthesis of more than 1 ABP for probing trypsin-like activities). For their proteomic identification of ABP-targets, the authors cut the gel at the position of ABP signaling and performed a mass spectrometry analysis. In their analysis why did the authors not try to identify the tryptic fragment that contains the active-site serine covalently attached to the ABP? In this way, the authors could identify other potential proteases that bind the ABP (therefore they are active in the sample). In Figure 3C why does the inactive KLK13 sample show a signal? What is the nature of inactive KLK13 (e.g. mutant at active site Ser?)
