This paper outlines in detail FDTool: a Python application to mine for functional dependencies. The paper is about developing a database tool that improves FD Mine a previous tool for functional dependencies The definitions, problem statement and explanations in this paper are well written and clear. The authors also provide a good comparison of several functional dependence discovery algorithms. In my opinion, it would be nice to have the experimental results and summary in some more detail. Also since the CARES data is not public it would be nice to have some results on available data.
