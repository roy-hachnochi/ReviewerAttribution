This is an interesting review paper on spatial reference abilities under physiological and pathological conditions. The manuscript is well written and clear, also it draws relevant, though in some instances not novel, conclusions. I fully support the publication of this paper, and I only have a couple of minor comments. First, I agree with the authors about the possibility to use spatial tasks for a pre-clinical screening of people at risk for AD. For this reason, I would suggest to also include in the discussion the (few) available studies that investigated the relationship between spatial navigation deficits and markers of AD, including for instance CSF levels of Abeta (see studies from Head and collaborators) or amyloid PET scan. Second, the sentence 'egocentric develops before allocentric spatial strategies' (and hence) 'altered egocentric abilities... can be considered an early sign ' looks a bit confounding to me. If so, one would expect that deficits in allocentric spatial strategies may emerge after the ones in egocentric ones in ASD, which is not the case in the studies reported here. The general view of the paragraph is correct, then I would only suggest to re-phrase the first sentence.
