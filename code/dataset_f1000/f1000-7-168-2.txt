This is a beautifully written article by Miniaci and De Leonibus. Importantly this article is timely because more and more people are reported to have dementia and that both industry and academic research is struggling to produce therapeutics to cure dementia or for efficient long-term management of dementia. In this review article, Miniaci and De Leonibus discuss forms of spatial representations (allocentric and egocentric) in the brain and how these representations are altered in normal aging as well as in autism and Alzheimer's disease. The review is well written and images included are highly useful to the readers. Few suggestions: Revise the abstract so that it reads smoothly. If the cartoons drawn (including brain images) are modified versions of previous images, earlier work should be cited directly in the figure legend. If it is adapted from a database, authors need to include links to the image. It is not clear how the authors are trying to distinguish the egocentric/allocentric spatial deficits in mCI versus Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion section should also need comments on spatial deficits in ASD and comparison with AD.
