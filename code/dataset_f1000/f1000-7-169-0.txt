A well written manuscript with detailed ultrasound/radiological findings. The abstract should only present the case without explanatory comments. “PASH lesions do not commonly have internal blood flow which pointed away from this diagnosis. It is likely the imaging study was confounded by the pregnant state” should be deleted from the abstract. If there is no histological evidence of lactational adenoma in the initial core biopsy which was reviewed to PASH with lactational change and galactocele after surgical excision, then there is no mimicry in this case. There is a difference between lactational changes and lactational adenoma which is neoplastic. Could the pregnancy have induced PASH in view of the hormonal influences which have been well documented in literature. This should be clarified appropriately in the manuscript. How this pitfall of initial misdiagnosis can be avoided will be useful to clinicians if included in the discussion. Perhaps, the title should have reflected the radiological (ultrasound) potential of wrong diagnosis of PASH in pregnancy. Figure 3 should have been bisected to show the central galactocele and figure 4 shows PASH only with no areas of gynaecomastoid like changes.
