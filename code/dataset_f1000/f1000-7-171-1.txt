This manuscript summarizes experience and justification for a rapid developer-user meeting format, which was first implemented at the 2017 GLBIO-ISCB meeting. It is a useful summary and may stimulate others to try similar approaches. My comments are entirely on ways to clarify the writing, because the content is fine as is. P3 Para2: The heavy use of “e.g.” is distracting and unnecessary – suggest just leaving it out. P3 Para4: Top line, “fewer” should be “smaller”; 3 rd line delete “an”; 4 th line delete “often” (since you use the word “average”). Next column (same para), add a comma after “total usage”; near bottom of para replace “are” with “is” before “intuitive”. P3 Para5: 3 rd line delete “e.g.”; 7 th line, replace “since” with “for one or more of the following reasons:” and delete both occurrences of “and/or”; 12 lines from bottom replace “Second” with “In the second broad approach”; and 3 lines below that remove “an”. P3 Para7: replace “analysis” with “analytic”. P3 and throughout: Is it F1000Research style to capitalize “Bioinformatics” with every use? P4 Para2: top line add “the” before “International”; 3 rd line remove “has”; 7 th line add “and” before “since”. P4 Para3: remove “e.g.” P4 Para7: remove “have” before “also allowed the session”. P5 Para2: unclear what is meant by “lightweight” – please clarify.
