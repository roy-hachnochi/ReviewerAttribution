Thanks for the opportunity to read this paper which I found fascinating for a number of reasons: Outlining the breadth and depth of the US Assist program. The complexity of the issues addressed and the methodology of distilling down messages from the many different conversations necessary to deliver the final conclusions. Making sense of really complex pieces of work to assist others in being successful is a terrific goal and I appreciate the hard work that has gone into this. I would be interested to know given the experience and expertise of the authors whether they were in anyway surprised by the results of those conversations and whether any element of pre-test bias may have influenced the distillation process to deliver the six key components and how that was managed - they seem so intuitively correct. This is always a hard question but I think the process you used may well have overcome that inherent bias if it existed. Were any thoughts given to these key components in the setup of the original work? The six key components and the descriptions of each of them as they relate to the Quality Management Triangle is neat and may well be of great practical support to those that will subsequently use it. As a next step I would like to see this framework tested from the get-go in the establishment of new work.
