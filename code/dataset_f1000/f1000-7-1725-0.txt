The manuscript reads well. The manuscript was well written. It has the potential to add to the body of knowledge in the field. The method was described in detail to allow for replication of the study. I have no major concerns. My only comment: the author should change the abstract conclusion to: “This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies shows that the use of oral HPTs in pregnancy is associated with increased risks of congenital malformations”.
