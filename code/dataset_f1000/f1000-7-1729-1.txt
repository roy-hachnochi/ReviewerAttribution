 The statistical analysis and its appropriate interpretation must be performed on the results to see significant differences between treatments (Fig 1-Fig 5) The standard deviations especially in Fig 1 is really high (approx. 50% of the avg. value). By this, the data reproducibility might be questionable. The authors should be consistent in presenting the figures. Sometimes the bars are accompanied with standard deviations, and without labels (numbers) on top of them, but sometimes without. The drawn conclusion seems to be correct and stems for the discussion being presented. However, if the discussion accompanied with statistical analysis, this would make the study more scientifically sound.
