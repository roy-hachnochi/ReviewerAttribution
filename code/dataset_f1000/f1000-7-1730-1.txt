The manuscript entitled "Evaluation of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds against chikungunya infection using a phenotypic screening strategy‚Äù by Bonotto and colleagues evaluated an image-based phenotypic assay for high-throughput screening of anti-CHIKV compounds. The screening assay was validated by testing a commercial library of 1,280 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs. The research topic is interesting and has potential significance. However, there are major gaps in the depth of the information reported in this manuscript that make publication of the findings in its current form problematic. Moreover, results in this manuscript are poorly presented and inadequate information is provided. In this manuscript, the screening assay was validated by testing a commercial library of 1,280 compounds. Where is the data on these compounds? Any anti-CHIKV activity by new compound? Not sure why these compounds were screened. It is not clear what are the advantages of using this image-based assay over other established assays for drug screening. IFA is expensive and time-consuming. Discussion is more about efficacy of anti-viral compounds tested rather than use of IFA-based screening strategy. The anti-CHIKV activity of Sofosbuvir must be validated by using another gold-standard assay such as plaque-assay.
