Tadros and co-workers report a case of severe chronic urticaria unresponsive to second generation antihistamines given at higher than licensed doses that resolved following the treatment of dental infection. General comments The clinical case is nicely described and easy to follow. Specific points The authors completely overlook the last version of the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines 1 that address most of the points discussed in the present article. The role of infection of CSU has long been debated (as also shown by the fact that many of the cited references are dated) but an unquestionable proof is missing. Those who, like this reviewer, have been dealing with urticaria patients for decades can easily remember that many years ago patients underwent systematically dental X-rays followed by root canal treatment (when necessary), in most cases without any benefit on the skin disease. The same holds true for eradication of H. pylori infection. The EAACI guidelines include the research for infectious disease within the “extended diagnostic program”, based on clinical history. CRP is included on the routine diagnostic tests to be performed in all CSU patients. The last part of the discussion addresses Omalizumab, but this is out of scope of the present case report as this drug was eventually not given. Minor points The maximum theoretical score of UAS 7 is 42 (6 x 7) and not 40.
