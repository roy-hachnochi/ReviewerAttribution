This report presents a case of CSU which improved following treatment of dental infection. This is a recognised association with CSU, and serves as a useful reminder to clinicians treating patients with CSU. The case report and summary of the literature is concise and to the point. The only suggestion I would make is that it may be worth citing other urticaria guidelines (e.g. EAACI 2018 which is more recent), and making it clearer in the introduction that infection (along with various other causes) is listed as a cause of CSU in guidelines. Extended testing for the various causes is guided by the history. Also, some of the initial tests in the EAACI guidelines i.e. FBC/CRP can give a hint that there may be infection. One small correction in the case report is that the UAS7 score has a maximum of 42, not 40.
