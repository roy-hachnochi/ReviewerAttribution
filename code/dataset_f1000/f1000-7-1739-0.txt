The authors present their methodology utilizing Tempus TM RNA stabilizing solution and an adapted protocol to be used on very low blood volumes collected via finger stick. The topic is relevant since the easier access to blood and a reduced amount of blood needed is an obvious advantage. Never the less, the article presented has some limitations: By comparing the RNA extracted using the authors methodology from finger stick blood with regularly obtained blood, the authors would be able to confidently evaluate if those two samples are actually comparable. This is currently missing. Following up to that, a statistical evaluation and comparison between those would definitely be relevant to the reader. Although total RNA quantity, RIN and A260/280 are provided, some downstream analysis of the RNA should be performed as well. The authors could for example, evaluate the results with a low-abundance-RNA as well as a high-abundance-RNA and compare those results to RNA extracted from regularly obtained blood. The information provided in Table 1 seems superfluous. Although it can be of interest for a reader in some circumstance, I'd suggest adding the table as a supplement and not as table of the main article.
