I read with interest the new version of the article by Yalong Dang et al. And I'm glad to find out that the authors' ideas match up with mine. I believe that in pigmentary glaucoma there is a defect in the autophagy of the cells of Trabecolato and therefore this version is more in keeping with modern biology. I believe it can now be published.
