In the revised version, the authors have nicely addressed all my comments from version 1. There are a few places in the manuscript where the text should be updated to reflect the inclusion of an additional method, e.g. in the last paragraph of the Introduction. Also, the last sentence in the Background section of the Abstract seems to be missing a word (or should rather be split into two sentences), and the second sentence of the Results has the same passage repeated twice.
