The authors have done an excellent job addressing my concerns in this review. I have the following minor comments, primarily for clarification in the text: Comments: I find it very difficult to distinguish the colored lines used in the new Figure 2E and Figure S4 (in particular, the counts, log counts, and knn lines). Please change one of these lines to red or another more spectrally distinguishable color. For example, the colors in Figure 4 are easier to distinguish. SAVER, MAGIC, and dca seem to introduce more contradictory markers compared to knn, DrImpute, and scImpute (Figure S6). Is this because of the underlying methodological biases discussed on page 9? Or should users be aware that using SAVER, MAGIC, and dca may introduce more contradictory differential expression results? Please clarify how users should interpret and act on these findings. The authors note that filtering by effect size restores specificity of identified differentially expressed genes in the imputed data. Does this effect size filtering also fix the contradictory genes issue? Or are there still contradictory genes even after the effect size filtering? Please clarify.
