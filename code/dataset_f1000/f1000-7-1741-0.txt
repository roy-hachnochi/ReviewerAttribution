 Major revision The authors evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TP53 gene exon 5-8, and found that 37.2% of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples harbored mutation, whereas 57.1% of esophageal adenocarcinoma (AC) samples harbored mutation. These result is interesting. However, this study lacks the information or explanation of SNPs in TP53 gene exon 5-8. The authors need to discuss how SNPs in TP53 gene exon 5-8 influence developing of esophageal cancer. The authors should mention the reason why the author focused on exon 5-8 in more detail. The author need to show the relationship between SNPs in TP53 gene exon 5-8 and clinicopathological features, including survival information.
