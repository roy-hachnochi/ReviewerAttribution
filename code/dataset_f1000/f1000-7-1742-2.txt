Individuals with Sickle Cell Trait (SCT), generally a benign carrier state of hemoglobin mutation, are thought to be at increased risk for exertional rhabdomyolysis. This report presents an association between SCT and rhabdomyolysis triggered by spinning. The association between SCT and exertional rhabdmyosis is mostly based on case reports. There are no well-designed case-control study that address this association except epidemiological study in US army soldiers. In many case reports, including this one, authors often highlight SCT is a main contributing risk factor. However, etiology of rhabdomyolysis is extremely variable. Although this case report describes an event of rhabdomyolysis in sufficient details, other potential contributing factors were not well discussed. The subject in the report appears to be unaccustomed to intense exercise and was not adequately hydrated before and during exercise. These are well known factors that contribute to rhabdomyolysis. Combination of those factors will certainly increase subjects' risk to muscle necrosis. Individuals should be aware of these factors before enrolling in unaccustomed strenuous exercise, regardless if they have SCT or not.
