This is an opinion article addressing the question whether missed opportunities have occurred due to inconsistent immune intervention studies between mice and men involving differential time of intervention. The proposed hypothesis is interesting and potentially plausible given the recent insights into circadian regulation of immune responses. However, the current opinion piece is not fully substantiated in certain areas requiring revision. Are arguments adequately supported by evidence from the literature? While the authors cite some reports highlighting circadian regulation of immunity, insufficient discussion was provided regarding specific differential immune responses and how they may actually impact tolerance strategies. Further discussion of this area would strengthen the work.
