This study compared continuous with intermittent beta lactam therapy for the treatment of CF exacerbations. There are theoretical reasons why continuous therapy is preferred, as the authors state. It seems that some of their data for intermittent therapy are not contemporaneously matched with the continuous therapy, which could confound the results. Furthermore, the authors state that many of the continuous infusion admissions were interrupted - i.e. - they ended up becoming intermittent. In any event, the study showed no difference between the two methods of administration. It is incorrect to state that one method had "a very small advantage" or "slightly better pulmonary function" than the other, when in fact there was no statistical difference - by definition the outcome was the same whichever method of administration was used. The data in the results alluding to race, age, length of stay etc. are irrelevant, since it is not expressed in relation to which type of therapy was used. The main thrust of this paper should be that continuous and intermittent therapy are both equally efficiacious in the treatment of an exacerbation.
