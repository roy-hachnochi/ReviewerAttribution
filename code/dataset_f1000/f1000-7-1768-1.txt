This article addresses the links between intra-canal medication used and the post operative pain after endodontic treatment, as mentioned in the article, post operative pain is multifactorial, however the design of the experiment is adequate including experimental and control groups, the primary outcome was measured preoperatively and after 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours only, however in the conclusion its mentioned that the 7 days was sufficient for reducing the post-operative pain. (The use of intra-canal medication for 7 days in necrotic teeth with apical periodontitis was efficient in reducing postoperative pain regardless of the type of intra-canal medication used). Approved: No changes are required. The experimental design, including controls and methods, is adequate; results are presented accurately and the conclusions are justified and supported by the data. The research is clear and cites the current literature in the topic of post-operative pain after intra-canal medication. The data published and the supplemental data provided is sufficient and clear to allow replication The conclusion is sufficiently supported by the results but could omit the (7 days) to prevent confusion.
