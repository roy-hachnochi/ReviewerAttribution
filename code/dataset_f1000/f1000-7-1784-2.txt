This description of the development of Key Concepts is clear and comprehensive. It is a real pleasure to read such strong and well-chosen English in a biomedical paper. The authors' sensitivity to language and meaning is also clear from the thoughtful way they have handled suggestions for changes in the wording of Key Concepts themselves. I have no suggestions for changes in the text. The concepts themselves are of permanent value and their authors have given the world a model of openness and rigour. It would be good to hear about their dissemination plan as clearly they have been successful in many ways but deserve to reach the widest audience possible.
