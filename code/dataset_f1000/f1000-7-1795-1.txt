This is a well-written and well-conducted article with clear problem and objective. For indexing, it is suggested some changes, described below: There are many recent published papers that report the clinical efficacy of diode laser in endodontic treatment (see Genc Sen and, Kaya 2019 1 ). In this way, the authors need to make clear in the introduction what is the innovation that this manuscript presents. References need to be more up-to-date. There is no citation of any article published in the last 5 years. The authors should pay attention to the citations. In the last sentence of the introduction, they comment that the use of the diode laser in endodontics was recently established, but they cite a 2004 reference. Please replace the abbreviation of units using capital letters; for example, ml to mL, watt to Watt. Please give references to the laser protocol used. Are there studies in the literature based on temperature increases generated in the root canal using such parameters? What are the observed values? Comment on their safety for the periodontal ligaments in the discussion. The authors do not explain how they ensured periods of pain assessment. Please correct the neodymium laser nomenclature. The correct one is Nd:YAG. Please explain why there was no bacterial collection in the S3 period of the placebo group. Discuss whether the insertion of the laser fiber may have exerted some mechanical removal of the biofilm. Please correct the captions of all the figures and tables. There are legends that mention letters and asterisks, but there is nothing in the figure (e.g., Figure 2), while Tables 4 and 5 do not explain what upper and lower case letters refer to.
