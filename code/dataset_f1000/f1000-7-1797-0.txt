The study protocol describes a randomized controlled trial investigating if addition of disulfiram and copper to the standard Stupp regimen for treatment of glioblastoma will increase survival at 6 months, overall survival, progression free survival etc.The study is limited to patients with first recurrence. The study is well designed and well planned to answer the research questions. It is, however, more and more common practice to perform surgical resection of the recurrence (if possible) prior to additional chemo therapy. I cannot from the study protocol read if this is also the case here and how the authors will deal with this. The RANO criteria will be used in the assessment of progression. Although these criteria are well recognized they may not always be that easy to use and conclude from. Therefore it was very nice, the authors also use volumetric measurements to evaluate growth rate. The authors might, however, consider using other measures than contrast enhancement to assess volumetric growth rate (flair, T2 etc).
