The article by Burrows and coworkers investigates the olfactory responses of mated and unmated Microplitis croceipes females of different age-groups to host-related plant volatiles. The results indicate that age and mating status do not affect the odour-guided behaviour or EAG responses of the parasitoids. The paper is clear and well written, citing relevant literature on the topic from previous studies by the same group and other authors. The methods used are standard in the field of chemical ecology and appropriate to answer the research question. One minor issue regarding the methods section is the inclusion of the conditions in which behavioural trials were conducted. Temperature and relative humidity are known to affect insect behaviour; therefore it would be important to mention if the assays were conducted under controlled conditions or not. And if the second was true, which were the average values for these parameters on the assayed days. A couple of minor style comments: The use of 'and/or' in the introduction (second paragraph). It is a matter of preference but 'or' only should be sufficient. In the methods section (Insects) 'L14:D10 h (L:D) photoperiod' is repetitive, either use L14:D10 h photoperiod or 14:10h L:D photoperiod. The statistical analyses are correct and appropriate to the data collected. The data sets provided ensure the reproducibility of the study, and the results support the conclusions. This is a high quality manuscript and I recommend it for indexing without hesitation.
