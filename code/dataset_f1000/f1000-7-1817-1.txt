This manuscript describes a set of behavioural and electrophysiological experiments testing the hypotheses that: 1) mating status and 2) age affect behavioural and antennal response of the parasitoid wasp, Microplitis croceipes to host-related plant odors. Both synthetic and authentic host related odors were tested. Odors were either a general green leaf volatile or volatile organic compounds induced by host ( Heliothis virescens ) feeding on plants. Overall, the data tend to reject both hypotheses. The authors postulate that M. croceipes display strong innate sensitivity and response to host-related odors with little plasticity due to their relative ecological host specialization. The investigators have made numerous scientific contributions using this parasitoid-host study system over a number of years and thus their methods are well established and proven state of the art. The experiments were adequately replicated and the methods are robust and well designed to test the stated hypotheses. The data analysis is appropriate. The data is clearly presented and the conclusions are consistent with the results obtained. I have no reservations endorsing this manuscript for indexing.
