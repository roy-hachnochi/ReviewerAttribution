This paper has addressed a particular clinical problem that is often found in specialist Endodontic practices - i.e. refractory cases that do not heal and show persistent radiolucency despite all the best clinical endodontic procedures and various anti-bacterial strategies being used. The authors have investigated the role of Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) in these refractory periapical lesions. They showed that lymphocytes and plasma cells from these lesions have high expression levels of TLR-2 which indicates their role in these cases. This information has the potential to lead to better diagnostic and management strategies to identify these refractory cases earlier. This is a well-conducted study that has utilized samples of refractory cases from the universityâ€™s collection of cases. The methodology involved numerous tests and analysis of the biopsy material along with positive and negative controls to support the methodology used. The paper has comprehensive descriptions and histological material to support the discussion and conclusions. The results support previous studies.
