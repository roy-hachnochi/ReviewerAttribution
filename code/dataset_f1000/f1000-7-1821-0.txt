Revise the abstract - Introduction - the prevalence of HIV is very small, but how this is written it sounds more fear mongering given the results that only 1.6% out of 2,084 were HIV+. I would focus on the facts only. The conclusion states - high prevalence compared to whom, please revise? Replace "homosexual experience" with "same-sex experience" in the abstract and entire manuscript. Grammatical errors have not been addressed throughout the paper. For example: " Prisons are the easily approachable venues for health interventions but unfortunately, the prisoners are among the most marginalized and restricted populations where access to health services, interventions and surveys are very limited". This should say - "Prisons are an important venue for health interventions as inmates are among the most marginalized and restricted populations where access to health services, interventions, and survey research are very limited ". I am unsure that prisons are easily approachable venues for health interventions. Describe IRB procedures.
