Overall, this is a very interesting method and an interesting application. I have a few comments. Page 1, Methods: This should be “which can provide mucosal protection”. Page 3, Methods: Shouldn’t it be -80 Celsius? Not Fahrenheit. Page 3, Methods: Please specify how the dilutions used for each sample type were determined. Page 4, Table 2: Need to specify the meaning of the coloring of the text. It is not clear why some are colored and some are not. The table only says that “seasonal vaccine strains are in bold” but does not mention the colors. Page 5, Results, paragraph 2: How do you defined “concordance”? What are your thresholds for how similar it needs to be? Pair 4 (IgA titers) could also be argued to be concordant. Page 6, Figure 1 legend: curvel - curve? Curvel is written twice—not sure if this is a word I’m not familiar with or a misspelling of “curve”. Page 6, Figure 1: The text is very small. Can you figure out how to enlarge please? Page 6, Figure 1 legend: MS abbreviation needs to be defined in the legend. Page 6, Figure 1 legend: “IS”, infant serum needs to be defined in legend. Page 6, Figure 1 legend: Need to explain why Log2 was selected for this display. Page 6, Figure 1 legend: Need to explain what “net” MFI refers to. What is the “net” part? Page 6, Figure 1 legend: Unclear why Log2(MFI + 1) is used. What is the + 1 for?
