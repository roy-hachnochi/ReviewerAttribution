This interesting pilot study investigates the association between anti-influenza antibodies measured by Luminex in blood and breast milk. Breast milk is a much understudied body fluid. However, the numbers in this study and the fact that the timing of breast milk collection varies so greatly means that the results are merely descriptive. Breast milk changes throughout feeding, by time of day and by time of collection relative to feeds. Thus the sampling, although I understand the rationale of convenience, means that the results are not interpretable as they currently are described. It would be useful to add more detail from the original study on timing of sample collection etc. How do you account for different rates of decline? IgG rate of decline is uniform across many pathogens and I am unsure why this should be any different in your study. What was the half life and how does it compare to the other studies you cite? Could the differences you see between pairs also be due to non-specific binding within your assay?
