This article describes a case of complex penile fracture (PF) with bilateral corpus cavernosum involvement resulting from sexual activity. Sexual intercourse represents the main cause of PF and is usually associated with high-energy traumas causing double fractures. This may occur during more vigorous sexual intercourse, especially in certain positions. According to our previous study, “doggy style” position was most frequently associated with complex PF, second only to the “man-on-top” position. Differently from this case report, in our sample, the “woman-on-top” position showed a low incidence, and no significant association with the severity of the PF. The authors should mention some aspects that can lead to complex bilateral lesions, such as vigorous sexual intercourse and certain types of sexual positions.
