The report is a relatively straight-forward and short description of a prospective malaria patient cohort, with a specific focus on platelet numbers and possible relationships between thrombocytopenia and the presence of splenomegaly. This is an important question to ask in relation to thrombocytopenia in malaria, since the mechanisms involved are not well-defined â€“ splenic trapping is certainly a valid mechanism to consider. Their platelet data support many previous studies of other patient cohorts showing thrombocytopenia is a common clinical feature in malaria. However, the relatively small number of patients exhibiting splenomegaly (11/204 or 5.1%) precludes making a definitive conclusion about the lack of association with thrombocytopenia. Therefore, I recommend this limitation be included in the abstract and final conclusions of the paper. Eg. Suggested wording: Splenomegaly, which was a rare clinical feature of this malaria patient cohort, was not associated with thrombocytopenia. The methods should include notes about how platelet counts were determined, and the fact that different hematological analyzers were used (this is currently mentioned in the Discussion).
