This study is important and has a great impact for clinicians in the subject, however I found many lacks in the assessment methodologies, especially: How to define the confirmed cases of this study (microscopic ELISA or PCR). The methodologies to count the thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. It is important to separate the cases by species of Plasmodium and the day of infection. Additional comments - there are some important things missing in this manuscript that need to be explained by the authors: The 1st paragraph; Please use the national Annual Parasite Incidence (API) below 1.00 per 1.000 population or the prevalence 1%. The methodologies need to be addressed, because this is the most important; a) how did the authors use the definition of malaria cases in this study (giemsa 3%)? and b) for the methods of counting the parasite and thrombocytes (after treatment or before treatment, or before and after treatment), did the authors make QA for the test? Which prevalence of P. vivax is correct – 42.0% (from page 3 in the discussion) or 43.2% (from Table 1)? In the discussion I need more explanation about the aims of this study; "Discover the association between thrombocytopenia splenomegaly”, please write about the following: a) the main function of thrombocytes and the kinds of situation risks decreased and for which patient conditions (acute or chronic diseases) and b) the authors should be addressing why their hypothesis was not considered significant. Please find an annotated copy of the article here for my full comments.
