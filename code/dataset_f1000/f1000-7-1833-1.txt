There is a mismatch between the discussion and the table number that is referenced in the text. For example, the discussion of development of infrastructure cites table 5, but the analysis is in Table 4. Likewise, in the text Table 6 should be Table 5. The standard deviation and standard error for crop development are 3.153 and 0.069 in the text, but 3.1694 and 0.0669 in Table 3. Which are the correct numbers? Table 4 is referenced in the discussion of farm development, but Table 4 concerns infrastructure development. There is no table that reports results for farm development. Tables 6 and 7 are not discussed in the text, so it is unclear what they mean.
