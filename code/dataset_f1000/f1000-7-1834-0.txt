Overall, this is a good study. However, the study only involved mothers of the children to answer the questionnaires. The researchers should also consider interviewing the teachers because nowadays the students spend more of their time in school compared to home. In certain circumstances the mothers may not know what actually happened at school. The teachers may know more of the achievements and problems of the children. Title - Clearly represents the study.
