I like the concept of this manuscript, and it could be interesting, but I think it needs some additional work. The only DPPH test is not enough to demonstrate the antioxidant activity and it is a easy test. Phytochemical screening is already known so it would be interesting at least HPLC analysis. The discussion could be a bit deeper explaining the benefits of extracts and comparing better which extracts is more useful and why. It would have been interesting to have information on the pedoclimatic characteristic of the place where the plant are harvested. The description of experimental part is for the most part good and clear. The written English needs to be better. The following reference which appeared recently in Natural Products Research, 2018 1 should be added.
