After checking the research article “Borneo herbal plant extracts as a natural medication for prophylaxis and treatment of Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens infection in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)” by Dr. Rudy et al. , I reached the following suggestions to be made for the article’s acceptance: The overall structure of the manuscript is satisfactory, though some changes are recommended. In the introduction the mechanism of action of plant extracts and its medical importance could have been added. The authors didn’t mention the composition of feed. There is a possibility of residual ethanol in the sample. How can you conclude the results with this concern? The nature and source of chemicals (Materials) used in this experiment are not mentioned. Footnotes can be much clearer and the legends used in the figure should be mentioned properly. Also, in some graphs standard deviation is missing. Give enough information about the figures in figure legends. The Discussion part can be much stronger. In conclusion, the content of the manuscript has value for indexing. The mentioned suggestions can be considered and resubmitted.
