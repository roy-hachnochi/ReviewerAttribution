In their revision, the authors addressed a comment in my initial report that EM-based quantification methods may, to some degree, alleviate the cross-mapping problem. In their Supplementary Figure 11, they show that using RSEM to estimate expression removes some of the false positive trans eQTL (points on the x-axis), but that the majority of FP trans eQTL persist (points on the diagonal). They have therefore addressed all of my initial comments/concerns. The added distinction between mappability and cross-mappability is also useful.
