I agree with Reviewer 1 in that this study by Strech et al. provides a comprehensive list of variables to take into account when tracking the publication of clinical trial data. Now, with their applicable checklist, researchers can fine-tune their tracking of the data from trials. The paper is well-written, cites relevant literature, and describes the chosen variables well; however, since a part of this research involves a qualitative portion, it would be informative to describe the 'explorative review' clearer. Additionally, point 7 could be expanded. Please find comments below for your review, thank you. Methods: Regarding the 'explorative review,' it would be interesting to know what was the initial list of tracking variables compiled by the authors before arriving at 10. The cited methodology on OSF does not describe this step. It is unclear how the authors voted or decided on the tracking variables. This explorative review is qualitative in nature and the authors should describe the way they chose the variables with greater clarity so that this part of the study could be replicated by other researchers. Discussion: Timeliness of the publication: I agree that researchers have limited time to publish, but as these tracking variables are also intended for assessing timeliness of companies' publications (including pharmaceuticals), the authors could also mention that there could be embargoes set forth by pharmaceutical industry officials and how embargoes could play a role in the timeliness of the publication of trial data irrespective of authors' available time to publish. I think this is a point worth mentioning in this section of the Discussion.
