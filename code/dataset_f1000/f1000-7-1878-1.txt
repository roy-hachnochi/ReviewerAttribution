The authors tackle an important issue in tobacco regulatory science - how to integrate data on the potential impact of the introduction of potentially reduced risk tobacco and nicotine products on the population. It draws on approaches to labelling claims on medical products, and as such may miss some important elements of what may influence behaviours and use of what are in most jurisdictions consumer products. Some of these may become apparent as the tool is used in a multi-national context. For example, the cost of the devices of vaping or 'heat-not-burn' may have a major influence on the likely uptake in countries with low disposable income. Other cultural influences may also become important, and so rather than a translation followed by back translation, additional items may need to be added in some countries.
