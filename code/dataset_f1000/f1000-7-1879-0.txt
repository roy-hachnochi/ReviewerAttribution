The authors carry out a detailed analysis of the association between risky sex and HIV prevalence at the regional level. They show that the prevalence of HIV is associated with risky sex. While this result is not unexpected it is important to quantify the relationship and to examine how the prevalence of HIV and risky sex vary among regions within countries. However, in my view a critical factor in determining the timing and peak prevalence of HIV epidemics depends critically on how people move. It is trivial to observe that sexually transmitted infections depend on direct, intimate contact between two individuals. If people don't move then, by definition, the epidemic cannot spread. DHS studies do not, of course, capture information on migration, and in particular oscillating migration, as is common in South Africa and its neighbouring countries and territories, and a direct consequence of the needs of the mining industry for a cheap supply of very large numbers of unskilled men rooted in the system of Apartheid. I would recommend reading this paper in parallel with the paper by John Hargrove "Migration, mines and mores: the HIV epidemic in southern Africa" published in the South African Journal of Science 1 .
