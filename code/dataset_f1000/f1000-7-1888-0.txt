The efforts are laudable and adequate weightage can be given since it is a multi-center study but I would like to mention that in the title it is mentioned "to enhance knowledge and skills", out of which only knowledge is tested. It is mentioned only in the Abstract regarding Direct observation of Procedural Skills, but it was nowhere mentioned in the main text, neither was it evaluated which it should have been, as it could test the skill component as well as performance. The module could also be explained in detail. In the Methodology, study design and sampling technique is not mentioned. Kindly explain the part in the Methodology - Procedure; that the residents took the exam at least once during the week after the study period. In the Discussion, the present study is not discussed in light of other studies. In the conclusions, it is mentioned that there were significant differences in knowledge and skill. If skills were nor assessed, this statement can't be made.
