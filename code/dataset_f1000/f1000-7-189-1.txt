The authors of the manuscript evaluated protein content and quantitation of tissues collected from 21 patients with a range of ovarian diseases (endometriosis, endometrioid and clear cell ovarian carcinomas). They used a well-designed proteomics approach. Their findings were unique and did not exactly correlated with current knowledge from genomic analysis. Clearly additional work will be required to confirm and expand on their current findings. Minor comments: There are some proteins that were identified only using 1 peptide (500 proteins). The authors should elaborate of the expected protein size for these proteins and confirm that the identification based on 1 peptide is sufficient.
