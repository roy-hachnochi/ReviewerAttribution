In my opinion, the manuscript submitted by Harzif and co-workers entitled: Factors associated with the utilization of long-acting reversible contraceptives among family planning clients at the Pameungpeuk Rural Hospital, Indonesia‚Äù is important for readers for several reasons. Indonesia is one of the countries with a large population, high total fertility rate (TFR) and high maternal morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, although the use of modern contraceptives is increased in the last decades, it is mainly based on the use of short acting reversible contraceptives (SHARC), mainly injectables and pills (almost 75%). It is well established that the use of SHARC methods are associated to early discontinuation and high contraceptive failure when compared to users of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs; intrauterine devices and implants). For this reason the government is encouraging the use of LARC methods. The authors showed data from Pameungpeuk, an Indonesian region which has the second largest population, with the highest TFR in South-West Java and with low use of LARCs (almost 10%). The main findings of the study were that the use of LARCs were significantly associated with age of women, the cost of contraception, knowledge, beliefs, skill of health workers, and support from health workers. The main limitation of the study was that it was a cross-section design and the number of interviewed women, which cannot allow to generalized the results to a large country like Indonesia. Additionally, it could encourage others to assess other regions to evaluate also the use of LARCs.
