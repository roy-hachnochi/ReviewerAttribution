The authors performed a bibliometric analysis of the employment of wearable technology in health using the SciMat software. They showed that the literature production is increasing in the period 2000 - 2017. They found that “monitoring systems” is the main research theme. And that new themes like mobile technologies and the study of algorithms are emerging. The paper is interesting and is analysing two topics, which is becoming more and more important and popular. First, they describe the use of a not so well known bibliometric analysis tool, SciMat. In that respect I would advise that the authors clearly state why they decided to use it, instead of more known tools like VOSViewer. I would also propose that in the discussion they state the advantages and disadvantages of SciMat compared to VOSViewer and other bibliometric tools. Second, the authors reveals the dynamics of literature production in quite a novel way, and identify most important topics of research. I would suggest that author add the most recent or cited references for each topic they identified. They should also extend the discussion with the implications for practice and further research from the point of maintaining health and development of IoT devices. They should also identify the research gaps. Some standard descriptive bibliometric analyses like geographical dispersion of research and most prolific journals, could also be helpful.
