The article describes a GenePattern notebook for inferring CNVs using methylation profiling data generated by Illumina Infinium arrays. The notebook leverages the well-established Bioconductor packages minfi and conumee to implement an analysis workflow that comprises quality control, CNV calling, and results visualization. Functionality is made available through a web browser interface and requires no software installation/configuration, making it an attractive option for users with limited informatics expertise. Some thoughts about possible improvements: Given that the entire workflow can be somewhat time consuming (the notebook documentation indicates that processing a single sample takes about 2 minutes), it would be useful if there was an option to run the QC step as a stand-alone computation, not combined with the CNV calling. As things stand right now, a significant amount of time can be spent waiting for the analysis to complete, only to realize that some control samples are of low quality and, thus, need to be removed and the analysis be rerun. When running the notebook without specifying values in the “genes to highlight” or “ignore regions” parameter boxes, the run fails with “getopt” error messages. It is not clear why these parameters are mandatory (e.g., in the case of "genes to highlight", it is conceivable that one may want to only inspect genome-wide patterns of aberration, without focusing on specific genes); but if so, it would be helpful to state clearly in the documentation section.
