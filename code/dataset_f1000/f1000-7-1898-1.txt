This paper appears to be a comparison of densah bur and conventional drill system according to implant design in animal models. Overall, the content is simple but well proven. Only in this experiment, it is considered that the animal model is designed properly. I mention a few minor revisions: Abstract is 4-mm thick cancellous bone slices, but it is written as 4-cm in the text. In the experimental design, four implants are placed in one Cow femur slice, and I wonder how much distance there is between the implants (critical distance between implants). Indeed, the important consequences of this experiment would be to provide an experimental condition that does not interfere with drilling or implant placement to yield reliable results
