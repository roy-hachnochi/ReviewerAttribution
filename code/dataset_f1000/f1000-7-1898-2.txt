This is an interesting in vitro study. Osseodensification technique is getting popularity due to improved local bone quality for implant placement with the technique. The pilot work is interesting as far as the unified approach is concerned with 13 mm long implants and customized surface configurations. It is suggested that in future following variations should be considered to test the effect of osseodensification. 1. Implants length less than 13 mm (8-11 mm) 2. Variable width. 3. Different thread pitch and depth. 4. Implant surface characteristics should be with SLA surface or any other non-machined surface. 5. The immediate stability of implants may not reflect the normal healing and stability physical equilibrium. As in real time clinical implant surgery, the initial stability and after 1-2 weeks stability may vary. The discussion part of the manuscript should include variables mentioned above and future studies may include those points. Further, radiographic or any other imaging technique should be used to see immediate bone-implant contact in both regular and OD technique.
