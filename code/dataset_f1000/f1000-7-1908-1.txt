The manuscript by the Rogan group potentially provides an interesting resource. I would like to suggest to make it more accessible for the user, because in its current form it is very difficult to judge how reliable and strong the splicing predictions and RNAseq data in reality are. Our lab has checked some variants that are know to affect splicing, and it is very difficult to judge how this resource rates these. For example, Ri before and after mutation are difficult to interpret, it is unclear from this manuscript what these values in practice mean. The text in figure 1 that describes the reads under individuals (bottom of A) does not always correspond to the IGV screenhot in B. It is also unclear what figure C actually shows. The term anti-cryptic has not been defined. It is also not clear to me to what extent the predictions were confirmed for the entire set and whether certain types of predictions were more accurate than others. The resource may be very valuable, I would recommend to make it more accessible and understandable for the biological and diagnostic researcher, who could greatly benefit from it.
