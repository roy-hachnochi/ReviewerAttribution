The increasing amount of sequencing data that is being generated in many biological systems has represented a real challenge to researchers in terms of trying to link individual changes to a particular biological process. The attempt, described in this work, to use IT approaches to evaluate the potential biological significance can significantly contribute to fill this gap. The laboratory of Peter Rogan has a long standing and internationally prominent role in addressing the possible consequences of sequence variants on the pre-mRNA splicing process especially with regards to its connection with human disease. The ValidSpliceMut developed in this work presents a user friendly interface that allows users to manually search for a variant (by gene name or genome coordinate range) and obtain information with regards to its possible effect on splicing. This will greatly help to better appreciate the functionality of Variants of Unknown Significance that are currently abundant genomic and transcriptomic Atlases.
