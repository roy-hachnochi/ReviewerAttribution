The authors provide a systematic review of immunohistochemical studies of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). The clearly stated objectives are: To collate and describe all published reports of immunohistochemical studies in HS. To critically evaluate the sampling, laboratory and analysis techniques used in each study to determine if comparisons can be made across studies. The review was registered with PROSPERO and conducted in line with the PRISMA. The STROBE statement was used to assess the observational studies included in the study. A PRISMA flow chart and a search strategy are provided accordingly. The authors adequately discuss the confounding factors and risk of bias, which both are significant weaknesses identified in the literature by this manuscript based on limited studies. Only 22 articles were identified describing results from 494 HS patients (average 22 pts/study) and only 168 controls. Furthermore, 87 unique immunohistochemical targets were identified adding to the scarcity of hard data. It is therefore less surprising that conflicting data were found. The authors are however able to provide a realistic analysis of the data taking these limitations into account, and, in addition, provide coherent analyses and a testable paradigm for the pathomechanisms of HS. The paper provides an excellent overview of the limited number of explorative immunohistochemical studies of HS, and thus provides an important stepping-stone to further studies.
