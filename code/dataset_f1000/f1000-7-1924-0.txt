The review article is certainly of interest, but needs improvement on several points. As a complement to the earlier Reviewer (who certainly has given many good suggestions to improve the article) I add: Remarks: The authors performed searches in PubMed and Embase. One way to extend the search is a backwards and forwards search, i.e. to look at the articles in the reference lists of included articles (and on earlier reviews), and to search in Google Scholar which articles have cited the included articles. If not performed, this ought to be done. As pointed out by Reviewer 1, the Introduction is too brief, and could certainly be extended. There are many connections between gout and atrial fibrillation that should be mentioned. For instance, hypertension is common in both conditions, with the use of many antihypertensive agents among certain medications may increase urate levels. As regards diagnosis of gout, there are different definitions of gout, e.g. the ARA criteria. The mentioned definition of gout in the article is too simplified, and needs to be extended. In epidemiologic research the definition of gout differ. The authors should mention how gout has been defined in the included studies. The authors could mention the known prevalence of gout and atrial fibrillation, respectively, in the world, and mention possible differences in different regions of the world, and different populations. This is important for the possibility to generalize their findings. In the Discussion, the connections between gout and atrial fibrillation should also be mentioned.
