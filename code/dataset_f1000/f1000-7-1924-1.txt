My points below are for potential improvement of this manuscript, and I have no conflicts of interest. This systematic review needs several points to be significantly addressed as listed below: There are very limited number of included studies (three cohort studies, one case-control study). This systematic reviews and meta-analysis has not been registered. Lack of transparency. Please add this point in the limitation. The reason why only 4 studies are included because literature search was too superficial. Hyperuriecemia should also be included in search term.
