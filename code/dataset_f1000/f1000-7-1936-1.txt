The research aims to investigate the effect of the use of garlic and ginger as bio-preservatives on the proximate and antioxidant properties of ogi flour made from cereal grains (sorghum or maize). The experiment has been well designed and overall, this study contributes to the knowledge about the potential use of local spices as natural preservatives in food. Still, authors should consider the following important comments. There are a few typographical errors throughout the manuscript e.g. in the last paragraph under the introduction, authors should consider ‘nutritional’ instead of ‘nutritionals’ quality of ogi …. Under methods specifically where ‘ ogi preparation co-fermented with garlic and ginger’ is described, authors should decide whether to use past tense (as in winnowed, steeped) or present continuous tense (as in draining, milling). The authors should consider giving further scientific depth. This can be done by expounding on the compounds present in ginger and garlic that make them good preservatives and the scientific rationale behind how these compounds exert their bio-preservative properties. If these are added, the technicality of the study especially the discussion bit would be greatly improved.
