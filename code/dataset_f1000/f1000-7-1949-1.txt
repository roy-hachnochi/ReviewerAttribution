The present article compares the postoperative pain after using either calcium hydroxide or silver nanoparticles as intra-canal medication. The success of root canal therapy depends on the reduction or eradication of the microbial load inside root canals. However, total elimination of the bacterial population inside the root canal is difficult to accomplish. It's well known that Ca(OH) 2 does not show complete effectiveness in cases of persistent root canal infections, therefore different nano scale materials have been recently used as an antimicrobial agent, the post operative pain after using new materials is considerably an important factor The authors definitely spent a lot of time carrying out the study and writing down their findings. The Introduction section contains an adequate background regarding the use of silver nanoparticles for intra-canal medication. Regarding the methodology, several aspects should be pointed out: Patients inclusion and exclusion criteria were clearly stated Ethics committee approval and randomization procedure were provided The method of introduction of the silver nanoparticle to fill of canal space was not clearly mentioned Results section shows the main results clearly. Generally discussion section is good and deliberate. The provided CONSORT checklist and flowchart for this article is quit beneficial.
