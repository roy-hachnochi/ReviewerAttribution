The authors should provide more info on the primary breast cancer; what was the status of ER, PR and Her2 in primary breast cancer? It is unusual that primary breast cancer (pT2No) is only treated by radiotherapy. What was the immunohistochemical profile of ACC variant of BCC? This must be clearly provided. There are also rare variants of primary ACC of the skin as well as ACC of the breast (including basaloid variants that are usually high grade cancers). It is not easy to appreciate mitotic figures in skin cancer (I am a pathologist).
