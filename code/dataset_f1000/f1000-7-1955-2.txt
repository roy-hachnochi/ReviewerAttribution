This article describes a series of SAS macros that automate a standard analysis of observational data. The macros include a descriptive analysis for table 1. An univariate analysis with the study outcome and study cohort and a multivariable or adjusted analysis. Outcome types include logistic regression, survival analysis, and competing risks. The authors do a good job describing the programs and giving examples of the output. My main comment is that there are other macros available to create tables from SAS output and for someone who is adept at SAS the time savings may not be so great. However, it is nice to have them grouped together in a series. I wonder if the authors couldn't go a step further and make the user interface a little more user friendly (such as an ap or point and click) system? I think such system would be more useful to the general public that is not so adept at SAS.
