This is a systematic review looking at the strength of evidence supporting the link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and neurological complications. The intention is to create a living review that is constantly updated as new publications arise, allowing researchers access to a data resource that keeps pace with the rapidly advancing evidence in the field. This is an extremely important initiative if it can provide truly up to date (i.e. as fast as a pubmed or similar search) and appropriately sifted information for those wishing to conduct spot checks on the current status of neuro-ZIKV. From an aspirational perspective I support it strongly, but does it work in practice? Setting aside many complex methodological considerations that this article raises, how useful is such a resource and who is it there to serve? We would all welcome tailor-made and up-to-date information at our fingertips to help navigate the mountain and minefield of information on ZIKV. I suspect that whilst this review will be widely consulted by those interested in neuro-ZIKV, from policy-makers to researchers, we will still refer back to primary publication for detailed up-to-date information in our specialist areas. At least it will provide a generic overview that facilitates more in depth access to and analysis of the primary data.
