In their study, Authors assessed the characteristics of patients with migraine referring to a single center over 9 years. In my opinion, several points of the paper are worth clarifying. Please find my observations below. Some terms should be clarified as they are rather unconventional. For example, the term "experienced aura" mentioned in the Abstract should be better defined. Authors state that they assessed "migraine causality" while in fact the cause of migraine is a research field. I suggest better explaining the rationale of the study and its novelty points as compared with previous studies. Comparisons with the available literature should be performed. Authors should also underline the differences between clinic-based and population-based studies. Some variables should be clarified. For example, Authors reported the number of monthly headache days without specifying over how many months they assessed the variable. I suggest reporting the absolute numbers together with proportions in the Tables. In my opinion, some variables assessed by the Authors, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale score, have a poor rationale. Was the present study cross-sectional or longitudinal? I suggest adding some information about the patients' treatments in their medical history and about those prescribed during the visits. Authors state that they assessed the level of disability associated with headache attacks. However, they did not assess the scores of standardized questionnaires such as the MIDAS or HIT-6, which constitutes a limitation.
