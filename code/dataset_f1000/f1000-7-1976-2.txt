Unfortunately the authors have revised their manuscript only slightly. I still see a general interest in the aim and the idea of the provided package. However, the value of the package is not explained in the manuscript, and that may be because the ability of the package is (still) limited. The manuscript needs example code, Figures, Tables etc. to show the value of the package. The manuscript needs to answer the following question: Why is it convenient to use your package compared to writing code specifically tailored for my data set?
