This manuscript describes the R package radtools. The aim of the R package is "smooth navigation of medical image data". The idea to provide functions which appear "smooth" for the end user is of great importance. However, the functions provides in the package do not seem to be of much (additional) benefit to the end user. Functions for reading NIfTI and DICOM images are wrappers around function in the packages oro.nifti and oro.dicom; visualisations of medical images are realised in oro.nifti. Only the functions for exploring DICOM headers are genuinely original. This is of course an important part of working with (DICOM) images. From my understanding, F1000Research requires software tools articles to contain examples of the use of the tools. This manuscript does not contain any examples. An example (or two examples) would not only strengthen the manuscript, but could/would also show the benefit of the R package itself.
