This manuscript reported the new information of phytochemical and antioxidant activity of barks of Baccaurea macrocarpa . The authors used only DPPH assay to evaluate antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activity should be investigated using various assays to present antioxidant capacity of the extracts. The results of evaluation on phytochemicals of barks of B. macrocarpa showed that the methanol extract consisted of alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, flavonoids and phenolic compounds. But the profile of GC-MS showed only fatty acids, fatty acid esters and methyl paraben. The authors should use LC-MS to investigate chemical constituents of methanol extract instead of GC-MS. In results section, the authors did not mention on the toxicity test of the extract using brine shrimp lethality test. And the results should express yours statistical analysis. In discussion section, the third paragraph, the authors need to rewrite the total content and composition of fatty acids. GC chromatogram in Figure 1 was not related to the data of composition of compounds in Table 3 such as retention time, % peak area. For example, peak at retention time 19.329 showed high intensity on GC chromatogram but it expressed low % peak area just 0.91. The peak at retention time 14.877 showed low intensity on GC chromatogram but it expressed % peak area 1.32. Moreover, some compounds presented low matching percentage from the library searching. In Figure 2, structure of methyl paraben was wrong.
