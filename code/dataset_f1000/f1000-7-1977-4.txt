 Introduction: In first paragraph line 5, please correct your statement on natural ingredients “ do not contain chemicals ” that only can be found in modern medicines, as all things in this world is formed from chemical constituents. Please change to “contain toxic chemicals”. Last paragraph line 5, the statement “kinds of isolated compounds contained” are not correct as you don’t isolate the compound. Please remove the word “isolated”. Methods: DDPH assay alone can’t express the antioxidant properties of sample, so we suggest you to add other antioxidant assay such as ABTS and FRAP. Discussion: GCMS result indicated that the main constituent in Baccaurea macrocarpa extract is fatty acid, this is because the GCMS can only detect the volatile compounds. To identify other compounds that are responsible in the antioxidant activity of Baccaurea macrocarpa , we suggest you to run your sample using LCMS. Methylparaben is familiar compound. Can you give literature which supported your claim that methylparaben is responsible to the antioxidant of Baccaurea macrocarpa extract?
