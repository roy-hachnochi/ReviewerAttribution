The authors have provided a clear and thorough description of their analysis of sequence variation in the bovine ITGB2 gene that encodes CD18. They have not only identified and characterised sequence variants, particularly in two exons of interest, but also tested the effect of these variants in a functional assay in respect of binding to Mannheimia hemolytica leukotoxin. The methods used are described in exemplary detail. There would be value in noting that some of the missense variants that are a key focus of the analyses have been reported by others previously and citing the relevant rs-identifiers: R5C rs517776076 N27K rs521222417 R120W rs109222573 R120Q rs522421330 D128G rs445709131 Q392K rs469652717 P656L rs379267066 The authors should be encouraged to submit their new variants to the European Variation Archive that now hosts sequence variation data for non-human species now that dbSNP has ceased this service. The authors should not only submit the sequence variants but also the genotype data and frequencies. Two of the variants listed above do not appear to have survived the migration from dbSNP to EVA and may need to be resubmitted (i.e. R120W / rs109222573; Q392K / rs469652717). There a few (very few) minor typographical errors: 5 uM rather than 5 μM on page 4, column 2 line 11 a missing gap after the comma on page 6, column 2, line 1 50 ul rather than 50 μl on page 6, column 2, 5 line from the bottom It may be appropriate to mention the contribution of Mannheimia hemolytica to "shipping fever" and note the cost of this disease and pathogen to the US cattle industry. The authors discuss their results in the context of a report of gene editing the bovine ITGB2 gene. The paper by Shanthalingam et al. 2016 (cited as reference 15 in this manuscript) report that gene editing a single codon in the ITGB2 gene and generation of a fetus carrying the edited yielded cells that were resistant to Mannheimia hemeolytica in an in vitro assay. The current authors correctly note that there are no reports of live born calves carrying this edit in homozygous form and thus the viability of this gene edit for resistance to Mannheimia hemolytica remains unproven. However, none of the natural ITBG2 variants characterised by the authors delivers resistance. As the authors search for variation was thorough and should have identified almost all variants of useful frequency, then designing variant signal peptide sequences that are not cleaved but do not bind the leukotoxin may be the way forward. The authors' discussion of these points could be more explicit.
