In the manuscript entitled "Research on Babesia: A bibliometric assessment of a neglected tick-borne parasite", the authors have included the recommendations made by the reviewers and their quality has improved. This bibliometric review is of interest to future researchers in this zoonosis and shows the need to continue studies in a multidisciplinary manner. It is practically ready for indexing, but first, it would be important to answer one question and one minor observation. The first is regarding the comment and graph made considering the state of Wisconsin, considering that there are other states such as Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine that show a marked increase in their incidence rates compared to Wisconsin during the period 2011-2014 1 . Please clarify, if the same does not happen in the other states. The second observation is regarding the writing in some paragraphs of the discussion. For example: "In countries in Asia ..." would be more appropriate: "In Asian countries .." or the following sentence: "Of interest the strong research activity of institutions and countries as Japan and UK, in which Babesia represents a new emerging problem in both animals and humans" the message is not clear. Another example is the paragraph: "The vision of zoonoses should be one. All integrated. Then, having separated human and animal babesiosis, to us, is not rationale today. Babesiosis is one zoonotic disease, no matter the host. The work on babesiosis, including research, should be together between veterinarians and human physicians, working in the interphase that zoonosis, such as babesiosis, provide. One World, One Health." in which redundancies are observed. References 1. Surveillance for Babesiosis - United States, 2014 Annual Summary. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
