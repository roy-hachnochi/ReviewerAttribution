I reviewed the manuscript “Progress and challenges in TB vaccine development” and it seems to me that the objective of this review is well defined and clearly stated. The abstract is written clearly and objectively. Introduction is clear and presents a solid foundation for the review's objectives. The presentation of the various sub-topics is clear and the review of the bibliography is mostly complete and includes the main articles published in the area. The section on animal models could be elaborated to discuss in greater details mouse and guinea pig TB models, in addition to the authors’ thoughtful perspective on the use of NHPs. Some discussion of the intricate network of events modulating inflammation in the context of TB and how a better understanding of this will aid in the development of more effective vaccines and host-directed therapies to curb TB is warranted. The review should also be updated given the recent report of the first efficacy trial evaluating prevention of infection results for BCG revaccination or H4:IC31. Thank you for the opportunity to review this excellent work.
