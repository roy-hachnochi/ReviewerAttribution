This is a brilliant short paper: a clever idea, explained very clearly and that immediately makes sense (but that is by no means obvious at first sight). The revision and the comments about the first version seem appropriate to me. I donâ€™t have further substantial comments except perhaps the following. I was curious to understand what value of n is required to achieve the result presented in the figure (is there anything special about n =7?). Using the code provided this is easy to check, but perhaps it would help readers to add an additional figure with multiple curves for values of n ranging between 1 and 7 to see how the results change. Doing this exercise myself I learned, for instance, that n 7 is enough for certain parameters and that the value of b is especially important (something that perhaps could be discussed in a sentence or two).
