The authors report the results of meta-analyses based on studies in Japan relating cigarette smoking to the risk of the four major smoking-related diseases. Data are summarized for current and former smokers and in relation to amount smoked and time quit. The relative risks reported for Japan are compared with those for other Asian and Western studies reported in published meta-analyses. The results shown are mostly quite similar to those reported elsewhere, with relative risks for current smoking elevated for all four diseases, relative risks for former smoking somewhat lower, and evidence of a dose response with increasing amount smoked and decreasing time quit. While current smoking relative risks for heart disease and stroke for Japan are similar to those in other countries, it is notable that, for lung cancer, the relative risks for Japan are much lower than seen in Western countries, though similar to those seen in other Asian countries. The paper includes an interesting discussion about the reasons why this might be so. Generally, the paper is very well structured and clearly written, and the material presented provides considerable reassurance about the completeness of the searches and the accuracy of the meta-analysis results presented. Over the last decades Peter Lee and his co-authors have published a broad range of papers dealing with the risk of smoking in general. Monitoring these publications over many years I was always impressed how clearly the papers are written, especially the MA ones. The results of the present publication are convincing, clear and concise. Concerning the lung cancer results this paper again points towards an important aspect in public health which definitely needs further research: the substantially lower RR in Japan compared to western countries.
