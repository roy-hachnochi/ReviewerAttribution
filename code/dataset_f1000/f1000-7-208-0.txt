The rationale for the research on the determination of prevalence chloroquine resistance among clinical isolates is generally sound given the significance of the Malaria disease. The statement that there chloroquine has been in used despite the ban is not clearly articulated. The argument supporting the reintroduction of chloroquine is not well articulated. The sample size is also quite small and the selection criteria of study participants is not well supported. There is an implication of inclusion of children statement that there were 13 women and 7 men contradict the inclusion of children. The methods are not sufficiently detailed since the gel photos of the amplification products are missing and there is lack of explanation as to how the products were treated before sequencing. If this are articulated it is possible to ensure that the methods are fully reproducible. The analysis of the presence of the mutation, the interpretation and subsequent conclusions are generally adequate.
