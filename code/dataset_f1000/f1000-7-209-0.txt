In the paper entitled "Cryopreservation of orchid seeds through rapid and step freezing methods" written by Marco Cerna et al . two types of freezing technique were tested by the seeds of 3 species: Epidendrum quitensium Rchb.f., Sobralia rosea Poepp. Endl. and Epidendrum anderssonii Hgsater Dodson. The authors present step freezing and rapid freezing methods for cryopreservation purposes. There was a significant difference in the results between the species and between the treatments. The cryoconservation method that provided the best results was the "Rapid" freezing, without the addition of any substance. The introduction is well structured, helping the readers to understand the issue the method tries to solve. Considering that it is a research note the methodology is very detailed. Nevertheless, in my opinion it is important to highlight the viability of the developed method on a wider spectrum if possible. In the current form of the Discussion, only general statements can be found regarding the viability of the developed method. A more concrete concluding sentence is missing that could answer the following question: For what kind of other plants, could this method be useful? If the developed method can be applied "only" for orchid seeds, a concluding sentence should be placed in the Discussion, stating the limiting factors (in terms of species) of the method. Although in this study only 3 species were examined, I believe that its important to inform the readers about the authors' recommendation regarding the potential usefulness in other species.
