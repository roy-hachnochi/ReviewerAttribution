The authors have done a rigorous job of addressing the comments of the initial round of reviews. Thank you for that effort. To clarify my comments on word embeddings in the context of topic modelling, I wasn't actually suggesting to use external resources for word embeddings; rather, since you are already building word embeddings, to use an alternative -- potentially more effective -- strategy for producing the clusters from those word embeddings. But your modifications to address this point are fine.
