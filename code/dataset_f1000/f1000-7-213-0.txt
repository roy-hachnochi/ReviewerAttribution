This work proposes a web-based tool allowing to identify a subgroup of samples that share similar molecular profiles based on gene expression information and visualize the results in various plots. It is written in R program language. This tool would be useful for easily dealing with clinical data and genomic data. One weakness is to only define two sample groups but not multiple groups.
