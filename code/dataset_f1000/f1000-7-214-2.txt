The second version of the article is quite similar to the first, the strong points remain the same, but the weak points about clarity as well. I was not specific enough in the first version, my bad. The list of issues that must be addressed in my opinion are the following: In Figure 2, indicate what the colors are, even if the color code is defined in Roadmap publications (it cannot be that the legend of a figure is in another paper). Also indicate somewhere what the legend is for the left bar (possibly in supplementary material, but it has to be defined somewhere in the article). In Figure 3, tell what the points represent. Looking at the figure raises many questions: why some tissues have more points than others? Where does the data comes from? What is the nature of the data? What is plotted exactly? What are the grey boxes? What is the definition for "significant enrichment"? What does p in the label of y-axis stand for? The nomenclature suggests it is a probability, why are some values negative then? The same questions apply verbatim to Figure 4, except the y-axis label. In addition, I found some additional typos that the authors may want to correct. Fix "required or state?" in Table 1 (should be "required for state" I suppose). Capitalize "roadmap" in the legend of Figure 3 and Figure 4. The "/" seems to be missing in the label of the y-axis.
