The authors present a method for annotating the genome using genomics data sets such as histone modifications, transcription factor binding and methylation. The algorithm is applied to data from a given tissue. It takes as input a collection of genomics data sets that have been binarized in a preprocessing step, such that each is represented by a binary vector over the genome. The method outputs a genomic vector of one of K states, such as "Promoter" or "Transcribed" (K=20 in their default model). The method uses a "model matrix" which defines, for each state-dataset pair, for a given base to be called as that state, if (1) the dataset *may* be positive for that base, and (2) if that dataset *must* be positive for that base. StatePaintR is likely to be an impactful method. Genome annotations are a very useful product of epigenomics data sets, as evidenced by the wide array of methods developed for their production. StatePaintR is an alternative to existing algorithms based on probabilistic models that is much simpler and more transparent. Unfortunately, the manuscript is difficult to understand in its current form because many key definitions are missing. Several examples: - The term "functional category" is not defined. - The Introduction uses the term "functional category" to mean a state, where later that term is used to refer to a collection of data sets (such as "silencing marks") - The form of the input and output are not explicitly mentioned. - It is not explicitly mentioned that the model matrix is generated manually. Minor notes: - It is claimed that the information content of a state equals the sum of the cell values. However, it seems to me that the maximally-permissive value is 1 (neither required nor exclusionary), not 0. - P3: "3 bit code". Should be 2 bit code. - Figure 1: "red dotted arrows indicate non-matching rows". I don't understand -- each arrow connects to two rows, not just one.
