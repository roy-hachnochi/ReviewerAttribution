This is now a revised version, that has seen some important improvements. The authors state in the amendments that combined valve surgery was now an exclusion criteria and it is listed on page 5 but I still find it - also page 5, left, 3rd paragraph) as saying: â€¦ "All patients undergoing CABG surgery, either (?) or with valve surgery, will be included". Please correct! Furthermore, although listed, I still do not find information on how precisely existing preoperative rhythm disorders are assessed, documented, analysed and/or categorized. Authors mention that blood is planned to be taken for Tocotrienol measurements. In the protocol, however, I find no information about the timing, the test and method used, pre-analytical management, CV values, and so on. Status cannot yet be changed.
