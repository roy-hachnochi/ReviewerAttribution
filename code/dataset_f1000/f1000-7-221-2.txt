 26/02: This peer review report was mistakenly published with an Approved with Reservations status. It has now been corrected to an Approved. I have reviewed the Case Report “Evaluation strategies and cognitive intervention: the case of a monovular twin child affected by selective mutism”. I think that the paper is well written and offers a relevant clinical and research contribution to studies on selective mutism, a little know disorder that consists in an “inability to talk in unfamiliar contexts”. The case of a child monovular twin is very interesting because it allows to evidence the link between biological and environmental factors. I accept the work but I think that: It is necessary to insert more details on the clinical case. The child is a twin and interaction with her sister is a though factor for maintaining the mutacic behaviour, so, the relationships between the two sisters must be better presented. The cognitive-behavioural is the best approach for children with mutism. The authors can mention also others approaches for comparison (e.g. psychodynamic approach). Early diagnosis and surgery of selective mutism must be briefly presented. Some misprints are present in the text.
