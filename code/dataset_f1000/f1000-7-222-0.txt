I have read this submission proposal and all related information reported in (introduction, methodology, results, discussion and cited references). Considering my expertise in secondary metabolites and bioactive natural products isolated from invertebrates (defensive secretions and applied chemical ecology) and fungi (volatile organic compounds) I believe that I could analyze the reported information data with an appropriate, conceptual and methodological level to confirm that this report devoted to mycological exploration of Ascomycota-Xylariales in tropical Andean region has a quite recognized scientific standards for being published in F1000Research. In this context, please, I have some considerations regarding the submitted article: - it could be of great significant and relevance to evaluate some biogeochemical parameters of eco-geographical collecting zones for potential determining the zonal distribution of Xylariales in these areas, including any potential correlation with tree diversity. - It would have been highly didactic, and recommended, the inclusion, in the proposal submitted, of some photographs in real time, taken during the collection phase in the national parks, and some, comparative ones, taken during the preparation phase in the lab (for morphological purposes only!)
