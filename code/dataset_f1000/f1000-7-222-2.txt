Abstract: 4th line from top - change 'done' to 'inferred' because you can't be sure of an identification based on ITS blast. 3rd line from bottom, change sentence beginning "This data" to These data provide baseline information" The Xylaria sp. 3 is still listed as unidentified. The molecular phylogeny indicates this is likely X. curta. X. curta is expected from that area and has been collected before in that part of Ecuador. It is easily identified in photographs, with confirmation by examining spores and ascus plugs under a microscope. It is not clear why this point was not addressed in revisions, though it would require renumbering of the unidentified species in tables and figures and text. Also, Xylaria sp. 4 appears to be X. fossils based on the phylogeny. The abstract says there were 4 unidentified Xylaria species, but if sp. 3 is X. curta and sp. 4 is X. fossils, there are only two suspected undescribed species - sp. 1 and sp. 2. The conclusions say there were four unnamed species also, but X. fissilis is among the named species based on one collection, but sp. 4 has an identical sequence to the named one, so that is also X. fissilis and not a new species. The manuscript should not be indexed until the authors reduce the number of undescribed species from 4 to 2 and make the corresponding changes to the text throughout.
