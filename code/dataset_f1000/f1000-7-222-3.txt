Introduction. Because the aim is to compare these two parks in Ecuador, it is important that the elevation ranges of each are included, as well as the distance between the two parks. Methods, p. 3, last line seems to be an incomplete sentence. It ends with ‘BLASTn’ (NCBI) optimized for highly similar sequences (megablast), alignments that presented 100’ It is probably meant to say ‘overlapped 100%.’ Results: Text for Clade E does not match the phylogram. The text says that sp. 3 was related to another collection identified only at the genus level. However, the phylogram shows a well-supported clade (98% BS) comprised of sp. 3 and X. curta KP133352 ECU. I would expect X. curta to be reasonably common there. There is either an error in identification of KP133352 ECU or the text in resutls needs to be changed, and the abstract and first line of results and conclusions also need to be changed to include X. curta . That also means that the unidentified species need to be renumbered in the text, table, and phylogram, with sp. 4 becoming sp. 3. There are likely 3 undescribed species included in this study. The journal allows for photographs, and photos should be added to the manuscript. Even if photos were not taken of the fresh specimens, photos of the dried specimens can be used, and are very helpful. If photos of the asci, especially the ascus plug stained with iodine/Melzer’s reagent, and photos of the ascospores showing the germ slits, that would be very helpful also for future work. The ascospore length and width ranges, the shape and extent of the germ slit, and the shape and size of the ascus plug would be helpful additions.
