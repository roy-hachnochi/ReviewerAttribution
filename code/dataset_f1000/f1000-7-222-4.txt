The article "Xylariales: First results of mycological exploration in the Sangay and Llanganates National Park, Ecuador " provides internal transcribed spacer sequences from Xylaria isolates collected from Ecuadorian national parks. Information about fungal diversity in Ecuador is still scarce, which makes this manuscript relevant. Nevertheless, I have several concerns, mainly: Phylogenetic analysis using only the ITS sequence is very superficial, and, most likely, it wont show an accurate representation of the real evolutionary relationships between isolates. There is no mention about the morphological characteristics of isolates. Is the morphology congruent with the genotype? The manuscript needs major revision to improve clarity. Several suggestions are made in the file linked below. https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/linked/196501.Bence_Matyas_rev.pdf
