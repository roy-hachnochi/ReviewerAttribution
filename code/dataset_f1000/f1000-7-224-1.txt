There is no question that tuberculosis prevention serves as a pressing global health priority, and while the BCG vaccine is moderately effective, the variability in response among those inoculated raises important questions about what accounts for such variation. Dowd and colleagues make a strong case for the need to investigate more systematically the role of social determinants and psychosocial stressors in predicting BCG response. The call for a “Social Technology Lab” would fill a knowledge gap around how and when social determinants affect vaccination efficacy; however, it raises questions about at what level of measurement one would need to employ to get meaningful answers. Population scientists are often hampered by space constraints around questionnaires to obtain the necessary contextual information to understand psychological constructs, including psychological stress, and there is a need for a common vernacular when discussing stress (see Epel et al., in press 1 ). Similar harmonization around other relevant social factors likely tied to vaccination response is needed. Nevertheless, an interdisciplinary approach to understanding BCG efficacy is well warranted. There are a couple of minor concerns that, if addressed, could improve the paper. In paragraph 5, it would be helpful to specify the direction in which immune markers are associated with TB risk. In the following paragraph, the definition of stress could be more specific. In the context of psychosocial factors, stress occurs when one’s perceived demands exceed one’s ability to cope (Lazarus Folkman, 1984), which often results in a coordinated physiologic and behavioral response to adaptively cope with the perceived demands. Stress as an event, i.e., stressor, is relevant but presumably the stress-immune link of interest in psychological in nature.
