Interesting paper about the importance of frozen section in the diagnosis of Salivary glands lesions. The casistic is very wide and the results are innovative also if many guidelines report the need of performing Fine Needle Aspiration in the preoperative setting of a salivary gland lesion and I do not think that we can actually derogate from this guideline. Anyway this paper is worthy of indexing but some points need to be reviewed: The first sentence of the "FS process" in method section should be moved to the introduction to complete the paragraph about the frozen section. In the inclusion criteria the authors report that just major salivary glands lesions were analyzed but in the outcomes data they state that 5 cases were minor salivary glands glands in the palatal mucosa. Please clarify this point. In the discussion the authors state that the FS is used as "pre-operative method". I think that is more correct to define it an intraoperative method.
