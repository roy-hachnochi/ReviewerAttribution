This article is a concise study concerning with the identification of microsatellite loci in sea anemones Aulactinia stella and Cribrinopsis albopunctata, both belonging to family Actiniidae, from Avachinsky Bay of Kamchatka Peninsula. In the introduction the authors said "Sea anemones are known to live in clonal or partially clonal populations" but this is valid only for some (not all) sea anemone species and it is not possible to generalize. The metodology is detailed and all the source data are available to ensure full reproducibility. The authors mention that total DNA from pedal disc tissues of studied species was extracted, but they must justify why they choose this part and not other (column, oral disc or tentacles) of examined sea anemones for DNA extraction. The text is correctly written and obtained results are well exposed in the text and table 1. This article is a valuable contribution for sea anemone genetic population investigations and merit approval for indexing.
