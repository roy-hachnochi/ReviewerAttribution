MS ‘Identification of microsatellite loci in sea anemones Aulactinia stella and Cribrinopsis albopunctata (family Actiniidae)’ by E.S. Bocharova et al. is a methodical study related to the search and testing of polymorphic microsatellite loci in the sea anemones of above mentioned species of Actiniidae. Microsatellites are informative genetic markers for population genetic studies. Such approach is useful for obtaining information on many fundamental issues related to the reproductive strategy and spread of clonal organisms. Unlike well-studied commercial species, the biology of sea anemones is still remained unexplored in many aspects. Theory explaining the evolution of a larval stage and their long-distance dispersal ability requires genetic examination. The clonal nature of these organisms impedes application of mtDNA polymorphism and requires the search for other informative genetic markers such as microsatellites. The methods used in this study are modern and reproducible. Manuscript is well written and concise. Apparently, developed STR markers will be suitable in studies of other sea anemone species. I recommend the MS to be indexed.
