Well written article. Good analysis of available gene expression data to create gene signatures for ionizing radiation exposure. Good discussion of the identified genes' functions and roles in radiation response. Conclusions are well supported by the results. Hopefully the analysis and genes identified in this study will be incorporated and/or validated in future studies examining prediction of radiation exposure.
