The authors described a case of III atrioventricular block due to fulminant myocarditis that was managed with non-invasive transcutaneous cardiac pacing in the absence of ECMO. In this case the non-invasive transcutaneous pacemaker was a safe, effective and convenient device to revert arrhythmias. Nevertheless, as the authors stated, if there is the arrhythmia, the patient should be immediately started on ECMO, percutaneous cardiopulmonary support or ventricular assisted device. Authors should specify and discuss, what the most important arrythmias with negative prognosis to what extend are. Are there any efforts made in this case, to get information on the etiology of the disease (e.g. viral, autoimmune), was there any discussion on an endomyocardial biopsy. Data in children with regard to the prognosis and outcome in fulminant myocarditis should be added.
