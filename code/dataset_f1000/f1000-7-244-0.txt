K. W. Witwer presents some interesting findings in his brief report: Alternative miRNAs? Human sequences misidentified as plant miRNAs in plant studies and in human plasma. I consider the brief report scientifically good as well as well written. Additionally, I would like to recognize the effort made by K. W. Witwer on examination of the methodology and critical reviewing a recent publication by Liu and colleagues in 2017 1 . Here Liu et al. report plant cross kingdom RNAi in two human sRNA plasma sequencing studies. Here Witwer identify a number of methodology issues in the Liu et al. paper by reanalyzing the public available data that were used in their paper. Witwer concludes that the most likely explanation for the Liu et al. reported plant RNA results, detected in the human plasma datasets, are traces of human degradome fragments and not of plant origin. The central conclusion in the manuscript are line with the findings that Kang et al. 2017 2 reported based on a massive analysis of public available sRNA datasets comprising 10 billion sequencing reads. All in all supporting the null hypothesis that presence of xenomiRs are technical/contamination artifacts. Based on the overall impression of the paper it is scientifically sound and I can fully support the conclusions.
