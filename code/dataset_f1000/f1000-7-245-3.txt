The authors have focussed a very important issue in the context of Health Technology Assessment in India. Data availability and accessibility from both public and private sources is a big challenge while conducting HTA in any discipline. The authors have appropriately described their valid experiences in this article. The information provided in this article will be of use for practitioners of HTA in India. I recommend the authors to consider the following issues and address them: Authors can consider the programmatic data which is available. For example Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme had collected valuable patient wise data and programmatic management data including resources/technologies invested and used. Similarly other programmes like National AIDS Control Programme need to be looked into for data sources. Data available with non-government organisations which have been working on various health related interventions need to focused on. Data from academic institutions like IIT and universities where students and faculties are engaging in innovations and newer technologies need to be explored.
