In this meta-analysis, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of PSA kinetics in patients with mPCa. They concluded that higher PSA nadir during ADT treatment was associated with shortened progression time and survival. Although the topic was not new, the review has archival value. I have several concerns about the MS and I suggest major revision. In the aim of the abstract, “hormonal therapy” should be replaced by “ADT” with regard to the homogeneity of the terms. In the introduction part, an explicit statement of the participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) is essential. The ADT methods and cut-off point about the PSA indicators varied from different studies, which can result in potential bias. This limitation should be focused and comprehensively discussed. There were several grammar mistakes in the MS. For example, In the table 1. “Significance Prognostic Factor” should be “Significant Prognostic Factor”.
