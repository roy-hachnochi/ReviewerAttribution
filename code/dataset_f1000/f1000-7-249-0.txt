This results presented by Purnamawati et al., are potentially interesting; however, since the key findings of the paper hinges on the fact that breast cancer stem cells were used in the assays it is difficult to interpret the findings (i.e. no details of the source of cells or proof they are cancer stem cells was provided). Major concerns. 1. There is no details of the source of the cells, nor was the Aldefluor sorting of the cells shown. 2. Assay were not performed to confirm that cancer stem cells had been isolated (i.e. are these cells more tumorigenic than non-cancer stem cell counterparts? 3. Expression of ALDH1A3 should be compared in in the breast cancer stem cell versus non-cancer stem cell sorted populations to confirm that the Aldefluor+ cells have higher levels of ALHD1A3 than the Aldefluor- cells. 4. The culture conditions used to form mammospheres were not appropriate (should seed much lower number of cells in ultra-low adherent plates so that no cells are adherent.) Standard media for mammosphere assays in Mammocult media from Stemcell Technologies. Hence it is unclear if these are mammospheres.
