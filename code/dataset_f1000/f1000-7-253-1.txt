This article describes the strategy to improve the lack of physical characteristic of such natural active compound by developing the nanocarrier system based on polymer. The authors discussed the correlation between polymer concentration and the drug loading efficiency. The main objective as well as the concept is acceptable in term of scientific perspective. However, some lack important information in particular in the method session: how the drug-loaded nanocapsules was formed, the sample preparation on such evaluation e.g PXRD, and the detail on SEM analysis (magnification etc). The important data to conclude the successful approach are missing: solubility and/or dissolution rate. Also, the only PXRD data is not sufficient to conclude the stability issue of the drug-loaded nanocapsules. The description presented in the result section is not sufficient to explain the phenomenon found in this study.
