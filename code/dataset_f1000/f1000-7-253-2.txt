The overall construct of the manuscript is generally concise. The authors highlight the higher concentrations of polymer in the stirring solution during the production process yielded higher encapsulation efficiencies and smaller particle sizes. However, it is better to add statistical analysis to show the correlation between concentration of polymer with encapsulation efficiency and particle size.
