The study entitled: Evaluation of portal pressure by doppler ultrasound in patients with cirrhosis before and after simvastatin administration – a randomized controlled trial , is quite interesting and of clinical significance which could have a good impact on treatment of portal hypertension with Simvastatin, which is a safe and well tolerated drug. However, I have few comments: I think this study actually aims at evaluation of portal hemodynamics rather than portal pressure, because Doppler U/S can asses portal hemodynamics rather than measurement of portal pressure,therefore, i suggest a minor modification of the title: Evaluation of portal hemodynamics by doppler ultrasound in patients with cirrhosis before and after simvastatin administration – a randomized controlled trial Data on MELD score should be provided, we can compare the mean MELD score in the 2 groups. Did all patients in the 2 groups had an upper GI endoscopy before enrollment? If yes, the endoscopic findings should be shown to asses varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy. In the method section, the authors mentioned measurement of Random blood sugar and AFP but this was not shown in the tables. Were patients on beta blockers excluded from the study? Was there a drug free interval before enrollment? Why was the dose of Simvastatin escalated from 20 mg to 40 mg per day after 2 weeks? My recommendation is that, this manuscript is suitable for publication (accepted with minor changes).
