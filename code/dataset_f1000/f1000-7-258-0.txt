The submitted manuscript by Bence et al. is good work which is suitable for publication in F1000 research. Authors have compared the organic practices and conventional practices, and compared their effects on soil respiration which is very important aspect. Standard methodologies were followed which ensures reproducibility of the results. The findings were subjected to the statistical analysis and conclusion drawn nicely. However, I have below suggestions for improvement which may be considered as minor revisions: "Physical-chemical" could be replaced by "Physico-chemical" throughout the manuscript. In abstract, word "statically" should be replaced by "statistically" In result, "showing and increment around 10%." should be "showing an increment around 10%." The discussion could be added more so that the findings of the study will become stronger.
