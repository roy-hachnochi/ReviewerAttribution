Major issues: Abstract: The authors stated that the scanner is “inaccurate”. To my opinion this conclusion is far too general and not supported by the presented data. The research question is not sufficiently motivated. Why are the authors interested in the torso? Existing literature is not sufficiently discussed. Please consider Glock F et al. Pediatr Res. 2017 and Kuehnapfel et al. Sci Rep. 2016 Sample Size calculation: What is the null-hypothesis used for the sample size calculation and how does it relate to the research question? From the torso picture (figure 1), I conclude that the subjects are not undressed. This is unusual in anthropometric research. How does clothing impact your results? I have concerns that scanning posture is different for girls and boys. What is the impact of scanning posture on results? Could this be a reason for the different reliability results in girls and boys? The measure used for obesity is unusual to my opinion and should be better justified. WHtR is not a gold standard for defining obesity at least to my knowledge. Why not using BMISDS or WHR? Figure 2: Should be replaced by Bland-Altman plots which are more informative. Table 2: Confidence intervals of rho_c values are more relevant regarding reliability than p-values. Please replace. Figure 3: ROC analysis is not carried out correctly. Please provide the complete ROC curve and its corresponding area. Alternatively, I would recommend removing the analysis since WHtR is not a gold standard of obesity diagnosis as far as I know. Language polishing is required throughout the paper. Minor issues: Abstract: “Area under ROC curve oscillates…” This cannot be true. The area is fixed. Methods page 3, col 1: SD=224 can hardly be true Please provide times between first and second measurement.
