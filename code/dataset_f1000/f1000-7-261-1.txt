The authors report a novel tool to detect "spurious" hits in gene assignments. The methodology is based on the assumption that "homologous gene sequences" that contain a substantial amount of stop codons indicate that a gene is "not under selective pressure. The tool seems to be superior to the earlier tool (antifam) and is therefore a useful tool for automatic annotations of genomes. Although this assumption most likely is correct in most cases - it also might miss non-spurious genes, in particular orphan genes. It is generally accepted that there exist a birth and death process where novel (orphan) genes can occur from non-coding regions and also that existing genes turns into pseudo-genes. This could be discussed further. There exist quite good set of orphans in drosophila and yeast - it would be interesting to see how spurio would rank these. (I am aware that this tool is mainly for bacteria - but at least in yeast most of these orphan genes are single exon so it should be possible to run it I think).
