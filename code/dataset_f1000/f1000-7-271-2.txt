 Reference should be added in method sections. Ethanol production was represented in both % and gm/L. Please use only one unit uniformly. Long time fermentation (96 hr) should be done to ensure the efficiency of the isolate. Introduction should be improved to address the objective of the study. Compare your results with related published papers. Please indicate the advantage of kitchen waste over more economical source such as molasses. It is not clear what changes occur due to bacillus pretreatment. Without large scale fermentation, the conclusion may be misleading.
