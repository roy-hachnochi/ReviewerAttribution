The article is well written. Its structure is clear and the goals are well defined. Here below some minor issues. General Issue What is the reason taxa functionalities are not implemented in taxize, which already seems a general purpose package to work with taxonomic information? Introduction We found citation numbers for R to be very low. Does “its extensions” include all packages? Overall, it would be better to drop the sentence with citation numbers and keep it to R + easy development of packages, thus going fast to paragraph 2 which is more important to provide context for the taxa package “Database” is a very generic (technical) term. Would have expected “source”, or similar for source of taxonomic information, cf. http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#elements-source Methods Implementation Figure 1: we found ourselves drawing examples of the classes presented in figure 1. Would maybe be useful to add those to figure? If it is not possible for graphic issues, maybe could be useful to add them in the text, more or less as done in vignette of the package. In “manipulation functions” : “Finally, if the drop_obs option is TRUE (the default), any user-defined data assigned to removed taxa are also removed, ...” With the reassign_taxa and reassign_obs discussed above, it wasn’t immediately clear how taxa can be removed. Maybe update to “... data assigned to removed taxa (those without supertaxa matching the criteria) are also removed ...” Use Cases Use cases: one use case presented. Update title to “Use case”. The presented use case is very informative, no need to add more use cases Use case might have been stronger if taxonomic information from 2 sources was combined (e.g. GBIF and …) Here below some minor issues about the package: Consider moving CONDUCT.md to .github directory, as that directory is already used for CONTRIBUTING.md Add proper MIT License in LICENSE file README.md is now a combination of https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/blob/master/vignettes/taxa-introduction.Rmd and https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/blob/master/README.Rmd . Would keep README shorter (based on README.Rmd), with links to vignettes instead. Consider adding a pkgdown website, with references for functions + the two vignettes. Site can be build in docs/ folder and hosted on GitHub pages, cf. https://inbo.github.io/wateRinfo/ Add website to repo description in repo settings. Consider moving vignette figures to “vignettes/figures” subdirectory for clarity
