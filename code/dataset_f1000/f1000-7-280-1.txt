Our continuous exposure to a multitude of pathogens requires a greater understanding of the host response to heterologous infections and is fundamental for developing novel therapies and vaccines against infectious diseases. In line with this, heterologous immunity to viruses and bacteria is an extremely complex scenario as our immune response greatly differs upon viral versus bacterial infection. Thus, how our immune system makes a balanced response to control both viral and bacterial infections without killing the host is a fascinating area of research. In this review article, Cobelens and colleagues reviewed the available epidemiological data for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infections. The review is well written and provides interesting human observations that HCMV may contribute to the progression of latent TB to active disease. However, I have three major comments that potentially can improve the conceptual idea of the current review. 1) Type I IFN is a chief antiviral cytokine, which also plays a critical role in immunity to CMV infection ( Plos Pathogens , 10:e1003962, 2014). However, it has been well documented that type I IFN increases host susceptibility to some bacterial infections including Francisella tularensis ( J. Immunol. 169, 1665-1668, 2002), Listeria monocytogenes ( J. Exp. Med. 185:921, 1997) and Mtb ( J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 25:694, 2005 Nature, 511:99, 2014). This concept has been also supported by another recent study (JID, 290:270 2014) demonstrating influenza infection increased susceptibility to Mtb infection in a Type I IFN dependent manner. Although the authors briefly mention this idea, a cohesive expansion of this concept would provide further insight for the important role of type I IFN in viral infection and susceptibility to Mtb ( Trends in Immunology , 36:307, 2015). 2) The authors need to be cautious about their conclusions regarding a recent paper using nonhuman primate (rhesus macaques) cytomegalovirus vectors encoding Mtb antigens (RhCMV/MTB) ( Nature Medicine , 24:130, 2018) for the vaccine in TB. Although the protective data from this study are very impressive, the lack of cellular mechanism (e.g. the protection was independent of effector T cells) as well as the lack of several important controls including the empty vector (RhCMV) indicate that further investigations are required to have a better understanding of this approach as a vaccine in pre-clinical study prior to any human trial for TB. 3) The presented human observations that sexual contact and whole blood transfusion are the risk factors for tuberculosis is very speculative. Thus, the author should consider rephrasing this section at least in the abstract as it sounds very confirmative. Minor comments: 1) The Age-specific death rates from TB in England and Wales was also reported for 1913 and 1918 that shows the same pattern (Table 2) and the authors may want to include this reference: Langford, C. The age pattern of mortality in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic: an attempted explanation based on data for England and Wales. Med. Hist. 46, 1–20 (2002). 2) As there is no evidence of Mtb activating latent HCMV in the lungs (Page 3), which is also not the focus of this review, the author may want to consider removing this entire paragraph.
