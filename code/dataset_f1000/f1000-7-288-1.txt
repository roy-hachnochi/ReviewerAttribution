The authors present a case of pulmonary sarcoidosis arising in a country where tuberculosis may be more common. There is an error in the Abstract where a sentence is repeated " A 39-year-old man, known as hypothyroidism who had come to the emergency ward with dyspnea and coughing after exposure to detergents in a closed environment A 39-year-old man, known as hypothyroidism who had come to the emergency ward with dyspnea and coughing after exposure to detergents in a closed environment." In the abstract, the authors should revise the sentence "A 39-year-old man, known as hypothyroidism..." this probably should be revised to "A 39-year-old man with known hypothyroidism..." On page 3, please revise the sentence "The incidence of severe sarcoidosis is the most common cause of death." On page 3, the authors should provide information from the bronchoscopy procedure report as to whether there was airway narrowing visualized during the bronchoscopy. This is of particular interest since the patient's main radiographic abnormality is enlarged thoracic lymph nodes without any notable lung infiltrates (stage I chest x-ray). On Page 4, please consider revising "It is difficult to determine the prevalence and incidence of sarcoidosis without clinical symptoms." Perhaps rephrase to clarify that "It is difficult to determine the prevalence and incidence of sarcoidosis since the number of patients who have sarcoidosis but do not have symptoms is unknown."
