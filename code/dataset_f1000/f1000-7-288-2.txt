This case study presents a man with cough and dyspnea following exposure with irritant agent. His chest imaging showed a right hilar mass. Although this is not an unusual presentation of sarcoidosis but confirms that not all mass is malignant. My comments: What do you mean by "The incidence of severe sarcoidosis is the most common cause of death"? As Swigris et al. had published, did you mean "The underlying cause of death in most patients with sarcoidosis was the disease itself." Would you please clarify and rephrase this sentence: "The only in clinical examinations except for wheezing in the right side of chest" The authors please add the bronchoscopic findings; was there any mass or narrowing there. Please add the coronal view of chest CT; considering chest physical finding, wheeze, the reader would like to see if there is any narrowing in right main and/or intermediate bronchus. Please add the unit of measurement of ACE level. Please add the histologic slide of biopsy to the manuscript.
