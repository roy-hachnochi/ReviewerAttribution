The article “Using electronic biology based platform to predict flu vaccine efficacy for 2018/2019” is clearly presented and technically sound enough for publication in F1000Research online. It is well-written and supported by computational well-developed bioinformatics analysis. I just suggest one observations that should be clarified to enhance the work: - Fig 1 The ISM tree based analysis is not supported by a tool to predict grouping like bootstrapping method to confirm accurate grouping Finally, the article is recommended for publication in its present format.
