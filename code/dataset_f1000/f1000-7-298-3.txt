This is a provocative research article based on the authors' previous development of the informational spectrum method that takes into account how virus/receptor interactions modulate the antigenic cross-reactive phenotype of the HA protein of influenza A viruses. Using this method, the authors were able to shed light on the lack of efficacy of the vaccine against the H3 subtype during the 2014/15. They were also able to predict that in the US, the vaccine against the H3 subtype was going to be more efficacious than previously anticipated by the CDC. Later in the 2017/18 season, the CDC confirmed the authors' prediction. In this latest article, the authors predict that the selection of the vaccine candidate for the 2018/19 is less than ideal and suggest that vaccine efficacy against the H3 subtype will be lower than in this past season. This type of work is fascinating and necessary and hopefully it becomes part of the toolkit for the selection of vaccine candidates against influenza.
