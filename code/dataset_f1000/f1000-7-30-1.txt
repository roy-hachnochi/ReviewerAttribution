This paper makes an important point and goes some way to tempering the high expectations placed on precision medicine. Have the authors shown that the comparison of variances is a useful but not definitive tool for assessing whether or not the assumption of a constant effect holds? I think they have. Would more data be useful? I think it would. The paper could be misinterpreted as an attack on precision medicine. This is unfair. In this version, the authors have tempered their conclusions in an appropriate manner. The study is based on just 208 of the eligible studies. It seems likely that studies permitting the analysis are a select subset of the studies available. And, given the uncertainties surrounding estimates of variance components, it seems not unreasonable to assume that not all studies were equally likely to have detected differences in outcome variance. However, the authors have defined a method and a process permitting evidence in support of precision medicine to be discussed rationally.
