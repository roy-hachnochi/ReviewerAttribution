I have now read the paper by Dourmashkin et al. Dr. Dourmashkin is a highly qualified electron microscopist with decades of experience. The difference he finds between patient samples and controls is impressive and may lead to treatments that include attempts to prevent viral replication in patients early in disease development. The paper is inclusive but I was unclear whether any blinded studies were performed. Were their blinded samples given to the authors and could they identify patient vs. control sample? Perhaps I missed this in the paper but of course the question is of great interest. I approve the paper for publication but do believe that the ability to predict disease vs control material is of great importance.
