Animal trypanosomosis, as reported in the paper, is indeed a major constraint to livestock production systems in Ghana. The theme for the paper is therefore very appropriate. The study design and methods as presented appear to satisfy the standard requirements for a scientific study. The authors suggested the use of these trypano-tolerant animals as control measure for the problem of animal trypanosomosis but I hold a dissenting view to that. The N'dama and WASH cattle, even though are trypano-tolerant as indicated clearly in the study, can not be a solution to the problem for the following reasons: 1) The T. vivax challenge does not mean a 100% free from the impact as demonstrated in the study (PCV of infected slightly lower than that of uninfected for both breeds of the trypano-tolerant animals used in the study). 2) The N'dama and the WASH breeds are not very productive compared to the other breeds of cattle raised in Ghana, probably due to the T. vivax challenge. 3) The two breads of cattle in the study have the potential status as reservoir of trypanosomes to other breeds of cattle.
