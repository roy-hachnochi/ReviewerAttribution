This study proposes to retrospectively examine data previously collected from 3 prospective studies to test whether OSA is an independent predictor of postoperative delirium and acute postoperative pain severity. The study is described as ‘observational’ however, the study examines data that was already collected, and so I believe the title should be adjusted to reflect this a retrospective study. The incidence of delirium varies depending on the type of surgery and is lower than 20% for some elective surgeries. The type of surgery included should be mentioned. Whether the patients may have a history of chronic pain should be included. As well, although the patients had a history of using CPAP, ideally, whether the patients were compliant with the use of CPAP while in hospital and the number of hours of CPAP use should be reported.
