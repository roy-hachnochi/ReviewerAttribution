Other than the Materials and Methods dealing with the underpinnings of the statistical methodolgy, which are well beyond me (my failure, not the authors'), the article is clear and easy to understand. It provides an interesting look at the University technology transfer process, and is probably of interest to a wide variety of readers -- both those in the technology transfer field and those who care what federal research dollars can provide. The authors demonstrate that some universities are better than others at commercializing the research that their professors undertake. They provide an examination of whether universities can be good at all steps of the process; or whether it is more effective for a TTO to specialize at one, more high-leverage, point in the process. The article is clear, and the conclusions and findings are well-reported. The authors additionally provide a few suggestions of how to improve or make more efficient the technology transfer process. These takeaways will be of interest to readers in TTOs, especially. It would be interesting for a follow-on article for the authors to examine tech transfer efforts at different "types" of universities -- with or without a medical school; or at places where there have been blockbuster licensing deals vs. not. But clearly those ideas are well outside the scope of this article.
