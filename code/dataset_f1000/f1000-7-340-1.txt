In this manuscript, author Dan Clark describes an experimental protocol aimed at introducing undergraduate biochemistry students to mass spectrometry methods. Native electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometry (ESI-IT-MS) was used to produce mass spectra of unbound ribonuclease A (RNase A) and ligand – bound RNase A at differing concentrations of added oligonucleotides. Dissociation constants were determined using observed abundance ratios of bound and unbound RNAse A. However, dissociation constants with small concentrations of oligonucleotides were inaccurate, while the largest concentration produced a dissociation constant similar to that previously published. The author explains that these discrepancies likely result from limitations in the mass spectrometry equipment available, and concludes that a different protein – ligand combination may be better suited for the desired experiment. Overall this was a well-conducted investigation and meets an acceptable standard for publication. Contradictory to the conclusion of the author that another protein – ligand combination may be better suited to teach undergrads about mass spec, I found strong educational merit in the failures of this protocol to determine all dissociation constants. As an instructor of undergraduates I have found that students can often learn more when things do not work exactly as expected. The experiment presented here offers an opportunity for students to understand equipment limitations and may help students obtain a stronger understanding of how the diversity of charged states impacts the ability to collect an accurate mass spectra.
