Jacqueline Chou and others have done an excellent job of evaluating the consequences to the United States from a ban of Co-60 gamma emitting radioisotopes in medicine and industry. The problem is actually far larger than that. Several more gamma emitting isotopes are also in widespread use. Gamma radiation from Co-60 is highly penetrating which makes it ideal for some applications and unsuitable for others. It is comparable in energy to a 4MV linear accelerator. Many medical devices contain Cesium-137. This isotope has a much longer half-life than Co-60 (30 years vs. 5.26 years) and emits gamma radiation with much lower energy, making it easier to shield. It is the isotope of choice for blood irradiators. Much of the US blood supply is irradiated before infusing into human patients, particularly those who are immune-compromised. Another extremely prevalent isotope is Ir-192.This isotope of iridium emits a multiplicity of gamma rays with about half the average energy of Cs-137 and one fourth the mean energy of Co-60 gamma radiation. Ir-192 is most commonly used in industrial radiography. There are literally thousands of such devices used in almost every major construction site in the country involving the use of structural steel. There is no other practical way to verify the competence of welding at a construction site which is vital to the safety of the bridges and buildings under construction. Another important field which makes extensive use of radioisotope sources is the oil and gas drilling industry. Well logging sources (primarily Cs-137 and Americium-241 mixed with beryllium) are inserted into a well and reflected radiation is analyzed to determine the geologic structure of the layer being penetrated. Each of these applications is important and very difficult to replace with radiation producing electronic devices.
