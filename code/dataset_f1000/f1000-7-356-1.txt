This report describes families in whom a diagnosis of Fabry was made via renal services. This is a valuable piece of work and is a useful contribution to the renal literature. The descriptions are careful and succinct, and are complete with mutations analysis data and pedigree charts. Thus they illustrate the authors' main points which are of high clinical suspicion and attention to family histories in general renal clinics. There are also examples of rare presentations given, e.g. presentation with hypertension in a female patient and confirmed on biopsy. Some specific observations: Introduction: Para 4: There is a differential diagnosis associated with zebra bodies. It may be worth noting this (e.g. antimalarials, amiodarone) as they can give false positives. Para 8: Tahir, J Am Soc Nephrol 2007 Sep;18(9):2609-17 provides evidence that ACE/ARB use in addition to ERT is essential to reduce proteinuria, and this is regarded as standard practice i.e. it is more than "reasonable" as stated in para 8. Para 9: Ref 19 was an observational study performed in untreated Fabry disease (i.e. pre-ERT era) so this should be stated. Cases: Family A, brother 2: Was he also treated for LVH? If so, an ACE or ARB may have augmented the response from ERT. Family E: Were other investigations performed to exclude other more common causes of hypertensive renal disease in the index patient? Such severe hypertension as an initial presentation of Fabry is regarded as very rare. Another diagnosis may have co-existed. Family F: It would be unusual to find no lamellated bodies anywhere on an initial electron microscopic report of a renal biopsy from a patient with Fabry. Discussion: Screening for alpha gal in at risk populations is only reliable in males, not the whole population.
