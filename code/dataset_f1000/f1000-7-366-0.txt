This is a simple report on a range extension of a butterfly species. What makes it interesting is that the range extension is to the island of Guam, which is relatively isolated. It seems this species is on a rampage through the South Pacific, colonizing new isolated islands! The only reference I missed was the relatively recent book by Patrick and Patrick (2012) "Butterflies of the South Pacific". I unfortunately do not have access to my copy at the moment to see what it says about the species. Perhaps good to look at that?
