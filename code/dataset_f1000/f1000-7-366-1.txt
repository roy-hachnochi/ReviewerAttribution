A well-written report and discussion of a new species of butterfly to Guam. The record is a significant range extension for the species. Introductions to islands such as Guam are of concern because of potential economic and environmental effects and reports such as this are important to document. It will be interesting to see if the species has established or if this was a one-time occurrence.
