In this small pilot study authors tried to determine if increased pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) in a Holstein calf could lead to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which provide histologic evidence to diagnose acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP). The results showed that left ventricular dysfunction can associate with, or be one of the cause that a feedlot steer has the sign of AIP (hyaline membranes and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia). "If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?" Due to the small number of animals used in the study, a qualified statistician is suggested to verify the statistical analyses. "Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?" More histology images (figure 1) with clear labels of different type of lesions and pathology findings will help to support the findings shown in Table 4 and 5. Specific comments: 1. Methods Postmortem exam and histology Whether a board certified veterinary pathologist identified and scored the histologic lesions? Results More histology images (Figure 1) with clear labels of different type of lesions and pathology findings will help to support the findings shown in Table 4 and 5. 2. In the introduction or discussion part, I would like authors to refine the novelty of this study. Increased PAWP due to left ventricular dysfunction can lead to hydrostatic edema, diffuse alveolar damage, all of which are pathologically correlate with acute interstitial pneumonia. This concept is acknowledged in the cattle field and the results from this study confirmed this concept and suggest that in feedlot, ARDS can not be diagnosed without first rule out LV dysfunction.
