I think the addition of the "Preregistered versus No-pregistered" section, analysis, and table adequately satisfies the serious concerns that I have about p-hacking. I switch my status to "Approved". Even though I'm still concerned about including non-preregistered studies at all, I realize that such a restriction does not have strong precedent. But I would still encourage authors to focus on meta-analysis of preregistered studies in the future. One minor comment which I have on the writing is that "No-pregistered" should be "Non-preregistered".
