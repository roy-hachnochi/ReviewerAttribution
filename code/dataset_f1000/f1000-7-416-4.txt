This is a review of the manuscript “Gene Annotation Easy Viewer (GAEV): Integrating KEGG’s Gene Function Annotations and Associated Molecular Pathways” by Huynh and Xu. The authors present a method via a python script that can take KEGG IDs and output three tables of useful annotation information in the context of the molecular pathways. The manuscript is well written and is easy to read. I envision that the tool developed will be useful, although see the comments below. With corrections I think this manuscript will be a good contribution to the resources available to researchers working in genomics/transcriptomics in non-model organisms. Major Comments Although I can start the python script running using python3, the example_input.txt file cannot be found when I enter the relative path or the absolute path. This is despite the input file being in the same folder as the script. My bioinformatics technician also encountered the same problem. Thus it seems there is an error in the script that would need to be corrected prior to acceptance of the manuscript. Minor Comments This tool is presented as accessible and user-friendly, and the authors use the example from Ye et al. 2017 of “the query protein sequences in a fasta file”. But a protein sequence file is not provided with that paper (that I could find). Thus there an assumed knowledge gap that your reader needs to be able to use this tool as you describe. I suggest you provide additional information on how users can go from a genome with predicted genes (i.e. a .gtf or .gff3 file) to obtain those query sequences for input into the KEGG. You may also want to mention that researchers working with non-model organisms could start with a de novo transcriptome or as an input file.
