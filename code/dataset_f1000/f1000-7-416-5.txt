The authors of this article present a new tool, compiled as a single Python script, that aids in visualizing the gene annotation analysis results of the webserver-based KEGG services. The function of this tool is to generate an html-based view of the genes analyzed by KEGG tools and the appropriate pathways with which they are linked. The html view provides also an overview of the total existing pathways per associated genes, a task which can be useful for whole genome and metagenome annotation queries. The authors provide a thorough explanation about how the tool works and communicates with KEGG API by generating the appropriate links and exporting the generated data. The authors also provide some test datasets which can be used to generate the results mentioned in the manuscript. Nevertheless this reviewer considers this endeavour to have already been covered by other bioinformatic tools with which a comparison would be necessary to underline the importance of the new tool. For example tools like MEGAN can provide a thorough investigation of the existing KEGG pathways in a genome/metagenome (although by using an older and not commercial version of the KEGG database). Furthermore MinPath can be also used in combination with KEGG generated datasets in order to provide a similar pathway reconstruction analysis. Maybe the authors could elaborate a little bit more about what makes their tool more suitable than these already published tools. Moreover during the Conclusions section the authors do not seem to explain the methodology in order to examine the differences between Daphnia and Drosophila and how that (and similar analyses) can be achieved solely (or more intuitively) by exploiting this particular tool. In general this tool seems like a good addition to a bioinformatic pipeline for genomic or metagenomic analysis but this reviewer thinks that the author must emphasize more on the differences and/or improvements regarding similar tools.
