I think it is much better structured, and easily read now. I also think it is good that the manuscript now focuses more on the post-test counselling and I really see the value of genetic counsellors in this process. I think this aspect of counselling is very important and I am happy that the author highlights this area of work setting for genetic counsellors and hope that clinical genetic clinics can benefit from this article in building their organisations. After the revisions made I now approve the manuscript for indexing in F1000.
