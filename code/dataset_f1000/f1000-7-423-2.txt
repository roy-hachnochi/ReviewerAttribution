The heterogeneity and complexity of the asthma syndrome necessitates a different approach to its management. The use of clinical features and physiological and inflammatory data is no longer sufficient. Omics data and clustering will provide a greater chance of phenotyping asthma according to the mechanisms driving the disease in each phenotype, from which a composite set of biomarkers could be used to define and categorise the endotypes. This will help to develop personalised medicine for asthma that will allow for more precise treatment and also provide a source of novel targets and hence new treatments for each defined endotype. It is high time that personalised medicine be applied to the whole spectrum of asthma. The application proposed by the authors is very promising, because it allows a precise phonotyping of asthmatic patients and a correct choice of therapeutic agents, in particular as regards the treatment with biologicals.
