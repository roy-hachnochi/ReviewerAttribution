This cross-sectional study makes an estimate of the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder in very young children (18-36 months) in Bangladesh. The study utilised the opportunity of an ongoing rural surveillance system to carry out door to door screening using the M-CHAT tool enhanced by the use of flash-cards. Screen-positive status was checked by supervisors, and around two -thirds confirmed. These children were invited for diagnostic assessment, including where indicated assessment using a gold-standard diagnostic tool, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. A prevalence estimate of 0.75/1000 was concluded. The paper cites the most relevant literature, including a 2013 Survey of Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders in Bangladesh conducted for the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Bangladesh. That survey found a very similar prevalence estimate of ASD in rural children of 0.68/1000. It is therefore incorrect for the authors to state in the Abstract: "Age specific autism (18-36 months) in children in found higher in rural community of Bangladesh". The estimate is low in comparison globally. The methodology adopted for the study appears strong in the main. However, a prevalence estimate with confidence intervals would require that a random sample of children screened negative were also invited for further assessment. Some of the interpretation of results is also inappropriate as statements are made, for example, about the numbers of children identified with cerebral palsy, without clearly stating that this estimate is within only the screened positive and assessed children. The authors' conclusions are encouraging, that systems for early detection and management of neurodevelopmental disorders can now be used across Bangladesh, because of good primary health care and the establishment of Child Development Centres in the Medical College Hospitals.
