The authors of the manuscript conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder among children in Bangladesh. The manuscript has potential to contribute to the body of knowledge in the field. The authors should be congratulated on bringing to light this important, but often neglected spectrum of medical conditions in resource-limited settings. The manuscript reads well and conclusion stated were not beyond the findings of this cross-sectional study. I have no major concerns in the conduct and reporting of this study: Abstract: ‘04’ should be changed to word at the start of that sentence. Table 1: column two, consider reporting the number and percentage in the bracket and change the column heading to ‘Number (%)’ Discussion: Consider adding study strengths and limitations Discussion: In addition, consider adding sub-heading to the discussion section, such as ‘Main findings, ‘Implications for policy and research’, ‘Study strengths and limitations’ Conclusion: consider also adding conclusion at the end of the discussion section
