This is an interesting study and seeks to answer a very complex question which has occupied researchers in the region for some time. There is a general background literature which is used to support the views of the authors which are strongly expressed in terms of the need for participation of adolescents in all stages of the planning and development of interventions. If the evidence is so strong then it would seem to indicate that this research study itself is not needed and that the development of parental and family training in communication about sexuality should be developed. The methods used appear to me to be a form of realist evaluation. The paper would benefit from revisions to strengthen the methodological section and clarify the method with some recourse to the methodological literature. Participants: there are a large number of participants and there is a lack of detail about the backgrounds. A table of information about the participant which groups them into health professionals, educational professionals, parents, volunteers etc would be helpful. The social status of individuals within the groups may have some bearing on the way in which they interact. There is a strong sense of conformity to social hierarchy in Thailand and this may influence the way individuals feel able to express their true views. The study by Sridawruang cited in the discussion found that when parents were interviewed in focus groups they felt the need to present a publicly acceptable set of views which differed considerably to their experience expressed in one to one interviews. A little more detail about the workshops could shed some light on how the data emerged. The nature of the findings which are unsurprising, supports the opinions of the authors cited at the outset. The problems identified are not new. The purpose of the workshops in finding potential solutions is not met unfortunately.
