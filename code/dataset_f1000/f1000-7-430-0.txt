While the authors addressed some of the raised comments, I see a need for the following: Simplify Table 2 into 4 main groups as mentioned before. It is understandable that patients with seller masses may also have hyperprolactinemia and hypopituitarism. These cases should be counted under sellar masses category and not included under hyperprolactinemia and hypopituitarism catergories. This will clarify the spectrum of pituitary disorders seen in this study and will be easy to compare if similar studies from other centers were to be published in the future. Under ''miscellaneous'' group, galactorrhea and acromegaloidism need not to be included in the study unless there is a pituitary disorder to explain such diagnosis. The other case(s) of hypogonadism should be counted under the category of hypopituitarism (which is already present as a category by itself). For Table 3, the total number of adenomas (156) should exactly equal the sum of all adenoma subtypes. If a patient has a mixed adenoma (GH PRL secreting adenoma) it should be counted as 1 adenoma under GH category for example and not included both.
