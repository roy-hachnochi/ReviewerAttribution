Dr. Mansour and co-authors investigated the Spectrum of pituitary disease (Sellar and Parasellar Region Lesions) in a large cohort of patients from a tertiary referral center in the southern region of Iraq. This center receives patients with pituitary diseases from most of Southern Iraq, a population of 6-8 million. The authors provided a well written retrospective analysis of the study population. The manuscript is focused on providing an attractive epidemiological description of the studied patients. Abstract section : concise text and states clearly the objective of the report. In their conclusion they stated that a change in practice of adenoma treatment is needed. It would be more informative if they provide some data on how they reached to this conclusion. A minor correction: the following 2 sentences need to be separated by full stop mark instead of comma ( Pituitary adenoma constituted the bulk of sellar and parasellar region lesions, growth hormone secreting adenoma is the most common adenoma followed by NFPA and prolactinoma due to referral bias .) The following sections are well written and data were clearly presented: Methods and results . In addition they included an appropriate Statistical analysis. However, minor English language edition is needed. The discussion section described the study results in comparison with recent literature. Recent literature has been adequately addressed. The authors stated the limitation f their manuscript clearly. It would be interesting to provide some information on the prognosis of their study patients, both for surgically or medically treated patients. The references are clearly presented and conform the current standards. The tables are clearly written. Minor comments : although the manuscript is well written, however some revision of the English text needs to done.
