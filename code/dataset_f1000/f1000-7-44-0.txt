This article is acceptable to me for indexing. Background of this study is very important as indices of insulin resistance is changing very fast and all of them may not be sensitive for different population throughout the world. Study method is convincing and results are acceptable. 34.8% had coronary risk of 5% in 10 yrs which is reflective of population in real time. Tg/HDL and TyG indices were statistically Higher AUC than HOMA2-IR. Overall this is a acceptable study which can be reproduced in different populations of the world.
