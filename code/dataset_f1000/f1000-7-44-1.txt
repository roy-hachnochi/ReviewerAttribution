The article has been improved by the corrections made by the authors. I have only one suggestion. According to the calculations with the dataset used in the analysis (“Dataset 1: MMSPS Insulin resistance indices and coronary risk dataset”), the formula used by the authors is the one indicated by Salazar et al. 2017, as it is actually indicated in the text that cites reference 8: "ln [Fasting triglyceride (mg / dl) x Fasting glucose (mg / dl)] / 2" So, that is the formula that should be included in the text of the article (version 2). Incorrectly, the formula is written in the text as: "ln [Fasting triglyceride (mg / dl) x Fasting glucose (mg / dl) / 2]", as reported by Simental-Menda et al. 2008.
