This is an interesting and well written case describing isolation of Elizabethkingia mircola in a patient with Cystic Fibrosis during a period of clinical deterioration. The authors have addressed previous referees comments. I would add that there is a paper by Dervla et al. 2018 in Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious disease which highlights the prevalence of an E. miricola cluster over other Elizabethkingia species among UK cystic fibrosis patients. However the paper by Dervla et al. concentrates on identification rather than clinical course and management which Frost et al. describe. I would point out that in vitro sensitivity of pseudomonas will not always predict in vivo response and the ciprofloxacin used could have actually treated the pseudomonas as well as the E. miricola thus making it more difficult to be definitive that the clinical decline was entirely due to E. miricola and not the pseudomonas .
