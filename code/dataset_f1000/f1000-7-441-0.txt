I have reviewed the article and here are my comments: This patient had the wrong diagnosis made and potentially could have had a disastrous complication of penile gangrene. The diagnosis was ischaemic priapism of 12 days and the initial treatment was correct but deemed a failure. After aspiration in this context a hyperdynamic flow occurs due to a reactive hyperaemia with reperfusion. The Doppler performed after aspiration therefore records a high flow whereas the perfusion within the small vessels and tissues is absent and is necrotic and later fibroses down. To then embolise a penis that already has necrotic tissue is dangerous. This patient did not have high flow priapism.
