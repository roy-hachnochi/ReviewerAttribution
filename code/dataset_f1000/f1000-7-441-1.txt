You provide an intriguing report and suggest a new treatment consideration for priapism. This specifically applies to the patient who has non-traumatic refractory high-flow priapism that apparently has evolved from a low-flow state in a sickle cell disease patient. Your success is applauded. There are some questions. Some important data would be helpful to include to convince the reader about your findings. For instance, do you have the data for arterial blood gas measurement from the penis with blood aspiration that correlates with your observation of bright red blood? What were the color Doppler ultrasound imaging parameters that are increased? What were the reduced blood flow parameters after treatment? Perhaps a simple table of before and after blood flow parameters by the ultrasound technique would be very helpful for the reader. A strong suggestion is to include arrows on your figures to show exactly where the embolization was performed. Legends for each figure can then specify the observation based on the location of the arrow. Although this has been a successful technique, it is clear that it has a role specifically in this sort of patient only after high-flow priapism has been confirmed. This would not be a technique that would mistakenly be done for low-flow priapism. Otherwise, serious complications could be expected in the latter condition. It is suggested to the authors to emphasize this point strongly in your conclusion statement.
