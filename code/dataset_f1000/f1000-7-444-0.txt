This is the report describing a patient with Pott's spine who also had cancer of bladder. Patient presented with a picture of compressive myelopathy along with constitutional symptoms. Authors did the typical work up and confirmed the diagnosis of Pott's spine based on microbiological data. In the case description, duration and progression of symptoms are not clear. In the endemic areas with TB it is not uncommon for patients to present with extra pulmonary TB. Given the typical presentation described in this case, Pott's spine still remains an important differential, despite the known diagnosis of cancer. It is well known to scientific community to consider the diagnosis of Pott's spine in such cases in endemic areas hence this case doesn't add anything in the existing literature.
