            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: The world prevalence of obesity in adult population in 2014 was nearly 13% while in Indonesia, it has reached 32.9% in the same year. Obesity is an established risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. A large proportion of people who had succeeded to reduce body weight failed to maintain it (weight cycling). Studies were inconclusive about the best composition in the diet for such people. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the body composition changes resulted from low calorie high protein and standard protein diet programme in obese people with history of weight cycling. 
 Methods: This is an open-randomized clinical trial of weight loss program as a part of a larger study researching the effect of low calorie high protein diet to body composition, oxidative stress, inflammation marker and metabolic syndrome in obese with weight cycling. A total of 61 adult obese men and women with history of weight cycling were recruited. Subjects were assigned to low calorie diet and were randomly distributed into two intervention groups, namely high protein group (22-30 % of total calories intake) and standard protein group (12-20%). Anthropometry and body composition data were taken at baseline and at the end of the study. Subjects were followed up to 8 weeks with daily reminder and weekly counselling . 
 Results: Fourty five participants completed the study. There were significant reductions in in body weight and body mass index (BMI), fat mass, fat mass percentage, muscle mass, and gain in muscle mass percentage occurred in both groups (Standard protein: P&amp;lt;0.001; High protein: P&amp;lt;0.001 for all variables except for fat mass P= 0,001) with no difference between group (P&amp;gt;0.05). 
 Conclusion: Calories deficit with either high protein or standard protein for 8 weeks brought about significant reduction in body composition">

  "description": "Background: The world prevalence of obesity in adult population in 2014 was nearly 13% while in Indonesia, it has reached 32.9% in the same year. Obesity is an established risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. A large proportion of people who had succeeded to reduce body weight failed to maintain it (weight cycling). Studies were inconclusive about the best composition in the diet for such people. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the body composition changes resulted from low calorie high protein and standard protein diet programme in obese people with history of weight cycling.
Methods: This is an open-randomized clinical trial of weight loss program as a part of a larger study researching the effect of low calorie high protein diet to body composition, oxidative stress, inflammation marker and metabolic syndrome in obese with weight cycling. A total of 61 adult obese men and women with history of weight cycling were recruited. Subjects were assigned to low calorie diet and were randomly distributed into two intervention groups, namely high protein group (22-30 % of total calories intake) and standard protein group (12-20%). Anthropometry and body composition data were taken at baseline and at the end of the study. Subjects were followed up to 8 weeks with daily reminder and weekly counselling.
Results: Fourty five participants completed the study. There were significant reductions in in body weight and body mass index (BMI), fat mass, fat mass percentage, muscle mass, and gain in muscle mass percentage occurred in both groups (Standard protein: P&amp;lt;0.001; High protein: P&amp;lt;0.001 for all variables except for fat mass P= 0,001) with no difference between group (P&amp;gt;0.05).
Conclusion: Calories deficit with either high protein or standard protein for 8 weeks brought about significant reduction in body composition"

Obesity is an established risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. A large proportion of people who had succeeded to reduce body weight failed to maintain it (weight cycling). Studies were inconclusive about the best composition in the diet for such people. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the body composition changes resulted from low calorie high protein and standard protein diet programme in obese people with history of weight cycling.<br/> <b>Methods: </b>This is an open-randomized clinical trial of weight loss program as a part of a larger study researching the effect of low calorie high protein diet to body composition, oxidative stress, inflammation marker and metabolic syndrome in obese with weight cycling. A total of 61 adult obese men and women with history of weight cycling were recruited. Subjects were assigned to low calorie diet and were randomly distributed into two intervention groups, namely high protein group (22-30 % of total calories intake) and standard protein group (12-20%).

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that in 2014 there were approximately 600 million people aged 18 years or more diagnosed as having obesity, which was equivalent to 13% of overall world’s population (<a target=xrefwindow href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/" id=d7438e222>WHO data on obesity</a>). In Indonesia, the prevalence of obesity has also doubled from 14.8% in 2007 to 32.9% in 2014. Especially in the capital region of Jakarta, ranked fifth in the list of provinces with the highest prevalence of obese population among the 34 provinces in Indonesia, with a prevalence of 16.2% out of approximately 10 million population in 2014<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. Being overweight and obesity increases the risk of developing various non-communicable diseases, especially hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic diseases. Changes in metabolism at the cellular level in obese people leads to an increase in lipogenesis, which later increases the size of adipose tissue without adequate angiogenesis thus causing hypoxia and cell death. Those two conditions initiate inflammation mediators with increasing oxidative stress and further exacerbates changes in metabolism, which leads to the development of chronic diseases<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d7438e234>Weight loss programs through food intake and physical activity adjustments are often prescribed to attenuate obesity. However, a considerable proportion of obese people who had previously succeeded in losing weight, failed to maintain the achieved weight-loss long-term and consequently regaining body weight. The state of alternating loss and gain in body weight is called weight cycling. Weight cycling brings about changes in body composition, namely fat mass rise and fat-free mass deprivation. Weight loss intervention towards weight cycling bearers results in unfavorable outcome upon body composition, since fat free mass will be dampened in accordance with overall body weight loss. This condition causes reductions in resting energy expenditure (REE), which precipitates further weight gain and worsening of body composition<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d7438e241>Previous studies have been inconclusive on the correlation between weight cycling and body composition. A study by Oetoro <i>et al.</i> showed that subjects with a history of weight cycling had a worse response upon participating in low calorie standard composition diets, with higher fat mass and lower muscle mass when compared to first-encounter obesity subjects<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. A study by Byrne <i>et al</i>. also showed that regaining body weight after successful weight loss was not accompanied by the increase of fat-free mass<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. On the other hand, in a study by Prentice <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> and Heitmann <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup> showed that there was no difference in fat free mass between usual obese people and obese people with weight cycling. Previous studies have been inconsistent on the results of low calorie diets with varying food composition upon obese people with weight cycling. A study by Layman <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, as well as study a by Parr <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>, showed that low calorie diets with higher protein gave rise to a better body composition outcome, in which the former found that a high protein diet resulted in weight loss with better fat mass-fat free mass ratio, and the latter showed that a significant difference was seen among high protein interventions. However, a study by Luscombe <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> showed that high protein intake did not result in significant differences compared to high fat diet based on weight loss and decrease of chronic disease risk. A study by Farnsworth <i>et al</i>. also showed that there was no difference in fat mass decrease between high protein and standard protein diet<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether low calories with a high protein diet result in a better outcome on body composition when compared to a standard low calories diet in obese people with history of weight cycling.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d7438e300>Methods</h2><div class=section><a name=d7438e303 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Study design</h3><p class="" id=d7438e307>This is an open-randomized clinical trial of dietary consultation for weight loss program as a part of a larger study assessing the effect of low calorie high protein diet to body composition, oxidative stress, inflammation marker and metabolic syndrome in obese with weight cycling. There are two intervention arms, both with 1000 kcal-caloric restriction, one with high protein (22–30% of total calories intake) and one with standard protein (12–20%). The allocation ratio between the two intervention group is 1:1. No major changes to the methods was made during the study (original study protocol is available in the supplementary material along with a completed CONSORT checklist; <a href="#SF1">Supplementary File 1</a> and <a href="#SF2">Supplementary File 2</a>)</p></div><div class=section><a name=d7438e317 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Participants</h3><p class="" id=d7438e322>Candidates were obtained from a list of patients from the previous year, based on a medical records summary of civil workers’ health service center of the special capital region of Jakarta, from which we had basic data on gender, weight, height and BMI (Pusat Pelayanan Kesehatan Pegawai Provinsi DKI Jakarta). Identified eligible candidates were contacted by phone to invite them to participate in the study. Considering difficulties finding subjects only from medical records, respondents were also recruited from other places that have the same characteristics as civil workers of the special capital region of Jakarta. This was performed by advertising the study to the public, broadcasting via social media. Initial screening for subject recruitment was any men or women, more than 20 years old, with a body mass index ranging from 25 – 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p class="" id=d7438e328>Since the definition of weight cycling has not been established yet, different criteria are used among various previous studies. In this study, weight cycling was defined as a history of weight loss ≥2 kg and regaining the weight into or exceeding the initial body weight at least twice in the last five years. Weight cycling history was identified from self-filled questionnaires recording the history of body weight changes. This definition allowed us to pick subjects with weight cycle for intervention and control groups with homogeneous baseline characteristics, as was demonstrated by statistically insignificant differences between these two groups.</p><p class="" id=d7438e331>Initial screens of patients was performed via interview to determine eligibility to participate (see <a href="#SF3">Supplementary File 3</a> and <a href="#SF4">Supplementary File 4</a> for form used in the interview and form used to gather demographic information respectively). Subjects were excluded if they had diabetes mellitus (identified from history taking and fasting blood glucose), having a history of gastrointestinal tract resection, having hormonal disorders (such as abnormal thyroid, identified from interview), using hormonal contraception, menopause, and having kidney function disruption (identified from serum urea and creatinine levels). At the point of recruitment, most of participating subjects were living sedentary lives and were instructed to perform physical activity at their usual level during the 8 weeks of diet intervention.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d7438e340 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Ethics and consent</h3><p class="" id=d7438e344>This study has been approved by the Health Research Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia – Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (approval number 237/UN2.F1/ETIK/2017.

The high protein (HP) group, as the treatment group, obtained counseling about weight loss programs by applying a low calorie-high protein diet with a diet menu composition of 22–30% protein, along with instructions for allowed cooking method. The control group receiving a standard protein (SP) proportion and were counseled about weight loss program by means of a low calorie-balanced composition diet with a menu comprised of 12–20% protein. Caloric intake and food composition for each subject were calculated according to history of daily caloric intake. During the 8 week of the diet program, subjects were instructed to reduce their daily caloric intake by 500 – 1000 kcal from their previous usual daily intake, with limitation in low calorie diet range (800–1500 kcal.day) of calorie intake. History of previous daily caloric intake were obtained from food recall of a 24 hour period by asking type of food, cooking method, and estimation of amount of food consumed by using household size based on food photo books issued by the Individual Food Consumption Survey Team, Ministry of Health of Indonesia. Subjects were asked to fill daily logbook to record daily consumption, food photographs, size, and the cooking method.</p><p class="" id=d7438e366>Follow up for each subject was performed once daily by person-to-person contact.

Disparity of gender proportion within both groups, with only three men in the SP (11%) group and the seven men in HP group (26%) probably could have had an effect on the output. This in light of the discovery of Smith <i>et al</i>., that there was significant difference of basal and post-absorptive rate of muscle protein synthesis as well as anabolic response to feeding and exercise training between men and women with obesity in older adults<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d7438e1747>In this study, it was found that there were no statistically significant differences in weight, body mass index, fat mass, and muscle mass between low calories high protein diet intervention group and low calories standard protein diet. This finding contradicted the result of the study by Layman <i>et al</i>.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> that evaluated adult women with BMI of more than 26 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which were divided into two groups; protein group (30% protein, 41% carbohydrate, 29% fat) and carbohydrate group (16% protein, 58% carbohydrate, 26% fat). In that study, the protein group underwent better body weight decrease with preferable fat mass/fat free mass compared to carbohydrate group.</p><p class="" id=d7438e1760>In this study, subjects in both groups were not assigned to perform a particular exercise yet they were advised to perform their physical activity as usual, and later it was discovered that the level of physical activity had no correlation with the change in the anthropometry measurements and body composition. Meanwhile, in other studies, physical activity was shown to increase energy expenditure<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> and helped protein synthesis<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Another marked difference between this study and the study from Layman <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> was that in the latter study, subjects’ compliance towards high protein intake were inevitably higher since the intake was given directly from the laboratory whereas in this study, subjects were only given intake recipes. We undertook measures to control the subjects’ compliance upon the assigned intake, with routine follow-up through daily reminder by phone and weekly meetings, yet most of subjects’ were reluctant. Moreover, we perceived that subjects in the high protein group tended to have poorer compliance than the standard protein group. It probably could have an effect on the overall result. This study were also contrary to the study by Piatti <i>et al</i>.<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> that found that a high protein diet resulted in a better outcome of body composition even in a shorter period of intervention. Although this contradiction could be explained in part by the difference in proportion of protein over total calorie intake whereas in this study, protein made up only 30% of total calorie intake while in Piatti <i>et al</i>., the proportion of protein consumed was up to 45%.</p><p class="" id=d7438e1791>In people with weight cycling, it was found that there was a disruption in protein anabolic capacity, which possibly stems from defects in amino acid transport into cell<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Hence, people with weight cycling need much more protein intake to increase its synthesis inside the body. A 30% protein intake in this study was possibly inadequate to compensate for the protein deficit present in people with weight cycling. We deduce that higher protein intake is required to decrease the rate of amino acid destruction since amino acid intake had already been diminished due to caloric restriction<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Moreover, the thermogenic effect of protein is so high that it will increase energy expenditure thus enhancing calories deficit. Reduction in amino acid oxidation needs to take place before nitrogen equilibrium can be achieved in the presence of efficient amino acid utilization caused by an energy deficit. Even though there are no significant difference between the two groups, the changes in anthropometry and body composition were found to be significant in pre and post intervention. Finally, this study demonstrated that total energy intake rather than protein content is the most important key in weight loss attempt<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>–<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d7438e1813>Discrepancies of results in this study from most of the other study could also be influenced by some limitations of this study. This study involving only very limited participants conducted in a relatively short period of intervention hence its power to show outcome difference among two group with small variant of protein intake was limited. The study population was representative of obese individuals with weight cycling history without any history of other disease and also considering the small sample size, these result may not be generalised to other populations. Our finding warrant further exploration on more of the obese population and with a larger sample.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d7438e1819>Conclusion</h2><p class="" id=d7438e1822>In a short term weight loss program, the most important factor is caloric deficit rather than protein proportion. In obese people with weight cycling, a protein proportion of 22 – 30% among total caloric intake has not been able to affect body composition, especially muscle mass. Further research with longer intervention durations are required to discover the sufficient amount of protein which can give rise to muscle mass improvements in obese people with a weight cycling history.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d7438e1826>Data availability</h2><p class="" id=d7438e1829>Dataset 1: Harvard Dataverse.
