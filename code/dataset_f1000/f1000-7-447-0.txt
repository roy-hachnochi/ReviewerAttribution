The manuscript is confused and the authors did not explain exactly what the hypothesis is? The conclusion in the abstract shows p values, this is not common and not interesting. The authors should write more about the role of protein in inflammation. BMI and weight are not body composition measurements. The diets were low carb and low fat and what was the exact protein intake expressed in g/kg/d, because 21% of protein is a diet with high protein intake? Normally, CRP values are not parametric data.
