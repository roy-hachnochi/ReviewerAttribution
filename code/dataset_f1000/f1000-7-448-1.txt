The article introduces a new very interesting ultrasound examination to be used for the study of CKD. The parameters used to perform the ultrasound measurements to be correlated with renal fibrosis appear to be very difficult to measure and operator-dependent. The standardization appears difficult and very difficult to obtain. The vascular component during fibrosis is not taken into consideration and the correlation of the new ultrasound measurement with renal resistance indices is not analyzed. CKD is reduced to the fibrotic component only, without considering the vascular alterations that underlie interstitial changes.
