Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. I hope my comments are useful to you. Introduction : Can you check the accuracy of the figures related to HCAI in developing countries please. Intervention : The design of the educational intervention was face to face workshop. Given that this was the intervention, it needs to be described in much more detail. What other types of educational interventions were considered and why was this type chosen? Can you please add a referenced section to the introduction. Design : The study design was quasi experimental. The authors need to explain more fully how the study met the criteria for quasi experimentation. Could it be more accurately described as an interventional study? Sample : The participants were chosen by the infection prevention staff in each hospital. How did this occur? it needs a better explanation and the threat of bias also needs to be discussed. It seems to me that this may lead to targeting only staff who were 'known to' or perhaps were friendly with the infection prevention team. Discussion : The discussion section needs to be developed more fully. In the opening paragraph, the authors state that there was no improvement in either knowledge or prevalence of HCAI's after the workshop. Did the study measure prevalence of HCAI's before and after the work shop? If not, then you might review making this statement. There is an attempt made to elucidate why the intervention did not work but it needs more than this. It would benefit from discussion of the design. Is there value in assessing knowledge immediately post intervention? Did you consider a longitudinal design? Overall, there is some merit in this paper but it needs further development.
