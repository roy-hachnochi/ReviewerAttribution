This revision addresses the major issues associated with the code and manuscript, and the paper should thus be accepted. However, two minor issues associated with the manuscript have not been dealt with, and the author's reply to reviews does not explain this decision. To reiterate: The statement in the third paragraph of the introduction starting "Papers have been criticised for using too many decimal places..." is still not supported by a citation (the cited paper is an example of a paper using high precision despite a small sample size, not a criticism of this practice). It should be simple to re-word the sentence or, if papers have been criticized for this practice, cite examples. it would be better to cite the paper describing rentrez, rather than the CRAN repository These issues may seem trivial, and they should not hold up the acceptance of this manuscript, but I think they should be addressed in a final revision.
