Barnett's article tests the adherence of papers in 23 journals to Cole's guidelines on the numerical presentation of percentages. As the author of the guidelines I acknowledge a competing interest. The paper is well designed, executed and reported, and it has a clear message - many papers give percentages to excessive precision. I have a few minor suggestions for improving it. 1. The term "accuracy" used several times in the Introduction and elsewhere should more correctly be "precision". 2. Did the algorithm for identifying percents allow for the possibility of the % appearing preceded by a space? 3. Looking at the R code I note the long lists of alternative spellings. First converting all text to lower case would have substantially simplified this process. 4. The spikes in Figure 1 are interesting. The author suggests they represent digit preference, which may be true, but I would have thought it worth formally checking some of them to see. 5. The paper starts with an apt quotation from Einstein. I wanted to draw the authorâ€™s attention to another apt quotation, from Gauss, which appears as a response to my original Archives of Disease in Childhood paper here . It is "Lack of mathematical education does not become more evident than by excessive precision in numerical calculation." Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). Tim Cole
