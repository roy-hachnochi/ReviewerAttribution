The case report is well written. The title is not addressing the case. Perhaps it can be reformulated to directly refer to the case. The statement "however resuming treatment at a lower dose helped to resolve her symptoms as well as provide a longer life-expectancy" - how does reduction of the dose provide longer life-expectancy? The provided figures, particularly Figure 2, are not clear. Was any local treatment given to the patient?
