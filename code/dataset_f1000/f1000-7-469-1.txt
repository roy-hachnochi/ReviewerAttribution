I think this is an excellent paper and is adding more knowledge to the literature. I really like the conceptualization of assessing the effect of Haruan fish extract ( Channa striatus ) on chest and leg wounds post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Dr Musa and his co-authors have discussed appropriately in the context of the current literature. Interestingly, the authors have used suitable methods and in my opinion, they have provided sufficient information and source data to allow other researchers to repeat different steps of wound healings in other organs of the body. I believe, no additional changes are required. The design, including sample size, wound infection, mobilization, health related quality of life, production of Haruan capsules, specifically the flow chart, and the methods, are perfectly prepared. Results are presented accurately and the conclusions are justified and supported by the data.
