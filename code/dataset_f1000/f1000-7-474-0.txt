Using a published data set, the authors built a model based on gender-specific gene expression to predict lithium treatment response in bipolar disorder patients. Here are my questions and concerns: The authors realized that the sample size is small and the results will need further confirm. Is there any other similar (lithium treatment response) clinical trial/data available to test the predicting model? After the Step 1 analysis, why not exclude the four samples that their genders had been mis-classified? (Since the clinical data for those four patients may be also mis-labelled.) Data accuracy is critical for building models, especially when dealing with small sample size. Those three genes, the ABRACL , FHL3 , and NBPF14 , which classified female responders seem not differentially expressed between female responders and female non-responders (Table 5). Please explain why this might be happened. What is the known function of those 5 genes that chosen for classification of male and female responders? The authors might want to discuss the possible molecular mechanism of those gene function related to lithium treatment response in bipolar disorders. Since the authors re-analyzed data from a previously published study, a comparison of the findings from this study to the original one may be necessary. I understood that the original study looked at differences between responder and non-responders, regardless of genders. Is there any gene, of which its expression differentiates responder and non-responder, overlapped with what the authors found in this study? What will be found if apply a machine learning approach to this data set without classifying patients by genders?
