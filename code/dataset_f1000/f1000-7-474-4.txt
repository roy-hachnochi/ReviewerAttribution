The authors demonstrated that sex-differences gene expression might contribute to lithium treatment response using microarray expression data. Major comments: A samples size of 60 might be too small to determine the sex effects. Can the sample size n=60 provide adequate power for data interpretation, especially separated men and women for study sex-effect on gene expression? The authors stated that their predictive model for lithium responders with an ROC AUC 0.92 for men, and 1 for women. If the prediction accuracy is so significant, what are the potential biological mechanisms beyond these genes? More discussion regarding the biology of those genes should be included in the paper. Once again, if the prediction accuracy is so significant, it is needed a replication study using different data sets? In summary, the authors claimed the prediction model with very high accuracy; it should be included either functional validation of those genes or a replication study population. Specific comments: Methods - study design, it might be better to use a flow chart to demonstrate the study design. Methods - study design, please clarify the rationale of filtering out “250” genes. Table 1 shows total study population n=60, but figure 1 legend shows male: n=41, female: n=39? Figure 2: please elaborate the data presented in Figure 2. The key results for each of the four panels should be summarized in Results. Table 2 and Table 4, the log FC threshold of 0.5 or 0.3 might be too low. The changes in gene expression are very subtle in Table 4. Table 2, are there any gene up-regulated in males? /downregulated in females? Limitations of the study should be addressed in Discussion.
