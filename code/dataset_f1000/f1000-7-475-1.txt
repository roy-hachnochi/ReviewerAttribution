This case report details a patient with cystic fibrosis, chronically colonised with pseudomonas aeruginosa, receiving intravenous ceftazidime as part of their treatment for an acute exacerbation who develops drug induced immune haemolytic anaemia. Ceftazidime is often used as part of the first line intravenous antibiotic regime in patients with cystic fibrosis and those with bronchiectasis who culture pseudomonas aeruginosa. This report highlights a potentially life threatening effect of this commonly used drug for which there are no firm data on frequency but haemolytic anaemia is listed on the summary of product characteristics. I would postulate that events of drug induced immune haemolytic anaemia are under reported. It is important that clinical teams remain alert to the potential undesirable effect of this well used drug, particularly as many patients may be administering ceftazidime themselves as part of home intravenous therapy regimes to treat their acute exacerbations.
