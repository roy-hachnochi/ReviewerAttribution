 The authors explored 73 diabetes patients treated with basal insulin regimen, starting from Basalin and then switched to Lantus in hospitalized setting based on electronic medical records from 2005 to 2016. The main outcomes showed further fasting blood glucose reduction with similar insulin required and similar safety profile. Meanwhile, the study released the same message that basal insulin was not fully titrated as other studies in Chinese diabetes patient, only about 0.05U/kg insulin dose increased (0.19U/kg to 0.24U/kg) at discharge compared with prandial insulin (0.18U/kg insulin dose increased from 0.32 to 0.40 IU/kg) after almost three weeks of hospitalization. The titration situation was supposed to be related to the limited clinical experience of the two basal insulin, Lantus and Basalin, which was launched in 2004, 2005 respectively and data included for analysis between 2005 and 2016, with diversified practice. But the outcomes did reflect the effectiveness of Lantus and Basalin in real life. In addition to the limitation mentioned in this article, some limitation should also be considered. First, the treatment duration of Lantus was 6.6(7.36),which meant the minimum treatment duration might be about 1-2 day. Therefore, it is much more appropriate to explore the data in steady state,for example 4-5 day after the first dosing. Second, the data was from a single site and the patient number was small for a retrospective study to address a strong conclusion but authors has realized it and provided a quite fair conclusion on the effectiveness. The article was well written and I personally agree it can be considered for publication in your journal.
