The article reports the goals of the recently created initiative named VALIDATE, which is an organization funded by the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) Networks in Vaccines Research and Development, which is co-funded by the The Medical Research Council (MRC) and The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). VALIDATE is a fantastic Network that aims to promote vaccine research and development for complex intracellular pathogens that cause significant disease burden in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). The authorsâ€™ summary of VALIDATE activities is outstanding. The authors and founding members of this much needed initiative deserve the compliments of scientific communities and Government authorities of not only of LMICs but also of developed countries. One minor suggestion is to add in the article a sentence or two indicating the plans for long term funding sustainability of VALIDATE.
