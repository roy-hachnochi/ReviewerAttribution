The manuscript is a reanalysis of the study of Mitchell et al. (2008). The author claims that using different feature selection methods can help to identify areas that are functional distinctive in individual level. The finding of the presented study provides substantial implication to studies that focus on how neural activation encoding the semantic content. I only have few minor comments. (on page 3) please provide details of the cross-validation method of the OLS analysis. In Discussion, the author describe about the distribution of "type 1 voxels" and "type 2 voxels" in some participants. I wonder if the results in the rest of the participants show a similar pattern? I would like to suggest that the author can provide figures or tables that show the distribution of three types of voxels (type 1, type 2, and convergent voxels) of each participant. This information would help the reader to see the consistency/divergence of encoding models in each participant.
