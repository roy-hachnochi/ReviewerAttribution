This is indeed a severe case of systemic vasculitis. The criteria used to classify the combined clinical and histological findings are not clearly referenced for discussion. The EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria published in 2016 are more discriminatory with the addition of IgA immunofluorescence for IgA associated vasculitis (formerly known as HSP). Unfortunately the authors were not able to perform this test and the skin histology did not describe a necrotizing vasculitis. The authors are correct that mononeuritis multiplex would be a separator, but the evidence in this case is more circumstantial as reported. The time line of Bells palsy is suggestive. The nerve conduction report is equivocal. Renal dysfunction or joint involvement were not mentioned. Both conditions can respond well to prednisolone alone, or in combination with cyclophosphamide depending on the severity. Since the case report is to highlight the overlapping features of the vasculitides, I agree that the differentiating diagnostic features are important.
