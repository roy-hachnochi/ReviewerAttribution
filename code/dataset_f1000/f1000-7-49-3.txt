The authors present a case of a 65 year old woman that was admitted to the authors' hospital due to abdominal pain and skin lesion on the right upper and right lower extremities, with negative rheumatologic tests. After careful diagnostic workout, the final diagnosis was vasculitis (Polyarteritis nodosa or complicated Henoch-Schonlein purpura). The paper is interesting, also due to the rarity of the disease. However, there are some points that need to be improved before final approval: The authors report Bell's Palsy in patient's medical history; it would be interesting to know when this occurred. Since this was treated with corticosteroid therapy, it is important to know if it was present when the patient already had PAN lesions - and in this case if they also improved during therapy - or if it occurred prior to PAN-related lesions arose. Timing details are missing: in the case presentation - follow up and outcomes - the authors report that the patient "is being treated with 50mg prednisolone daily and then we will taper this amount". It is important to define for how long the patient is being treated, how much time past from initial diagnosis and therapy, and how the authors intend to reduce treatment. Sensorineural Hearing Loss is often reported in PAN and, in some cases, may occur as the presenting symptom. Hearing Loss is typically bilateral and symmetrical, with sudden or rapidly progressive onset. It would be interesting to know if hearing impairment was reported by the patient, or investigated. In the discussion we recommend to further discuss the findings that led to PAN diagnosis in this case. The paper has several English language typos and grammar mistakes that should be corrected by a native English speaker (i.e. "which were was mostly", etc).
