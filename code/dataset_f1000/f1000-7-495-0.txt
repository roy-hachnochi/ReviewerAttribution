The article outlines a clear and important vision of a university for the world located in the Middle East. The goals of stimulating development in the "South" with a "South" orientation rather than a North one is well presented. The arguments could be strengthened with (1) more concrete numbers, such as the number of students leaving the Middle East for Europe and the U.S. for an education who do not return; (2) the viability of current Middle East institutions to transform, as it seems some are doing at this time; (3) the possibility of investment from the North or Middle East wealth to make this feasible.
