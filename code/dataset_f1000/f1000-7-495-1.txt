The author makes a valid point on the need for universities that seek to provide solutions for the specific problems of less developed countries. The fact of a large gap in science and technoloy between North and South is noted as well as the need to look to the future in developing programmes for such a new university. There is no doubt a university owned and manned mainly by citizens of low and middle level countries will better be able to focus on local problems. It is not clear however how such a new type of institution will address the issues of scientific deficit or d better in the field of artificial intelligence than traditional universities. The potential collaborative role is particularly exciting. The recommendations for financing need further clarification since this is crucial for the realisation and sustainability of the idea. It would be helpful to provide evidence for the assertion that "lack of think tanks and innovative Universities in the global South have negatively impacted on leadership, generation of new ideas and bringing positive change." It is not clear also if asking the World bank and similar global institutions to take it up means they should come up with the money or only develop the concept further. Overall I think it is a paper worthy of attention by anyone keen on trying a new way of fostering development and equality.
