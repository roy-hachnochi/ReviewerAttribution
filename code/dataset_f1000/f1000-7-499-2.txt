 A rare undifferentiated tongue sarcoma showing recurrent RETSAT mutations and a loss-of-function POLDIP2 mutation was presented in this case report. By showing comprehensive genetic analyses, it was interesting to identify the unique presentation of the common genes found in head and neck cancer, including TP53, CDKN2A, and NOTCH1. It is undoubtedly that the genetic profiles of this rare tongue sarcoma is different from those found in the common HNSCC because of distinct pathological background. Nonetheless, the presentations of this case different from the common sarcoma merit further confirmation. If it is really the case, it infers the possibility that the anatomical factor is presumably involved. Data related to the sarcoma of head and neck is suggested to be compared. Although this case might provide a chance to evaluate the mutual influence between the germline and somatic mutation, evidences are required to confirm whether the heavy germline mutation indeed affect the incidence of common somatic mutation found in this patient.
