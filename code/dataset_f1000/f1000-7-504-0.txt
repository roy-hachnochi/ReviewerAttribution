The present study “Non-HDL cholesterol is better than LDL-c at predicting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors clustering, even in subjects with near-to-normal triglycerides: A report from a Venezuelan population” by Bermdez et al., is interesting however, the authors must address the following key points: In results, (Table 2) the non-HDL cholesterol levels were represented based on age groups. In addition to this if the authors provide the analysis for men and women separately which will be more accurate. Table 3 to 5: if the analysis done for both men and women separately that provides more insights for both clinicians and researchers. Authors are suggested to comment/discuss briefly the hormonal influence in disease progression in both genders.
