The authors have addressed a very pertinent issue of growing mycobacterial culture using a customized cocktail of commonly available antibiotics instead of commercially available expensive antibiotics (PANTA), presently in use. They have performed whole experiments in a very simple way and succinctly described the methods with appropriate conclusions. Since the findings obtained using CAM were comparable to the commercially available PANTA, this can be really useful to researchers in TB field. Bypassing the routine culture and BACTEC methods authors tested CAM in animal based study, which gave ample scope to new mixture of antibiotics to eradicate any prevailing contamination carried forwarded through organ homogenate. However, a control carrying only organ homogenates on the culture media plates without any antibiotic mix would have given fair idea of prevailing microbial contamination and allowed authors to assess how effectively CAM exterminated the microbial flora under the experimental conditions used by authors.
