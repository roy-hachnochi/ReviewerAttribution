The current version of the submitted article doesn’t have sufficient content and merit to be indexed as a full journal article. The storyline of the article is not well developed, the relevant references are not well cited, the article doesn’t have sufficient results for critical analysis (and how these results are different from other reported results, unless those results are unique and reported for the first time). It can be included in a conference proceedings (or may not); however, for journal articles we expect high standard research work and publication. This article reports the production of bioethanol from kitchen waste fermentation. Not technically sound. The article does not add any new information to the scientific community. Very limited results. No comparison/report on similar work around the world. This article is not suitable for indexing.
