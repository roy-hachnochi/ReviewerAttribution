The manuscript has lack of novelty in term of methodology procedure. The introduction I suggest to focus more on the previous studies of generating ethanol from kitchen waste and show the gap in between. Clear the objective of the study. The methodology has not been explained well. The process was under anaerobic or aerobic condition? What was the pH selected for the experiment? No explanation of the pre-treatment of the material, the initial composition characteristics. Also authors did not mention about the size of the sample taken. Authors have not describe the analytical method used in the study. Full description of the equipment and the methods required. Authors have to explain in details how many samples were examined, how may runs. And also provide the statistical data in order to discuss the significances of the results. The results and discussion is very weak and only presented one table. Which is not in scientific form. Discussion should be with comparison of the previous studies. Therefore, I do not recommend for indexing.
