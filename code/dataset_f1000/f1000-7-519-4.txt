Many researchers arrive at point in enrichment analysis where they have tables of enriched ontology terms and pathways, but don't know how to go beyond presenting those data as tables or perhaps bar graphs. The use of networks is an intuitive and powerful visualization option. The eXamine app for Cytoscape provides a nice approach for displaying a simplified version of enrichment results. A couple steps are missing, however, and a few minor edits are suggested. Missing steps: All sources of enrichment that I'm aware of provide rows of terms and a list of genes in a single field per row. It would be nice if you provided a bit of Python to transform that common input data type to that required by eXamine. I was wondering about genes that belong to more than one term (often the case). I looks like your tool handles these via a piped list. Is that right? Please describe the correct syntax in the text so readers don't have to guess. Minor suggestions: Groups in Cytoscape are no longer provided as a separate plugin, but rather are now integrated into the core of Cytoscape. Your reference to "RBVI Cytoscape plugins" should be updated to simply mention the Cytoscape manual and point to the section on groups: http://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/Creating_Networks.html#grouping-nodes The LaTeX formatting for your Python code is unfortunately rendering single quotes in a way that throws SyntaxError in Python. Can you update the rendering so one can simply copy/paste snippets? In the next version of this paper, I'd highly recommend using py2cytoscape ( https://github.com/cytoscape/py2cytoscape ). This will make the code you have write much more concise and easier to maintain or adapt. Likewise, I'd really like to see R examples and you can leverage RCy3 to make that code easy to write as well ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RCy3.html ).
