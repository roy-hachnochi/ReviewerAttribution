In their manuscript “eXamine: Visualizing Annotated Networks in Cytoscape”, Spohr et al. describe a new version of their Cytoscape tool eXamine. eXamine allows user to enrich the visualization of small networks via colored contours which represent specific annotations of subnetworks, e.g. functional annotation. eXamine is very useful because it not only highlights group properties in a visually appealing way but also allows the representation to be changed interactively. The software always attempts to achieve an optimal layout in which overlaps are kept at a minimum. Here, the authors have adapted eXamine to make use of the new Cytoscape automation features which allow for programmatic control of the plotting process, thus allows for generating reproducible results that can further be embedded in scripts. The manuscript is well written and describes the new features and their usage clearly. The code of eXamine is hosted on github and contains the two use cases from the manuscript in the form of popular Jupyter notebooks. Each step of the examples is well described and illustrates to the user how eXamine can be used in a scripting environment such as Python. In particular less obvious steps like extracting network ids from a JSON result help new users to achieve results fairly quickly. I have only minor comments: Unfortunately the second use case (Jupyter notebook) in the git repository did not work due to the use of a local file path instead of a public URL. Add the end of the first paragraph the manuscript says “by dilating and eroding the associated links”. I’m not sure what is meant here with erosion. Use case 1, first paragraph, there is a typo: feautures - features The github readme should briefly describe the jupyter notebooks and link to them.
