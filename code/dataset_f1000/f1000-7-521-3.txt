This is in general a well written and well argued paper that represents a valuable addition to attempts to bring bacterial taxonomy into the genomic age. I can find no fault with the methodologies used nor with the general interpretation of results. I agree with the authors that all future bacterial taxonomy and nomenclature should be based on genomic data and they have fallen in line with an emerging consensus of how to make that work using ANI. It is clear that bacterial taxonomy is broken and needs fixing and the only suitable response to the tyranny of The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology is subversion by publishing papers like this that ignore its ridiculous and outdated requirements. To quote Darwin: "Our classifications will come to be, as far as they can be so made, genealogies" I have just a handful of minor criticisms/suggestions for improvement: I don't see the need for the separate Introduction and Background sections. According to the guidelines for authors, papers in this journal should follow the usual IMRAD format, so I think that the two sections should simply become sub-sections of the Introduction, perhaps with brief explanatory headers. I am not sure why the authors abdicate responsibility for determining whether "8 subclades of E. asburiae should be treated as subspecies". Why not roll their approach out to cover these lineages too? The authors discuss the concept of "placeholder" species and subspecies in the Discussion, but fail to mention the "Candidatus" designation, which is recognised by the current bacterial taxonomy apparatchiks: http://ijs.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/00207713-45-1-186 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidatus They should include some discussion of this designation that includes a recognition of its major shortcoming in requiring phenotypic data in addition to genome sequence.
