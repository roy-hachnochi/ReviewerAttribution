The authors describe the development of CyREST API for ReactomeFIViz, a Cytoscape app, which exposes some Reactome functions as REST APIs for external software components, to process pathway and network data in automatic and reproducible workflows built using almost any programming languages. The source code provided for ReactomeFiViz and for the Python use case notebook, make the use of CyREST API easier and simpler to understand. The manuscript is well-organized and the described app will be highly valuable for users working with big data related to enrichment analysis and visualization of networks. I have only some minor comments: In the Introduction section (pag.2): the sentence “These approaches project significant genes, proteins, metabolites, and other kinds of biological entities collected from pre-analysis onto pathways and networks, knowledge produced by many years’ experimental studies.”, is not quite understandable, I think it should be rephrased. The Methods section (pag.2) is clearly explained and sufficient details are provided to allow replication of the method development and its use by others. The section Operation (pag.2) I think is unnecessary, the authors can add it as the subsection of Methods because here they are explaining the methods available in the CyREST API developed. In the Analysis results subsection (pag.3): I think it's possible to add a figure (such as a Venn Diagram) to better explain the results obtained. In the same subsection (Analysis results: pag.3) more details should be provided about the results. (For example: - in BRCA modules 13 and 17 are there overlapping genes? If yes, which are their names? - What is the way, in which the enriched signaling pathways are involved in BRCA and/or OV carcinoma?) More references to supporting literature must be provided in the manuscript in order to further substantiate the claims.
