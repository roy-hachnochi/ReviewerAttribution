Dear authors, I appreciated your manuscript very much. Congratulations for all the details that you presented in the work. I had some suggestions, regarding the sample that was analyzed in the work, considering that the majority of patients in the sample belong to classes I or II of the NYHA, and as you declare in the limitations, “more than 90% of our patients are within the low risk group of 0-10%”. Your work could have the advantage to be done in one single service, with the same quality of the surgery. Unfortunately, you said that the performance of the surgeons is not the same, between them. Particularly, I have critiques about the multicenter studies, which have a lot of qualities, but the surgeons from different services and nations have different results, like you expressed in the limitations. The problem of the work being retrospective brings some problems, but this does not compromise the results. Your discussion was very clear, adding your article in the present context of the literature. The conclusions are simple and straightforward, allowing the Cardiac Surgeons of Malaysia to use the EuroSCORE II, securely in your country.
