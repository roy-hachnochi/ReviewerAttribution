This opinion paper is interesting. My first concern is the presentation of the production costs of the active substances. Indeed, only reasoning (ie for each molecule) in proportion to the Kelley figure of $20,000 to $300,000 per kilogram of active ingredient (equivalent to $ 0.02-0.3 per milligram) without having any idea of the real cost for each molecule can be misleading, and is not very satisfactory. These data being confidential, thank you to the authors to specify this in the legend of the table and not only in the supplementary material. Even if the idea proposed by the authors is interesting intellectually, it clashes with the respect of the patent right. It should be emphasized more in the paper.
