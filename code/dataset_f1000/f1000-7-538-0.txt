The advantages of the ATEC are that it is shorter than other measures, easy to understand and designed to be completed by parents, teachers, or caregivers, making it a suitable tool for a country where there is a shortage of psychiatrists. It provides quantitative measurements on important domains of ASD severity which increased the effectiveness of home-base care for children with ASD. The authors have translated the ATEC into Thai following Beaton's Guidelines for the cross-cultural translation and adaptation of self-report instruments. The psychometric properties of the Thai-ATEC have been tested and reported as acceptable to good. The methods section and results of the study have sufficient and clear details. The authors are skeptical whether the Thai-ATEC can be used in other parts of Thailand but this may not be the case because the wording in each item is natural, clear and easy to understand. Comments: Please change “DSM-V” to “DSM-5“ It would be better if the author also present the other type of reliability, i.e., the internal consistencies of the ATEC scores and subscales. Page 6 paragraph 4: It is not relevant to compare the Thai-ATEC with the CARS study in India as the purpose of that study was to develop the screening tool whereas the ATEC is designed to measure ASD severity. Page 6 paragraph 6: This research is time consuming or slow-paced but it is not the limitation of the study.
