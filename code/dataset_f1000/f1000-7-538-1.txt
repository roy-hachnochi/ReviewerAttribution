The researchers have undertaken an important and timely study to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) for diagnosis and evaluate children diagnosed with autism in Thailand. They have demonstrated that they were able to translate the ATEC from English into the Thai language, and then utilize the ATEC as a means to identify and evaluate the severity of children diagnosed with autism in Thailand. They have utilized appropriate methods for data collection and data analyses. The study results are consistent with previously cited published studies examining the validity of the ATEC on different populations using different metrics. The researchers appropriately consider study limitations, and the study conclusions are supported by the data.
