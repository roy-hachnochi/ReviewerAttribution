In my opinion, this article is well editable and easy to follow. The scope of each chapter is appropriate. In the Introduction, they briefly presented the problem behind the study. The study design is appropriate and the work is technically sound. They cited 11 references which is strongly connected to this topic. These are from 1998 to 2018, all in all, current literature was used. The method was described in detail, thus it is easy to replicate. They created three main parts in the methods. In my opinion is fine, but I suggest that the third subchapter should be the test used during the experiment. Otherwise, the materials, repetition and measurement which they are used are appropriate. The charts that are used are clear and easy to follow these in the text. In this article, the statistical analyses is applicable. May I suggest, that in the future they should use some other statistical test to compare different treatments (such as Tukey or Duncan-test). All source data are underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility. The conclusions are drawn adequately supported by the results. Summary, this article is clear, easy to follow, used appropriate methods and scientifically based. Thus, it will be very useful to solve the examined problem.
