The authors explored major databases of genomic alterations in cancer samples and evaluated a potential role of LINC00987 in Lung Adenocarcinoma. They concluded that their results "demonstrate that LINC00987 expression might have a tumor suppressive role in lung adenocarcinoma". As an investigation evaluating the relationship between a non-coding gene an a human disease it is an interesting piece of work. However, I believe that the results are not supported and the work lacks a more appropriate statistical framework. The choice of LINC00987 as a potential gene involved in this cancer is based on a paper by Xu et al. After screening the paper and the supplementary annotation I haven't found any mention to it. It may be due to a change in nomenclature, but then it must be clearly stated. The deletion of LINC00987 is associated to a deletion of half on an arm of chromosome 12. There are hundreds of genes in the region so any association to LINC00987 must be clearly differentiated. Likewise, the expression levels can be associated to this deletion. Hundreds of other genes will be also underexpressed. This also affects the analysis of Figure 1C. From my point of view, and considering the evidence shown, there is no evidence of a causal connection between LINC00987 and Lung Adenocarcinoma. A convincing analysis should take into account the expected mutation/deletion/expression/survival profile of other genes (expectations) including those in the frequently deleted arm of chromosome 12.
