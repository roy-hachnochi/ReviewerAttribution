The paper refers to the in vitro antifungal efficacy of both an ethanol extract from Ambrosia arborescens and Aristeguietia glutinosa essential oil. The topic is of interest, unfortunately the paper is not well written and deep editing by a native English speaker is needed. Furthermore references and data about these ethnobotanical species are too scanty. The composition of these products is not reported, making it difficult to reproduce the study. The authors should provide some data about the composition, related to healing ability, as well as the composition of specimens used for the present study.
