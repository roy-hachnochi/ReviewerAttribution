In this cross-sectional survey, the authors assessed the relationship between metabolic syndrome and tobacco habits and found a significant association with some MS components. Here are some comments oriented to improve the manuscript: Introduction: Paragraph 2: “ these percentages are important because” can be erased. Methods: Clinical evaluation: the classification of the JNC7 was not used in the results, this explanation about the JNC7 criteria can be avoided. Results: No comments. Discussion: The first paragraph should resume the main findings. Paragraph 3: “on the other hand” can be erased. Paragraph 5: change “ according to the results of our study ” for “ In this study ”. The authors should be careful in presenting cigarette use as a “protective” strategy for high blood pressure. Line 13, paragraph 7: the authors should instead discuss the masked hypertension effect observed in smokers - this could explain this “paradoxical result”. This effect was also reported in patients with type 2 diabetes and smokeless tobacco use in Venezuela (Gonzlez-Rivas et al. , 2017 1 ).
