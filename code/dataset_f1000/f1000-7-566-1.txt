This is a good software developed which could help in continuous visualization of contacts and their progression in disease tracking. It is user friendly for those who are not computer specialist and still want to visualize data. Data visualization is pertinent to disease monitoring and what the authors have done will aid in helping epidemiologist and public health specialist involved in outbreak response to quickly visualize progression and spread of disease from primary to secondary contacts and how the disease is evolving among contacts. The software will actually achieve its purpose as stated in the conclusion of the write-up. Good work done.
