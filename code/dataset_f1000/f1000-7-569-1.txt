This is an interesting and well-organized article to compare GC AMR (MIC) distributions among men who have sex with men (MSM) and women between the UK and Belgium and conclude the difference in the distribution patterns is due to intensity of screening for sexually transmitted infections. On the current version of the manuscript, I made a few additional comments as follows for authors’ considerations. The title refers to “gonorrhoea screening” but I could not find any information/data on gonorrhoea screening but the screening for STI in the manuscript. It may be better to change to “screening intensity for sexually transmitted infections” or “Differences in population-specific gonococcal antimicrobial resistance distributions between the United Kingdom and Belgium” and then use the screening intensity to explain the differences in text. From Belgium part in the Figure 2, we can find a higher MIC distributions for cefixime and ceftriaxone among women than MSM - in contrast to what observed in the UK. Does it mean an increased intensity of screening for STI among women in Belgium? This should be explained in the Discussion. Although screening intensity can be used as proxy of intensity of antimicrobial use/exposure, the further studies indicated in the last paragraph of Discussion should include the assessment of corrections between intensity of the specific antibiotic use and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of NG.
