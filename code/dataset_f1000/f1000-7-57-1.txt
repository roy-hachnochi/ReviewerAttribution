The authors purify a VHH fragment corresponding to an camelid single-chain antibody previously selected from a Llama derived phage antibody library. They measure binding of this VHH (BCD090-M2) to the extracellular region of ErbB3 that was immobilized to a CM5 biosenor chip, using Surface plasmon resonance (SPR). An apparent K D of 1Î¼M is reported. The authors solve the X-ray crystal structure of the VHH in two different crystal forms and observe differences in the conformation of CDR H2. The SPR sensograms do not come to a plateau during each injection, which is most obvious at the higher concentrations, so it is not a saturation binding response for each concentration. The Response data that are plotted in Figure 2B for each concentration of VHH do not correspond to the response values 5 seconds before the end of the injection in the sensograms plotted in Figure 2A. It looks more like the values 50 seconds before end of injection. There is something wrong here. Perhaps the data in A and B are from two different experiments? No error is given on the K D value so it is not clear if these data were repeated. I also worry about use of regeneration using glycine at pH 2. It is highly likely that this will denature the immobilized ErbB3. These data are thus questionable. No information on binding for the intact antibody is referenced or provided. The VHH is clearly folded. The question is whether it really binds to ErbB3. The structure determination is technically sound.
