For the immunoglobulin-Î³ (IgG) antibodies, the structure usually is assembled from two identical heavy (H)-chain and two identical light (L)-chain polypeptides is well established and highly conserved in mammals. The L chain of these immunoglobulins comprises two domains, whereas the H chain folds into four domains. Currently, most of therapeutic antibodies used in clinical development are belong to such type. One exception to this conventional mammalian IgG structure is found in sera of Camelidae. Unlike the conventional heterotetrameric antibodies these sera possess special IgG antibodies. IgG antibodies, known as heavy-chain antibodies (HCAbs), are devoid of the L chain polypeptide and are unique because they lack the first constant domain (CH1). At its N-terminal region, the H chain of the homodimeric protein contains a dedicated variable domain, referred to as VHH, which serves to associate with its cognate antigen. The VHH in an HCAb is the structural and functional equivalent of the Fab fragment (antigen-binding fragment) of conventional antibodies. In this report, Igor et al expressed a recombinant single-domain antibody (VHH form llamas) targeting ErbB3 Protein crystallography study was used for determine the structure of VHH in different crystal forms. It is a well done crystallography report providing readers more data for the structure of VHH, and I only have a few minor suggestions: Do the authors have any information or data about the epitope of BCD090-M2? Single-domain antibodies from llamas are new generation of therapeutical antibody drugs, can authors make another 3-D Alignment figure to compare BCD090-M2 with human antibodies?
