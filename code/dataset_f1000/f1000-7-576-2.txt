Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. General comments The paper is an important and useful contribution, as there is very little in the peer-reviewed literature about drowning in Nepal. The authors should go into more detail about the police data source they used - particularly whether there are estimates of the number of deaths that occur but which are not reported to this source, whether there are biases etc. The presentation of results seems somewhat haphazard - the authors could benefit from taking one step back from their data and deciding what are the 3-5 main findings we have come across here that are important and deserve to be amplified and framed clearly for the reader. There is little in the way of serious follow up discussion on some aspects that would seem to invite more critical thinking - the disparity between this study's findings and GBD estimates for example. There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors in the text, so this should be edited prior to publication. Specific comments Results section - drop "the open water" - which could be confused as meaning waters far from any coastline - and replace with either natural water bodies or rivers. Proportion of males is cited as being higher than females - it is simple enough to give this as "roughly 3 times as many deaths were reported in males versus females", or words to that effect. It communicates with greater precision one of the findings of interest. I take the seasonality pattern but believe there is somewhat muddled writing about the effect of seasons here. Clearly there are some drownings that occur year round, but the authors should be clear on drawing attention to the surge during the monsoon season as this has implications for prevention programmes. The references appear incomplete - for example, the Global Report on Drowning from the WHO is referenced within the body of the text but does not appear within the references, although a WHO regional report does.
