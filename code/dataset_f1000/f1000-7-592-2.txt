This is a well written clearly explained method for making slice cultures from 3xTg-AD mice for the study of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. It is useful to have a step by step account with hints to describe this method as in general slice cultures can be difficult to reproduce and be consistent. There is a good description of how this method fulfils NC3Rs criteria. Minor points: It would be very helpful to have a little more justification of why this is a novel method when many publications can be seen using slice cultures for Alzheimers research, even from transgenic mice. It was a little bit confusing on the section stating: In brief, slice cultures are cut whilst still on their membranes and then treated as free-floating sections. Is this illustrated in Figure 1? If so could be made clearer? Not convinced the n=12 from one pup statement is correct, as this would be replicates. N usually refers to different biological repeats. It would be really useful to see example of the slices when validated, with examples of staining. Can microglia be seen and how good is the anatomy of the slices. The LDH was not explained enough and perhaps the time course could have been shown. Are a suitable application and appropriate end-users identified? Yes If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? Yes Are the 3Rs implications of the work described accurately? Yes
