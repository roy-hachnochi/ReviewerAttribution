The authors report the case of a patient with periorbital and facial oedema in whom muscle biopsy allowed the diagnosis of myositis (probably DM). The skin biopsy in this case is not specific, absence of mucine and leukocytoclastic vasculitis are not typical of DM. This reviewer, nevertheless, agree that the most probably diagnosis is DM. In this case it would be appropriate to define it as a Clinically Amyopathic DM. Determination of other specific autoantibodies would have been of help: anti-TIF1gamma, anti-PL12, anti-PL7, anti-SRP, anti-MDA5, or anti-NXP2. In opinion of the reviewer, this presentation is not so rare. Please comment or modify all these points.
