The case report presents the diversity of clinical variants in autoimmune inflammatory myopathies. Clinical case is present briefly, but the information is sufficient. My critical remarks are: It is not clear how the authors clinically assess the muscle weakness; Authors state creatine phosphokinase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase are in normal ranges. What about alanine aminotransferase and aldolase? I would suppose the term clinical amyopathic dermatomyositis, since muscle biopsy shows definite features of myositis and thus is the key evidence for diagnosis. It is not indicated the place of muscle biopsy. I would recommend discussing the orbital myositis as a possible differential diagnosis. Investigation of anti-MDA5 and may have value in this case. In conclusion article is interesting and after some corrections will be useful for variety of medical specialists.
