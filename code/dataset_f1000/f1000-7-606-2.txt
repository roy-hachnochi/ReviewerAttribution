I have gone through the revised manuscript entitled "Absence of toll-like receptor 9 Pro99Leu polymorphism in cervical cancer" submitted by Alex Chauhan et al. The authors have revised the manuscript satisfactorily and answered all the queries therein. The English corrections that I asked for has been incorporated in the revised manuscript and I now recommend final acceptance of the manuscript for indexing of the article.
