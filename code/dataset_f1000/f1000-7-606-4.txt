The basic assumption of genetic epidemiology is that two alleles of a gene are present in the population and one of the allele (usually minor) has altered frequency in cases and controls. However, if a gene is mono-morphic as is the case here for TLR9C296T, then it is non-informative and there is no point to look for its association. Therefore, the very basis of study is wrong, even though it has been carried out technically correct. I therefore feel that this publication will not anything the present knowledge.
