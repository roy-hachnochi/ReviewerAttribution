With the global minor allele frequency of 0.0002, the studied sample size is too small. It is interesting to observe that there is only one genotype (homozygous wild type) present in the studied cohort. The power of the study should be mentioned by the authors. The conclusion drawn from the limited data set may not reflect the real situation. I suggest the authors to first calculate the number of samples required for the study on the basis of the frequency of minor/major alleles to achieve about 80% power of study and increase the sample size accordingly.
