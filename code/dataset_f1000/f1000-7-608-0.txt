Abstract I see no changes in the conclusions of the abstract. Introduction Can authors discuss in the manuscript also the rationale and relevance of investigating the correlation between implicit and explicit attitudes at the individual and population levels as requested in my first report? Methods In the new online files I see no description of the IAT procedure but only stimuli used in the task. Can authors describe the IAT procedure in the text of the manuscript? Statistical analysis and results I suggest authors to provide the additional information about the computation of the D and explicit scores also in the text of the manuscript. In particular, since the sample size of the two groups was very different (869 vs. 70), how they calculated the Cohenâ€™s d (and the associated pooled standard deviation).
