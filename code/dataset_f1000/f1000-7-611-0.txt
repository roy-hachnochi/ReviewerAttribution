Okello et al provide observational data on the incidence of pulmonary edema at autopsy following death from head injury. Consecutive data, of organ weight, with in 24 hours of death, obtained over two months, in 26 patients are provided. Pulmonary edema was documented in 76.8% of patients; weight increase was not found in organs other than the lungs. The mean age was 26 making co morbid cardiovascular factors unlikely.This incidence is similar to that of Simmons (1969) report in fatal military head injuries (pulmonary edema found in 17 of 20 cases). The authors conclusion that neurogenic pulmonary edema begins early and is isolated to the lung adds incidence data to a fatal consequence of head injury about which the pathophysiology and therefore the treatment remains uncertain.
