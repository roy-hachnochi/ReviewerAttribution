As the authors mentioned, selection bias was an issue. Type, classification, and fracture geometry, those were not recorded, also the important factors associated with postoperative complications. Different experience of multiple surgeons should be mentioned for the information bias. The reasons of delayed definitive operations should be classified, such as, patient condition, surgeon intension, randomisation, or hospital facilities etc. Exactly, "time from the injury scene to definitive fixation" is more concerned duration and more appropriate than "time from admission".
