The broader goals (seeking ways to enhance possibly limiting host defense capacities of pre-term and term newborns) are important, the experimental approach for these target samples (though not more generally) is novel, some (but not all) of the limits of this approach recognized, and the microbial targets and exogenously added host-derived (via recombinant form) reasonable. Of note, for experiments of this nature, the general reproducibility of the observations are striking. The description of the assay protocol should provide a more complete description of the "physical format" of the incubations (e.g., vessels used; type of sample shaking (or not)) that could impact, especially, the participation of the cellular elements of the blood samples that are likely important in the handling and outcome of these infections in vivo . The main "weakness" of this study is that the findings seem not surprising and not leading to an obvious next chapter unless other test host agents come to mind and/or become available. The conclusions of the authors, I think, reflect a similar view. The demonstration of lower killing capacity of preterm vs term cord blood against the two staphylococcal species tested is a new finding that may be important but deserves a more thorough characterization. It is not surprising that this difference could also impact the potential efficacy of the added agents as shown in Figs. 3-5. How that works would be of interest and potential value. In the end, the choice of MBL and LL-37 -- considering their limited effects in very high test doses -- may not have been optimal.
