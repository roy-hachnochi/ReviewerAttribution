This report on treatment of chronic subdural haematomas with a closed irrigation / drainage system is a good pilot for a larger study to compare the methods used. Allowing a more accurate assessment of any potential benefits compared to the more standard treatment methods - especially for outcomes such as recurrence. Please clarify if the irrigation through the Jacques catheter was performed intraoperatively only or if it was continued postoperatively (if so then give an indication how long this was for). Otherwise this is a well written article which I recommend for indexing.
