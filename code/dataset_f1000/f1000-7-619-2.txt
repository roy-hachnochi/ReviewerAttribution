This is a prospective study of 36 consecutive patients with chronic subdural haematoma presenting to a single tertiary UK neurosurgical centre over a 4-year period. The authors evaluated use of the so-called closed system irrigation and drainage (CSID) technique, finding no patients developed pneumocephalus, although recurrence or significant residual blood was seen in 11%. Skin-to-skin time was short (mean 13.4 minutes), and mean length of stay in the neurosurgical unit was 4 days. This is an interesting study of a common condition seen in neurosurgical practice, and a useful addition to the literature. The multimedia included add significant value to the paper. The authors discuss the limitations of their study clearly. The data suggests that this technique warrants further study in a larger population. I have a couple of questions for the authors: Do the authors have any comparative data from patients with CSDH treated at the same centre during the same time period, but with different surgical techniques e.g. standard burr-hole irrigation? It would be interesting to compare (perhaps even statistically) surgical time, complication rates and length of stay between the different approaches. However, I do note that the authors already quote previous literature when discussing the complication rates associated with other surgical approaches to CSDH, which in itself is useful. Table 1 indicates that one patient had a superficial wound infection in the “Co-morbid conditions” section – can the authors clarify exactly where this patient’s infection was, and if it was the same patient that developed a wound infection after sutrgery (as per Table 2).
