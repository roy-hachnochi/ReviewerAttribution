In their excellent and timely contribution Nachev, Rees and Frackowiak tackle current limitation in the models used to understand the brain functioning and the translation of this knowledge to the clinical practice. The text is engaging, and the message is clear. The authors did not limit their focus on the current problems but also provide clear new solutions and recommendations for future generations. May I suggest the part on Dimensionality and individualisation to be linked up to a recent editorial entitled 'is a *single* brain model sufficient' (Thiebaut de Schotten and Shallice Cortex 2017) 1 . I think this is appropriate but I leave it as optional for the authors. Again, thank you for this elegant contribution soon to become a classic in the field.
