 In the revision 3, the authors have amended some part of the manuscript, but ignored some of the reviewer's comments. The conclusion in the abstract is not corresponded to the main aim of the study. Why the authors did not include mRNA expression of CDK2 and MATK from SHED or treated SHED, instead of SHED-derived MVs alone. Discussion sounds more like rationale of study, not discussing about the main findings and relate with previous works. The current write up is not so impressive, so I recommend re-writing of the manuscript.
