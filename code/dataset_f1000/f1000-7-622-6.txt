The authors have presented a work on the effects of fibroblast growth factor-6 on the expression of CDK2 and MATK in microvesicles derived from stem cells from exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED). In the study, the authors have shown that treatment with FBF-6 enhances the proliferative activity as well as the expressions of CDK2 and MATK in MV derived from SHED. This study is somewhat preliminary and the manuscript requires modifications to further improve it. There is inconsistency in the usage of terminology for example MATK was misspelled with MAKT many times (also in the title). Figure 2 should include population gating and isotype control. The authors should provide r value of the correlation coefficients of the CDK2 and MATK expressions to cell proliferative activity as shown in Figure 4. Conclusion need to be rephrased. The language use in the manuscript is unsuitable for publication. I would like to suggest submitting the manuscript for professional English editing.
