Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. In manuscript the authors describe a pilot randomized controlled trial that aims to demonstrate the implementation and utility of the anesthesiology control tower (ACT) in improving adherence to best care practices when compared to enhanced usual care. The authors propose to randomize 12,000 patients over the study period, with approximately 6,000 patients in the control arm and 6,000 patients in the intervention arm. Clinicians grouped in the intervention arm will be provided with real-time feedback based on the available electronic resources. Primary and secondary outcomes will be compared to the control group. Page 3 paragraph 2: The authors state that some of the risks of perioperative adverse events may be a manifestation of either underlying patient pathology or the complexity of the surgical procedure itself. The authors could consider elaborating that statement in more details. How big is the proportion of underlying patient pathology and complex surgical procedures? Page 3 paragraph 2: The authors state that prior studies have documented that deviation from evidence-based standards of care is common, and that deviation results in poorer patient outcomes. Which outcomes has been the focus of prior studies? Page 3 paragraph 8: Why have you chosen these outcomes to be the primary outcomes? Page 4 paragraph 2: The authors mentions that only patients undergoing surgery between 7:00 AM and 4:00 PM Monday through Friday will be included. Have you considered there could be a difference between elective and acute surgery. Are clinicians more prone to follow clinical guidelines at day time compared to night time?
