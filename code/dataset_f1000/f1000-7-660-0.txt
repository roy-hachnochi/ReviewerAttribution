The article investigated whether identification performance of objects are performed serially or in parallel. The author shows that reaction time and accuracy of object identification are affected by the number of categories of objects, but not the number of objects. There are a few issues that the author need to address. Parts of the Introduction seem incompletely discussed/elaborated. For example, in para 3, the elaboration of the previous research would be better if they were related back clearly to the purpose of the current study. Insufficient details in Methods What do the authors mean by corrected-to-normal vision? How was it assessed? What was the size of each pixel? Since the stimulus size was restricted to 100x100 pixels, the angular size of the objects, particularly if they had details that might be important for recognition, might have influence response accuracy. Among the 10 categories of objects that were chosen, were they tested to be equally identifiable? Some objects might be harder to identify than others, therefore could affect reaction time and accuracy. The author mentioned that “the longer stimulus exposition duration under the two conditions with distorted stimuli were chosen to equalize response accuracy under all conditions” (page 3). Well if response accuracy had been equalize then of course one would not find any difference in duration time between original, locally-distorted and globally distorted objects? A repeated-measures ANOVA would be more suitable to analyse the data. There are several English language issues that the author need to address, as have been pointed out by other reviewers. A glaring example is the first sentence in the article: “Visual information is processed in the brain in both parallel and serial.” Parallel and serial WHAT? The implications of the study need to be better discussed. The current study is undoubtly of interest but all of these concerns need to be addressed.
