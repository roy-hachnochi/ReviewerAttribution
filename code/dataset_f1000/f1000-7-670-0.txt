The authors performed a retrospective study on the role of ETS in treating primary hyperhidrosis and found that ETS is a safe, effective and aesthetically remarkable procedure for the treatment of primary hyperhidrosis with only half of the patients developing mild to moderate degree of compensatory sweating. However, the findings are actually not novel enough except the predictors of CS. In addition, the number of patients was too small to provide robust evidence for practice. Meanwhile, ETS procedure with two incisions in their institution seemed outdated since uniportal ETS is routinely performed in our center. Generally, the study is well-designed and the statistical methods seem sound, but the findings are not very novel. Last but not least, some grammatical errors exist. These errors should be corrected and more limitations should be acknowledged before the manuscript is acceptable.
