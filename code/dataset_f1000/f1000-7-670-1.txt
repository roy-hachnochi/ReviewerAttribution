This is a review of a well-studied subject: retrospective results of assisted video sympathectomy in a single center. In the Introduction the authors make a general review on the subject. There is a final paragraph in the Introduction defining the aims of the study, which are written within the Material and Methods section. Remove the aims from the Methods and put them in the last paragraph of the Introduction. The casuistry is small, but significant. It is acceptable for a study demonstrating the results in Malaysia. The number of overweight and obese patients in this series is interesting. In international studies BMI greater than 25 generated greater intensity in SC. The results are adequate, demonstrating that the sympathectomy in the Malaysian population is similar to international. The great variation of the levels of sympathectomy is also interesting, since articles from 2005 to 2007 already demonstrated advantages of sympathectomy at T3 or T4 levels alone over other levels of sympathectomy. But they reflect the local reality, which makes this data valid. The conclusions are appropriate.
