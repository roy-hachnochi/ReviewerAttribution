This article addresses the related mechanisms between the hormonal systems of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, which produces cortisol. The study evaluated the relationship between the daily variation of salivary cortisol dosages and the level of stress in caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is an interesting article. However, some questions need to be clarified to improve the manuscript and make it clearer to the reader: Abstract: The authors wrote in the ‘Conclusions’ section: “...the stress mechanism may be more complex and depend on more factors than the levels of this hormone”, so I suggest including in the ‘Conclusions’ section one or two factors to exemplify this. Methods: There is this information that “In order to determine the size of the sample, we considered all patients that fit the inclusion criteria of the study and are serviced by AEPAPA”. However, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not clear. I suggest writing about the criteria used in Association for Research and Assistance to Patients with Alzheimer’s (AEPAPA). The authors concluded that “...the stress mechanism may be more complex and depend on more factors than the levels of this hormone”. So, I would like to know more information about the caregivers’ clinical comorbidities, because a clinical comorbidity can be an explanatory factor.
