This preliminary research is interesting enough to be developed but there are some things that need to be reconsidered: ABSTRACT Research background that written on the abstract (lines 6 and 7) does not match the purpose of the study. The sentence can be interpreted in contrast to the antifungal potential possessed by Garcinia verrrucosa. It is dubious to investigate the potency of biofilm inhbition effect if Candida albicans more tolerant to Gracilaria extract. 2. METHODS Methods need to explain the following: Systemic conditions and state of teeth and oral soft tissue volunteers, The predestined determination of the Gracilaria verrucosa plant should be mentioned. Were the culture washed after the incubation period on treatment? How many times an experiment produces a representative result? 3. RESULTS Interpretation of the results is confusing; as far as I know the higher the optical density value the more biofilms are formed. The results in Fig. 1 show that 100% and Fluconazole extracts have higher optical densities rather than the lower concentration of extracts, as far as I know this shows that the mass of biofilms formed in the group is higher. Please observe the methods and results of research reported by Sebaa et al 2016. The statistical method used was only Kruskal-Wallis, is there a multiple difference analysis? Researchers need to discuss the effect of antibiofilm extract at lower concentrations, because of course 100% extract is not a good recommendation for subsequent experimental use.
