Good simple study highly needed for the country like Sudan. The work is original and reflect the health situation of the foreign labor that working in the restaurants and food industry in Sudan. I have some comments on the paper: In paragraph one it is Khartoum State, not just Khartoum. In the third paragraph of the Introduction if the Author change the word polluted with the word contaminated is better. In Table 3 if the Author use the word sentence percentage in Khartoum North in the 3ed upper cell of the table is better. And the sentences percentage in Khartoum State in the 4 th upper cell is also better. In Table 4 if he delete the word (the) from the upper cells is better. Figure 6 should come before Table 3.
