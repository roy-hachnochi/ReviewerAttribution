This is a well designed randomized controlled trial about an important patient-oriented outcome (mortality). This trial had the potential to add to the literature with high quality evidence in the prehospital setting about the management of ACPE with CPAP, and it is unfortunate that the target sample size was not met due to early termination. Though the study is underpowered, the authors appropriately note that the results are promising and suggest it supports another attempt at a similar study. The results are also available for inclusion in future meta-analysis. One concern I have regarding feasibility is that the reason for early termination was the cost of the consumables for the intervention itself.
