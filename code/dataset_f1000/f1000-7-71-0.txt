In this manuscript, Chang and Lai identify sequences of the homeobox genes in crustaceans from transcriptional data. For TALE family members, they classify these orthologs into the six subfamilies. The introduction provides the justification for establishing this resource in these agriculturally important species. In total, this will be an important reference source for future work in understanding the transcriptional regulation of development in crustacean species. There are a few minor questions and suggestions the authors can address. The details of the BLAST-based approaches and CD-Hit should be described in more detail. Were default settings applied? Perhaps adding an additional supplemental file or link with the commands would clarify this to facilitate replication in other species. The authors have the opportunity to address how effective their approach is and potential places for improvement. For example, how do the datasets derived from proteomes compare to that from transcriptomes? Is there an overlapping dataset where the two approaches could be compared? Also, how does the identification of homeobox genes using this approach in Drosophila compare to the number annotated in this well-studied species? If all are identified this would suggest that this approach may be sufficient if some are missing it suggests that this conservative starting point could be enhanced in the future by additional refinement. Minor comments: Introduction, second paragraph, description of homeobox identification in other species. Either provide references for “and many more” or omit. As is, this phrase is vague and doesn’t add constructively to the introduction.
