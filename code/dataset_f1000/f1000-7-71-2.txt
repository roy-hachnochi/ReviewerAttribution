The report by Chang and Lai provide an extensive dataset and phylogenetic analysis crustacean homeobox genes. This data will be useful to individuals interested in studying the evolution and function of homeobox genes in crustacea and other organisms. Overall, this manuscript is well written and appears to be technically sound. I only have some very minor comments the authors could address to improve clarity: 1) In the abstract, the rationale for the work takes an intellectual leap: it is unclear how identification of homeobox genes will be useful for aquaculture sustainability. I think the authors provide some compelling reasons within the text of the manuscript. 2) In the results and discussion there are a few instances where the authors should use the past tense. 3) Page 3, last sentence: even though the authors referred to Peter Holland's work, they should be much more precise about the observations from a "previous study". The authors should expand what they mean.
