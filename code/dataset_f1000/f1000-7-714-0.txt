The authors aim was to perform a systematic review of the effectiveness of available interventions for acute complete rupture of the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb in terms of patient-reported outcome measures and to assess the rates of adverse outcomes associated with these interventions. Their methodology appears overall sound, however I have some concerns over their request for additional data from the authors of the selected papers. If this data was not included in the original papers how can it be accepted retrospectively. Overall the authors have achieved their aim of the systematic review however they have added a large amount of extra data particularly concerning diagnosis (MRI and US). In general I think the paper has merit to be published but in their stated aim the authors should include that they reviewed the literature concerning diagnosis as well. 11th June 2018: The status of this report has been updated from ‘Approved with reservations’ to ‘Approved’ in response to the author comments . I thank the authors for their comments and accept that no additional data was either sourced or utilised. Also, I accept their comments on the diagnostic component in the article and accept that on balance it is useful in its contribution to the overall aim.
