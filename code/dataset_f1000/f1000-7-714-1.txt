This interesting article systematically reviews the literature base regarding injuries of the thumb ulnar collateral ligament. A large number of studies (158) were read and assessed to identify 6 eligible comparative studies. The 6 studies in question appear to be highly heterogeneous and have a high risk of being susceptible to bias. The quality of published data is too poor for the study to achieve its initial goal of performing a meta analysis. This is in itself a valuable piece of information which can be used to help drive further research. The search strategy is well described and repeatable and conducted according to the PRISMA checklist. Overall this is a well written paper, of publishable standard, describing poor quality data which is of particular value to researchers planning new studies investigating or designing new studies concerning the ulnar collateral ligament.
