The revised manuscript by Irna et al. was improved, but there is still a lot of room for improvement as follows: Methods Page 4 Cell culture In lines 18 – 20, the authors mention that HSC-2 is the cell line without the p53 gene mutation. However, it is a misunderstanding of the authors. It has been reported that HSC-2 has p53 gene mutation. Sakai E, Tsuchida N.: Most human squamous cell carcinomas in the oral cavity contain mutated p53 tumor-suppressor genes 1 . Page 5 Results First paragraph: In lines 1 – 8, the authors should state that the results of this paragraph are shown in Figure 1Aa and b. In lines 8 – 14, the authors should also indicate that the results of this paragraph are shown in Figure 1B, left panel. In lines 8 – 14, the authors mentioned that the percentage late apoptotic cell number 24 hours after areca nut treatment is 83.8215.86% and 15.5423.52%. However, the width of the error bars in the corresponding graph (Figure 1B, left panel) does not reflect the standard deviation (i.e. 15.86% and 23.52%). Second paragraph: In line 4, Figure 1 should be changed to Figure 1A. In line 4, is there any difference between pink and red dots? In line 9, Figure 1 should be changed to Figure 1B. Third paragraph: In lines 3-6, the authors mentioned that, after 24 hr areca nut treatment, there was an increase in early apoptotic cell populations from untreated to treated cells (1.77% to 17.88%, respectively). However, this description does not match the graph of Figure 2B, left panel, in which the percentage of early apoptotic cells of untreated and treated cells appears to be about 40% and 70%, respectively. Fourth paragraph: In lines 1 – 3, do the authors repeat the description of the previous paragraph (Figure 2B)? If so, the authors need to eliminate redundancy. The authors state that in HSC-3 cell lines, areca nut extract induced only early apoptosis after 24 hours. However, late apoptotic cells were apparently detected in Figure 2B, left panel. The authors need to describe the results more accurately. In lines 3-7, if the authors mentioned their results here, the results should be described in the past tense and indicated as (data not shown). Or if the authors intended to state general facts that occur in the process of apoptosis, such explanations are not necessary here and thus should be excluded from the text. Fifth paragraph, Caspase-3 assay: In line 2, “The value is” should be changed to “The values are”. In line 8 - 11, the authors sate that areca nut extract caused an increase in the number of cells with active caspase-3 which is 85.9456.86%. The standard deviation is very large. Isn't it impossible? I am wondering if the statistical calculation is correct. While the authors state that the number of cells without activating caspase-3 (14.3711.27% after 24 hours exposure), such cells appear to be almost 0% in Figure 3B, left panel. Again, I am wondering if the width of the error bars in Figure 3B does not reflect the standard deviations of both control and areca nut-treated cell populations. In line 11, “This value is” must be “These values are”? In lines 16 – 17, the authors state that the similar patterns were seen in 24 and 48 hours after exposure (Figure 3A). However, as they already mentioned about 24 hours above, they should change the sentence to “the similar patterns were seen in 48 hours after exposure (Figure 3Ac-d, and 3B, left panel). Sixth paragraph: In line 1, The authors sate that “the high concentration of active caspase-3”. Since the authors counted the number of caspase-3 positive cells by flow cytometry, “concentration” is inappropriate. As in the previous fifth paragraph, the authors should state the number of cells with or without active caspase-3 after 48 hr. Discussion: Since Discussion is too long and redundant, the authors should make them more concise by removing parts that are not directly related to their results in this study. Page 10: Fourth and fifth paragraphs The authors discuss the difference of the sensitivity of HSC-2 and HSC-3 cell lines based on the fact that HSC-3, but not HSC-2, has p53 gene mutation. However, as mentioned above, both cell lines carry p53 gene mutation. Thus, the authors should reorganize these paragraphs. Figures Figure 1A – 4A: The authors should indicate when each data (i.e. a, b, c, and d) was obtained after areca nut treatment. Are (a and b) and (c and d) 24 hr and 48 hr, respectively? Figure 1B – 4B: The authors should check whether the standard deviation of each data is accurately reflected as the error bar of the corresponding graph. References 1.

Statement before revision Results There was no increase in late apoptosis but, instead, the early apoptotic cell population increased. There was an increase in early apoptotic cell populations from untreated to treated cells (1.77% to 17.88%, respectively). Revision: Results There was no increase in late apoptosis but, instead, the early apoptotic cell population increased (37.48% to 70.10%) (Figure 2. B; left panel). Next, the apoptosis assay in HSC-3 cells after 48 hours exposure, however, showed significant increases in early and late apoptotic cell percentage (18.201.03% and 70.10.25%, respectively) (Figure 2.B; right panel). 7.

Statement before revision Results Caspase-3 assay The caspase-3 assay was performed in triplicate in HSC-2 cells also using flow cytometry. The value is calculated based on the percentage of the cell population with caspase-3 enzyme activity during apoptosis. The percentage of control and test cells in the same quadrant was compared. The M1 quadrant demonstrates the number of living cells without active caspase-3, whereas M 2 quadrant is a number of apoptotic cells with active caspase-3. Areca nut extract caused an increase in the number of cells with active caspase-3 which is 85.9456.86% more than the number of cells without activating caspase-3 (14.3711.27% after 24 hours exposure). This value is in accordance with the results of the apoptosis test, as an increase in caspase-3 corresponds with an increase of late apoptosis cell population. Untreated cells (M 1 ) were primarily negative for the presence of active caspase-3, whereas greater than one-third of the treated cells were positive for active caspase-3 staining (M 2 ). The similar patterns were seen in 24 and 48 hours after exposure ( Figure 3A). This shows that the ability of the extract to induce apoptosis is increased with longer exposure in HSC-2 cells. Revision: Results Caspase-3 assay We examined whether the areca nut extract can induce the activity of caspase-3 activity by using flow cytometry. The values are calculated based on the percentage of the cell population with caspase-3 enzyme activity during apoptosis. The percentage of control and test cells in the same quadrant were compared. The M 1 quadrant demonstrates the number of living cells without active caspase-3, whereas M 2 quadrant is a number of apoptotic cells with active caspase-3 (Figure 3A). The results indicated that the areca nut extract can increase the number of HSC-2 cells with active caspase-3 significantly after 24 and 48 hours exposure (85.930.01% and 97.050.01%, respectively) (Figure 3B). The untreated cells (M 1 ) were primarily negative for the presence of active caspase-3, whereas greater than one-third of the treated cells were positive for the active caspase-3 staining (M 2 ). These values are in accordance with the results of the apoptosis test, as an increase in caspase-3 corresponds with an increase of the late apoptosis cell population. 9.

Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 1 This study is a novel or first study which clearly reveals the potential cytotoxicity effect and mechanism of action of areca nut in oral squamous cell lines. Our preliminary study showed that the areca nut has a high content of total phenolic and flavonoid 38 . The areca nut has chemosensitivity of cancer cells in different concentrations. We performed an MTS assay to observe the areca nut extract on cell viability. Five doses were adding into cancer cells, which were 160, 320, 640, 1280, and 2560 μg/mL in HSC-2, HSC-3, and HaCat cells 38 . We found that the areca nut extract was cytotoxic towards HSC-2 (IC50 629.50 g/mL), while in the HSC-3 cells, the IC50 is lower than HSC-2 cells (IC50 164.06 g/mL). The areca nut showed weak cytotoxicity against HSC-2 cells. Sakagami et al. found that flavonoid-related phenols especially flavones showed weak cytotoxic activity against HSC-2 39 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 1 This study is a novel or first study which clearly reveals the potential cytotoxicity effect and mechanism of action of areca nut in oral squamous cell lines. Our preliminary study showed that the areca nut has a high content of total phenolic and flavonoid and showed cytotoxicity activity against HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells 38 . In the present study, we found that areca nut extract can induce apoptosis in HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells with optimum time after 48 hours exposure. This result is similar with the previous study that the ethanolic extract of areca nut (IC 50 77 μg/mL) for 48 hours could inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells 40 . 13. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 2 This study performs apoptosis and caspase-3 activity tests using flow cytometry, with the objective to acknowledge whether the cell death mechanism happens through apoptosis induction by areca nut extract or not. In order to acknowledge the optimum time of areca nut extract activity against the cells, two units of time are used, which are 24 and 48 hours. The results of flow cytometry analysis on HSC-2 cells shows that areca nut extract can induce late apoptosis activity after 24 and 48 hours exposure, but the increase of late apoptotic cells occurs more following 48 hours exposure. This result is in accordance with the past study that performed apoptosis test using orange acridine-ethidium bromide staining (double staining). The result showed that treatment with an ethanolic extract of areca nut (IC 50 77 μg/mL) for 48 hours inhibits the growth of MCF-7 cells as much as 13–84% 40 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 2 Although the extract has the same optimum time in both cells, we found that HSC-3 cells have the ability to withstand apoptosis higher than HSC-2 cells. This result is possible because of the characteristic of HSC-3 cells is different from HSC-2 cells. Both cells have mutated p53 tumor-suppressor gene [2, 3].The HSC-3 cell line has high metastatic potential with doubling time longer than HSC-2. The HSC-2 cell line has neither invasive nor metastatic potential. However, we do not fully understand the different mechanism that occured between the two cell types in response to the areca nut. Further studies to investigate this issue will be needed. 14. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 3 The flow cytometry analysis was performed to reveal the loss of plasma membrane asymmetry in cells. In apoptotic cells, the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, thereby exposing PS to the external cellular environment. Annexin V is a 35–36 kDa Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein with high affinity for PS and binds to exposed apoptotic cell surface PS. Annexin V can be conjugated to fluorochromes while retaining its high affinity for PS and thus serves as a sensitive probe for flow cytometric analysis of cells undergoing apoptosis. This is one of the earliest features of apoptosis. In our research, The flow cytometry was performed triple for both cells. The cells are processed with enzymatic degradation, centrifugation, and/or filtration to isolate the cells of interest, and the resulting cellular suspension is “stained” with fluorescent antibodies. When HSC-2 cells were cultured with areca nut for 48 hours, most of the cells were in the upper right quadrant; AV+/PI+. It means that most of the cells have undergone late apoptosis ( Figure 1B). However, when HSC-2 cells were cultured for 48 hours under the same condition without areca nut treatment, we found that only less than 40% of the cells were viable. This condition suggests that the preparation of the staining process in flow cytometry itself may trigger the death of the cells (apoptosis or necrosis). The same result is seen in the HSC-3 cells for 24 hours without treatment. This includes one of the limitations of our research. To ascertain the biological mechanism underlying areca nut-induced death, the apoptotic cell images should be obtained by a fluorescent microscope. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 3 The flow cytometry analysis was performed to reveal the loss of plasma membrane asymmetry in cells. In apoptotic cells, the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, thereby exposing PS to the external cellular environment. The cells are processed with enzymatic degradation, centrifugation, and/or filtration to isolate the cells of interest, and the resulting cellular suspension is “stained” with fluorescent antibodies. In our finding, most of the treated HSC-2 cells were undergone late apoptosis ( Figure 1A). However, we found that only less than 40% of the control cells were viable. This condition suggests that the preparation of the staining process in flow cytometry itself may trigger the death of the cells (apoptosis or necrosis). The same result is seen in the untreated HSC-3 cells for 24 hours without treatment. This includes one of the limitations of our research. To ascertain the biological mechanism underlying areca nut-induced death, the apoptotic cell images should be obtained by a fluorescent microscope. 15. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 4 Areca nut extract can possibly induce non-apoptotic cell death or necrosis. This is shown from the increase in necrotic cell percentage significantly after 24 hours of exposure. One of the past studies using catechin from green tea, proved that catechin has the ability to induce necrosis or non-apoptotic cell death in leukemia cells without caspase-8, 9, and 3 activities 41 Although molecular mechanism pathway of necrosis is not clearly understood, catechin can possibly induce necrosis through two pathways, which are decreasing concentration of intracellular ATP and interaction on ATP-binding site of glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) leading to increased activity of ATPase 41 . This result shows two competitive abilities between catechin and ATP-binding site leading to necrosis with catechin activity via the apoptosome (intrinsic pathway) and death induced signaling pathway (DISC; extrinsic pathway). Revision: Discussion Paragraph 4 The present study demonstrated that the caspase-3 activity as an effector caspase is shown to be related with late apoptosis activity because of the increase of caspase-3 with increasing late apoptotic cells percentage in both cells. Analysis of caspase activity confirmed that apoptosis might be the major mechanism of cell death induced by areca nut. As far as we know, there is no similar report regarding the caspase-3 activity by areca nut, but this result is similar to several previous studies that used plants containing flavonoid to increase caspase activity in cancer cells[4, 5] 42 . This finding may have biological implications in cancer treatment. Caspases inside cells are in an inactive form (procaspase), but activation induces the production of other caspases leading to cell death through proteolytic activity 46 , 47 . Caspase-3 activation is a crucial component in the apoptotic signaling cascade. Based on the results obtained from our study, the apoptosis pathway involved in areca nut-induced cell death in both cancer cell lines may be through the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Further investigation is needed to clarify the exact mechanism through which areca nut induces apoptosis. 16. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 5 Analysis of caspase-3 activity in HSC-2 cells shows results in accordance with the apoptosis assay, in that caspase-3 activity increases significantly after areca nut extract for 24 and 48 hours compared to control, with the increase of caspase-3 activity also being higher after 48 hours exposure. This result is similar to the study using catechin of green tea and hydrate catechin against HS-sultan and RPMI8226 cell strains, and MCF-7 cells using Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR techniques, that this compound can induce caspase-3, 8, and 9 activities 42 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 5 This research showed that the apoptosis activity using flow cytometry has several advantages, including fast period time analysis (thousand of cells per second), single cell analysis, and multiparametric measurements (correlations with several different cell events in one unit of time), but this machine also has drawbacks; the presence of physical and enzymatic manipulations during cell preparation and staining, can trigger additional apoptosis or necrosis cell numbers. Furthermore, flow cytometry is an efficient machine to calculate the number of apoptotic cells based on PS staining out of the cell membrane, so it is more appropriate to detect early apoptosis. If the test aims to improve the accuracy of DNA fragmentation calculations in late apoptosis, it is recommended to use Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) . 17. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 6 The results of flow cytometry analysis on HSC-3 cells show that areca nut extract could also induce apoptosis after extract exposure for 24 and 48 hours. Unlike with HSC-2 cells, extract exposure induced more early apoptosis after 24 hours exposure, but after 48 exposure apoptosis induction by the extract happened more in the end step. Caspase-3 activity as an effector caspase is shown to be related with late apoptosis activity because of the increase of caspase-3 with increasing late apoptotic cells percentage. There is a significant increase in necrotic cells percentage after 48 hours of exposure. Therefore, the apoptosis assay showed that areca nut extract is capable of inducing apoptosis in HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells with an optimum time after 48 hours exposure. Although the extract has the same optimum time in both cells, there is a difference on extract effect on the number of apoptotic cells, where the percentage of HSC-2 cells undergoing apoptosis is higher than HSC-3 cells. This result is possible because of the characteristic of HSC-3 cells is different from HSC-2 cells. The HSC-3 cells have the p53 gene mutation 36 . The mutation of HSC-3 cells was confirmed in a previous report 43 . However, when the p53 gene mutates, the mutated p53 protein is excessively produced or accumulated, thereby compromising apoptosis and leading to abnormal or malignant cell growth 44 . We found that HSC-3 cells have the ability to withstand apoptosis higher than HSC-2 cells. However, this finding may vary by the study design and so much more data must be collected to better understand this phenomena. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 6 Deleted 18. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 7 Literature shows that in addition to the p53 gene mutation in HSC-3, severe damage to phosphorylation of Ser 46 in HSC-3 cells causes loss of apoptotic ability mediated by p53 and also increased survival ability of HSC-3 cells against anticancer genes compared to HSC-2 cells 45 . The p53 tumor suppressor gene holds an important role in deciding the cells’ fate if there is DNA damage. If there is mild damage, p53 will stop the growth until the DNA repair process is done. If there is severe damage, p53 will induce senescence process to prevent the increase of precancerous cells. Phosphorylation of Ser 46 causes p53 to activate proapoptotic genes, leading to the induction of apoptosis 45 . However, the different response between HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells after exposure to extract could possibly be caused by different effects of areca nut extract on the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Due to the effects of the p53 mutation on the intrinsic pathway in HSC-3 cells raises the possibility of the effects of the extracts being solely through the extrinsic pathway, whereas in HSC-2 cells, the extract works on the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways leading to more apoptosis occurring in HSC-2 cells. This cannot be determined from these results as not tests on caspase 8 and 9 were performed. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 7 Deleted 19. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 8 The induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is considered a valuable method to treat cancer. A wide variety of natural substances have been recognized to have the ability to induce apoptosis in various tumor cells. Apoptosis is an active form of cell suicide controlled by a network of genes, in which the Bcl-2 family proteins play an important role in the control of apoptosis. The balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins control permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and release of intermembrane space proteins, most notably cytochrome c. In the presence of cytochrome c and dATP, Apaf-1, the scaffold around which the apoptosome is built, recruits and activates caspase-9, which then propagates a cascade of further caspase activation events downstream. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 8 Deleted 20. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 9 Caspases inside cells are in an inactive form (procaspase), but activation induces the production of other caspases leading to cell death through proteolytic activity 46 , 47 . Initiator caspase activation (caspase-8 and 9) by catechin shows early apoptotic activity in cell death. Cell death through extrinsic pathway can be influenced by catechin derivates originating from green tea, resulting in inhibition NF-kB, MAPKs signals, nitric oxide synthesis, and EGFR mediated by transduction pathway signaling through suppressing on EGF binding with its receptor, AP-1, IGF-1 signaling pathway, COX-2, and proteasome activity 46 . Cell death through the mitochondrial pathway can also be induced by catechin. Changes in mitochondria caused by an increase in membrane permeability lead to opened pores and loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential causing the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, thereby activating the caspase-9 and 3 pathway 46 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 9 Deleted 21. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 10 Catechin can increase apoptogenic protein release from mitochondria such as cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and AIF into cytosol leading to death signaling from inside of the mitochondria releasing more and activating caspase-3 48 . The decrease of Bcl2 and Bcl-XL antiapoptotic protein, an increase of Bax proapoptotic protein in the intrinsic pathway are also influenced by catechin. If there is a p53 mutation, the function of BH-3 proapoptotic protein will be inhibited and function of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein family will increase leading to inhibition of anticancer agent activity in the intrinsic pathway. Caspase-3 activation is a crucial component in the apoptotic signaling cascade. Based on the results obtained from our study, the apoptosis pathway involved in areca nut-induced cell death in both cancer cell lines may be through the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Further investigation is needed to clarify the exact mechanism through which areca nut induces apoptosis. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 10 Deleted 22. Statement before revision Discussion Pararagraph 11 This research also showed that the apoptosis activity using flow cytometry has several advantages, including fast period time analysis (thousand of cells per second), single cell analysis, and multiparametric measurements (correlations with several different cell events in one unit of time), but this machine also has drawbacks; the presence of physical and enzymatic manipulations during cell preparation and staining, can trigger additional apoptosis or necrosis cell numbers. Furthermore, flow cytometry is an efficient machine to calculate the number of apoptotic cells based on PS staining out of the cell membrane, so it is more appropriate to detect early apoptosis. If the test aims to improve the accuracy of DNA fragmentation calculations in late apoptosis, it is recommended to use Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) .

Statement before revision Results Caspase-3 assay The caspase-3 assay was performed in triplicate in HSC-2 cells also using flow cytometry. The value is calculated based on the percentage of the cell population with caspase-3 enzyme activity during apoptosis. The percentage of control and test cells in the same quadrant was compared. The M1 quadrant demonstrates the number of living cells without active caspase-3, whereas M 2 quadrant is a number of apoptotic cells with active caspase-3. Areca nut extract caused an increase in the number of cells with active caspase-3 which is 85.9456.86% more than the number of cells without activating caspase-3 (14.3711.27% after 24 hours exposure). This value is in accordance with the results of the apoptosis test, as an increase in caspase-3 corresponds with an increase of late apoptosis cell population. Untreated cells (M 1 ) were primarily negative for the presence of active caspase-3, whereas greater than one-third of the treated cells were positive for active caspase-3 staining (M 2 ). The similar patterns were seen in 24 and 48 hours after exposure ( Figure 3A). This shows that the ability of the extract to induce apoptosis is increased with longer exposure in HSC-2 cells. Revision: Results Caspase-3 assay We examined whether the areca nut extract can induce the activity of caspase-3 activity by using flow cytometry. The values are calculated based on the percentage of the cell population with caspase-3 enzyme activity during apoptosis. The percentage of control and test cells in the same quadrant were compared. The M 1 quadrant demonstrates the number of living cells without active caspase-3, whereas M 2 quadrant is a number of apoptotic cells with active caspase-3 (Figure 3A). The results indicated that the areca nut extract can increase the number of HSC-2 cells with active caspase-3 significantly after 24 and 48 hours exposure (85.930.01% and 97.050.01%, respectively) (Figure 3B). The untreated cells (M 1 ) were primarily negative for the presence of active caspase-3, whereas greater than one-third of the treated cells were positive for the active caspase-3 staining (M 2 ). These values are in accordance with the results of the apoptosis test, as an increase in caspase-3 corresponds with an increase of the late apoptosis cell population. 9.

Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 1 This study is a novel or first study which clearly reveals the potential cytotoxicity effect and mechanism of action of areca nut in oral squamous cell lines. Our preliminary study showed that the areca nut has a high content of total phenolic and flavonoid 38 . The areca nut has chemosensitivity of cancer cells in different concentrations. We performed an MTS assay to observe the areca nut extract on cell viability. Five doses were adding into cancer cells, which were 160, 320, 640, 1280, and 2560 μg/mL in HSC-2, HSC-3, and HaCat cells 38 . We found that the areca nut extract was cytotoxic towards HSC-2 (IC50 629.50 g/mL), while in the HSC-3 cells, the IC50 is lower than HSC-2 cells (IC50 164.06 g/mL). The areca nut showed weak cytotoxicity against HSC-2 cells. Sakagami et al. found that flavonoid-related phenols especially flavones showed weak cytotoxic activity against HSC-2 39 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 1 This study is a novel or first study which clearly reveals the potential cytotoxicity effect and mechanism of action of areca nut in oral squamous cell lines. Our preliminary study showed that the areca nut has a high content of total phenolic and flavonoid and showed cytotoxicity activity against HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells 38 . In the present study, we found that areca nut extract can induce apoptosis in HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells with optimum time after 48 hours exposure. This result is similar with the previous study that the ethanolic extract of areca nut (IC 50 77 μg/mL) for 48 hours could inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells 40 . 13. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 2 This study performs apoptosis and caspase-3 activity tests using flow cytometry, with the objective to acknowledge whether the cell death mechanism happens through apoptosis induction by areca nut extract or not. In order to acknowledge the optimum time of areca nut extract activity against the cells, two units of time are used, which are 24 and 48 hours. The results of flow cytometry analysis on HSC-2 cells shows that areca nut extract can induce late apoptosis activity after 24 and 48 hours exposure, but the increase of late apoptotic cells occurs more following 48 hours exposure. This result is in accordance with the past study that performed apoptosis test using orange acridine-ethidium bromide staining (double staining). The result showed that treatment with an ethanolic extract of areca nut (IC 50 77 μg/mL) for 48 hours inhibits the growth of MCF-7 cells as much as 13–84% 40 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 2 Although the extract has the same optimum time in both cells, we found that HSC-3 cells have the ability to withstand apoptosis higher than HSC-2 cells. This result is possible because of the characteristic of HSC-3 cells is different from HSC-2 cells. Both cells have mutated p53 tumor-suppressor gene [2, 3].The HSC-3 cell line has high metastatic potential with doubling time longer than HSC-2. The HSC-2 cell line has neither invasive nor metastatic potential. However, we do not fully understand the different mechanism that occured between the two cell types in response to the areca nut. Further studies to investigate this issue will be needed. 14. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 3 The flow cytometry analysis was performed to reveal the loss of plasma membrane asymmetry in cells. In apoptotic cells, the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, thereby exposing PS to the external cellular environment. Annexin V is a 35–36 kDa Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein with high affinity for PS and binds to exposed apoptotic cell surface PS. Annexin V can be conjugated to fluorochromes while retaining its high affinity for PS and thus serves as a sensitive probe for flow cytometric analysis of cells undergoing apoptosis. This is one of the earliest features of apoptosis. In our research, The flow cytometry was performed triple for both cells. The cells are processed with enzymatic degradation, centrifugation, and/or filtration to isolate the cells of interest, and the resulting cellular suspension is “stained” with fluorescent antibodies. When HSC-2 cells were cultured with areca nut for 48 hours, most of the cells were in the upper right quadrant; AV+/PI+. It means that most of the cells have undergone late apoptosis ( Figure 1B). However, when HSC-2 cells were cultured for 48 hours under the same condition without areca nut treatment, we found that only less than 40% of the cells were viable. This condition suggests that the preparation of the staining process in flow cytometry itself may trigger the death of the cells (apoptosis or necrosis). The same result is seen in the HSC-3 cells for 24 hours without treatment. This includes one of the limitations of our research. To ascertain the biological mechanism underlying areca nut-induced death, the apoptotic cell images should be obtained by a fluorescent microscope.

The same result is seen in the untreated HSC-3 cells for 24 hours without treatment. This includes one of the limitations of our research. To ascertain the biological mechanism underlying areca nut-induced death, the apoptotic cell images should be obtained by a fluorescent microscope. 15. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 4 Areca nut extract can possibly induce non-apoptotic cell death or necrosis. This is shown from the increase in necrotic cell percentage significantly after 24 hours of exposure. One of the past studies using catechin from green tea, proved that catechin has the ability to induce necrosis or non-apoptotic cell death in leukemia cells without caspase-8, 9, and 3 activities 41 Although molecular mechanism pathway of necrosis is not clearly understood, catechin can possibly induce necrosis through two pathways, which are decreasing concentration of intracellular ATP and interaction on ATP-binding site of glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) leading to increased activity of ATPase 41 . This result shows two competitive abilities between catechin and ATP-binding site leading to necrosis with catechin activity via the apoptosome (intrinsic pathway) and death induced signaling pathway (DISC; extrinsic pathway). Revision: Discussion Paragraph 4 The present study demonstrated that the caspase-3 activity as an effector caspase is shown to be related with late apoptosis activity because of the increase of caspase-3 with increasing late apoptotic cells percentage in both cells. Analysis of caspase activity confirmed that apoptosis might be the major mechanism of cell death induced by areca nut. As far as we know, there is no similar report regarding the caspase-3 activity by areca nut, but this result is similar to several previous studies that used plants containing flavonoid to increase caspase activity in cancer cells[4, 5] 42 . This finding may have biological implications in cancer treatment. Caspases inside cells are in an inactive form (procaspase), but activation induces the production of other caspases leading to cell death through proteolytic activity 46 , 47 . Caspase-3 activation is a crucial component in the apoptotic signaling cascade. Based on the results obtained from our study, the apoptosis pathway involved in areca nut-induced cell death in both cancer cell lines may be through the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Further investigation is needed to clarify the exact mechanism through which areca nut induces apoptosis. 16. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 5 Analysis of caspase-3 activity in HSC-2 cells shows results in accordance with the apoptosis assay, in that caspase-3 activity increases significantly after areca nut extract for 24 and 48 hours compared to control, with the increase of caspase-3 activity also being higher after 48 hours exposure. This result is similar to the study using catechin of green tea and hydrate catechin against HS-sultan and RPMI8226 cell strains, and MCF-7 cells using Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR techniques, that this compound can induce caspase-3, 8, and 9 activities 42 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 5 This research showed that the apoptosis activity using flow cytometry has several advantages, including fast period time analysis (thousand of cells per second), single cell analysis, and multiparametric measurements (correlations with several different cell events in one unit of time), but this machine also has drawbacks; the presence of physical and enzymatic manipulations during cell preparation and staining, can trigger additional apoptosis or necrosis cell numbers. Furthermore, flow cytometry is an efficient machine to calculate the number of apoptotic cells based on PS staining out of the cell membrane, so it is more appropriate to detect early apoptosis. If the test aims to improve the accuracy of DNA fragmentation calculations in late apoptosis, it is recommended to use Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) . 17. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 6 The results of flow cytometry analysis on HSC-3 cells show that areca nut extract could also induce apoptosis after extract exposure for 24 and 48 hours. Unlike with HSC-2 cells, extract exposure induced more early apoptosis after 24 hours exposure, but after 48 exposure apoptosis induction by the extract happened more in the end step. Caspase-3 activity as an effector caspase is shown to be related with late apoptosis activity because of the increase of caspase-3 with increasing late apoptotic cells percentage. There is a significant increase in necrotic cells percentage after 48 hours of exposure. Therefore, the apoptosis assay showed that areca nut extract is capable of inducing apoptosis in HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells with an optimum time after 48 hours exposure. Although the extract has the same optimum time in both cells, there is a difference on extract effect on the number of apoptotic cells, where the percentage of HSC-2 cells undergoing apoptosis is higher than HSC-3 cells. This result is possible because of the characteristic of HSC-3 cells is different from HSC-2 cells. The HSC-3 cells have the p53 gene mutation 36 . The mutation of HSC-3 cells was confirmed in a previous report 43 . However, when the p53 gene mutates, the mutated p53 protein is excessively produced or accumulated, thereby compromising apoptosis and leading to abnormal or malignant cell growth 44 . We found that HSC-3 cells have the ability to withstand apoptosis higher than HSC-2 cells. However, this finding may vary by the study design and so much more data must be collected to better understand this phenomena. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 6 Deleted 18. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 7 Literature shows that in addition to the p53 gene mutation in HSC-3, severe damage to phosphorylation of Ser 46 in HSC-3 cells causes loss of apoptotic ability mediated by p53 and also increased survival ability of HSC-3 cells against anticancer genes compared to HSC-2 cells 45 . The p53 tumor suppressor gene holds an important role in deciding the cells’ fate if there is DNA damage. If there is mild damage, p53 will stop the growth until the DNA repair process is done. If there is severe damage, p53 will induce senescence process to prevent the increase of precancerous cells. Phosphorylation of Ser 46 causes p53 to activate proapoptotic genes, leading to the induction of apoptosis 45 . However, the different response between HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells after exposure to extract could possibly be caused by different effects of areca nut extract on the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Due to the effects of the p53 mutation on the intrinsic pathway in HSC-3 cells raises the possibility of the effects of the extracts being solely through the extrinsic pathway, whereas in HSC-2 cells, the extract works on the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways leading to more apoptosis occurring in HSC-2 cells. This cannot be determined from these results as not tests on caspase 8 and 9 were performed. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 7 Deleted 19. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 8 The induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is considered a valuable method to treat cancer. A wide variety of natural substances have been recognized to have the ability to induce apoptosis in various tumor cells. Apoptosis is an active form of cell suicide controlled by a network of genes, in which the Bcl-2 family proteins play an important role in the control of apoptosis. The balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins control permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and release of intermembrane space proteins, most notably cytochrome c. In the presence of cytochrome c and dATP, Apaf-1, the scaffold around which the apoptosome is built, recruits and activates caspase-9, which then propagates a cascade of further caspase activation events downstream. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 8 Deleted 20. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 9 Caspases inside cells are in an inactive form (procaspase), but activation induces the production of other caspases leading to cell death through proteolytic activity 46 , 47 . Initiator caspase activation (caspase-8 and 9) by catechin shows early apoptotic activity in cell death. Cell death through extrinsic pathway can be influenced by catechin derivates originating from green tea, resulting in inhibition NF-kB, MAPKs signals, nitric oxide synthesis, and EGFR mediated by transduction pathway signaling through suppressing on EGF binding with its receptor, AP-1, IGF-1 signaling pathway, COX-2, and proteasome activity 46 . Cell death through the mitochondrial pathway can also be induced by catechin. Changes in mitochondria caused by an increase in membrane permeability lead to opened pores and loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential causing the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, thereby activating the caspase-9 and 3 pathway 46 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 9 Deleted 21. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 10 Catechin can increase apoptogenic protein release from mitochondria such as cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and AIF into cytosol leading to death signaling from inside of the mitochondria releasing more and activating caspase-3 48 . The decrease of Bcl2 and Bcl-XL antiapoptotic protein, an increase of Bax proapoptotic protein in the intrinsic pathway are also influenced by catechin. If there is a p53 mutation, the function of BH-3 proapoptotic protein will be inhibited and function of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein family will increase leading to inhibition of anticancer agent activity in the intrinsic pathway. Caspase-3 activation is a crucial component in the apoptotic signaling cascade. Based on the results obtained from our study, the apoptosis pathway involved in areca nut-induced cell death in both cancer cell lines may be through the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Further investigation is needed to clarify the exact mechanism through which areca nut induces apoptosis. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 10 Deleted 22.

Statement before revision Results Caspase-3 assay The caspase-3 assay was performed in triplicate in HSC-2 cells also using flow cytometry. The value is calculated based on the percentage of the cell population with caspase-3 enzyme activity during apoptosis. The percentage of control and test cells in the same quadrant was compared. The M1 quadrant demonstrates the number of living cells without active caspase-3, whereas M 2 quadrant is a number of apoptotic cells with active caspase-3. Areca nut extract caused an increase in the number of cells with active caspase-3 which is 85.9456.86% more than the number of cells without activating caspase-3 (14.3711.27% after 24 hours exposure). This value is in accordance with the results of the apoptosis test, as an increase in caspase-3 corresponds with an increase of late apoptosis cell population. Untreated cells (M 1 ) were primarily negative for the presence of active caspase-3, whereas greater than one-third of the treated cells were positive for active caspase-3 staining (M 2 ). The similar patterns were seen in 24 and 48 hours after exposure ( Figure 3A). This shows that the ability of the extract to induce apoptosis is increased with longer exposure in HSC-2 cells. Revision: Results Caspase-3 assay We examined whether the areca nut extract can induce the activity of caspase-3 activity by using flow cytometry. The values are calculated based on the percentage of the cell population with caspase-3 enzyme activity during apoptosis. The percentage of control and test cells in the same quadrant were compared. The M 1 quadrant demonstrates the number of living cells without active caspase-3, whereas M 2 quadrant is a number of apoptotic cells with active caspase-3 (Figure 3A).

This is shown from the increase in necrotic cell percentage significantly after 24 hours of exposure.

As far as we know, there is no similar report regarding the caspase-3 activity by areca nut, but this result is similar to several previous studies that used plants containing flavonoid to increase caspase activity in cancer cells[4, 5] 42 . This finding may have biological implications in cancer treatment. Caspases inside cells are in an inactive form (procaspase), but activation induces the production of other caspases leading to cell death through proteolytic activity 46 , 47 . Caspase-3 activation is a crucial component in the apoptotic signaling cascade. Based on the results obtained from our study, the apoptosis pathway involved in areca nut-induced cell death in both cancer cell lines may be through the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Further investigation is needed to clarify the exact mechanism through which areca nut induces apoptosis. 16. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 5 Analysis of caspase-3 activity in HSC-2 cells shows results in accordance with the apoptosis assay, in that caspase-3 activity increases significantly after areca nut extract for 24 and 48 hours compared to control, with the increase of caspase-3 activity also being higher after 48 hours exposure. This result is similar to the study using catechin of green tea and hydrate catechin against HS-sultan and RPMI8226 cell strains, and MCF-7 cells using Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR techniques, that this compound can induce caspase-3, 8, and 9 activities 42 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 5 This research showed that the apoptosis activity using flow cytometry has several advantages, including fast period time analysis (thousand of cells per second), single cell analysis, and multiparametric measurements (correlations with several different cell events in one unit of time), but this machine also has drawbacks; the presence of physical and enzymatic manipulations during cell preparation and staining, can trigger additional apoptosis or necrosis cell numbers. Furthermore, flow cytometry is an efficient machine to calculate the number of apoptotic cells based on PS staining out of the cell membrane, so it is more appropriate to detect early apoptosis. If the test aims to improve the accuracy of DNA fragmentation calculations in late apoptosis, it is recommended to use Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) . 17. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 6 The results of flow cytometry analysis on HSC-3 cells show that areca nut extract could also induce apoptosis after extract exposure for 24 and 48 hours. Unlike with HSC-2 cells, extract exposure induced more early apoptosis after 24 hours exposure, but after 48 exposure apoptosis induction by the extract happened more in the end step. Caspase-3 activity as an effector caspase is shown to be related with late apoptosis activity because of the increase of caspase-3 with increasing late apoptotic cells percentage. There is a significant increase in necrotic cells percentage after 48 hours of exposure. Therefore, the apoptosis assay showed that areca nut extract is capable of inducing apoptosis in HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells with an optimum time after 48 hours exposure. Although the extract has the same optimum time in both cells, there is a difference on extract effect on the number of apoptotic cells, where the percentage of HSC-2 cells undergoing apoptosis is higher than HSC-3 cells. This result is possible because of the characteristic of HSC-3 cells is different from HSC-2 cells. The HSC-3 cells have the p53 gene mutation 36 . The mutation of HSC-3 cells was confirmed in a previous report 43 . However, when the p53 gene mutates, the mutated p53 protein is excessively produced or accumulated, thereby compromising apoptosis and leading to abnormal or malignant cell growth 44 . We found that HSC-3 cells have the ability to withstand apoptosis higher than HSC-2 cells. However, this finding may vary by the study design and so much more data must be collected to better understand this phenomena. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 6 Deleted 18. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 7 Literature shows that in addition to the p53 gene mutation in HSC-3, severe damage to phosphorylation of Ser 46 in HSC-3 cells causes loss of apoptotic ability mediated by p53 and also increased survival ability of HSC-3 cells against anticancer genes compared to HSC-2 cells 45 . The p53 tumor suppressor gene holds an important role in deciding the cells’ fate if there is DNA damage. If there is mild damage, p53 will stop the growth until the DNA repair process is done. If there is severe damage, p53 will induce senescence process to prevent the increase of precancerous cells. Phosphorylation of Ser 46 causes p53 to activate proapoptotic genes, leading to the induction of apoptosis 45 . However, the different response between HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells after exposure to extract could possibly be caused by different effects of areca nut extract on the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Due to the effects of the p53 mutation on the intrinsic pathway in HSC-3 cells raises the possibility of the effects of the extracts being solely through the extrinsic pathway, whereas in HSC-2 cells, the extract works on the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways leading to more apoptosis occurring in HSC-2 cells. This cannot be determined from these results as not tests on caspase 8 and 9 were performed. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 7 Deleted 19. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 8 The induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is considered a valuable method to treat cancer. A wide variety of natural substances have been recognized to have the ability to induce apoptosis in various tumor cells. Apoptosis is an active form of cell suicide controlled by a network of genes, in which the Bcl-2 family proteins play an important role in the control of apoptosis. The balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins control permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and release of intermembrane space proteins, most notably cytochrome c. In the presence of cytochrome c and dATP, Apaf-1, the scaffold around which the apoptosome is built, recruits and activates caspase-9, which then propagates a cascade of further caspase activation events downstream. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 8 Deleted 20. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 9 Caspases inside cells are in an inactive form (procaspase), but activation induces the production of other caspases leading to cell death through proteolytic activity 46 , 47 . Initiator caspase activation (caspase-8 and 9) by catechin shows early apoptotic activity in cell death. Cell death through extrinsic pathway can be influenced by catechin derivates originating from green tea, resulting in inhibition NF-kB, MAPKs signals, nitric oxide synthesis, and EGFR mediated by transduction pathway signaling through suppressing on EGF binding with its receptor, AP-1, IGF-1 signaling pathway, COX-2, and proteasome activity 46 . Cell death through the mitochondrial pathway can also be induced by catechin. Changes in mitochondria caused by an increase in membrane permeability lead to opened pores and loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential causing the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, thereby activating the caspase-9 and 3 pathway 46 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 9 Deleted 21. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 10 Catechin can increase apoptogenic protein release from mitochondria such as cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and AIF into cytosol leading to death signaling from inside of the mitochondria releasing more and activating caspase-3 48 . The decrease of Bcl2 and Bcl-XL antiapoptotic protein, an increase of Bax proapoptotic protein in the intrinsic pathway are also influenced by catechin. If there is a p53 mutation, the function of BH-3 proapoptotic protein will be inhibited and function of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein family will increase leading to inhibition of anticancer agent activity in the intrinsic pathway. Caspase-3 activation is a crucial component in the apoptotic signaling cascade. Based on the results obtained from our study, the apoptosis pathway involved in areca nut-induced cell death in both cancer cell lines may be through the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Further investigation is needed to clarify the exact mechanism through which areca nut induces apoptosis. Revision: Discussion Paragraph 10 Deleted 22.

Statement before revision Results There was no increase in late apoptosis but, instead, the early apoptotic cell population increased. There was an increase in early apoptotic cell populations from untreated to treated cells (1.77% to 17.88%, respectively). Revision: Results There was no increase in late apoptosis but, instead, the early apoptotic cell population increased (37.48% to 70.10%) (Figure 2. B; left panel). Next, the apoptosis assay in HSC-3 cells after 48 hours exposure, however, showed significant increases in early and late apoptotic cell percentage (18.201.03% and 70.10.25%, respectively) (Figure 2.B; right panel). 7.

Statement before revision Results Caspase-3 assay The caspase-3 assay was performed in triplicate in HSC-2 cells also using flow cytometry. The value is calculated based on the percentage of the cell population with caspase-3 enzyme activity during apoptosis. The percentage of control and test cells in the same quadrant was compared. The M1 quadrant demonstrates the number of living cells without active caspase-3, whereas M 2 quadrant is a number of apoptotic cells with active caspase-3. Areca nut extract caused an increase in the number of cells with active caspase-3 which is 85.9456.86% more than the number of cells without activating caspase-3 (14.3711.27% after 24 hours exposure). This value is in accordance with the results of the apoptosis test, as an increase in caspase-3 corresponds with an increase of late apoptosis cell population. Untreated cells (M 1 ) were primarily negative for the presence of active caspase-3, whereas greater than one-third of the treated cells were positive for active caspase-3 staining (M 2 ). The similar patterns were seen in 24 and 48 hours after exposure ( Figure 3A). This shows that the ability of the extract to induce apoptosis is increased with longer exposure in HSC-2 cells. Revision: Results Caspase-3 assay We examined whether the areca nut extract can induce the activity of caspase-3 activity by using flow cytometry. The values are calculated based on the percentage of the cell population with caspase-3 enzyme activity during apoptosis. The percentage of control and test cells in the same quadrant were compared. The M 1 quadrant demonstrates the number of living cells without active caspase-3, whereas M 2 quadrant is a number of apoptotic cells with active caspase-3 (Figure 3A). The results indicated that the areca nut extract can increase the number of HSC-2 cells with active caspase-3 significantly after 24 and 48 hours exposure (85.930.01% and 97.050.01%, respectively) (Figure 3B). The untreated cells (M 1 ) were primarily negative for the presence of active caspase-3, whereas greater than one-third of the treated cells were positive for the active caspase-3 staining (M 2 ). These values are in accordance with the results of the apoptosis test, as an increase in caspase-3 corresponds with an increase of the late apoptosis cell population. 9.

Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 1 This study is a novel or first study which clearly reveals the potential cytotoxicity effect and mechanism of action of areca nut in oral squamous cell lines. Our preliminary study showed that the areca nut has a high content of total phenolic and flavonoid 38 . The areca nut has chemosensitivity of cancer cells in different concentrations. We performed an MTS assay to observe the areca nut extract on cell viability. Five doses were adding into cancer cells, which were 160, 320, 640, 1280, and 2560 μg/mL in HSC-2, HSC-3, and HaCat cells 38 . We found that the areca nut extract was cytotoxic towards HSC-2 (IC50 629.50 g/mL), while in the HSC-3 cells, the IC50 is lower than HSC-2 cells (IC50 164.06 g/mL). The areca nut showed weak cytotoxicity against HSC-2 cells. Sakagami et al. found that flavonoid-related phenols especially flavones showed weak cytotoxic activity against HSC-2 39 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 1 This study is a novel or first study which clearly reveals the potential cytotoxicity effect and mechanism of action of areca nut in oral squamous cell lines. Our preliminary study showed that the areca nut has a high content of total phenolic and flavonoid and showed cytotoxicity activity against HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells 38 . In the present study, we found that areca nut extract can induce apoptosis in HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells with optimum time after 48 hours exposure. This result is similar with the previous study that the ethanolic extract of areca nut (IC 50 77 μg/mL) for 48 hours could inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells 40 . 13. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 2 This study performs apoptosis and caspase-3 activity tests using flow cytometry, with the objective to acknowledge whether the cell death mechanism happens through apoptosis induction by areca nut extract or not. In order to acknowledge the optimum time of areca nut extract activity against the cells, two units of time are used, which are 24 and 48 hours. The results of flow cytometry analysis on HSC-2 cells shows that areca nut extract can induce late apoptosis activity after 24 and 48 hours exposure, but the increase of late apoptotic cells occurs more following 48 hours exposure. This result is in accordance with the past study that performed apoptosis test using orange acridine-ethidium bromide staining (double staining). The result showed that treatment with an ethanolic extract of areca nut (IC 50 77 μg/mL) for 48 hours inhibits the growth of MCF-7 cells as much as 13–84% 40 . Revision: Discussion Paragraph 2 Although the extract has the same optimum time in both cells, we found that HSC-3 cells have the ability to withstand apoptosis higher than HSC-2 cells. This result is possible because of the characteristic of HSC-3 cells is different from HSC-2 cells. Both cells have mutated p53 tumor-suppressor gene [2, 3].The HSC-3 cell line has high metastatic potential with doubling time longer than HSC-2. The HSC-2 cell line has neither invasive nor metastatic potential. However, we do not fully understand the different mechanism that occured between the two cell types in response to the areca nut. Further studies to investigate this issue will be needed. 14. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 3 The flow cytometry analysis was performed to reveal the loss of plasma membrane asymmetry in cells. In apoptotic cells, the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, thereby exposing PS to the external cellular environment. Annexin V is a 35–36 kDa Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein with high affinity for PS and binds to exposed apoptotic cell surface PS. Annexin V can be conjugated to fluorochromes while retaining its high affinity for PS and thus serves as a sensitive probe for flow cytometric analysis of cells undergoing apoptosis. This is one of the earliest features of apoptosis. In our research, The flow cytometry was performed triple for both cells. The cells are processed with enzymatic degradation, centrifugation, and/or filtration to isolate the cells of interest, and the resulting cellular suspension is “stained” with fluorescent antibodies. When HSC-2 cells were cultured with areca nut for 48 hours, most of the cells were in the upper right quadrant; AV+/PI+. It means that most of the cells have undergone late apoptosis ( Figure 1B). However, when HSC-2 cells were cultured for 48 hours under the same condition without areca nut treatment, we found that only less than 40% of the cells were viable. This condition suggests that the preparation of the staining process in flow cytometry itself may trigger the death of the cells (apoptosis or necrosis). The same result is seen in the HSC-3 cells for 24 hours without treatment. This includes one of the limitations of our research. To ascertain the biological mechanism underlying areca nut-induced death, the apoptotic cell images should be obtained by a fluorescent microscope.

In apoptotic cells, the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, thereby exposing PS to the external cellular environment. The cells are processed with enzymatic degradation, centrifugation, and/or filtration to isolate the cells of interest, and the resulting cellular suspension is “stained” with fluorescent antibodies. In our finding, most of the treated HSC-2 cells were undergone late apoptosis ( Figure 1A). However, we found that only less than 40% of the control cells were viable. This condition suggests that the preparation of the staining process in flow cytometry itself may trigger the death of the cells (apoptosis or necrosis). The same result is seen in the untreated HSC-3 cells for 24 hours without treatment. This includes one of the limitations of our research. To ascertain the biological mechanism underlying areca nut-induced death, the apoptotic cell images should be obtained by a fluorescent microscope. 15. Statement before revision Discussion Paragraph 4 Areca nut extract can possibly induce non-apoptotic cell death or necrosis. This is shown from the increase in necrotic cell percentage significantly after 24 hours of exposure. One of the past studies using catechin from green tea, proved that catechin has the ability to induce necrosis or non-apoptotic cell death in leukemia cells without caspase-8, 9, and 3 activities 41 Although molecular mechanism pathway of necrosis is not clearly understood, catechin can possibly induce necrosis through two pathways, which are decreasing concentration of intracellular ATP and interaction on ATP-binding site of glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) leading to increased activity of ATPase 41 . This result shows two competitive abilities between catechin and ATP-binding site leading to necrosis with catechin activity via the apoptosome (intrinsic pathway) and death induced signaling pathway (DISC; extrinsic pathway). Revision: Discussion Paragraph 4 The present study demonstrated that the caspase-3 activity as an effector caspase is shown to be related with late apoptosis activity because of the increase of caspase-3 with increasing late apoptotic cells percentage in both cells. Analysis of caspase activity confirmed that apoptosis might be the major mechanism of cell death induced by areca nut.
