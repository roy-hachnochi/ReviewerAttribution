 The case is well presented, and the clinical details are well written and meticulously enumerated. The case is relevant for practice and will benefit clinicians. The only comment I would have is to change the word "ileum" on p.2 (2nd paragraph) to "ileal" and the word "rectorrhagia" to "hematochezia" in order to conform to the more commonly used medical terminology. This paper is an excellent case report that presents useful information for the clinician. I would recommend acceptance if the two semantic changes were made.
