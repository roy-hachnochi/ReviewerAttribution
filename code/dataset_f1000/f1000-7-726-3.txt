The work is about adding PF127 as the additive of a PVC membrane. Membrane characteristics and performances are measured. It is, however, not clear why the addition is only until 7%. Is there any reason for this? Looking at the results, better performance could be obtain for higher concentration of PF127. In this sense, we cannot conclude the way it is concluded now. The same goes with the shrinkage test, where it is only tested at 80 degC. Hence, the respective conclusion is not correct. At 7%, the shrinkage is about 10%, is it not already significant shrinkage? For the permeability test, it will be clearer if all various additives are put on the same graph, with the x-axis as the time and y-axis as the permeability. Then, we can see and compare the performance better. All in all, the analysis of the data and the conclusion need to be revisited.
