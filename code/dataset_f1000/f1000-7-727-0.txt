The manuscript ' Automating the PathLinker app for Cytoscape' by Huang, law and Murali introduces an API solution of their PathLinker software that was previously published. Although the PathLinker algorithm was made available through a Cytoscape app it turned out that its usage through the Cytoscape framework was initially cumbersome. With the new solution the authors used the CyREST API that allows to tap the results of the PathLinger app when used in conjunction with Cytoscape to be incorporated in user specific pipelines. As such, the authors allow through their API to use a Cytoscape app and results thus obtained to link to methods outside the Cytoscape framework. In particular, API output can easily be tapped using python and R code as well as using the Junyper notebook. The proposed API appears very useful for researchers who want to consider the advantages of the PathFinder app w/o being constrained by the Cytoscape framework. The current manuscript describes the basic steps to get a user going. As a small change I would describe the examples in a bit more detail to show a fully worked example. In particular, Fig. 3 goes in that direction but is a bit generic. Working a real example would help with the transparency of the underlying approach.
