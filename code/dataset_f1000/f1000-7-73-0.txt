This study from Dalton aims to understand whether the same mechanisms that control olfactory receptor (OR) gene choice also govern the selection of vomeronasal receptors (VRs). The paper presents several immunohistological assays demonstrating that the expression of ATF5 is regulated by similar genes to those observed in the olfactory epithelium. Finally, the author shows that the expression pattern of ATF5 in the vomeronasal organ is distinct from the observed pattern in the olfactory epithelium. Overall, this work is well presented and clearly described. A few points deserve revision. Major points: The author acknowledges that there is significant cell death caused by mutation of Lsd1. An additional control demonstrating that the expression of a housekeeping gene would be useful to demonstrate that gene expression is not globally altered in the surviving cells. Minor points: The statement of a hypothesis in the Results section should be deleted. This hypothesis is adequately addressed in the Discussion section. Lines delineating regions that contain immature vs mature VSNs could be drawn in Figure 3 to aid readers who are less familiar with the structure of the VNO. The second to last paragraph of the introduction lacks several references. The authors should review this paragraph and add citations. The sentence beginning "A number of studies support..." In the second to last paragraph of the discussion lacks a citation.
