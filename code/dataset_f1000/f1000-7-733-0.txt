The authors present a well-protocol using bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation over auditory cortex for tinnitus treatment. Tinnitus is quite common, yet not well understood. Understanding the etiology and neural basis of tinnitus would help in developing treatment: both alleviation and even remediation. In addition brain research on tinnitus can also reveal important information on the auditory system and its principles in general. As in many neurological conditions, the challenge in studying tinnitus lies in its heterogeneity and the comorbidity with other conditions affecting auditory processing. When regarding tinnitus the hearing loss is perhaps the most obvious mixing factor. In my opinion, this protocol provides a fairly good starting point towards investigating the effects of a chronic protocol of bilateral tDCS over auditory cortex (AC) with one-month follow-up in a double-blinded randomized clinical trial. The study is reasonably well planned and conducted. However, there are some concerns about the efficacy and safety of tDCS and finding a specific electrode location on the patient's scalp in order to achieve optimal electrode positioning.
