The study is well designed, double-blinded and randomized. Despite some non-completions the study is still reasonably ‘well-powered’, in that the n is reasonable compared to that typically reported in the literature. There is a clear flow diagram explaining how subjects were assigned to conditions. There is a wide range of outcome measures including those of auditory function, perception of tinnitus and well-being. There are several outcome time points which is also a strength of the design. The introduction may have liked to have provided a rationale for only investigating cathodal rather than anodal TDCS. Presumably the putative inhibitory actions of cathodal TDCS (rather than the excitatory actions of anodal TDCS) would be expected to reduce tinnitus symptoms.
