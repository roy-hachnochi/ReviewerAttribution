 The authors discuss an important issue regarding the pricing of drugs. The issue is presented clearly and concisely, and is put in the context of other drug pricing situations where egregious prices are being charges. The authors then propose a solution to prevent such an example from occurring in the future. It is important for this paper to be indexed as it will spark a debate about how to prevent a company like Marathon from exploiting loopholes in the US orphan drug approvals process.The Emflaza case is one where a company is charging far too high a price for an important DMD drug which has been available for decades in Europe for far less money. Furthermore, the authors show that this is not a unique situation and that it is likely to be repeated by another company. Thus, a solution is needed. The authors propose a potential solution which should be aired and debated. Thus, I fully endorse indexing of this paper. Having said that, I am not fully on board with the authors' solution. Marathon DID spend $50 million on clinical studies to prove the medical viability of Emflaza in DMD patients. Yes, the drug is being used off-label in Europe for DMD, but have studies been published justifying its use? If yes, how vigorous are these studies? Depending on the answers to these questions, one could argue that Marathon did a service for physicians and patients by carrying out a phase 3 program that was of sufficient rigor to garner FDA approval. The authors' solution could work had the NIH carried out these studies and proved the value of Emplaza, thereby justifying the decision to allow Americans to import generics. Again, my questions only serve to justify indexing of this paper to spur such debate.
