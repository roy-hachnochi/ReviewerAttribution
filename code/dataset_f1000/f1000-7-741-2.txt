The iSEE package was developed to allow people to easily perform exploratory data analysis with data that are stored in a Bioconductor SummarizedExperiment object. A SummarizedExperiment container allows researchers to store one or more matrices of data, where the columns represent samples, and the rows represent either genomic positions or genomic features (genes, exons, transcription start sites, etc). In addition to the matrices of data, the SummarizedExperiment also contains two additional objects that describe the samples (the colData) and the rows (the rowData or rowRanges). iSEE allows users to interactively plot the underlying data from a SummarizedExperiment, and also choose subsets of the data based on either interactive selection of data in a plot, or by selecting samples or genomic regions based on the colData or rowData. The chosen subsets can then be linked to other plots in the Shiny Dashboard. This simplifies what could be a complex process, allowing both experienced R users a quick way to check over their data, and allowing less experienced R users the ability to do things that they otherwise might not have been able to do. All the underlying code generated while making interactive changes is saved and can be printed out later, in order to make the exploratory data analysis reproducible. This is an excellent feature, particularly for those who want to share observations with colleagues that may not be local. The only negative for this package is that, being based on the Shiny framework, to allow a colleague to explore the data requires that the colleague either have R, iSEE, and all its dependencies installed, or that you have a server running all necessary packages that you can point the colleague to. This limits sharing with people who are not R savvy, but is a function of how Shiny works, rather than the iSEE package. This is a high quality package, and given the generalizability of the SummarizedExperiment package, is applicable to a whole range of different data types. Given the ease of use, self documenting features, and applicability to multiple data types, this package will likely become very popular for exploratory data analysis.
