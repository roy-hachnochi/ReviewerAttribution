The web-based application, described in the manuscript, could be relevant in terms of applicability in cancer therapy because has the potentiality to find new targets or new factors affecting drug response. The starting point is homology between yeast and human. The authors only showed the RAD9 as example and reported that the human counterpart is the TP53BP1 gene. Where did they find this information? To my knowledge, yeast RAD9 has no human homolog; I have checked in the yeast genome database ( https://www.yeastgenome.org/ ) and I could not find any homology. TP53BP1 appers to be RAD9 homolog only if you find homoly with no filted application ( PANTHER method only giving this result , 1 out of 10 ) I guess that the authors has to state how and where the human homologous to the yeast gene are found and show a little more examples. Moreover, the application only shows data from cBioPortal with no statistical evaluation on how it would be relevant to translate study form yeast to human. What I mean is that there is no functional evaluation of the gene, no data about the level of conservation between human and yeast. What I think is that a high level of conservation should correspond a high degree of reliability. Recently, Mercatanti et al (FEMS Yeast Yesearch, Dec. 2017) 1 published a web tool where yeast strains could be "humanized" and evaluated the reliability score to make the functional assay more relevant for cancer risk evaluation. I do not think that the manuscript is not acceptable in the present form.
