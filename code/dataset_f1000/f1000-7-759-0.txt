In this manuscript, Yeung et al perform a meta-analysis of narrow band imaging versus white light endoscopy for the diagnosis nasopharyngeal carcinoma.A few areas that could be improved in this report: Introduction Explain more about how narrow band imaging works and detects mucosal change. Methods Included studies inclusion criteria are very loosely explained (discussed between DCMY and JYKC), No specific criteria other than prospective studies that compare NBI to WL. Please provide more detail on study protocols that were used. Provide additional detail on imaging characteristics that were concerning for neoplastic change and warranted biopsy. Results: Table 1 and 2 could easily be combined in to a "study characteristics" table. Discussion One confounding factor would be in the indications for imaging and/or biopsy. Mucosal appearance of screening patients and surveillance patients are likely very different aka post-treatment/ radiated mucosa.
