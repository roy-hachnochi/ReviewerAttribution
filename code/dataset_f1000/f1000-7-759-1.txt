A comprehensive review/meta-analysis on the topic of NBI in diagnosis of NPC. Several comments that i have are 1) PRISMA chart - Figure 1 The authors should expand on the reasons of the exclusion of the papers. Having 13 papers excluded after title screen, one paper excluded after data collection without clarification may leave the readers wondering on the nature of the exclusion. 2) The heterogeneity analysis is an inherent weakness of this study which the authors have addressed in the discussion. Having NBI in separate clinical context ( ie screening and if so, in specific high risk cohorts versus general population; and surveillance cohort should be explored). Can a separate robust analysis be performed on the use of NBI in these specific clinical scenarios with the existing dataset? 3) A recent meta-analysis published in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery on this subject yielded similar conclusions. The authors may want to highlight some similarities or differences in their analysis and approach. Overall, an informative article on the subject matter and reviewing the existing evidence of NBI in diagnosis of NPC.
