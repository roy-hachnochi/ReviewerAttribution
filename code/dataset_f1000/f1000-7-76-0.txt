The manuscript is improved and well-written, and the idea of "universal TTSs" is interesting, but there are still several weak points. These points make some of my concerns remain but are not as serious as before. So, I think it is better to let readers make their own judgement. First, the authors analyzed basically only the data of MEG3, which makes the basis of the conclusion weak. The authors say, "To check the ability of other RNAs to form triplexes with MEG3 binding sites, we applied Triplexator to a set of 153 expressed transcripts". The specific 153 ones (given that there are ~20,000 annotated lncRNA genes) make the following "65 analyzed RNAs show results similar to MEG3 lncRNA" quite specific. Second, both the ChOP-seq data and Triplexator results may have defects. For example, the authors say, "the number of the predicted triplexes increases with the lengths of input sequences". Why? Theoretically, if the longer sequences do not contain more TFO, the number of the triplexes should not increase.
