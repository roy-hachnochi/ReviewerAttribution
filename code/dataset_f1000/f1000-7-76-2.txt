Many lncRNAs can bind to DNA sequences by forming triplexes (the binding sites are often called TTS, triplex-targeting sites). Whether there are “universal TTS” as described here is interesting and unreported, and deserves a careful investigation. But I have a major concern about the work: the authors reach the conclusion upon too few examples. Also, why these lncRNAs (BE2L6, LILRA3, HMOX1) were chosen (randomly or selected for some reasons)? A few others issues should also be addressed. First, what is the relationship between the “universal TTSs” and base-pairing rules is untouched. For example, do the universal TTSs allow many lncRNAs to bind to them using the same rules? If very different rules are involved, what does this mean? To some extent, binding upon different rules indicates lncRNA specific TTSs, instead of universal TTSs. Second, I feel that the genomic regions used to sum scores are unreasonably long (3000 bp). Finally, it is said that “the median Triplexator SumScores were 48 and 25, respectively (p-value=5.2e-100)”. Statistically, the difference is significance, but biologically might not. I think 48 is not that large and 25 is not that small.
