Well put together manuscript reviewing the literature in penile prosthesis placement after radical prostatectomy. I commend the authors on their thorough summary. There are several points I would recommend clarified. 1. Page 2 paragraph 3 first sentence – “The initiating factor in the development…” This singular cause is debatable. There was a paper by Box et al. 1 that showed no difference with preservation of the APAs. I would recommend softening the tone. 2. Page 2 paragraph 4 – when discussing the potency rates I would recommend stating that those numbers include patients with and without the use of PDE5Is. 3. Page 2 – surgical considerations – 1 st paragraph, last sentence – spell check – Dilamezinsert is the name listed in the Cooper Surgical catalog. 4. Page 3 – 3 rd paragraph, prevention and management of perforation – Please clarify how the ‘U-type’ suture is used to prevent cylinder migration. 5. Page 3 satisfaction rates after penile prosthesis implantation, first sentence - Check grammar, “of” can be removed as the 4 th word.
