Short summary The Copycat Cytoscape layout plugin presented here maps the node locations of a source network to the node locations of a target network and handles missing nodes. Important is that the source node ids uniquely match the target node ids to avoid network inconsistencies after applying the layout. The Copycat layout is a straightforward to use plugin. The application is simple but powerful and Cytoscape needs this kind of layout algorithm. It is also important the the developers offer a REST enabled service to this plugin which is thoroughly described for different programming languages in the article. The only point the authors could address is a more sophisticated way of handling node inconsistencies. E.g. give a name/id list of nodes that are not unique in the target network to inform the user about this problem instead of just overlaying these nodes on the target network. Will the authors of this plugin consider edge information in the future? E.g. to give an option to map only nodes that are linked in the source and target network.
