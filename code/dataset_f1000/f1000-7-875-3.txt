 Summary: This pilot study evaluated the efficacy of an intraoperative thoracic epidural analgesia by using a multi-parameter device, the nociception level index (NOL). The authors offer an interesting perspective on the use of a multi-parameter intra-operative nociception device in patients undergoing VATS. Comments: Abstract: please mention in the conclusion that more studies are needed. Introduction: please mention that NOL is the only nociception monitor currently available combining several parameters (in contrast to for example ANI; SPI) Discussion: In the limitations, you state that randomization would have added complexity. Can you please explain this? Please mention in the conclusion that future large studies are warranted.
