The study carried out by the authors on Streptococcus pneumoniae is extremely important for Kenya. It addresses a major health problem that has been addressed by other authors in the past and for which a lasting solution is currently being sought. The study is detailed and was able to employ modern techniques to assess the carriage state of children at The Gertrude's Children Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya. The methods used were appropriate and in line with the study's objectives. The sample size was appropriately determined and descriptive statistics have been used appropriately to describe the results obtained by the authors. The title of the study however includes the word 'epidemiology' and this may lead the reader to think that the authors would have tried to determine factors that influenced the establishment of the research problem at the study site. The authors have not determined those factors or risks that lead to Kenyan children being vaccinated, yet not being protected by the PCV-10 vaccine. Those findings would then have given an idea of the risk of expose of children to Streptococcus pneumoniae disease and given the hospital and government the strategies to employ for preventive measures against the disease. The conclusion is brief and does not give recommendations to the Government of Kenya or The Gertrude's Children Hospital on what to do after the findings of the study.
