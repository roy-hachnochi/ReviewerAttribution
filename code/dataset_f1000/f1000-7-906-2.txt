In my view this paper is valuable and suitable for indexing after doing the comments The methodological quality of the study is fair but I think it should be evaluated by an expert of Psychiatry in terms of psychology concepts, classifications of Psychological characteristics and other issues. Maybe the category of “Psychological factors relating to children” is not needed. The section of “These factors can differently contribute to parenting style. Thus,” is unnecessary in abstract section. The introduction section of manuscript needs more clarification on parenting styles and factors contributing to raising children and the importance of . The discussion section just has repeated the results, while it should compare the results with those from other studies, and provide possible reasons to explain the results with additional clarifications. Moreover it should be written in order of most to least important. The conclusions section is just one recommendation, not the real conclusion. It should be written more powerful and as a real conclusion of research which re-states the main points in a new concise way. It should be worked to improve the quality of the English grammar throughout the manuscript.
