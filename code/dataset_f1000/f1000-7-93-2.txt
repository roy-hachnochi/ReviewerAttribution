This manuscript by Qin et al. addresses an important question in the gene regulation field: How cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) are co-regulated within the same cell. Although many genome-wide studies on cis-NATs have been reported in different species, most expression analysis was based on data from bulk samples that include many different cell types. The conclusions from those studies may not be entirely accurate because it is not clear if the two transcripts of each cis-NAT pair indeed express within the same cell. The authors of this study used a unique system â€“ pollen for the analysis because pollen only has two cell types, sperm and vegetative cells, which allows easy identification of NATs that expressed in the same cell type. They identified 872 potential functional cis-NAT pairs in pollen. Microarray expression analysis identified 72 and 56 pairs were potentially functional in sperm and vegetative cells, respectively, as both adjacent genes were expressed. In addition, 271 pairs and 145 pairs for which only one was expressed in sperm or vegetative cell, respectively. It is possible that one of the transcripts within a pair that is expressed may suppress the expression of the other transcript in the same cell. Furthermore, 739 pairs of cis-NATs generated sRNAs and 35 cis-NATs pairs had sRNAs from the overlapping region, suggesting that sRNAs play a role in the co-regulation of NAT genes. Co-regulation analysis of cis-NATs within the same cell is an important but often overlooked criteria, this study provided an excellent example to take the localization of gene expression into consideration, which not only identified a set of pollen-specific functional cis-NATs and sRNAs for future study, but also help us understand the regulatory mechanism of cis-NATs. Thus, I support this manuscript to be indexed without delay.
