This is a case report of bronchogenic cyst. It highlights the importance of imaging, including computed tomography. The article is well-written. One minor suggestion is to consider adjusting the position of the arrows in Figures 1 and 3 as it points at the right lung rather than the cyst - instead an asterix over the cyst can also be practical without hiding parts of the figures.
