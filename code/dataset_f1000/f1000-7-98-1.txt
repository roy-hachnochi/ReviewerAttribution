I offer some brief comments that could be addressed to make the paper more accessible and also justify the work. A schematic of the process used in the study. There was a very detailed description that could have been shortened by providing a schematic. This would enhance the paper, by making it easier to read and understand. What is the marginal advantage of the data in the paper? If one were to just use mapping to the reference human genome (hg38), I assume most of the host-derived reads would get eliminated. How many more reads are eliminated using the database provided in this paper? If this is not a big number, then maybe it is not worth the work? There were some contigs assembled that do not map to the reference human genome? What are these? Some hints on where they come from? Is the DNA or mRNA data most useful? It was not clear to me at the end if one or the other was more useful in the subtraction.
