This study examined the effects of Paclitaxel exposure on Drosophila larval nociception system and the authors propose that their model is suitable for high throughput screening and further mechanistic studies. The study is overall an interesting and clearly written, however, I do have the following concerns: 1. The dose response effect of thermal stimulation was only at 42 degrees. There was no discussion or explanation why this effect was not seen at 46 degrees. 2. The behavior experiment was based on thermal stimulation. I would be interested why mechanical stimulation was not chosen since mechanical sensitivity is common among patients who develop Paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy? 3. It is not clear to me what the timeline is between the exposure of the larvae with paclitaxel and performing microscopic studies. 4. There should be at least a short discussion about the result.
