This manuscript purports to analyze and disclose the chemical diversity of the FooDB database. It is an interesting study with a logical flow based on appropriate methods. There a few optional suggestions that the authors could adapt in the manuscript: It would be advisable for the authors to add the rationale behind selecting the three versions â€“ GRAS, DrugBank and ZINC for data curation. Since acyclic compounds represented the most common scaffold in FooDB, the authors could expand upon the types of functional groups commonly observed in these acyclic compounds in FooDB. Further, the authors point out that there are more polyphenols in FooDB vs. Phenol-explorer. The authors could include the dataset from Phenol-explorer in a consensus diversity plot (like Figure 4) to clearly represent their reults.
