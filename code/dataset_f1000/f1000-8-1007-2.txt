In this manuscript the authors have retrospectively examined the incidence of allergic reactions in a cohort of patients with ALL receiving multiple doses of PEGylated aspraginase. They show that premedication did not have an impact on allergic reactions. The study has drawbacks inherent in a retrospective analysis of a heterogeneously treated population with non standardized blood sampling as acknowledged by the authors. My comments are as follows: A concern with premedication is whether it will mask a true antibody mediated allergy. A major question therefore is whether the allergic reactions observed were actually antibody mediated allergic reactions or infusion reactions that do not affect asparaginase activity. Therefore authors should show the asparaginase levels of patients who had a reaction and compare to those who did not, in order to show whether the reactions observed are due to drug neutralizing antibodies. In their conclusion (in the abstract) the authors focus on patients who receive only 2 doses of PEG asparaginase. In most regimens patients will receive more doses of PEG asparaginase and hence it is unclear why authors focus on patients who receive only 2 doses. The correct conclusion in my opinion is that premedication did not impact the incidence of allergic reaction and premedication did not mask silent inactivation.
