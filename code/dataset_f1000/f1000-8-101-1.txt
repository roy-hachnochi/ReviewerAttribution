 This is a small-size retrospective study with only 75 patients, which is not enough to support their conclusions. In the previous review comments, we asked two questions: For the VSD patients with PNA or PH, does the increased incidence of anaemia have any influence on the therapy or clinical management? As the aetiology of anaemia is multi factorial, any intrinsic and extrinsic factors should be analysed in this article. This is crucial. However, I didnâ€™t see any reply and revision to them. Major revisions are needed.
