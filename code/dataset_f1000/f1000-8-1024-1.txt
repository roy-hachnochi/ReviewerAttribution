Apart from physical and mental rest, there are limited options for clinical management of sport-related concussions or mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). This case report suggests that the ingestion of hydrogen-producing tablets may be a viable treatment to improve the recovery of the concussed footballer. The neuroprotective effects of molecular hydrogen against TBI have been demonstrated in animal models, in the form of hydrogen gas inhalation or hydrogen-rich water administration. However, its efficacy in treating mild TBI in humans has not been examined. The buccal administration of the molecular hydrogen in the present case report represents an innovative immediate treatment approach to manage TBI in the field. The favorable outcomes of the intervention highlight the importance of a more extensive case series, and subsequently the need to conduct controlled trials in examining the therapeutic effects of molecular hydrogen on signs and symptoms of acute mild TBI in athletes.
