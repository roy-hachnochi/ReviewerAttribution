The authors report an interesting case of co-occurrence of primary CNS lymphoma and meningioma in a 64-year-old lady and discuss the importance of preoperative suspicion in their management. The case is indeed interesting and clearly, the authors managed the case well. My observations which the authors may like to clarify include: Was the presence of hemiparesis not suspected when the patient presented with a fall 2 weeks earlier? Clearly, the tendency to fall on the left side must have been given due importance. Details of the surgical approach are necessary. How was the periventricular lesion approached? Through a separate corticectomy or through the bed of the meningioma cavity? Was any intraoperative image guidance utilized? Did you try to rule out systemic lymphoma? If so, how? Apart from being a function of increased age, is there any connecting link between lymphoma and meningioma? Some more literature needs to be incorporated in this regard. Apart from reporting a rare association, a case like this can be more educative if newer insights can be provided as to how do they co-occur and how should they be managed. I would be happy if the authors address these minor points.
