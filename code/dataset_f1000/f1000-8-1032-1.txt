Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this manuscript. It measures the retest reliability of common ocular/oculomotor tests over one year. The sample size is 16 college-aged athletes. Intra-class correlation is performed and presented. I have read through the entire manuscript and it is exceptionally well-written, it shows that it has gone through several internal, and even some external, reviews and revisions already. The statistical analysis are correctly described and the appropriate tests and graphs are used to present data. The most obvious downside of this study is the small sample size, there is so much within-subject variation among these test due to the natural process of aging and ocular adaptations which could be due to insignificant events like getting a new monitor for work. Future studies should be performed on larger sample sizes, etc. But I believe that there is merit in having your study indexed for a couple of reasons. The research protocol and analysis are well explained and could be used for design future oculomotor retest reliability studies. Secondly, I am glad that you had concussion as your exclusionary criteria since there are a hundred different publications showing abnormalities in vision function tests after concussion, yet present no retest reliability without the presence of a concussive head injury. I think this paper provides some preliminary evidence which should be made available to other researchers and I think this is a citable manuscript. I do not have any sentence by sentence suggestions, but my only major suggestion is to remove the pre-outlier ICC of Positive Fusional Vergence at 30cm value of 0.93 and say that it is 0.55 (moderate). And I think Negative Fusional Vergence at 30cm should be classified as Good ICC (not moderate since it is between 0.75 and 0.9).
