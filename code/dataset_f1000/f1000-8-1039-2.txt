The beneficial properties of IL-1ra have been widely demonstrated in numerous experimental models of cerebral ischemic injury. For this reason, the molecule is currently under evaluation in ongoing clinical trials. However, given the mechanism of action of IL-1ra, possible adverse effects of this drug and derived from its immunosuppressive action, such as the potentiation of stroke-related infections, might hamper its clinical use. In this context, the aim of the work by McCulloch et al. is highly relevant by trying to ascertain whether factors associated with enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infections are increased in IL-1ra-treated patients after stroke. The authors explored a wide array of very well selected parameters, ranging from Ig isotypes, components of the complement system, up to noradrenaline, as a parameter of the stress response. The results show that whereas these factors, as expected, are affected by stroke, none of them was affected by the treatment, clearly supporting that, at least with the protocol of administration used for this study, IL-1ra is safe as regards to immunosuppression-derived complications.
