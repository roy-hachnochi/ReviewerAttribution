In this research note, Hurst Gasser highlight Hoechst photoconversion as a potential caveat in UV laser damage experiments. The UV-induced switch of Hoechst (or DAPI) from blue to green may indeed give a false positive signal in the green channel. The following points need to be addressed: The authors refer to a “strong UV laser”. It is not clear which conditions are required for DAPI/Hoechst photoconversion (laser power, exposure time) and how they compare to classical exposure times for DAPI visualization and to UV laser settings for laser damage induction. It is important to clarify this point to determine if we face a marginal or a general problem. The authors should be more specific when referring to UV laser or UV light. They should specify “UVA”, as other UV wavelengths such as UVC, also used to introduce local DNA damage (Dinant et al.,2007 1 ), may not have the same effect. They could suggest using BrdU instead of Hoechst to pre-sensitize cells to UVA light as done in a number of studies (e.g. Lukas et al.,2003 2 ). The authors illustrate the problem with GFP-tagged proteins but the issue would be similar with YFP-tagged proteins. They explain that far-red emission is compatible with photoconverted DAPI/Hoechst. How about red emission? There are 55 files on figshare, which seems excessive, and they are difficult to navigate through so in the end it is not very useful. Result section: “cells expressing the GFP-tagged protein (Figure 1)”. These cells are not shown on the figure and which GFP-tagged protein is it?
