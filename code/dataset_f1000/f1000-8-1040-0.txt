The study identifies a potential EBOV VP24 inhibitor via pharmacophore-based virtual screening. Selected compounds were also assessed for safety properties using numerous in silico methods. The work is clearly and accurately presented but it doesn't cite current literature. Only 3 literature sources were cited from 2018, and 0 citations from 2019. The study design is partly appropriate and partly technically sound. This study is missing binding free energies extracted from molecular dynamics simulations of the reported systems. The reported docking results are generated from static crystal structures which is not a sound reflection of a biological system. The docking results must be correlated to the binding free energies from molecular dynamics simulations, which serve as a core validation of the docking results presented. The conclusions drawn are not adequately supported by the presented results since the point raised above in 2 has not been fulfilled.
