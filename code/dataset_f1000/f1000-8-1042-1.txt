The first IgY-based lateral flow immunoassay of fumonisin B is presented. The earlier known techniques were based on the IgG use. At whole, the study is well-described and contains all necessary stages of the assay optimization, characterization and validation. However, the necessity of new test is not clear from the manuscript. The common advantages of IgY are widely known, but were not demonstrated for the proposed test system. To clarify this question, the data about reached advantages (lower reactants consumption, higher stability, etc.) of the proposed test in comparison with the known IgG-based test strips for fumonisin B should be added with their experimental / quantitative confirmation.
