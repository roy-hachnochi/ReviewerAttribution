The present manuscript submitted by Tien et al. is a very interesting study in current food contaminants aspect. However, my main criticism goes to the detection limits of assay and the target selection in the study. As Fumonisins are a group of toxins, out of which fumonisin was target in the present study was not clear, for example among the fumonisin FB1 is more potent and frequently reported one in may kind of food grains mostly in wheat and maize and the cross reactivity patterns with group of Fusarium toxins need to be studied for example DON, T-2 toxin, Nivalenol etc. Introduction part is too vague, need to be improved with recent and relevant references. Preparation of IgY-conjugated gold nano particles is not clear, it's totally confusing, authors should clear draft the protocol in a supplementary section or main text. Ethical committee guidelines and permission to carry out the study need be given the manuscript. Selection of nitrocellulose membrane: its very crucial in developing the LFA assay, in the present study sufficient information was not presented by the authors in this section. please be give the clear protocol how its been chosen. OD 4000ug/kg is very high, many studies reported that the LD is under nano gram levels, this need to be further improved for their sensitivity. Over study looks good and can be indexed in this journal after substantial revision of the manuscript.
