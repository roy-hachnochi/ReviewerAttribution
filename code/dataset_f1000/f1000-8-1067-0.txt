 Cut-off for signal to noise ratio - The underlying data reports several lipids with a very low peak area response (For example PI 32:0 reports a value in the untreated group as 78). I am concerned that some of their lipid identifications have been falsely identified. Does metaboanalyst have a threshold for considering ‘real’ peaks compared to noise? Accounting for additional internal standards in the underlying data – The authors have clarified in the discussion the use of cholesterol d7 to normalise their results. However, the underlying data presents several other internal standards as being present (for example LPC 19:0, PI 38:4, SM 30:1, TG 17:0/17:0/17:0) We’re these internals standards also present, and if so why weren’t they used to normalise their respective lipid classes, and if not have they simply been falsely identified? Statistical analysis - As there was no direct response to my initial query I am still unsure of the rationale behind Bonferroni over FDR/Benjamini-Hochberg. To the best of my knowledge, both are options for correcting P-values using metaboanalyst with FDR . Although not affecting the fold changes observed, FDR has more power and would help clarify the more statistically significant changes.
