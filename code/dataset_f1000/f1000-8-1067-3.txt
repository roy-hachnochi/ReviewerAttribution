Following up my questions in the previous review: Q1 and Q2: I fully understand the in vitro model of H2O2-induced oxidative stress as well as the related cell biology assays. If the Fig 1A and 1B are combined together, readers can see the trend upon treatments, while also comparing the information under the -/+ H2O2 conditions. Q3: I mean +LSF-H2O2 vs -LSF+H2O2, they caused similar changes in the levels of C18:1 and C20:3, according to the Underlying Data. Why did these two treatments resulted in opposite biological outcomes, if C18:1 and C20:3 are key regulators? Q4: Based on your results, another 19 types of PEs are more abundant than 34:0 by the analyses of Prism. I quite understand that PE34:0 is not the LEAST abundant, as many others like 34:3 are even lower. In my analyses, the total PE level was significantly reduced in LSF20+H2O2, as compared with -LSF+H2O2 or LSF5+H2O2. This might be more related to your discussion on A2E production.
