 Ali and collaborators describe a case of a possible association between opioid withdrawal and seizure-like activity. As stated by the authors, there are only a few cases reported in the literature that associate opioid use and this type of complication. The case history and progression has been described in detail. However, there are some points that need to be addressed. Surgical history could be summarized in a way that readers have the idea of an extensive orthopedic surgery history without providing specific details about those procedures, such as the year when they were performed. It is stated by the authors that the pain management team initiated the oral opioid treatment after the discontinuation of intrathecal pump. It would be helpful to know if the team made the switch based on opioid conversion tables to provide the patient with equianalgesic doses. Additionally, it will be helpful to know if a urine drug screen was performed upon admission to rule out illegal substance use that could potentially cause seizures. The discussion section needs to be extended. The authors state there is a lack of literature regarding the association between opioid withdrawal and seizure-like activity. However, there have been some articles proposing a potential mechanism for which seizures may occur in those cases (Khanra et al. , 2015 1 ). Also, the authors stated that in their case the seizure may have been caused by severe pain and inadequate doses of analgesics. However, when making conclusions they state that the case illustrates a possible connection between opioid withdrawal and seizure, which creates a contradiction. It is advised that the authors review the cited article on this report regarding potential mechanism of seizure-like activity in chronic opioid use. Lastly, the manuscript needs to be revised for grammar and semantics. Kindly revise the above observations.
