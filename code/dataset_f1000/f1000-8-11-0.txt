This is a fascinating research question and the methods set out in this protocol seem appropriate. I am satisfied that the authors have set out the protocol in accordance with the PRISMA-P checklist. I have outlined a few points below: I think the decision to reject studies which deliver therapies outside a 6 hour window warrants some additional background information. This may well be an appropriate decision; however, I don't have expertise in stroke and so it leads me to question if there is the possibility that the combination therapies could lead to greater efficacy/less harm outside this time period. In table 2, will the authors state what "other" is for species and type of model? This seems like useful information. Table 2 part b, should it state "N Initially Reported"? Is "potential bias due to sample size calculation" actually related to imprecision rather than risk of bias? Dichotomous cut offs might lose valuable information e.g. infarct 40% is within reasonable limits vs 40% is not. Is 39% vs 41% really that different?
