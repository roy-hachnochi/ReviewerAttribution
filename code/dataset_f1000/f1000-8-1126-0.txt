 Following remarks are to be considered. A.Test formulation Triphala formulation (TF) (Emami Ltd; batch no. EM0029; Proportion of 3 constituent plant species: 1:1:1) was purchased from a local market. For assay purpose, 150 mg of this formulation was suspended in 5 ml of DMSO (Merck, Mumbai), followed by vortexing for 15 min. Then it was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 30 min at ambient temperature, and resulting supernatant was collected in a sterile glass vial (15 ml; Borosil) and stored under refrigeration till further use. Remaining pellet was subjected to drying in an oven at 70-80C until the solvent was completely evaporated, followed by weighing of the dried plant material. Subtracting the latter from the initial weight of 150 mg, the concentration of test formulation in supernatant was calculated to be 22.94 mg/ml. This way the whole formulation was found to contain 70% DMSO soluble fraction, which was used for our experiments. Remark DMSO is having some effect on at least some microorganisms. What concentration of DMSO was used? Please add report / reference of non – germicidal effect of DMSO at the concentration used in your experiment.

Some portions are appeared unclear. Please modify the sentences: Page 2, Column 2 Paragraph 4. Prophylactic assay (Patel et al ., 2018b): …..These worms were then fed with TF by mixing required concentration of this formulation (100 μL) with M9 medium (800 μL) and placed in a 24-well plate (non-treated polystyrene plates…. Remark: Is it the DMSO –TRIFALA mixed supernatant? Page 4 Column 1 Paragraph 4. …..at par with that of control (DMSO treated parent culture). – Remark: Point is not clear. Overall Comment: The research work is very good. The writing style is also good. After the mentioned modifications, the article may be accepted.
