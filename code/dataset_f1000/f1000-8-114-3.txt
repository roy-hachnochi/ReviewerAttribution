This paper describes the effectiveness of DrinkLess, a mobile alcohol intervention, using Bayes factor to further compliment previously published findings. I have one major comment and several minor comments. Major Comment: The work extends our understanding of DrinkLess and its effectiveness in managing alcohol misuse; however, it would be helpful to make a clear statement on how the Bayes analysis has improved the value proposition of DrinkLess. Minor Comments: Abstract: “Amongst responders only” – is that the sample who took part in the follow-up questionnaire?; Abstract: “Unplanned comparison” appears to convey a negative connotation the authors could alter to “additional analyses”; Abstract: “four most promising” could be misleading as you only had five components but we also have to be mindful that the data was insensitive; Abstract: “reminded insensitive but tended” are you able to provide any BF for this statement?; Introduction: It would be helpful to provide some discussion (specific examples) on how Bayes have been used in other domains to provide more insight by means of additional data; Methods – Participants: “were interested in reducing their drinking” how was this measured? Were participants research aware, or were they targeted because they had previously stated an interest in reducing alcohol? Or could it be by downloading DrinkLess they were assumed to be interested in reducing their alcohol consumption?; Methods – Participants: Was a geolocation restriction placed on participants? How can you be sure that users were from the UK?; Methods – Intervention: What were the minor bug fixes, is a summary able to be provided as a supplement?; Results: Results present AUDIT-C score, however this is not discussed previously. Results: It would be helpful to have Table 2 represented as supplementary material for those who took part in follow-up; Results: It would be of interest to discuss further the difference in AUDIT and AUDIT-C score and the role the final two questions (risk taking etc) play; Discussion: “no additional resources were required” – is this the case, was the app provisioned for longer than anticipated?; Discussion: “our decision on which components to retain or remove” – a bit more discussion round this aspect would be helpful to the reader; Discussion: A 13.2% follow-up rate appears to be very low, do the authors have any reasons for this?;
