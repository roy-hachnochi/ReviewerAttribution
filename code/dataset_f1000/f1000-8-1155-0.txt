The proposed protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis on surgical treatments for post-radical prostatectomy incontinence is an important endeavour given the availability of surgical options beyond the artificial urinary sphincter. The authors appreciate the paucity of prospective studies to date, let alone randomized controlled trials on this topic. Thus, retrospective and observational studies are included in this review. The authors have a practical approach in defining cure (primary outcome) as “patients wearing no pads per day to a maximum of a safety pad or 1 pad per day". This definition is more clinically relevant and applicable to daily practice. Their proposed secondary outcomes capture the various endpoints typically used in studies related to incontinence, such as 24-hr pad weights and validated questionnaires. Other data items proposed for collection also encompasses important factors of interest such as baseline severity, BMI, age and history of pelvic radiation to name a few. With regards to the proposed data analysis component, the authors have anticipated the need for assessing studies with no control groups. They have outlined the risk of bias instrument that they will be using to assess this issue which was modified from validated instruments and reduced to 4 domains of interest (non-validated). However, I wonder if question #3 of the questionnaire “were outcome assessors blinded and independent to the intervention?” would be able to discern the risk of bias with the study as I anticipate a large proportion of which would the assessors would not be blinded. Choosing aspects of validated methods to ascertain bias does not guarantee accurate assessment of bias. I don't know if taking a portion of a bias tool and applying it invalidates the utility of the tool. I look forward to seeing the results of this undertaking given the potential impact it may have on patient care.
