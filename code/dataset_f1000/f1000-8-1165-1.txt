The protocol for the ENGAGES-Canada is well written and presented according to established guidelines. In brief, the protocol is constructed around the hypothesis that eliminating or reducing the incidence of burst suppression would decrease incident delirium. It may be beneficial to explicitly address whether the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass time, cardiopulmonary bypass temperature and total circulatory arrest would be addressed (in the context of burst suppression) in exploratory analyses. It is reasonable to make clear how anesthetic management during cardiopulmonary bypass is managed. Do all centers use inhaled anesthetic-drugs and will the EEG be used to manage drug cardiopulmonary bypass drug dosing versus performed empirically by the perfusionist. I missed whether/what anesthetic drugs are being collected intraoperatively for exploratory analyses (there is mention of anesthetic depth in the prespecified analysis - EEG?). Burst suppression may be a "non-modifiable readout" of deliriogenic brains. Nuanced exploratory analyses of anesthetic-drug/index values etc. may be helpful.
