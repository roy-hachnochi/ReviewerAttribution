Contreras-Puentes et al ., searched the database for the analogues of ginsenoside, and identified three compounds that strongly bound to BACE1 by structure simulation. The bindings of the compounds with BACE1 were compared with that of other known BACE1 inhibitors including verubecestat and donepezil, an acethylcholine transferase inhibitor with some inhibitory effect on BACE1 activity. BACE1 residues involved in the bindings and the forces mediating the bindings were characterized. The compounds identified in this paper can be tested for the effects on BACE1 functions, both in vitro and in vivo . While bindings of compounds with enzymes may result in a suppression of enzyme activities, an activating effect cannot be ruled out. If the compounds do inhibit beta-cleavage of APP by BACE1, their applications in AD prevention and therapy could be explored. A recent clinical trial showed that verubecestat, a potent BACE1 inhibitor, failed to correct AD symptoms. BACE1 is required for a number of neuronal activities, and the inhibition of BACE1 may cause severe side effects. In such a context, compounds specifically targeting beta-cleavage of APP by BACE1 without affecting other BACE1 functions are desired, and these compounds could be useful for AD prevention. Hence, the compounds identified in this paper could also be tested for specificity. It would be more informative if the authors could analyse the bindings of these compounds with BACE2 that is a close homolog of BACE1, and involved in APP processing and neuronal apoptosis. To our knowledge, all known BACE1 inhibitors also inhibit BACE2, despite of their higher preference for BACE1. 7.5kcal/mol was set as the energy threshold for compound screening. It would be better to justify this threshold.
