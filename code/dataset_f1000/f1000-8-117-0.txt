This article expands in substantial detail on a previously published method of myelinating cultures generated from murine spinal cord. The authors clearly demonstrate that establishing the cultures on MEA chips facilitates the monitoring of electrophysiological properties of the system. They show clearly the manipulation of gene expression in the culture using siRNA and also the ability to study developmental and pathological processes, such as innate immune responses, using imaging. They also demonstrate the use of multi-well plates facilitating drug screening. The article thus describes an excellent straightforward method to complement, and in some instances replace, experiments in live animals. The method will be very useful for screening reagents with the potential to influence myelination or remyelination. It therefore provides a timely and important contribution to the experimental toolbox of myelin researchers. Are a suitable application and appropriate end-users identified? Yes If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? Yes Are the 3Rs implications of the work described accurately? Yes
