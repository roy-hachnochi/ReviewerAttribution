This is a case report of an elderly patient with a diagnosis of a metastatic adenocarcinoma in an inguinal hernia sac. The case report has outlined the clinical history along with preoperative investigations in in detail. The discussion of the article clearly describes importance of history and the relevance of diagnostic biopsy. In the biopsy however, there is no mention of the immunohistochemistry markers performed (CK7,CDX2,VILLIN, CALRETININ etc). Also when small whitish nodules were seen on parietal peritoneum and omentum, a differential diagnosis of mesothelioma does arise. There is no mention of the differentials considered in the biopsy in this case which was reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma. This is of utmost importance as all the subsequent biopsies were negative. It would be nice to have more detailed hisopathological findings along with necessary histological pictures. The article is brief and written well, however grammatical errors need to be corrected and submission of pictographs would further enhance the scientific evidence.
