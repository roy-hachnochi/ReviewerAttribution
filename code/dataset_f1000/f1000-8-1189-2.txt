The report is extremely well written and of high quality; crucially important that "negative results" are still published. In the abstract please clarify that the n=102 is 102 pairs - it a bit ambiguous. it would have been nice to genotype the animals on some for of SNP chip to determine the breed composition (you allude to not knowing) and also the pedigree structure (may influence your analysis). Other than for breeding purposes (end of the introduction) the results of such an approach can be used for personalised management (including purchasing). please re-write the 7th line of the second paragraph in the M i can't understand what is being said - maybe there is a missing word or two
