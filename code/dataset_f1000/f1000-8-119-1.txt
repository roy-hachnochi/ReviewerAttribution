The manuscript entitled “Synthesis of adsorbent from food industry waste for purification of used cooking oil” demonstrates the application of activated carbon prepared from banana peels in improving the quality of used cooking oil. Although the experiment was reasonably designed and executed, there are some significant points that need to be improved. I thus recommend major revision on these following points before accepting for indexing: Abstract: Line 8: Quantitative description of “slightly improve” should be given. Methods: In general this part has a lack of statistical analysis. Means and standard deviations of triplicate samples should be reported and analyzed for the statistical difference. It would be more concrete if characterization of the BPAC is conducted such as bilk density, porosity and microscopic analysis for microstructure and compared with commercial activated carbon. Discussion of results should also be included. The quality of UOC after being treated with BPAC should be compared to the standard for cooking oil. Research sample: What type of oils were collected (palm, coconut, etc.)? Which processing/cooking method were these UCO samples subjected to? Oil quality testing: Why was only the UCO sample treated with BPAC sample prepared at 600C for 3 hours tested for colour? What about the colour of other treated UCO samples? Results and discussion: Table 1: The distribution of score should be presented. Figure 1: Data should be presented in the form of a Table. Saponification number: This measurement does not appear in the Methods part.
