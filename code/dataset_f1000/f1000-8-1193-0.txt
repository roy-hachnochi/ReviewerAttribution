This is a very short and well written paper. But the paper would have benefited from further substantiation by relating the concept of moral injury to the concepts of moral failure, moral residue and moral distress. Here are some references the authors are advised to consult: Lisa Tessman, Moral distress in health care: when is it fitting? Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy (2020) 23:165–177 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11019-020-09942-7. 1 Boudreau, Tyler. 2011. The morally injured. The Massachusetts Review 52(3/4): 746–754. 2 Campbell, Stephen, Connie Ulrich, and Christine Grady. 2016. A broader understanding of moral distress. The American Journal of Bioethics 16(12): 2–9. 3 Tessman, Lisa. 2015. Moral failure: On the impossible demands of morality. New York: Oxford University Press. 4 Williams, Bernard. 1973. Ethical consistency. In Problems of the self, ed. B. Williams, 166–186. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 5 In addition, I advice the authors to consult the literature on adverse events in health care that are impossible to predict or prevent and which may cause moral distress, burnout and moral injury. That is, the fact that less than 50% of all adverse events in health care are possible to predict and prevent (of which a significant minority causes permanent disability, 7%, or death, 7%), is a painful reminder of the prevalence of unavoidable normative ignorance in health care and the importance of learning to live through moral failure caused by such events. For this, see e.g: Rafter, N., Hickey, A., Condell, S. et al. (2015). Adverse events in health care: learning from mistakes. QJM: An International Journal of Medicine, 108, 4: 273–277, and De Vries, E.N., Ramrattan, M.A., Smorenburg, S.M. et al. (2008). The incidence and nature of in- hospital adverse events: a systematic review. Qual Saf Health Care,17: 216-223. 6 Finally, the authors are advised to focus more on the problem of moral failure and injury among health care workers. In the present version of the paper the main focus is on the patient's experience of moral injury.
