This is an interesting, single-center small case series of the Karius test performance in 10 immunocompromised patients. Agreement with standard microbiological methods was 70% (7 of 10), but with only one "false negative" case of Aspergillus abscess while on treatment. I agree with the authors this is a promising assay that we have all been using in TOID, and as such support its clinical utility, but a scientific manuscript should stick to standardized methodology and report the results unbiased to contribute to our knowledge and set the ground for future studies. As such: The authors need to provide more details about the study design. It seems to be a prospective study, but inclusion criteria are not clearly defined. The au mention "availability of kits". Was this a prospective study funded by the sponsor? Were they consecutive pts? More specifically, it seems strange they would enroll a patient who had been on antifungals for so long. Were the tests ordered as part of routine clinical care? The study design needs clarification. Instead of reporting 100% sensitivity "among the patients with HM and confirmed infections", I would prefer to (also) see the "overall agreement" of 70% with standard micro methods. There is limited data on Karius performance for invasive mold infections, and the authors should acknowledge that, referring to additional studies, specifically DMID 2018;92:210 1 (7 of 9 pts correctly identified), Pediatr Blood Cancer 2018;66:e27734 2 (4 of 6 pts correctly identified).
