This article describes methodologies used to construct datasets on sequence submissions and co-authorship relationships relating to genomic sequencing of three major organisms. The methodology is clearly described, as are its limitations and prospects for use by other scholars. I particularly appreciated the careful reflections on strengths and weaknesses of the approaches taken, and agree that these approaches have clear prospects for enriching our historical/sociological accounts given tendencies to focus on the strongest (or loudest!) research centres to the neglect of other participants particularly in genomic sequencing efforts. Would strongly suggest citing Leonelli's book 1 on data curation (in addition to Lupton's more general work on this topic) as it addresses many of the relevant issues raised in the limitations relating to curation and completeness of data specifically in the context of modern biology.
