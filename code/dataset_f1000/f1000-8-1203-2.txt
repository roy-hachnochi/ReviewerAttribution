This article is aimed at comparing the postoperative pain following single or two-visit endodontic treatment of necrotic teeth with apical periodontitis. The subject has been previously investigated when calcium hydroxide was used as the intracanal medicament. The point of this article is using triple antibiotic paste as the inter-appointment medicament. The authors have shown that there is no difference between two groups of patients regarding post-operative pain. Although the subject is interesting, there are a few issues that need to be clarified: The introduction is very short. I believe the authors should explain more about the post-operative pain following endodontic treatment, its mechanisms and incidence. Moreover they also should explain why and how triple antibiotic paste might be effective in reducing the post-operative pain. In this study, only necrotic teeth with periapical lesions were included. These teeth are prone to flare up (a combination of pain and swelling). I am interested to know why the authors evaluated only pain and not swelling. Normally in this kind of study only teeth with a single canal are included. However, in the methods part of this article, it is not clear what types of teeth were selected; single-rooted or multiple-rooted or both types?
