In this revised version of the manuscript we are satisfied that the authors have made improvements where these were possible. In particular data regarding the specificity of GBM changes found by EM for identifying familial FSGS (4/5 families with a proven COL4A variant and FSGS had GBM thinning). We accept that sensitivity of EM abnormalities is difficult to ascertain. It is unfortunate that the patients with GBM abnormalities identified in the present study have been lost to follow up. However, we thank the authors for making efforts to retrieve clinical information, which may have strengthened the argument that the patients did harbour a COL4A variant. The multi-modality approach to identifying patients with an underlying genetic cause for FSGS is more clearly emphasised. We agree with the workflow shown in Figure 2 that if GBM structural abnormalities are identified by EM in cases of sporadic FSGS, patients should be thoroughly investigated for a underlying genetic cause by NGS. This may also be relevant in familial cases where GBM abnormalities are identified by electron microscopy. The title of the article now more accurately reflects the data provided. We are happy to approve this article without further revisions.
