This retrospective study focuses on the fact that renal biopsies are not always evaluated by electron microscopy (EM). The authors found 43 renal biopsies in the records of two hospitals, where the diagnosis of FSGS was made, for which EM had been performed only in 30. Most importantly, in two of the biopsies studied by EM, there was evidence for a collagen IV disorder but had not been followed up. This has important implications in view of numerous reports in the past decade and more, according to which the histological diagnosis of FSGS could be on the background of collagen IV mutations, which cause Alport syndrome or thin basement membrane nephropathy. I agree with all points raised by the previous reviewer and which I do not intend to repeat here. I would only emphasize two things: I believe there should be no renal biopsy attempted if it is not going to be studied fully by light microscopy, immunofluorescence studies and EM. It is an invasive procedure accompanied by some risk and when performed it must be fully exploited as very significant results may come up, which bear implications on treatment, inheritance patterns and family planning. The authors found two patients who had undergone EM and there were findings indicative of a collagen IV disorder. They should have proceeded to genetic testing to verify this and strengthen their case. Even belatedly, this could be of benefit not only to the patients but also to family members.
