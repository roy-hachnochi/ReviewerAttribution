This article validated several commercial antibodies against Nicastrin protein which is one of the gamma-secretase complex. Authors used different cell types and organisms to validate antibodies for the specificity and sensitivity. As other reviewers pointed out, this article has less interesting since other papers already showed the specificity of several antibodies in human or mouse cell line or tissues. Furthermore, postmodification mechanism of Nicastrin by glycosylation was also well established. Despite less novelty, this article would be helpful for the community who have a plan to perform a Western analysis on HEK293 cell line which is major experimental condition of this paper.
