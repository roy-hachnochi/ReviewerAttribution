(JTOF) The authors present a hybrid case report of CGCG, with juvenile trabecular ossifying fibroma. The authors should mention the soft ware used to do the surgical planning (Figure 1), was it a CBCT? It is recommended that the authors provide a high power representative of the heavily cellular stroma and pseudoaneurysmal spaces, characteristic of the Juvenile trabecular ossifying fibroma (JTOF). Add reference to support the triamcinolone acetonide injection. In the discussion the authors need to reflect more on the differential diagnoses, that the bone deposition may be part of a reparative granuloma histologically, yet the rapid clinical expansion speaks against a reparative process. That JTOF can be associated with MNGCs, yet the incisional biopsy had enough evidence of a CGCG component to support a hybrid lesion.
