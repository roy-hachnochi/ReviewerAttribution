The authors have revealed some important brain regions active for schizophrenia patients in addition to some other reported regions in previous studies. This will give some clinical advantages in this certain brain disease. However, this whole study is based on the dysfunction of working memory, and a portion of fMRI data set. The authors did not emphasized enough on the selection criteria of elimination of certain region of the same data set. Furthermore, are the authors thinking not to generalize their finding of “some functional changes in the brain regions, such as Heschl gyrus and the vermian area” at this point (in this work) due to the sample size they are taking into account?
