Unfortunately the manuscript and the study have serious flaws. The most important flaw is the lack of recognition of infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer specimens. These lymphocytes can be Epstein Barr positive and give false positive outcomes of PCR based studies. This issue has long been recognised by others and is repeatedly referred to in the literature This problem can be overcome in several ways as published. In addition the results of the controls are not reported properly? See Table 2. This table does not make sense. This problem has been commented by a previous reviewer. I am sorry but this project is not of sufficient quality to deserve indexing.
