 In the Abstract: Method: the age of the control group is far younger compared to patients (37 vs 50). Result section - control group - only the histological type is provided. It should show the virus presence in tissue of patients with breast cancer compared to control without cancer - that does not make sense. In the Methods: how are the tissues fixed and embedded in blocks and how long? Results: Table 1 - describe only patients - why not control as well? Table 2: does not make sense and is not clear. In results sections: last paragraph state that "In the control group, EBV was detected in 101/115 (87.8%) and only 14/115 (12.2%) tested negative for the presence of the virus" that means the virus is present in the majority of control samples - which render the conclusion wrong. Fig 1 is not necessary unless control samples are included as well. Discussion : the author should discuss their results and not cite the literature (this was done in the introduction) - they should discuss what their results mean and what was the importance of looking at the stage, age and virus presence.
