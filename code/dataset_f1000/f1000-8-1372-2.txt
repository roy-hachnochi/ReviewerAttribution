As I scanned this manuscript (ms), I thought the introduction rather long. On reading it, however, I was impressed how well it laid out the field succinctly, identified some of what was missing, how this report would eliminate one deficiency, and then what was found. Well done, indeed. The design is more than appropriate with the technically-sound assessment of multiple drugs and multiple passive permeability markers The methods and analysis are presented in sufficient detail for others to attempt replication. I was at first frustrated that I could not find the number of animals identified in the text. Then I found Tables 1 and 2, which, on consideration, seemed eminently reasonable given the numbers that were appropriately listed for each age group for each assessment. The authors used Tables 3 and 4 to identify materials used. Yes, the authors provided all the information needed. The 4 data tables (#s 5, 6, 7, and 8) and the 7 figures present all the data needed very well. The authors clearly document changes to support their conclusion that the functional capacities of efflux transporters at the barriers are developmentally regulated. I did NOT think that any revisions are called for.
