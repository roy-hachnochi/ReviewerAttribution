The subject of this review is interesting and relevant to clinical practice. The review is well written. I have some comments: The literature search was until September 2018. Why is an update missing? Complications and side effects of the MMC injections were not mentioned. There was no clear definition of recurrence of the stricture. As this is a major subject of dispute in urethral surgery, this issue should be addressed, at least in the discussion. The length of the stricture was not mentioned. Were these all primary strictures? Should be addressed. The first publication was in 2007. Yet, MMC injection is not implemented in clinical practice for prevention of urethral stricture. It should be discussed why this is the case.
