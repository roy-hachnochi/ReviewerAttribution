With respect to the two previous reviews I will refrain from summarizing the article once more. Although the article addresses an important issue and the hypothesis of THC residues being responsible for some of the adverse effects of CBD preparations is plausible and supported by the data, I miss the discussion of two relevant points: No details are given regarding the extraction of the products. Was the 'total THC content' measured by heat-induced decarboxylation of THC acid A? That would be close to the procedure used by most forensic laboratories in Germany. The author's response to reviewer 2 (page 4, comments #3 and #8) suggests, however, that THC acid A was determined separately. If the 'total THC content' was given as the sum of THC and THC acid A after correction for the molecular weight the dose would be overestimated (maximum conversion rates of smoked, 'vaped' or baked cannabis were usually reported to be below 70%). The available THC doses after oral ingestion without heating the material would be even lower (depending on the THC acid A content). Regarding the THC dose required to produce psychotropic effects the authors did not discuss the 'inverse agonist' like properties of CBD at the CB1 receptor (McPartland et al. , 2015 1 ) which have been shown to reduce the intoxicating effects of THC (e.g. Solowij et al. , 2019 2 ). This might affect the LOAEL and the ARfD of THC when contained in CBD rich products as these values were not yet assessed for such cannabinoid preparations. Page 8: The German guidance value seems to be several orders of magnitude (up to 4) lower than the CBD contents in the products.
