Informational spectrum method (ISM) was used for analyzing the HA sequences of the influenza A/H1N1 viruses. The ISM is a virtual spectroscopy method for the study of the long-range protein-protein interaction. 252 human pH1N1 viruses collected in US and Canada from October to November 2018 were compared with 33197 H1N1 pdm09 viruses of 2009-2017 years and with vaccine virus A/Michigan/45/2015 for 2018/2019 flu season. Based on this analysis, it was concluded that: 45% of analyzed viruses of 2018 are co-cauterized with the vaccine virus A/Michigan/45/2015 for 2018/2019 flu season suggesting that this vaccine can at least efficiently protect against this fraction of circulated viruses. It has been also suggested that these viruses carry previously identified pandemic markers (namely substitution in positions 94, 196 and 274 in HA1 suggesting their increased pandemic potential. The authors declare that the acquisition of these mutations in HA1 are essential for adaptation of swine A/H1N1 viruses to humans, by virtue of the interaction with human protein(s)/receptor(s). The main question that can be presented to the authors is the advantage of the Informational spectrum method in comparison with the generally accepted analysis of genomic sequences. The subdivision of circulating viruses into subpopulations is detected by building evolutionary trees. To predict the effectiveness of the vaccine, you can compare the sequence of circulating viruses with the sequence of the vaccine strain in the field of antigenic determinants. Identification of mutations that are markers of pandemic viruses is more reliably carried out by direct analysis of sequences, than by changing the averaged characteristics. Moreover, the statement that positions 94, 196 and 274 are pandemic markers is based only on the previous work of the authors of this article, and was not confirmed by other researchers. Even more doubtful is the claim that the positions 94, 196 and 274 are responsible for the interaction with the human receptor. The problem of the interaction of influenza viruses with the host receptors has been well studied. Are known the amino acids that are located in the receptor-binding site of HA and form hydrogen bonds with specific atoms of the receptor molecule. The authors do not quote these works, and do not seem to know them.
