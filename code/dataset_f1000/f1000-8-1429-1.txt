The manuscript now shows considerable improvements and is, in my view, almost ready for indexing. Just very few minor points: Why is “tamsang” written in bold both in the abstract and the intro? The table text of Table 1 could be more self-explanatory than only “Demographic data”. In table 1 I am also still a bit unsure as to the meaning of the p-values. For such background data I would not do any significance testing at all, but also understand if the author wants to include it. But, for most variables like gender, age and so on, there is a p-value given as an overall assessment, while for education the p-value is given for the category “no school”. For table 2 it is still not clear to me for what differences the p-value is given. In the text it says that it is for the differences between Tamsang and Papaya Salad, and that should also be made clear in the footnotes in the table. I still think that the first sentence of the conclusion should be omitted since that is not what the results show if Thai restaurant means all four types of restaurants studied. After having reviewed the first version of the manuscript, I felt left with a question of what is so special with the tamsang restaurants, and am no pleased to find the explanation in the second last para of the introduction.
