I think this is an excellent review written on the topic Zika virus and adverse fetal outcome and neurological complication (Guillain Barre Syndrome). The studies interpretation in terms of statistical significance is outstanding. The pathogenesis of these complications are not mentioned. How GBS develops after Zika infection? Whether immune mediated or virus has direct affinity for nervous system? What precautions to be taken at community level to curb the menace of Zika virus infection?
