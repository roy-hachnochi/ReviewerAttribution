For novel vaccines (e.g., Ebola vaccines), WTP was often considered as a major factor of vaccine policy and innovation 1 , 2 . Several studies have examined WTP for an Ebola vaccine in Ebola-affected countries (e.g., West Africa 3 , 4 , 5 and America 6 . This study in Indonesia helped to supplement and enrich WTP for an Ebola vaccine in non-Ebola- affected countries. However, there are several significant omissions in study design from this manuscript. Although this study aimed to investigate community WTP for Ebola vaccine in Indonesia, the selection of respondents (patients’ family members who visited outpatient departments) caused selection bias. This study was conducted in Aceh province, Indonesia. Aceh comprises predominantly rural areas 7 , which might result in the skewed distribution of participants’ characteristics, including Education (Senior high school: 47.2%), Occupation (Farmer: 26.7%) and (Suburb: 85.8%). As a result, some conclusions that high educational attainment, working as a private employee, entrepreneur or civil servant (compared to farmers) and residing in a suburb (compared to a city) were associated with higher WTP could not exclude the influence of these skewness distributions. The authors stated that, “Prior to assessing their WTP, participants were provided with an introduction to the Ebola disease including the symptoms and modes of transmission.” Although there were no Ebola cases reported in Indonesia, some respondents were still likely to learn about Ebola and Ebola vaccines in a variety of ways, such as the Internet or newspapers. In addition, knowledge of vaccines had proven to be one of the crucial variables affecting WTP 7 . Therefore, this intervention would bias the outcome of WTP, which did not reflect the real WTP of respondents.
