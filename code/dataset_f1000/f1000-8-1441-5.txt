Thank you for inviting me to reviewing the paper “Willingness-to-pay for a hypothetical Ebola vaccine in Indonesia: A cross-sectional study in Ace”. This is an important and well written paper with sound methodology. I have the following recommendations to improve this paper. Under discussion, the authors stated that, “However, we found no relationship between knowledge and WTP. It is interesting to discuss why knowledge on Ebola was not significantly associated with WTP in this present study, but higher education was.” The authors should state that knowledge on an infectious disease provided health professional was found to be associated with WTP. Please add the following statement: …. but higher education was. It could due to the observation that only knowledge on an infectious disease provided health professional was found to be associated with WTP for vaccine. 1 Under limitation, the authors should state that this study did not explore on the effect of insurance on WTP. Please add the following statement under limitation: ….. some questions given included in WTP section. This study did not explore the effect of health insurance on WTP as previous study found that having health insurance were associated with WTP for vaccine. 2
