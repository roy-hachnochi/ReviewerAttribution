This manuscript reports a protocol for a randomised clinical trial to evaluate the best pharmacological management of agitated patients in psychiatric emergency rooms in Lebanon. It follows a previous version of this protocol, published in 2002, for studies conducted in Brazil and India, assessing the use of the prevalent intervention in both countries, a combination of haloperidol and promethazine. The Lebanon study will compare this intervention with their local practice: a combination of haloperidol, promethazine and chlorpromazine. The similarities with the original protocol are many. The pragmatic design, the blinding up to the point of randomisation just to ensure concealment of allocation, the type of participants, the doses of medication at the discretion of the doctor, the main and secondary outcomes, and the analysis of data. The main differences are in the randomisation process: it is stratified by ward and delivered in sealed envelopes instead of sealed boxes containing the treatment. Although the trial intends to recruit only 90 participants, the results of this study could be added to the body of evidence in systematic reviews. I have only some minor comments: The authors state they will perform an intention-to-treat analysis, but they also declare that if ineligible people enter the trial, they will not be counted and their notes will be disregarded. Isn’t it a contradiction? The authors state that in the event that some syringe or vial containing medication is broken, another envelope should not be opened. It doesnt make much sense. The authors state that guidelines are “often based on the same limited evidence”. This is currently not accurate and the references used (1998, 2001 and 2004) are outdated.
