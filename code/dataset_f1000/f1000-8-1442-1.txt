The authors submit the protocol of the clinical trial comparing to combinations of antipsychotics for emergency patients which need a rapid intervention. The protocol is a very detailed and explains every important step of the study. The team around the study, in particular the author Prof Clive Adams, has a lot of experience in this type of study. He has helped to contact and published several trials of this kind in the past. The current trial will fill another bit of the puzzle about the best intervention for acutely ill mentally ill patients who need rapid treatment. As the interventions are frequently used in the trial centre so that the clinicians have a lot of experience with them, I do also not see an important risk going beyond routine care.
