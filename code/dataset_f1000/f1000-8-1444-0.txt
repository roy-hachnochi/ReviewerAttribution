Some concerns regarding the preparation of the extracts and the starting concentrations for the toxicity study. 'Doses (300 and 2000 mg/kg) of the extracts were administered orally'. What was the starting concentration of the extracts for the toxicity study/MIC? If the MIC was used, this part should move to after the preparation of the plant extracts for clearer understanding. 'QRFH and HEXRFH were dissolved in 3ml of sterile distilled water and virgin oil, respectively. Serial dilutions ranging from 3.125â€“400 mg/ml of the extracts were then prepared using sterile peptone water'. Why were these used as solvents? Manufacturers info missing: 'pulverized by use of a mechanical mill' (info). "They were fed on standard mice pellets from a commercial feed supplier (Unga Group Plc, Kenya) and water was provided ad libitum ." "Feeding mice on graded doses of the root extracts of F. hildebrandtii over a 28-day period had no significant effect on the feed and water consumption of mice in treatment groups relative to the control (Extended data: Table S615)". My concern regarding the above: what is the composition of the pellets the mice were fed on and could this not have an effect on the outcome of the toxicity studies? Could the pellets not influence toxic uptake? If not, this needs to be discussed.
