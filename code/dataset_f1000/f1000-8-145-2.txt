I hereby confirm my approval status of this article, while suggesting to fix the following language issues: Introduction: "performing these mapping" -- "performing these mappings". "provide only online service" -- "provide only online services". "all the idle CPUs" -- "all the idle CPU cores". (This is also to be more technically correct, as few computers these days have multiple CPUs, while most of them have CPUs with multiple cores).
