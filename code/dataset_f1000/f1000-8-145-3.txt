The revised article is now much improved, with a solid introduction explaining the problem area and previous research, use cases, and with the title amended to better reflect the functionality of the tool. I think it can now be approved, with the following minor suggestions for language fixes: Abstract web interface - a web interface Introduction P. 3: Biobtree address - Biobtree addresses Methods I think "disc" should be "disk" for hard drive disks. as key and values - as keys and values "... and values are attributes and mapped datasets information". This is a somewhat unclear sentence. I.e, does it mean "mapped datasets' information" (genitive), or "information about mapped datasets"? I suggest slightly clarifying it. Use cases "... third input is dataset to" - "... third input is a dataset to" "in different dataset" - "different datasets" or "a different dataset" "with same value" - "with the same value" Future work "In addition, following and experimenting with the advancements in large data processing techniques, databases and data structures fields to improve the tool further". This sentence seems incomplete. I.e, what is stated about this activity? Something that is planned to be done, or "could be done in general"?
