While it is important to create a consistent and queryable database of biological identifiers, it is unclear what advances this tool brings to the field. For example, how does this tool compare to other queryable database tools such as mygene.info, or BioMart? The paper will greatly benefit from a comparison to these and other such tools. I downloaded and ran the tool but it seems I can't get through the update phase when I run ./biobtree update (It seems to hang after uniprot_reviewed finishes) without any other messages. When I rerun using biobtree --d uniprot_reviewed update it finishes but there is an error: Error while reading file- .//out/index/0_13.938476000.gz panic: gzip: invalid header I tried running generate and web after that regardless, but couldn't get it to work: panic: mdb_txn_commit: MDB_BAD_TXN: Transaction must abort, has a child, or is invalid Error while reading meta information file which should be produced with generate command. Please make sure you did previous steps correctly. The author needs to debug/test their code to ensure that it can be used by others.
