Weber and Soneson have written a software article presenting HDCytoData (currently version 1.4.0), a Bioconductor package aimed at making multiple high-dimensional cytometry (HDC) datasets available in a consistent R friendly format as either SummarizedExperiment or flowSet objects. The authors have framed this as an aid for facilitating benchmarking studies and for use for examples or tutorials in future. HDCytoData provides links to these datasets through ExperimentHub and includes some helpful commands for downloading such data. Currently eight datasets are included in the package which are accessed with easy-to-use function calls in the workspace. With this in mind, I have some comments questions below that could improve the manuscript and useability of the HDCytoData package. This approach effectively duplicates the data from flowRepository and into the Bioconductor ExperimentHub ecosystem, is it more worthwhile to provide the functions to extract and process the data from the original flowRepository source? This manuscript could contain more motivation for hosting the processed data versus providing functions to download + process the data from flowRepository. Is it extensible to other additional characteristics? e.g. data arising from imaging mass cytometry with further measured features, or similar. The authors could discuss the breadth of experimental data types they imagine HDCytoData to encompass or accept from contributors. The authors should discuss the continued curation of the data within the HDCytoData package and mention how it behaves in case of changes or updates to the 'original' data in flowRepository. Describe further how one can contribute their dataset(s)? I'm confused as to the framing of this package as principally for benchmarking studies. Whilst it's an important aspect of understanding and improving methodology, users of this package may be more interested in a convenient and consistent way of loading the flow cytometry data altogether, especially so for some integrative analysis of multiple HDC datasets. It's unclear how large the data files are that are being downloaded into the local cache, ideally the user would want to know this information before going ahead and downloading it. It's not clear in this manuscript how one would remove the data once it's no longer needed, or how to clear the cache. It appears that it's assumed users are also fairly familiar with the ExperimentHub interface. The authors should make it more clear what level of experience they imagine package users should have, i.e. who are they aiming the software towards? It would be useful to have a bulk download to cache, or possibly a bulk load to workspace option for these datasets. Is there a functionality to switch from SummarizedExperiment object to flowSort format? If this exists in another package it should be pointed to. For the Bodenmiller data, I was surprised to find that the help file for Bodenmiller_BCR_XL_SE() says there are measurements for 24 proteins but the exprs assay has 35 columns, looking at the colData, features are classed into "type" and "state" with the remainder having a class of "none". Some of these columns do not appear to measure specifically protein abundance but rather cell-specific (as opposed to sample-specific) features, for instance "Cell_length". Have the authors anticipated this type of extra information and how it would fit into the SummarizedExperiment or flowSort object? The slot name "exprs" suggests that the data within this slot should be some molecular quantities, should these other features go into the rowData() slot instead? Or furthermore, whether ideally for downstream analysis (such as differential expression) these extra columns should be discarded? (Note these extra columns than what is listed in the function help descriptions appears for multiple datasets.) How do you ensure that there is enough information available here to be able to accurately normalise/standardise the data, especially so for flow cytometry data, given the particular combinations of fluorescent markers associated with the proteins, and potential overlap of the fluorescence for these markers?
