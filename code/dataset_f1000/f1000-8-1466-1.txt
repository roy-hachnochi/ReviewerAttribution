The manuscripts is quite interesting but need more improvement in some parts, as shown in the annotated manuscript , and with the comments below: Abstract: Methods should be more details, results and conclusion must be rewritten to meet the research aims. Introduction: Sufficient. Methods : More details about the food (Please see manuscript). There is a possibility of residual ethanol in the sample when the ethanol used to mix amaranth and feed. How can you conclude the results with this concern? Is there any information about proximate composition of artificial feed? Results Please add more information about the initial weight of crab?. Was it homogen statistically at the day 0? How many crab did author measure for growth per replication? It is stated in the methods that the growth results was analyzed using Anova and Duncan post hoc. However, there is no statistic information in the results. Thus it is quite difficult to determine the differences among the groups of doses. No need to put survival rate in the table (Table 4) because all survival 100%, Table 4 should be deleted. Please check some typos in the table. Ex: avarage change with average. Discussion The Discussion part can be much stronger to add why amaranth involves in decreasing or increasing growth performance Conclusion It is more likely only repeating the results. Please rewrite.
