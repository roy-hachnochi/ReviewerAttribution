The case report by Rahman and Gupta describing an 8-month-old female with spontaneous perforation of a congenital choledochal cyst (CC) demonstrates the ability to provide appropriate patient care despite a paucity of diagnostic options. These providers had only an abdominal ultrasound which demonstrated intra-abdominal fluid following spontaneous perforation of a CC. Surgical exploration revealed bile peritonitis and a local bile duct perforation treated with a T-tube decompression. Diagnosis as a CC was only made at subsequent cholangiography leading appropriately to cyst resection and choledochal-enteric biliary anastomosis. All this was done without access to MRI/MRCP, apparently a CT scan, or access to an onsite radiologist. As a gastroenterologist who has provided ERCP support to pediatric patients for 30 years, one who has been involved in the treatment of more than 100 adult patients with CC, and an individual who has been involved in education and training programs in the developing world for a comparable time period, I salute their diagnostic tenacity, appropriate treatment, and apparent outcomes. In areas in which more resources are available, it is unlikely that this patient would have been explored without a CT scan, and if a grossly dilated common bile duct had been defined, a subsequent MRCP to define the extent of the cyst as used the pancreaticobiliary junction to define the type and extent of surgical resection. Although the authors suggest that the patient is doing well after CC resection and hepaticoduodenostomy, there is no report of the follow-up times. A follow-up 2 weeks after surgery is much less important than a 1 year follow-up with normal liver enzymes and growth parameters. The follow-up interval needs to be defined.
