The report has very much improved and the authors have answered all my concerns in a reasonable way. Perhaps, I have a couple of minor points to outline regarding Experiment 2: a) I think that the rationale behind Experiment 2 can be reorganized a bit to understand better the motivation of the "cheating with task" condition. The explanation that you offer to one of my questions (Linguistic issue; point 3) is very clarifying and could be used as a guideline in this regard. In a similar vein, b) If I understand well, both, the "cheating" and "cheating with task" conditions will/should not differ with regard to the baseline. Please, make that point more explicit in the text as you did in your answer.
