I feel that the proposal has been substantially improved. The authors have satisfactorily addressed all the issues I had raised. However, I have some minor comments/suggestions on the revised manuscript, which I address below. Minor comments: Data analysis of the “cheating with task” condition in Experiment 2: If you are going to delete the data of participants who fail to give the right answer to the attention task, this information should be provided in the main text. The Japanese translation of the instructions in Experiment 1: The orders of the [嘘つきにならない/嘘をつかない] (don’t be a cheater/don’t cheat) and [“嘘つきにならないでください/嘘をつかないでください”]（”PLEASE DON’T [BE A CHEATER/CHEAT”）need to be reversed so that they would be consistent with the corresponding English descriptions. I agree with the comment by Dr. Sergio Cervera-Torres on the readability of the introduction. The storyline can be improved. The fourth paragraph of Experiment 2: “In our Experiment 2, we manipulated the way in which participants saw….” - “In our Experiment 2, we will manipulate the way in which participants see…”?
