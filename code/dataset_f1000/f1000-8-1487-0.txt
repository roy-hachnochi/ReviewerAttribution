The research proposes to demonstrate the antimicrobial effect of a natural extraction of plants, this is well known and the test models also, in that direction to work it requires more evidence or generate new contributions to change the models or use more robust ones for the tests, perhaps the systems of broths of cultures in 96-plate plates and evaluate the effect in vivo allow a result of greater impact, on the other hand the controls applied to the experiment such as water are not so blunt should the solvent with which the plant extract. On the application of more robust methods, I suggest applying the MIC-MBC (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), the methodology recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute), as well as the technique of viable microdrops. It is also suggested to construct microbial kinetic curves to have a more precise data of the effect of the dose vs the bacterial cell density in a certain time and can be contributed in the knowledge of microbial physiology since under these conditions the extract could also have another form of action closer to the real one (within the host) that provides an approach to results that allow a future biomedical application of the plant extract. Researchers should improve the conclusion since their writing only reports one result, they should be able to generate new knowledge based on the analysis and discussion of the results that will allow a substantive contribution to the execution of the proposed research.
