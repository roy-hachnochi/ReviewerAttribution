The authors describe a software package aimed at construction, storage, and manipulation of sequence graphs. The software is publicly available on Github. While the core functionality is developed in C++, the package also provides Python wrapper library and a command-line tool. The authors outline the software design and provide pipelines and code examples for two different types of data. Overall, the paper is well-written and describes potentially useful software. At the same time, the paper lacks: Comparison of (features of) the developed software and existing software such as VG toolkit based on variation graphs (reference 5 1 ); Discussion of the software applicability (e.g., will it work on large or repeat-rich genomes?), or estimation of its running time/space complexity. Some minor comments: The use of bold font is not explained. For example, Datastores first appears in the sentence “ Datastores allow random access...” describing its features, but WHAT is Datastores? Orthogonal edge routing in Fig. 1 is somewhat confusing, why not make edges curved?
