For this first round of review, the first thing to do is to add the ERPs elicited by the cross from the time the baseline started to be computed up to the end of the ERPs elicited by the stimuli for all experimental conditions. The type of electrodes (which material?) and the characteristics of the amps and their band pass have to be included in the method section as well as the gain used. Then, the digital band pass used to process the EEG have to be added (with the details about the cut-offs). Given that the CNV is usually maximal at central or fronto-central electrode sites, data will first have to be re-referenced to one (or two linked) electrodes that are as far as possible from these sites, in order to boost CNV amplitudes and see details. This might also boost effect sizes and give simple statistical analyses a chance to find CNV differences. These ERPs should be in a figure including a sufficient number of channels (e.g, 20) to give a general idea of the scalp distribution of every component. This will allow for a comparison of the CNV activity found with those found in prior CNV studies. In this reprocessing, bad channels should not be removed and reconstructed. Given the extremely high scientific stakes of this study, a simple and FULLY reproducible technique should be used as a strat (even ICA is not fully replicable, its results vary a bit). Any fancy technic should be removed first so that readers can have an idea of the ERPs and CNV obtained. To do the reprocessing, I suggest to focus on the 20 channels mentioned above. Each time one channel is bad in an EEG epoch: the whole trial should be suppressed. Please give the trial selection criteria (max voltage, flat line...). Then, please mention the average number of trials that had to be rejected for each experimental condition and the standard deviation across participants. I will be glad to review the study again and will provide new comments fast according to new results.
