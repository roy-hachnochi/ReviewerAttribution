This article presents a view on open access and the role of repositories from a Latin American perspective, focusing on open access not only as a way to make scientific and scholarly publications more accessible, but also as part of aiming for more reproducible research. It offers a discussion on goals of OA and reproducibility and places this in the context of institutional and government policies and practices, and the availability and usage of infrastructure in the context of Latin America, and Chili specifically. As such, it provides an important point of view. I especially commend the authors for including Spanish-language literature in addition to English-language references. I agree with the first reviewer the paper could benefit from a tighter structure, removing some duplicate paragraphs, and fixing some missing and duplicate references. Regarding structure, I would suggest to make the aims of open access and reproducibility (in the context of Latin America) central to the paper, introducing them at the start and placing the discussion on OA definitions, policies, available infrastructure and recommendations in that context. But this is just one suggestion, the structure suggested by the first reviewer is another one. The paper mentions the relevance of OA and reproducibility for both natural and social sciences, as well as humanities. Building on that and using the references already provided, some discussion on the differences between these main disciplines in how these topics are considered could be a useful addition to the paper. Beyond these main points, I have made a detailed annotation of the paper, including comments and suggestions (without the expectation they should all be met), as well as flagging some copy-editing issues using Hypothes.is.
