The article is mostly a survey (with a discussion) of the state of Open Access Policies in Latin America and in Chile. This is a relevant topic on which little systematic literature exists. Thus it is an important scientific contribution that deserves to be published. The material of the article is interesting, the authors have done a lot of work compiling sources and developing a map of the realm of Open Access in Latin America and in Chile. I only have formal observations, mainly regarding the organization of the paper that I will list below. A. I suggest to organize the material according to the three main topics treated (hopefully in this order) that currently are spread and mixed in different parts of the paper: Open Access Policies and notions (varieties of OA, reproducibililty, legal issues, etc.). (page 3, page 7, page 9) OA in Latin America (end of page 4, page 5, part of page 7, parts of page 9) OA in Chile (page 4, page 6, second column of page 8, page 9) B. I would develop a small taxonomy of OA policies and varieties and explain them. Not all readers are OA experts. If possible, explain relations among them, etc. Something like the description you did for Latin American OA initiatives. C: Revise repetitions throughout the paper. Example: In page 3: first paragraph of 1st column is repeated as fourth in second column last paragraph first column repeated in first three in second column D. The readers of the paper are not only Chileans. Hence, do not write "at national level" but "at Chilean level", etc. E. Check details of form: be consistent when enumerating (capital o not capital letters) there is a [?] reference in page 9 subtitles require to be more systematic I approve this paper under the condition that the authors follow the corrections indicated.
