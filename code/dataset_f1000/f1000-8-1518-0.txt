This is an innovative approach to reducing costs of offering HIV drug resistance testing in resource-limited settings. The authors have shown a thorough understanding of the literature in HIV drug resistance testing and implementation in resource-limited settings. They have related their findings to the majority of publications that presenting performance characteristics of in-house HIV drug resistance tests. It would be interesting for the authors to compare the performance of the ‘modified assay’ with the Viroseq assay as well. The authors followed the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for validating 'in-house' HIV drug resistance assays and clearly showed that the results of the modified assay were comparable to the commercial assay. Furthermore, the authors have demonstrated that these assay modifications resulted in a significant decrease in cost of implementation. I however wonder why the authors did not present results for reducing reaction volumes for the RT-PCR step. It is conceivable that they may have at least attempted and therefore should comment if the results did not meet the WHO criterion for assay validation.
