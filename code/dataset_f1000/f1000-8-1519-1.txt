The manuscript focuses upon two main issues which are single visit regeneration and photo activated disinfection. The title lacks the "the single visit concept". The title states "oral" disinfection, this would be better as "canal" disinfection. The introduction and discussion did not include the justification of the idea of single visit regeneration. The introduction and discussion did not include the possible effects of laser as heat generation and effects on stem cells. The manuscript did not state radiographic standardization during follow up. The discussion did not justify the supposed mechanism of root canal disinfection by laser (PAD).
