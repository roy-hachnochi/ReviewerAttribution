I agree with the authors that the assessment of spatial information processing in rodents with automatized tracking systems aids in the reliability of findings across studies and enhances efficiency in which one can make conclusions about specific manipulations. The current work, which would have been nice to include, would be more complete with: A direct comparison to commercially available software - e.g., HVS Image provides similar tracking information so in this case, how do these two tracking systems fair head to head? A group of mice with hippocampal lesions. For point 2, does the tracking software pick out well-established deficits in spatial behavior following hippocampal lesions and does the new software provide any additional information on the deficits in spatial navigation produced by hippocampal lesions. I wonder also if the additional measures provided by this software will give more insight into spatial learning deficits in models where deficits were not noted; that is to say, conventional tracking software or output measures might not revealed a deficit when a deficit was predicted. Would this new software provide more robust measures to indicate deficits? Further work is required to more fully test the software to demonstrate its reliability.
