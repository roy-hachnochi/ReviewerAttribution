 It was mentioned that patients serum samples were selected randomly for cytokines analysis. How does this random selection carry out? Does it take into consideration the age of patients since they are categorized according to age at the beginning? There would be differences in cytokine release profile between child, adult and elderly as the level of immune response between the three groups towards invading organisms would be different. So how does the selection carry out among the three groups of patients? The symbol for gamma for IFN must be presented properly with the right symbol… not “y”. What is the age profile or category of the 29 patients in whom the cytokine profile was carried out? It would be interesting to see if the cytokines release is influenced by age.
