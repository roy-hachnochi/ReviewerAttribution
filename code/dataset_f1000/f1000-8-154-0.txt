I acknowledged the fact that the authors have attended to (some) of the suggested revisions. However, there are still three issues with the current revised version of the work. Two are major, while one is minor. The minor issue is the use of Quora as a bibliographical reference. I am not sure if the publisher has a lenient provision for this. But I do not think Quora's posts can pass peer review or sound publishing practice tests. I will rather advise alternative verifiable materials, even if it is university handbook for the definitions of GPA and CGPA. The major issues are (a) literature review and (b) conclusion sections of the paper. The literature review section, as it is currently, is bibliography listing: A said this, B said this, and C reported this. This is listing of bibliography not reviewing of literature. In review, we will want to see what do(es) A, B, and C have in common and what differentiate them -the constructs studied, demography/sample analyzed and results reported. Review must synthesize the literature, highlight similarity or/and differences, and what might account for these, from the authors' perspectives. This is what is called scholarly footing, which must inevitably form the foundation of the new study. The conclusion section, unbelievably, did not include the discussion part, and not in any distinct section of the article. The discussion part, either as a distinct section or part of the conclusion section is very important. This is where the findings of your study are situated within those of past related works (which you would have reviewed in the literature review section). It is expected to show what you have done differently as a way of providing different context for previous similar studies, complementing previous studies, or contending previous findings.
