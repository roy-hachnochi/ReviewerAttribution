This paper describes the grade point average variances in students enrolled in a private university during a 5 year period. Analysis revealed that grade point averages were not significantly different based on program of study. The cumulative grade point average, a number derived from the grade point average in each year, was significantly correlated with each of the component year grade point averages. Tables 1 and 2 include a column for cumulative percent, which does not add any useful information, and can be deleted. The rightward shift in figure 1 may be explained by dismissal of students with low GPAs - but no indication of dismissal/attrition is indicated in the manuscript. The conclusion in the abstract that students perform much better in level 3 and 4 do not appear supported by table 3, and is not mentioned in the Conclusion section of the paper .
