In this paper, Rai et al. described a patient with acute hepatitis E virus infection who developed acute heart failure. Some cases with hepatitis E virus-associated myocarditis have been reported previously and the authors considered the development of myocarditis also in this case, but the diagnosis was not based on enough tests. The authors diagnosed him as having myocarditis, but the evidence is not enough for the diagnosis.The finding of electrocardiogram is not typical. As discussed in the manuscript, endomyocardial biopsy or other supportive tests are required. In Figure 1, why are the same 3 pictures of electrocardiogram (only lead I, II, and III) shown? 12-lead electrocardiogram should be shown. In Introduction, HEV is an abbreviation of ‘hepatitis E virus’, not ‘hepatitis E’. Please show general names of drugs that were used for this patient. A result of HAV test is not shown. Units of platelet and leukocyte counts are not shown. The characteristics of reported cases with hepatitis E virus-associated myocarditis should be described in the discussion section.
