The article describes the frequency of epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes in Omdurman Maternity Hospital. It examines the association of EOC with age and determined subtypes and grade association. The study is significant as more cancer documentation is needed in Sudan. That said my enthusiasm for this study greatly hampered by the following: Omdurman Maternity Hospital is not the major hospital where women with cancers are diagnosed - so that may affect the conclusion. Not sure from where the authors extracted the tissue grading - as this is not a common practice in Sudan and therefore the authors need to provide more details and present results with some pictures. Detail is also needed in how the data for subtype is obtained - from pathology reports or by using archival blocks and then repeat the pathology reports?
