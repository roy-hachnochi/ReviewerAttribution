This is the initial description of compound heterozygous variants in LPIN1 as a cause of rhadomyolysis in a person of Chinese ethnicity. The sequencing data provided is robust, the nomenclature used is correct and the ACMG classification for the missense change is conservative. There is little in the way of improvements to the manuscript that I could suggest. The categorical statement "The human LPIN1 gene is mapped to chromosome 2p25.1 and contains 20 exons" isn't correct as this gene has multiple transcription isoforms with different numbers and combinations of exons. The isoform used in this discussion certainly has 20 exons but other isoforms range up to 22 exons.
