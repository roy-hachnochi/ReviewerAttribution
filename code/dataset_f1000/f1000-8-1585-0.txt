Authors developed a logistic regression model based on the retrospective study of 737 IVF cycles. They concluded that the model might result in a new validated decision support system to help physicians to manage couplesâ€™ expectations concerning their possibility to have a live birth. The introduction section is unreasonably extended, without providing the necessary information only, leading to the rationale of the study. Important similar models using more sophisticated networks, such as artificial intelligence, are missing. Language and grammar need revision. The sample size is small. A proper power calculation is missing. Some important parameters that have been tested in other studies that contribute to live birth are missing. Limitations are not reported.
