 Comments General comment: Thank you inviting me to review this manuscript. The title of this manuscript is apt and is of relevance in many resource-limited settings. Specific comments: Introduction: this beautifully written. Methods: Here, I appreciate the description of the study setting and reason for the choice of the period to which medical charts were reviewed (in this case, 5 years). However, I will suggest a review of your definition of costs in the economic evaluation of snakebite injuries. Generally and broadly there are two types of costs: Direct cost: Refers to the resource consumed in providing health care interventions. It consist of: Direct medical cost: cost of hospital stay, outpatient visits, card/consultation fees, drugs, labs, surgery, physiotherapy, etc Direct non-medical cost: these resources supporting medical services such as transportation cost, caregiver costs, etc. Indirect cost: this refers to cost from production losses. These include cost due to incapacity to work, disability or premature death. If “complications including death” from snakebite were your outcome measures, then the nomenclature should be reworded to reflect these, instead of “direct cost” as it is presently. Data handling and statistical analysis: I struggled to understand what qualitative variables were analyzed through thematic analysis. Your study was of quantitative design; for instance, no focused group discussions were held. This area needs clarification or else the statement I am referring to should be deleted. The results may need to reflect the queries above. Conclusion: reasonably written.
