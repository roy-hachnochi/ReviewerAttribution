The article is well written and easy to follow. There is a need to classify all the 127 bite victims into the 3 categories Cytotoxic, Haematotoxic and Neurotoxic and any combinations of the same seen so it's clear how many patients had what symptoms. Subsequently, the patients should be followed down along these pathways so it's clear for each category. It's hard to tell if the 74 who did not get antivenom, did they have any symptoms? They may not have had toxic snake bites or were these excluded from the study...not clear. As all the data is available, we should be able to track the different patient categories through their hospital stays and also determine the outcomes for each of the categories.
