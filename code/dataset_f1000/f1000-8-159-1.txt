The study is interesting and the conclusion is provocative: AMH is 1.11 in cancer and 3.99 in non-cancer. However, there are several red flags and suggestions need to be considered: It should be mentioned that AMH was determined from blood, in Abstract and Results. If the authors have sufficient background, it should be discussed about the biology and AMH production by ovarian follicles. The number of patients is not very big. It would be more informative to see a dot plot where every patient represents one dot. The Age of the patients (28, 18-37) is something of a red flag. For ovarian epithelial cancer, 95% of the cases are 55 or older. Doubtfully, all cancer types are affected by AMH. The gynec cancer (14 cases) should be also analysed separately.
