The manuscript by Wiweko et al. asks, does the LHR expression levels in mural granulosa cells correlate with embryo quality in poor/non-poor responder patients? Their results show a positive correlation between fertilization and embryo morphology in poor responder patients and a negative correlation between fertilization and embryo morphology in non-poor responder patients. These findings are novel and are well presented. One point of interest is missing in the discussion; LHR undergoes a sharp decrease after the LH surge (Nair et al., 2002 1 and Ophir et al., 2014 2 ) and the granulosa cells examined in this study were obtained around 34 h post LH surge when LHR levels should be under suppression. This may explain the lower LHR levels found in non-poor responders that responded better to the LH surge. Further discussion in this regard should be added. The manuscript after minor revision may be suitable for indexing.
