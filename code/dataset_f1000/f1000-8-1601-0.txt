Thank you for sharing with us a revised version of the manuscript. First, we would like to clarify that approval with reservations intended to be approval with minor corrections. Further, we are pleased with the way you have addressed the second point we raised, which was to comment on the applicability of your methods on other types of trials. However, we feel that the reply to the first point we raised didn’t add to the manuscript, in fact, it might have even deteriorated the flow of the text. The comment was not meant to be interpreted such as “why you do a t-test”, this is very well justified in the original version. Rather we are asking: “Could you comment whether in the case that the data are not following a Gaussian distribution you can still apply your method?” We will not provide any further reviews, but rather leave it to you whether you would like to improve the manuscript based on the feedback or not.
