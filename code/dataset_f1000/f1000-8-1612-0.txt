Wong et al describe a Chinese kindred with FHH 3 due to a monoallelic point mutation in the AP2S1 gene. The phenotype of the proband and affected relatives is well described and the report is well written. I have a few comments that I submit to the consideration of the authors: The work-up of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism commonly includes renal ultrasonography (or CT scan) and bone mineral density measurement. Was any of those performed in any of the patients? If so, the results should be provided. If not, this should be mentioned. A score, named Pro-FHH, 1 has recently been reported as performing better that CCCR to distinguish patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and with FHH. Could Pro-FHH be retrospectively be computed in the patients? The respective merits of CCCR and Pro-FHH could be discussed. The description of the parathyroid tissue is a bit confusing. Is neoplasm used instead of carcinoma? Was the removed parathyroid tissue totally normal (on a quantitative and qualitative basis), or hyperplastic or anything? Table 1 should be cited when describing the biochemistry in the brother and the niece. Hospitalization for urinary tract infection is uncommon unless it is complicated. Was it? The risk of post surgical hypoparathyroidism after repeated parathyroid surgery should be mentioned in the discussion. page 1, introduction: renal tubular calcium reabsorption
