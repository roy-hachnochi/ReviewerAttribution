The Clinical Practice Article by Wong and colleagues describes the first report of a Chinese kindred with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia type 3 (FHH3). It is informative and well written, and provides detailed phenotypic information for this kindred. I have a few comments, which require addressing: Title: Please insert details of the mutation e.g. “…hypercalcaemia caused by an AP2S1 mutation, Arg15Cys” Page 3: In the paragraph detailing parathyroid histology in the proband, is the term 'without evidence of malignancy', referring to parathyroid adenoma or carcinoma? Malignancy should not be used interchangeably with parathyroid adenoma, given that this is a benign condition. Please avoid the term 'parathyroid neoplasm' as this suggests that histology is being undertaken to assess for parathyroid carcinoma. Please cite Table 1 in the paragraph describing the findings in the elder brother. Table 1 should be cited after the statement 'FECa was 0.83%'. Also cite Table 1 when describing the niece's biochemistry. Please state if gallstones were excluded as a cause of the acute pancreatitis Page 4: This article would benefit from a more in depth discussion of the pancreatitis in the niece. The authors should mention that pancreatitis has previously been reported in a child with FHH3 (Scheers et al Pancreatology 2019). This reported patient also harboured a mutation in the SPINK1 gene, which represents a risk factor for pancreatitis. The authors should indicate whether or not the niece has been tested for a mutation in the SPINK1 gene. Table 1: Please insert serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values for members of this kindred. Figure 1: Please insert sequence trace for the proband showing the c.43CT nucleotide substitution in the AP2S1 gene.
