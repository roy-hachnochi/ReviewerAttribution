 Overall: This is a useful piece of work which challenges the way in which clavicle fractures may be rehabilitated following surgery in athletes. Specifics: Abstract: I would re-write the background as some of this relates to methods and not background. Just frame the rationale for this study. Do you know what the time to union was? (May be useful to put this in the abstract). Main paper: Introduction: May be worth stating what is roughly standard practice in athletes? If there is evidence here quote it, if not then state what is generally done – I suspect the standard practice is to wait for evidence of some bony union before allowing contact, hence why this study is interesting as it questions current practice. Aims: You mention complications in both primary and secondary aims, can you refine this? Results: Would be worth adding in time to union if you have this? Table 1 – would be worth adding another row with the median/average values of age etc Discussion: I would re-do the first paragraph to concisely summarise your key results and why this is important, i.e. that early return to full contact is possible and there is a risk/benefit to this approach as shown by your results. Conclusion: I would make this a bit more concise to summarise that early return to full contact is feasible and results in excellent outcomes but there is the risk of…….
