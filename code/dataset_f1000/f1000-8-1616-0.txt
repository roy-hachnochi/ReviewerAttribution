The study is about hospital learning center that is interesting and important for children to continue their learning outside school. However, I have some suggestions: There are 200 data in the research rather than 400 people. The author can explain that 200 children included in the research and 200 parents were interviewed. Introduction: The author should review other countries' hospital learning centers and their effectiveness in education. Method: The method is short. The author should give more information about the questionnaire especially the relationship between parents and children and children's personal information. The author should explain how it relates to education (the objective of the research) It will make readers clearly understand and follow the article. It is unclear about the hospital learning center such as the reasons teachers modify children's education plans and if they contact children's school teachers? Result: The author should put subtitle before changing the subject, for example, puts words like "education" before according to table 1. The readers will clearly follow the article.
