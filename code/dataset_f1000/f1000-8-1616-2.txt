The effort to help children with learning center while at the hospital is impressive and the result revealed that many children and families were satisfied with the hospital learning center. I have some suggestions: The title should be adjusted. The word effectiveness should be used to explain what effect the child has when they attended the learning center, such as getting a better score, better adaptation when go back to school. In this research, there is no mention of that issue, but mainly as a study of satisfaction. Authors should explain more about the teaching and learning at the center, such as setting and management, teachers: qualification, frequency of attendance, curriculum. Such things would help readers understanding more about the center and could be reproducible. Table 2: It would be better if authors show or explain more about the concept of what you want to convey? Displaying the percent before and after of each items do not show clear picture. Author may use statistics to analyze or discuss more about Table 2 in the discussion part Table 3: please check the odd ratio in the illness condition again if the first row (acute illness) is a reference value (odd is equal to 1). The odd value of chronic illness and disability should be greater than 1. Table 4: The authors try to show the comparison results between 3 groups in degrees of satisfaction. The table should show statistical analysis to compare whether there are differences or not, for clearer picture. In discussion part, the author should explain further as specified in the objectives of the research. For example, discuss about satisfaction for learning center, factors effect modification of educational plan.
