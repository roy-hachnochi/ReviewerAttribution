I read with great interest the Manuscript titled “MUC1 and E-cadherin immunohistochemistry of endometrium cannot predict the outcome of in vitro fertilization: A case-control study” (F1R-VER19607-R), which falls within the aim of F1000Research. In my honest opinion, the topic is interesting enough to attract the readers’ attention. Methodology is accurate and conclusions are supported by the data analysis. Nevertheless, authors should clarify some points and improve the discussion citing relevant and novel key articles about the topic. Authors should consider the following recommendations: Manuscript should be further revised by a native English speaker. Was this study registered? I could not find any information about this point. Embryo transfer is a key stage in IVF, in which the quality of performance determines the outcome. According to recent evidence, transvaginal ultrasound guidance of the transfer significantly increases the percentage of pregnancies per transfer, both in the general population and in the reference population, compared with transfers performed under transabdominal ultrasound guidance. Authors should add few lines about the topic, referring to: Cozzolino et al.(2018) 1 ; Larue et al.(2017) 2 . Recent and robust data suggested that endometrial scratch injury performed once, may improve clinical pregnancy and ongoing pregnancy rates in IUI/IVF cycles. I invite authors to discuss these data (refer to: Vitagliano et al. (2018) 3 ; Vitagliano et al.(2018) 4 ; Vitagliano et al. (2019) 5 ), in the light of available evidence.
