 Overall This study is worthwhile as I'm aware it is difficult to design trials with adequate control solutions. The study was written well and clearly for the most part; I have included some comments for improvement. Abstract Please make clear that you are developing a "control" mouthwash rather than an active one. When you say the experiments were performed in duplicate you suggest that the experiment was performed twice. Reading on, you mention that you performed two measurements from the same experiment which is not an experimental duplicate. Can you rephrase to reflect this? You also mentioned that there is a good trade-off between anti-gonococcal activity and taste for one placebo; how did you measure this? It is not described in the main study. Methods You mention PBS allows for unrestricted gonococcal growth; I do not believe this is correct; it maintains viability but not growth. Initial colony counts were not performed; this would have allowed comparison between the different mouthwashes with higher confidence. You cold have also somehow measured reduction in viability; this will need to be justified in the discussion. You present results for penicillinase; how did you test this. Results Can you please put title rows on table 1? For Table 2 it would be helpful to mention what the final volume/weight/mass the placebos were, or enter the values as percentages? Table 6 could perhaps go in supplementary files? The summary tables enough for these results. Discussion What do you mean when you say you did not assess bacterial growth "blindly"? See comments in methods for what else needs to be considered in discussion. You also mentioned experiments performed sequentially and also plating was performed in duplicate; from the results it seems like one of these was done. Can you clarify this?
