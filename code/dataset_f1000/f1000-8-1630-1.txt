From the point of view and optics of Oncological Gynaecology, it would highlight the originality of the clinical case presented. The presentation of clinical and surgical data is adequate and meticulous and translates a good level of background knowledge of the author. Good writing, clarity in the presentation and good structuring of the discursive dialogue of the discussion. Perhaps there would be a short synthesis at the end of the article with the background of the case and a small conclusion.
