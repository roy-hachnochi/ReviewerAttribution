This study is very interesting, and having assessed the reliability of radiographic examinations is very useful for clinical practice. We should only understand, as a future perspective, the differences between the different devices used, or between the different exposure settings; it could be mentioned in "Discussion" section as a limitation of the study. The work has been well done, and the results are in agreement with other studies in the literature. In the "Keywords" section, I recommend using Meshwords (https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/) I suggest to expand the "Introduction" section: Add notes on the history of radiology in maxillofacial and oral medicine 1 2 . Add clinical notes on the use of three-dimensional radiographic examinations, and how these may influence rehabilitation 3 . Furthermore it is necessary to subdivide the section into two sub-sections, for example "Background" and "Aim". The "Methods" section should be implemented only by improving image quality if possible. In the "Conclusions" section, cite a future perspective of the study, and the function of this research in clinical practice.
