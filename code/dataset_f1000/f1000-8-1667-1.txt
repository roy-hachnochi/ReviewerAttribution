This article by Sana Mostafa et al. examines Gustatory dysfunction in relation to circumvallate papilla’s taste buds structure upon unilateral maxillary molar extraction in Wistar rats. The study, although it is simple, adds knowledge to the literature. Minor comments would help to improve the impact of this paper: Title: Gustatory dysfunction in relation to circumvallate papilla’s taste buds structure upon unilateral maxillary molar extraction in Wistar rats but in Methods you said (all maxillary molars of the right side were extracted) so you may change it to maxillary molars. Introduction: An interaction between dental and gustatory afferent neurons in the NST has been previously discussed please add a hint about it Methods: In the experimental groups, all maxillary molars of the right side were extracted (early in the morning) why? Is the time of extraction make a significant difference. The tongue retracted by a tweezer. Postoperatively, antibiotics were administrated (cefotaxime10mg/Kg IV, Eipico, Egypt) for 3 days23. Analgesics were administrated (Ketoprofen (Anafen, Merial) 5mg/kg I.M)24 once daily for up to 3 days did you do that with the control group? If not how to be sure that the medications does not affect the experiment. Results: Figures from 2 to 6: please clarify which side is the extracted molars side and adjust the angulation of the CVP (figure 3 and 5) to make it easy to compare between the 2 sides of the trough. Discussion Further investigations of the nerve supply under TBs of both sides using immunohistochemistry is recommended.
