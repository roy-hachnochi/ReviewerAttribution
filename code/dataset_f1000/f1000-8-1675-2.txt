Consistently, the authors have not well communicated in their writing and poorly reviewing the previous studies resulting in devaluing the work despite interesting methodology. For example, the authors cited their own articles, and readers cannot clearly distinguish ones from the previous studies and one of this study. Though, there is some inconsistency between the previous study of Oda and Chiem (2019) — “the absence of rice plants doubles the methane emission from the field because of the lack of methanogenesis inhibition by rice plants”— and the Figure 1 of this study. The authors are not attempting to discuss this inconsistency but try to discuss their new findings without citing any supporting evidence from other previous works.
