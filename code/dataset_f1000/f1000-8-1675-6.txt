I still have concerns about the accuracy of the methodology applied for this work since the result is double the maximum value given by prior studies conducted in the same region. Though the author is convinced that extremely high CH 4 is usual in the studied areas but no scientific evidence is shown in context. Furthermore, the suggestion given by the authors on the decomposing rice straw in flooding field may not be feasible due to a lower gain of the farmers. The authors are convinced that the yield in the tripled crop is low, and the farmers will have much more profit by practising organic farming. This discussion is out of the ring because there is no evidence on rice yield, and organic farming is out of the scope of this work.
