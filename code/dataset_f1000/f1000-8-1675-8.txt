The measurement of GHG emission from paddy fields in Mekong Delta have been carried out by several authors. However, understanding of GHG emission from paddy field by triple seasons isn't well known. This study contributed some good information on GHG emission, focusing on CH 4 to understanding how to reduce GHG emission from the paddy field. My commends are below: Introduction: Introduction should be given a general information on rice production in Mekong Delta in order to explain this study is a representative. Method: Site description should be more clear, such as, what about the field practices of the farmer on their fields? Were the three observed fields similar in these practices? What about the water management in the fields? The author said the fields was continuously flooding, but how about water level/regime in three observed fields? How about straw management? What about the height of stubble for each season? How was about fertilization?... Methane measurement: The author said the closed chamber method described by Oda Chien, 2019. However, a brief description should be added. What time of the day were GAS samples take? How was CH 4 calculated? Statistical analysis: A one-way ANOVA should be analysed to compare the means among season? Discussion: The authors just explained the difference of CH 4 emission among seasons was due to straw incorporation into the soil. However, I did not see any information on straw incorporation in the observed fields (as above commented). Other factors such as rice varieties, weather, fertilization... should be discussed. In this case, these factors differed among seasons, why did only straw incorporation influence on CH 4 emissions? Conclusion: As above commented, the conclusion on CH 4 emission increase being due to straw incorporation is not clear.
