This paper tackles an important issue in science policy research. The authors have responded well to comments on an earlier draft. They have addressed the issues raised and the limitations of the study are clearly stated. While those limitations mean the survey results must be interpreted with caution, the findings are likely to inform discussions around the barriers to and facilitators of interventions to improve adherence to reporting guidelines.
