We read with interest the study by Chen et al. , where the authors have assessed (hK6) and (PGDS) as new markers of injury indicators coupled with NSE and S100B. These two proteins [(hK6) and (PGDS)] are of high interest and worth looking at; however, this study lacks enough power (n=10 exp vs 10 control) which is not enough to draw any kind of discriminatory level. N of patients should be increased and other demographic data should be included as well. The TBI patients assessed are in the severe level and as the authors have mentioned that both UCH-L1 and GFAP have been considered the gold standard by the FDA specifically for severe TBI which is the case in this study. This is in contrast to the S100B and NSE which have been criticized for their non-specificity (muscle and red blood cells derived!). Thus, I think these data should be contrasted to UCH-L1 and GFAP with higher N. It is of interest as to why the CT scan was not included in the comparison.
