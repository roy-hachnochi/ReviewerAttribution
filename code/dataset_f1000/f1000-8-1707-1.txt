The authors seem to have responded to most of my comments, but few, mostly minor, still need to be addressed: “Line 23-24 of introduction: The reference Bcskei et al. Nature 1992 should be added to the explanation of the structure of Rat n 1. Similarly, under methods section: “Construction of 3D models”, the pdb codes of the structures should be provided.” In abstract: Rat n 1 shares 52%. Is this correct, or should it be 62% as mentioned later in the paper? The percentage of identity should be corrected if needed for consistency. Minor comments: In the paragraph before last: “Blattella germanica (German cockroach), a capacity to bind hydrophobic ligands such as: tyramine and octopamine has been characterized34. But residues involved in linking ligands in Rat n 1 are not conserved in Bla g 4, this is relevant because suggest a capacity to link different kinds of ligands in both allergens.” Blattella germanica should be in italics. “This is relevant because suggest a capacity to link different kinds of ligands in both allergens.” Should be a separate sentence. In Table 1: Equus caballus (domesti chorse) should read: domestic horse Before last paragraph in discussion: “Resolution of 3D structure of Rat n 1 by X-ray, it helped to understand structural basis for linking ligands”. This sentence should be: Resolution of 3D structure of Rat n 1 by X-ray helped to understand structural basis for binding ligands.
