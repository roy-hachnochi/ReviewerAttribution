Vancomycin is an important antimicrobial drug particularly against MRSA however its growing development of resistance against the microbes has made it an important drug for further studies and a higher level of understanding for its utility and mode of usage. In present study, the authors conducted a retrospective study at Jafar Ibn Auf Hospital which is one of the good health care facility for infectious and other diseases. The results concluded that 86 patents (67.8%) were receiving the Vancomycin therapy appropriately against Sepsis (29%) and Pneumonia (19.6%) as most common indication. The authors have reported that the therapy was given to a pneumonia patient for 40 days and alternatively it was recommended for another patient for one day only, here I would suggest the authors to update the record for this duration of one day as well and whether it was discontinued for some medical reason OR due to treatment success OR due to something else. As per my understanding Vancomycin therapy should not be given for that much limited duration. The authors have reported that in most of the cases vancomycin therapy was given as an imperial treatment, and culture sensitivity testing rate is very low, The authors should explain (in discussion) why they have this much low rate of culture sensitivity testing? I highly recommend the acceptance of this manuscript for publication as it will provide the basis for antimicrobial regimen design against certain diseases.
