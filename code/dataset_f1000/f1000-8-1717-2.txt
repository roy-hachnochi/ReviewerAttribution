The authors provide a case report on the management of muscle-invasive adenocarcinoma of the bladder with partial cystectomy. As discussed by the authors, this is not standard or recommended treatment for this disease. This treatment strategy has been well addressed in the literature. Background: Schistosomiasis and chronic bladder irritation are associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder (not adenocarcinoma). Case report: It is unclear the duration of followup. It would be useful to know longer-term oncologic outcomes. Specifically, the authors are advocating for partial cystectomy in T2 adenocarcinoma of the bladder without a clear report of the oncologic outcome. I'm not entirely sure of the novelty of this case and its' suitability for publication.
