I would like to congratulate you on the work done. This helps to analyze the most active researchers in the subject, facilitating future collaborations. I would like to ask some questions that were not very clear for me in the paper. Why did you only use PubMed to survey data? How did you consider collaborations? You could have done more interesting things, such as a heat map (VOSViewer has a great one and is free to use - but have used it in a previous bibliometric analysis). Bibliometric is an aid in the characterization of a field, but scholarly communication is too complex to explain the history, status, and development of any field of science. Bibliometric has a lot of limitations that should be recognized in order to avoid a simplistic misuse of the indicators and methodologies. Borgman, C. L., and Furner, J. (2002).
