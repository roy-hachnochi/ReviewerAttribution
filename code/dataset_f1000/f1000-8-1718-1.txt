I applaud the authors' efforts in sifting through the large volume of data in determining the proportion of ophthlamology publications that are cateogorized as RCTs. The authors also found that most of the RCTs concern retinal diseases. This makes sense, as one of the most dramatic therapeutic advancements since early 2000s- not just in Ophthalmology but all of medicine - is the employment of anti-VEGF therapy in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. These two conditions, along with glaucoma, are perhaps the 3 most common ophthalmic conditions for which many newer therapeutics are being developed. It is also encouraging to see that the number of RCT published annually in Ophthalmology has generally trended upward, and that they are published in well-regarded peer-reviewed journals. Overall, though, there remains a lack of RCTs in Ophthalmology, with majority of published works being presumably retrospective in nature.
