During review process, I appreciated this study. Authors discuss new approach that is well written. However, I found following points to be check for further improvement in manuscript: Abstract: Please correct "in this area" instead of "in this era". Introduction: Please replace "tolerant varieties" instead of "new and better heat tolerant varieties". The conclusion need to be ameliorate because it is very brief. The review discussed very well and comprehensively the context of current literature. All statements are correct and author can refer to others citations to make the paper more supported. The review is written with good English and it did not need any improvement. Author can refer the following paper to explain more: Zafar S.A., Zaidi S.S.A., Gaba Y., Singla-Pareek S.L., Dhankher O.P., Li X., Mansoor S., Pareek A (2019). Engineering abiotic stress tolerance via CRISPR/ Cas-mediated genome editing. Journal of Experimental Botany, doi:10.1093/jxb/erz476, pp 1-10 1 . Cushman J.C., Bohnert H.J. 2000. Genomic approaches to plant stress tolerance. Genome studies and molecular genetics, 3:117â€“124 2 . In general, this review can be accepted with minor revision.
