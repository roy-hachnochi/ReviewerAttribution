It is a well written manuscript. Few suggestions: For the 3 rd paragraph of the introduction, reference 9: The looming co-epidemic document ( https://www.theunion.org/what-we-do/publications/technical/low-resolution/25383_TCB_Report_LR.pdf ) mentions figures from TN from a 2012 study (see page 10 of this document). There is one study from Tamil Nadu in which diabetes was documented in 163 (14%) of 1131 TB patients (10.4103/ijcm.IJCM_179_16). Consider using this for more recent, same state figures. Box 1 seems redundant as the authors decide against analyzing the outcomes based on RBGs. The information available in the results section, fourth paragraph is adequate and self-explanatory. Since this is a record review, it will be good to know the denominator of all TB patients diagnosed in all these three tuberculosis units of which, the authors found 438 patients with TB-DM. This will add important information for the program, as well as future studies.
