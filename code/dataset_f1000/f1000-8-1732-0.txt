This is a somewhat unusual manuscript presenting many thoughts on how to identify an epitope, recognized by an antiserum that was raised against a synthetic peptide, identified by prior Edman sequencing. The authors decide to perform IHC on different tissues. The encouraging result is that they find that their antiserum stains these tissues, and that staining is blocked by smaller peptides, containing the C-terminal residues of the sequence against which the antiserum was raised. Based on these data, molecular modeling and bioinformatics analysis, the authors conclude that their antiserum may bind a 'secretogranin II-related' epitope. Since the epitope sequences are not encoded in linear SgII derivatives but all amino acid residues are present, the authors propose that the epitope, recognized by their antiserum, must be generated by peptide splicing. Overall, in its current form, I find this manuscript a bit too speculative - there is no direct evidence that the antiserum indeed recognizes an SgII-like protein-derived sequence that is formed by peptide splicing. My suggestion would be that the authors introduce the antigen candidates they describe into cell lines that don't stain with the antiserum themselves, and then perform IHC to identify the antigen recognized. They may then mutate this antigen, to verify whether the distant protein parts they suspect indeed are part of the epitope recognized. If so, more biochemical experiments (which do not necessarily have to be part of this manuscript) may be performed to confirm the role of peptide splicing in the generation of the current epitope.
