This article describes a case of botyroid embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the right middle ear in a four year old child. It covers the clinical presentation, workup and subsequent management of this rare entity and reviews the pertinent literature of other case descriptions. The case report is very well written, informative, covers an interesting and unusual topic, and adequately covers all of the objectives set out in the guidelines. The background of the caseâ€™s history and progression are described in excellent detail. Description of the physical examination and workup of the patient are detailed and methodical, as are the descriptions of diagnostic tests, treatments and outcomes. Emphasis is placed on the rarity of this clinical entity and thus it's contribution to the literature is a useful one. There were no novel treatments in this case report, however the description of the chemotherpay regimen will be useful for other clinicians. Description of the recurrent presentations to the GP and AE departments are a sobering reminder of the need for these clinicians to recognise unusual clinical patterns, not rely on previous diagnoses and seek help from specialists early in such scenarios. Images of the histology would have been a nice to see given the rarity of this clinical entity.
