This is an interesting, concise and well-constructed case report and review of the relevant literature surrounding rhabdomyosarcoma affecting the middle ear. This is a rare entity and as such additional case reports are valuable in adding to the existing literature. The case report contains adequate description of the patient and detail of the presentation and initial investigations, which would be in line with the reviewers own practice. The case highlights the need for high clinical suspicion when treating non-resolving recurrent ear infections in children which is a useful message for clinicians. The literature review results are presented clearly and contain all relevant information regarding the caseâ€™s reported. However, there is a lack of detail surrounding which chemotherapy/radiotherapy regimes were used. It is also unclear if they were adjuvant or primary treatment modalities for the other cases described.
