The Northern Italian research group presents a study protocol detailing specifics of a rectal cancer registry, which consists of a multicentric collaboration aiming to gather reliable, prospectively collected data for rectal cancer research. The authors need to be congratulated for their initiative. Multi-institutional collaborations are needed in the rapidly evolving field of multi-modal treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. The authors emphasise new challenges of an ageing, frail population. Radiotherapy- or surgery-sparing strategies may represent interesting alternatives to conventional treatment schemes. Overall the protocol is clear and concise. I would like to suggest expanding on the following points: Multi-institutional collaborations are challenging, since dealing with a heterogeous patient- and provider population, surgical and perioperative care. How do the authors account for that? Standardization: Do all centers use similar treatment protocols? How standardized is the surgical approach? Do all centers perform robotic proctoectomy? How experienced are participating surgeons? Are all participating centers teaching facilities? I think the authors may expand on complication assessment. Who is assessing complications, are these institution-specific abstractors or do centers dispose of surveillance tools, i.e. for surgical site infections? How do the authors ascertain data quality? National data registries ideally need (independent) audit and validation. Who is auditing data accuracy?
