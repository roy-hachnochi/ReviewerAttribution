The Abstract was well written and fully comprehensive, however this phrase should be corrected: ...; NaF (demineralized enamel treated with 0.05% sodium fluoride solution (one minute) for eight weeks);... Should mention that this immersion was done DAILY for one minute and lasts 8 weeks. The introduction presents the studied issue through a brief literature review. The objective was clear in the bottom of the introduction. However, I suggest for the authors to include the null hypothesis of the this study. The methods: As a suggestion, this paragraph (The specimens were then subjected to thermo-mechanical wear (37000 ER machine, ERIOS, So Paulo, SP, Brazil). Mechanical cycling was performed with load of 60 N and 100,000 cycles. The load was applied on the composite resin restoration, perpendicular to the enamel surface.) may be rewritten as the following: (The specimens were then subjected to thermo-mechanical cycling (37000 ER machine, ERIOS, So Paulo, SP, Brazil) with load of 60 N and 100,000 cycles applied on the composite resin restoration, perpendicular to the enamel surface.) The discussion, it may be interested to discuss the use of NaF solution instead of using AgF and KF and the immersion for 1 minute instead of for 3 minutes as in the study of Zhi et al 1 . Even more, the discussion of more recent studies could be interested as the study of Alqahtani et al 2 . The study was well written, the objective is interested and has a relevance in this area. The results were promising and the study and the authors collaborated in the understanding of the behavior of many materials in the de/remineralization process on the tooth surface. The conclusions of this paper drawn adequately supported by the results.
