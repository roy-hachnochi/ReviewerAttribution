This study analyzed Salivary nitric oxide, Simplified Oral Hygiene Index, and salivary flow rate in smokers and non-smokers: a cross-sectional study. The results of the study explained the relationship between unstimulated whole salivary flow rate and the status of oral hygiene also the relationship between salivary nitric oxide concentration and the status of oral hygiene assessed through the OHI-S of smokers but the conclusions do not explain the correlation as mentioned. This paper is good and is an important addition to the literature. The concept of correlation between salivary nitric oxide and the status of oral hygiene index is written clearly. I would like to give the suggestion of adding explanations about why the authors correlated flow rate saliva and status of oral hygiene or add literature that explains about the effect oral hygiene status on salivary flow rate.
