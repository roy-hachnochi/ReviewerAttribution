Abstract Background: “disparities amid almost similarities in policies is a cause of concern to demographers" – not sure what this is in reference to Abstract Methods: 'Using Bongaarts reformulation of Easterlin and Crimmins conceptual scheme of 1985 on Demographic and Health Survey Data (DHS) data collected overtime across countries' – Not clear what the next sentences are justifying. 'The understanding of the current transition in general would help to reassess and provide explanations to the observed latest fertility dynamics at play. This study therefore is an attempt to explain the current fertility transition through women’s fertility preference' – Justification should be moved to background or objectives Introduction: The sentences “African fertility transitions occurred earlier than anticipated if Africa had followed the non-African relationship between fertility and development” and “The key features of African fertility regimes indicate that at a given level of development, Africa’s fertility is higher,” are contradictory. The authors need to discuss the limitation of the model. Such assumption is that F 0 = F w + F u yet we know there are situations that F 0 is less than F w. How will this explain an increasing observation that due to various factors many women do not achieve their desired fertility.
