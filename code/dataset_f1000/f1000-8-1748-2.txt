This is a welcome exploration of a key source of debate in the FP/RH world: what is the more important source of fertility transition: population fertility preferences or contraception service delivery? The analysis was sound, but a qualified statistician needs to review the calculations to ensure accuracy. However, the conculsions are convincing on the importance of service delivery implementation and its relation to fertility transition. I would welcome more exploration of literature exploring this critical question - currently the article does not touch on other studies or the debates and calculations other authors have conducted. This is a huge gap in the study. There is also not enough discussion of implications of findings for policy in FP/RH. The article also needs a thorough copy-edit, especially the abstract, where results are written in a confused, unclear manner.
