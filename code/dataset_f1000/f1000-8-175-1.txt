Figure 1. Please specify what each color on the rarefaction curve represents. Figure 3 and distance based analyses: Authors still have not followed through with adding R2 and pseudo-F values, besides P-values, in the text. I know it is referenced in the supplement (which by the way should be referenced throughout the text with specific S-table or S-figure number), but these three values should be referenced in the main text. Also, authors should specify in the text that the P-values from the distance-based differences calculated (also R2 and pseudo-F) were calculated via PERMANOVA. Also on figure 3, please omit "...representing the mean of distance matrix for.." It should read "representing the mean UniFrac distance between samples" PERMANOVA analyses: Authors have a confusion about the difference between then terms ADONIS and PERMANOVA- basically ADONIS, is a function within the R package vegan to perform PERMANOVA- the R2 is not a value from adonis, it's a value generated in PERMANOVA (all, P-values, R2 and pseudo-F). This reviewer thanks the authors for improving the manuscript. However, before it can finally be endorsed, authors should address the following minor comments: Table 3: This is a comment made in the previous version: the title "Relative abundance of bacteria found among smokers vs former and never-smokers generated by QIIME" is incorrect - QIIME is am interface with several plugins, authors should specify which of these specific plugins allowed them to detect discriminant taxa in table 3 (e.g. LeFSE, binomial distributions?). Authors should specify I the text that discriminant taxa analyses were made at the genus level. Last, if authors mix the term OTU with several taxonomic levels (e.g. OTUS at the genius level, or OTUS at the phyla level, readers may get confused- typically, we only use OTUs as a proxy for species (97% 16S rRNA sequence similarity).
