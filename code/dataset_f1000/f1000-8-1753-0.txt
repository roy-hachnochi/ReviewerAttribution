The paper describes importance of intrainsically disordered proteins with thorough set of examples with good references. It also explains computational and experimental challenges involved in IDP research. A good summary of available tools and platforms are also provided. Key challenges in IDP research are identified and key activities to be carried out to tackle these challenges are provided. ELIXIR community has many of the researchers working in the field within the consortium. All the needed activities align well with ELIXIR activities as well. So it is natural that ELIXIR plays a centralized role in these activities. The paper also identified key players around the world that they can collaborate with establishing a task force to tackle major challenges IDP research needs to tackle. Only issue I have with the paper is the lack of focus on reproducibility issues. That is a major problem life science research is facing today. most of the experimental results are not reproducible even computational models are not reproducible resulting in waste of billions of euros spent in funding such research activities. They should have a special focus group within their consortium to ensure reproducibility of experimental results within IDP community (define key information needed to reproduce results, endorse use of e notebooks and use of protocols established withing the network, etc.). They should also do the same for computational models that are developed to tackle several problems related to IDP. A section added on these issues would strengthen the paper. Also if they include other initiatives focusing on reproducbility that would strengthen their task force.
