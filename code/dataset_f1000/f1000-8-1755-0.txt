S. Suzuki addressed all the concerns I raised except one. Looking at the new version of the work, it seems to me that he reviewed the table header and footnotes, but not the table itself. In this way, the header does not match with the table (no estimate is provided for the whole sample). He should update the frame and content of the table following my previous comment, where columns are separated by '\' and rows are separated by '|' (I know it is tricky to read, but I could not paste the Word table in the online form). If the author addresses this point, his work can be accepted without any further changes.
