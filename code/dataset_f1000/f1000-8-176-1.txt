The authors provide an interesting report of the use of allopurinol to decrease 6-MMP levels and ameliorate 6MP-induced hypoglycemia. Their experience in these two cases is supported by other recent case reports with similar results. This article provides good background and discussion of the mechanism, as well as guidance regarding the risks of myelosuppression with this therapy and the need for 6MP dose reduction and close monitoring. The authors should review the therapy details closely, particularly related to dosing. For patient #1 they state that the methotrexate dose was 75mg/m 2 which is clearly a typo, but draws into question if other doses provided are correct.
