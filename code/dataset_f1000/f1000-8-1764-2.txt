This study investigated the effect of different whitening toothpastes on the teeth enamel color surface roughness and morphology. The topic is interesting and the manuscript is well written and well constructed. The introduction was informative and covered the main ideas investigated in the study. The apparatus used to simulate the brushing provided a standardized procedure thus aiding in having accurate results. All data of teeth color and surface roughness are available.The discussion was well written and covered and explained the results thoroughly. However, some minor comments are suggested for the authors to consider: More than one type of tooth pastes with blue covarine could have been tested to compare their efficacy, or different concentrations of blue covarine. The authors didn`t mention if a new toothbrush was used in the experiment for each tooth or not. In figure 2 the word "colour" is different than the spelling in the rest of the research.
