DNA barcoding is an important and useful tool to ratify species status in circumstances where morphology-based taxonomy fails or nearly-fails to perform unambiguous identification of species. The authors in the present study have taken up an important group of freshwater fish. There are many grammatical errors and some technical flaws in the manuscript. I felt one major drawback could be their total silence on the nominal species of Osteochilus kelabu . Of course using barcoding they have proved that the species is O. melanopleurus . However, they should have shown a phylogenetic comparison of these two nominal species to rule out confusion in identification. Morphological method followed does not appear to be robust. They are advised to use TRUSS MORPHOMETRICS which can be performed using user-friendly software nowadays. In the phylogenetic tree the majority of bootstrap values do not appear to be robust; hence it could reflect a spurious relationship.
