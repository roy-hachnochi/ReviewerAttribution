Generally, the article needs to be proofread by an expert. There are a lot of areas I have highlighted to guide the authors. In paragraph three of the discussion section, the authors should be more scientific in providing reasons for limited variation such as inbreeding within the species due to limited migration. More so, if COI is known to be conserved within a species, it is not expected to change within a small time frame of genetic event. In general, the discussion should be rewritten to explain the results and interpretations of the study. In addition, I suggest the authors contact an expert that can explain/interpret the results obtained using DNASP. The explanation of the results from the software should be more than presenting the values. The gel result will be more appreciable if the marker has been properly labelled.
