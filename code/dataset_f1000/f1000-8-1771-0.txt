The case report is interesting, well written and provides complete information for paediatricians who have never met the acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy in their practice. Just a few minor observations: The acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy is more known as Finkelstein disease than as Seidlmayer purpura: I suggest to change the eponym both in the introduction and in the keywords. The French origin of the girl does not influence the diagnosis and is redundant: please remove it. In the discussion section, Finkelstein disease is said to be distinguished from Gianotti-Crosti disease, whose papular and not usually purpuric presentation is quite different: I suggest to remove it. Authors state the the Finkelstein disease is more frequent in winter time: when did the girl arrived in the Emergency Department?
