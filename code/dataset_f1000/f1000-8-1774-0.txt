Gustavsen and colleagues present a well-written software article that describes usage of RCy3, a R/Bioconductor package for using Cytoscape from within R. The package is very well documented in both analysis vignettes on the Bioconductor landing page of the package and in the article itself. The implemented functionality covers a range of useful features including network import/export, network layout, and integration with network and enrichment analysis packages. I have 3 minor comments: Table 2 is supposed to show the "Top 30 network-related Bioconductor packages ordered by rank" but misses the EnrichmentBrowser package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/EnrichmentBrowser) which is (and was in Sep 2019) highly ranked in the various corresponding BiocViews: Rank 2: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___NetworkEnrichment Rank 10: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Network Rank 13: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___GraphAndNetwork The relevant functions EnrichmentBrowser::compileGRN (compiles a gene regulatory network in a simple 3 column format regulator-target-effectType), EnrichmentBrowser::nbea (network-based enrichment analysis working on such GRNs), and EnrichmentBrowser::ggeaGraph (constructs a graphNEL object that annotates differential expression and edge consistency) produce network-representations that are compatible with the formats supported by RCy3. I tested that. The lines gal80Rexp.min - min(data$gal80Rexp, na.rm = T) gal80Rexp.max - max(data$gal80Rexp, na.rm = T) should be replaced with gal80Rexp.min - min(data$gal80Rexp, na.rm = TRUE) gal80Rexp.max - max(data$gal80Rexp, na.rm = TRUE) consistent with the remainder of the article and good R style. The lines # Run EnrichmentMap build command em_command - paste('enrichmentmap build analysisType="generic"', "gmtFile=", paste(getwd(), gmt.file, sep="/"), "pvalue=", 1, "qvalue=", 1, "similaritycutoff=",0.25, "coefficients=","JACCARD") can be simplified to # Run EnrichmentMap build command em_command - paste('enrichmentmap build analysisType="generic"', paste0("gmtFile=", file.path(getwd(), gmt.file)), "pvalue=1", "qvalue=1", "similaritycutoff=0.25", "coefficients=JACCARD")
