This is a review of the manuscript titled "RCy3: Network biology using Cytoscape from within R". RCy3 is a Bioconductor package that communicates with Cytoscape via its REST API to build and visualize networks. This manuscript is about a re-designed/updated RCy3 package and its function and implementation. My comments are below: The authors say "We have re-written every function". Is it backward compatible? Should existing users of the older version of the package have to make changes in their code? The authors say "Over 100 new functions have been added, including dozens of helper functions specifically for intuitive data overlay operations". This is a great achievement. In addition to this statement, perhaps it would be helpful for users to summarize/compare what the main improvements are in this newer version? Does this newer version include more or better (or the same) interoperability with other major packages that use RCy3? For example, exporting and importing to/from Ndex. From the example code listed in the paper, it seems there is no change in the way the interoperability works? Minor comment: It is helpful to call the package RCy3 2.0 or something to note the version change? Would keeping the same name be confusing for users? Overall great work! RCy3 is one of the major packages that work with Cytoscape so very important for the R/BioC Community. Not all authors of Bioconductor and R packages take effort to update their packages, so I commend this effort. I have used RCy3 in the past and am excited to try out this newest version of the package.
