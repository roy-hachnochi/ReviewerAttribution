This case could readily be explained by prolonged androgen suppression, which is common in elderly men after discontinuation of LHRH agonist. In the absence of serum testosterone levels after ADT was stopped, the case is not convincing. While I'm open to the effect of interventions such as this, it requires very convincing evidence. On this basis I'd elect to reject this paper.
