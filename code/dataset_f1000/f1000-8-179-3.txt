The authors report on the bone marrow changes during RT-CT in anal cancer patients as assessed by FDG-PET performed at week 2 of treatment. The study is of interest. Bone marrow sparing approaches tend to rely on the fact that bone marrow is a static organ at risk to be avoided during planning and delivery, but this is not the case, since both CT and RT may change the relative proportion of active/whole bone marrow and the spatial distribution. I have some comments: Introduction: I would cite HPV infection as a risk factor. Methods: I would not call eligibility criteria out; it is a retrospective study and hence I would rather define patientsâ€™ characteristics. No data on chemotherapy are present (type, timing, regimen); please provide details. With respect to RT, please provide details on the setting (definitive RT, adjuvant RT); if part of the cohort includes post-operative patients, please describe. Which OM scoring scale did you use? Please specify. Results: Please provide data on the timing of worst OM; at which week of treatment. Discussion: Please cite and discuss Franco et al. (2017 1 ). General comment: I would suggest the authors to have their manuscript revised by a native speaker. Language needs to be improved.
