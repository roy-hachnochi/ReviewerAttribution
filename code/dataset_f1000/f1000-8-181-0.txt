Case is written in great detail. Evans syndrome is uncommon, and the association with celiac disease is extremely uncommon. Since the pretest probability is very low in patients with celiac disease, I would not recommend routine screening for Evans syndrome in all patients with celiac disease. It will be prudent to screen in only the appropriate clinical setting. Recommend amend the first line in the discussion section celiac disease results from gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals. There is no convincing evidence of disease onset only from environmental triggers. It will be helpful to include a line in the history on excluding any medications/supplements that can cause hemolytic anemia.
