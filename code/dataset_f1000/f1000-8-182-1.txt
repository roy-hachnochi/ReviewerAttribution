 Overall evaluation This is an interesting case report of venous thromboembolism in a young adult male without any predisposing factors. The authors described the case in detail with relevant and recent literature references. However, there is a need of a minor revision to enrich the manuscript. The author may revise the manuscript keeping in following points in mind: Title As this is a case of a “young adult male,” authors may add the word “male” in the title of the manuscript. Abstract The patient presented with chest pain and dyspnoea. The second line of the “Abstract” described that the patient did not have any “calf pain.” Authors could add some cardiological history. They could also add a glimpse of clinical examination (especially heart rate and rhythm) rather than starting with “ECG showed tachycardia…” Keywords Authors may add more keywords according to MeSH for wider dissemination of the article. Introduction PE causes “100000 deaths” annually. Is it global or regional data? Please specify. Case report Authors may add the time when the patient was brought to the hospital, along with the nature of his works in previous 12 hours, if the information is available. What was the rhythm of the pulse in clinical examination? If the data is available, the authors may add it. Discussion Discussion is adequate and well written. Conclusion Written well and it is within the scope of the article. References References are relevant and recent.
