This is an interesting case report which discusses a rare phenomenon of unprovoked venous thromboembolism and its management. I would congratulate the authors for their work. However, there are a few concerns: Though the authors have mentioned that there was no history of long air travel, it will be helpful to know if the patient had any history of long car travel before the event precipitated. It has been noted that DVT is commonly encountered in patients who undergo long car travel. Such information, if added, shall make the physicians more aware. Did the physicians/authors conduct any clinical examination to test DVT. Were Homan's or Mosses sign performed. If yes, what were the results. If not, it will be helpful to know the reason for not performing them. A little detail on clinical examination of the patient should also be added to the manuscript besides the symptoms and findings. It will also be helpful to know the Trop I values, if they were assessed by the authors. The authors have mentioned that patient was kept on Rivaroxaban. Were there any side effects that were encountered. It will also be helpful if the authors could mention about the follow-up period of the patient in the manuscript. Was any assessment done in the post discharge period. Was there any change in vessel size? Any adaptive remodeling seen with the treatment using Rivaroxaban . Was the patient satisfied with the treatment? Any satisfaction index which was assessed. Authors may add it if found to be appropriate. They could use the attached reference for the same.
