The research point is very interesting and worthy of affirmation. However, I think there are several problems in the design of this experiment. First, the rice variety adopted in this experiment is not suitable for ratoon use, so the results could not explain the impact of SALIBU measures on ratoon rice well. Second, the soil fertility of standard conditions and the climatic factors such as sun light and temperature of the experiment site are not explained, so it is difficult to compare the results with previous reports. Whatâ€™s more, there is no introduction for the fertilizer status of the tested soil, so it is difficult to discuss the changes of soil under four adverse environments, which is the important reason that leads to the conclusion of the study not being convincing.
