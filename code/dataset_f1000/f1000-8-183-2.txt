This article entitled “How ‘smart’ is smart dentistry?” is an interesting topic. It looks upon smart dentistry which is an important area especially as we are currently in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where everything is changing fast with new technologies. It is no doubt that smart dentistry already exists with more new advanced technology that has emerged to facilitate clinical works. However with this bibliometric mapping methods study, the included papers were not critically appraised and the details information were not described clearly. Limitations that band it from being smarter such as cost and resources should be elaborated. It just show the overall general trend where a proper conclusion cannot be made, which ends up with very a weak conclusion. Maybe it is better to conclude that there is an improvement in smart dentistry with year changes especially in developed country as the gold standard level is yet not known.
