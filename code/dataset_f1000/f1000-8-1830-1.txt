Here, the authors describe several ethical considerations in academics. This is an interesting topic and the ethical issues related to academic are seldom acknowledged. This is largely an opinion piece, with the conclusions those based on the authors' opinions. Unconscious bias in academics is an important topic that should be addressed. My only comment for consideration to address is for the authors to somehow make clearer the relationships they describe in their "episodes". I found it difficult to keep track of the various relationships. Perhaps there is a way to do the pictorially.
