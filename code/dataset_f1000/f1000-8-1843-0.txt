Here are my comments to the authors of 'A case series analysing patients with dental anxiety: a patient-centred model based on psychological profiling [version 1; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]': If this study is an original research/research article, then what is the null hypothesis of the study? If it is a review, the authors should better enhance the discussion and strongly support it with literature conducting dental anxiety, MDAS, sedation, etc. The examples given in the study (one in each type) are not enough to make a review! The introduction and discussion parts are too short. The authors should better use valid scales or questionnaires to avoid subjectivity. The dental history of the patient mostly affects the current state/mood on the day or even before the day of dental appointment regardless of operation type. The grammar is poor. The aim and methodology of the study should be revised and planned in detail.
