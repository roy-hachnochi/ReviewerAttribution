 Summary The article titled Relationship between postpartum depression and lactation status at a Japanese perinatal center: A cross-sectional study focused on obstetric records of 809 nulliparous healthy women with vaginal singleton delivery at 37-41 weeks’ gestation between July 2018 and June. The study is relevant, as it set to highlight the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding and its relationship to maternal mental status. Although the present study did not find an association between exclusive breastfeeding and the development of postpartum depression. Report A. Title The title for this study is appropriate although I think it should be reversed so that the outcome variable should be at the latter: Relationship between lactation status and postpartum depression at a Japanese perinatal center: A cross-sectional study. B. Results it is very difficult to follow on the reading with the results without Tables. The authors should insert result tables for easy reading and comparison. C. Discussion I am not sure what the authors mean by “ The current results seemed to be unpredictable for us“ in the first paragraph. “The influence of synthetic oxytocin on a new mother’s well-being has been also reported previously” should read, “The influence of synthetic oxytocin on a new mother’s well-being has also been reported previously.” “The mental status of mothers considered to have low….associate with incomplete breastfeeding seemed to be stable” should read, “The mental status of mothers considered to have low levels of oxytocin associated with incomplete breastfeeding seemed to be stable.” “A further larger study is needed to clarify these factors.” Should read, “A further larger study is needed to clarify these other factors.
