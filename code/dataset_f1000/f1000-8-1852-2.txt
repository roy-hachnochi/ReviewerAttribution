The authors addressed most of my comments and concerns, but I am still not sure that it is appropriate not to present references that studied academic degrees and authorship. While there is no overview of the practices in different journals, there is certainly research in individual journals. In biomedicine see here 1 - 4 . These studies justify the need for a comparison study and they also show that there can be valuable information if academic degrees are published in a journal article. I suggest to address these points. References 1. Haws B, Khechen B, Movassaghi K, Yom K, et al.: Authorship Trends in Spine Publications From 2000 to 2015.
