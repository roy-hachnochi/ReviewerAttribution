 CT is not the first choice for breast cancer . It should provide ultrasound, X-ray and MRI imaging data. Breast cancer patients without axillary lymph node metastasis, but found a large number of mediastinal swollen lymph nodes, such cases are very rare.First of all, we need to analyze the relationship between breast tumor and mediastinal enlarged lymph node. If two different diseases are considered, breast cancer is considered as breast cancer, while mediastinal enlarged lymph nodes can be metastatic lymph nodes, sarcoidosis or lymphoma.If breast and mediastinum are considered as the same disease, lymphoma should be considered first. The case report has not been discussed in detail in terms of examination method, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and has limited value in clinical guidance.
