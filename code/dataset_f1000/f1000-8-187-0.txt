My specific comments to further strengthen the manuscript are shown below. Abstract Section: Case presentation subsection: Line 5, the word ‘inciting’ can be replaced by a more suitable word. Conclusions subsection: Line 1, ‘adverse effect’ may be a more appropriate term that ‘side effect’. Key words: More key words can be added. Key words can be arranged alphabetically. Page 2, column 1, Case report section, paragraph 1, Line 9: Do the authors mean emergency instead of emergent? The quality of written English is generally good but corrections may be required in a few places. I agree with the other reviewer that the authors can carry out a causality, severity and preventability assessment of the adverse drug reaction. Also, information about the medicines used preoperatively and during anesthesia will be helpful as suggested by the other reviewer. Does the institution have a functioning pharmacovigilance center? Was the adverse drug reaction reported to the center?
