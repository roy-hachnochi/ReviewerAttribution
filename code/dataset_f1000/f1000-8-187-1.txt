 General comments: It is a timely report representing an important area of clinical practice and hence deserves indexing. Specific comments: Authors must mention these points in the case report section: Whether this patient had a history of liver problems in the recent past? Any previous history of allergy to any other drugs? Was there use of potentially hepatotoxic general anaesthetic agent? Is he taking any other medications at the time of admission? Is the patient an alcoholic? Any other predisposing factors that could have potentially caused/augmented this adverse drug reaction? Causality assessment: It will be nice for the authors to perform a ‘Causality assessment’ and grade the Causal relationship between the drug and the event. I recommend using Naranjo scale. Severity assessment: The severity assessment gives an opportunity for the authors to categorize the adverse drug reaction based on its severity. Authors could sue the ‘Hartwig Scale’ for this purpose. In ‘Case report’ Section, …remote village in Biratnagar, Nepal. (add ‘Nepal’) ‘Discussion section’ should emphasize on the management pattern patient (in relation to the adverse drug reactions) highlighting any supportive treatment provided in this patient. This could be even mentioned partly under the ‘Case report’ section.
