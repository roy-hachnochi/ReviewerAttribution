This is a descriptive cross-sectional study evaluating urine cytology in patients referee to the outpatient clinic. The authors analyzed the data according to age, gender, and underlying medical disease. Below comments should be considered and answered: In the method it is mentioned that 2 cytopathologists examined the smears, is there any disagreement between them especially in atypical, suspicious and positive cases? If present, what is your approach? Figure 1A is not representative of HPV. It must be changed with the proper one. In 2nd paragraph of "Discussion", the authors said: 'In this study, we observed that urine cytology could easily differentiate benign from malignant cells showing high specificity for detecting HGUC'. To determine specificity we have to compare the results with pathologic examination. If there is a cytology-pathology correlation in this study, it is better to mention in "method and result" sections with proper tables.
