This is a useful tool to examine publicly available gene transcript data. The paper would be more useful if it included more detailed instructions for its use, perhaps including screenshots to illustrate the text. The location of the PubMed link of each sample wasn’t immediately obvious to this reader. I now realise it is accessed by clicking a part of the PubMed.gov icon. The meaning of the term “ranking” becomes apparent with use but it would not be burdensome to more experienced readers to have it defined or explained. The acronym for induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) should be defined with first use. The sample set “Whole Blood Transcriptional Modules generated on Illumina Hu-6 V2 Beadchips. GSE29536” is listed with the disease category “Immunodeficiencies” but the data presented appears to include none from immunodeficiency settings. I see transcripts from infections, SLE, diabetes, Still’s disease. I can’t get more detail of the study because the PubMed link is wrong. The link provided is https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24069364 which is actually the link for other listed samples ( GSE51404 and GSE51405 ). I haven’t verified all links in the table. If improvements such as those above were addressed I believe the paper would be very useful to those conducting immunological research.
