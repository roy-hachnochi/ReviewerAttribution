The article titled, ‘Knowledge and practices about breastfeeding in rural areas of Rajshahi District, Bangladesh’: A cross sectional study, examines the knowledge and practices regarding exclusive breastfeeding among mothers with at least one child aged 6-12 months. I have the following comments: The authors’ claim that this is the first study of its sort, is unjustified. Several studies have been carried by researchers independently and also based on data obtained during Bangladesh health and demographic survey. There are factual errors, e.g. 91% of mothers breastfeeding their babies up to 2 years, is an overestimation. What is a ‘village hospital’? Why did the authors use lists used in EPI – why wasn’t household survey carried out? How were mothers with ‘psychological disorders’ ruled out? The participants were interviewed during ‘routine check-ups’ in their homes. This is not clear. What constituted routine check-up? Does under 30 years constitute middle age? Why was this age taken as cut-off point? Why was income Tk 6999/ used as a cut-off point? The authors do not explain why service holders were less knowledgeable than housewives regarding EBF, and why women who delivered in hospital were less likely to practice EBF than ‘their counterpart’. Discussion is very thin. Conclusions: Malnutrition is not solely dependent on poor EBF practices as the authors claim. Poor weaning also contributes to malnutrition.
