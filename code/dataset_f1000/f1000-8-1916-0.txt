 Methods: Selection of study subjects: Unclear how participants were selected for focus groups e.g. one per household? Were participants related, which would increase similarities? Data collection: Unclear what, if any, information was gathered per participants or was all the data obtained through the focus groups? Results: Qualitative risk assessment: Unclear in the text what data were from the study and which were from the articles in Table 2. Discussion: Did not see where differences in the demographics of the focus groups (sex, age) which could influence the results were discussed.
