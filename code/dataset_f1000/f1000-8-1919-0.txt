This brief research reports a cost-benefit analysis of egg production in three communities of Ecuador. The element of cost-benefit analysis is clearly articulated in the study that shows the potential of the egg production Ecuador and one would want to see further analysis of the challenges in egg poultry production. Egg quality, zoometric measurements, and producer survey data are presented are collected although the zoometric data is completely missing in the results and discussion section. In general, it is not clear why the study was carried out. What the problem was? Correct terminology should be used. The introduction is too short and doesn`t cover variables that are going to be studied. The sample size of 29 eggs is not a good representative of the 3 communities? How many hens are in total in these communities? Justify your sample sizes. Areas of improvement: The purpose and background of the study should be clearly articulated. The author should include subsections on the results to improve structure. A clear structure of the data collected is presented nicely in Table two and this should be maintained in presenting the results. The zoometric measurements and tables of descriptive data of the three communities should be included in the results. Further discussion of the egg quality and zoometric measurements is required. More comparison of the results to other studies is highly warranted in the discussion.
