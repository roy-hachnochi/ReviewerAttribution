 The main structure of the research and main data are according and relevant, with all references, and showed the new findings effect on mix biofilm formations. As an addition if possible, in table 1, the effect of CC against individual bacterial biofilm can be added as a reference or control. As a suggestion, in the discussion, it would be better to explain the bioactive compounds of Melaleuca cajuputi reported in other published papers. In this way, we can predict the active constituents of M. cajuputi that show an effect to biofilm formation.
