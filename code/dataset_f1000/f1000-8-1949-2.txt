The study was aimed at providing information on the type and short-term effects of contextually relevant interventions that can be scaled up to change societal attitudes towards accelerating the decline of early marriages in rural Gambia. Overall, the study design was appropriate with robust data collection and interpretation. The data were adequately interpreted and discussed. The authors should however reduce the length of the background in the abstract and include more findings in the result section. The manuscript is recommended for indexing, subject to the minor revision.
