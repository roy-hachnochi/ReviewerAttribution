The manuscript “Dental stem cells in tooth repair: A systematic review” is a review by Tadros et al. on a very timely topic, tooth regeneration. However, this paper does not read like a review but rather as a catalogue of papers. This review requires conceptual work towards synthesizing the great findings in the field. For example, many notable, recent papers are excluded from this review. In addition, the following comments need to be addressed. Provide citations for every statement (e.g. “Loss of tooth pulp stops the development of permanent root teeth that can weaken the periodontal connection and lead to teeth loss” Page 3, Paragraph 2.) Spelling and grammar review. Multiple incidences of unclear sentences (e.g. “Although the great tendency for dentine-pulp complex regeneration, SCAP and SHED were rarely administered.” Page 10, Paragraph 5) or incorrect word used (“SHEDs, which rare derived from extracted deciduous teeth” Page 10, Paragraph 1). Develop appropriate tool to assess the quality of included studies and risk of bias such as that described in Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. How titles and abstracts were “deemed relevant” to the research question. Why were studies excluded/removed? What databases/sources were used? What search terms were used? Studies included: Reviews are not listed though there are reviews included. Humans are not listed in populations studied though human studies are cited (e.g. “All included experiments utilizing DPSCs were isolated from human healthy pulp tissues…” Page 4, Paragraph 3). Why there was insufficient data for meta-analysis. Meaning of “usually orthodontics” Page 4, Paragraph 3. Does this mean teeth were extracted due to orthodontic treatment plans? “Fresh bio-root” and “success” when discussing PDLSCs and “potential pulp” on Page 4, Paragraph 4 and 5. TERM approach. “Scarce factors” and “excellent outcomes” discussed on Page 10, Paragraph 5.
