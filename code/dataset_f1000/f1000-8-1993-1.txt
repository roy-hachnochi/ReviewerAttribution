A commecial PCR method to detect M.genitalium was used in this study and a prevalence of 8% was found in female sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya. The manuscript is well written. It is of interest to perform such studies in many countries and cities globally to follow and understand the epidemiology of this STI. Of that reason the study can be accepted for indexing as it is. What is not studied is the antibiotic sensitivity of M.genitalium . In coming studies this has to be performed.
