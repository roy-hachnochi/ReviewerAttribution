This systematic review of maternal and newborn care-seeking practices adds important information regarding maternal and newborn care seeking patterns and associated barriers. With its methodology clear and sound, results provide important findings to support future health program design in service provision for mothers and newborn. One important aspect not clearly addressed, in the results and discussion section, is related to the difference or lack of thereof between maternal and newborn care-seeking pathway. There seems to be published evidence on this subject, which seems to lead on the different care-seeking pathways, with consequences in future program design. Authors, may want to include a special issue on this theme published at the Journal of Health, Population and nutrition in December of 2017. The conclusion, seems to be rather short and not conclusive enough for relevant findings. It leaves out important common factors such as the need to include community/user context for strategy/intervention design, for example.
