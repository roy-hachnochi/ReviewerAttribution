The present article is a systematic review of qualitative and observational research studies on care seeking for maternal and newborn illness in low and middle income countries. There has been a knowledge gap in synthesizing studies to understand barriers and facilitators in the context of the Three Delay Model and pathways of care seeking. The literature search has been conducted in a robust manner. The authors could expand a little more on 'narrative synthesis' of the findings in the context of qualitative and observational studies. The authors have included literature search up to September 2017. A special issue of the Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition (December 2017), focuses on illness recognition and care seeking pathways of maternal and newborn illness in seven countries. The authors might like to update the search to include more recent articles. The authors have synthesized the findings of the studies, combining maternal and newborn illness. They may want to present the care seeking pathways for maternal and newborn illness independently to explore the effect of the timing of the onset of illness (during pregnancy, childbirth or post childbirth for maternal illness, for instance) on care seeking behavior. This will also allow the authors to explore how the different perceptions of the causes of illness- supernatural or medical - often influence care seeking pathways. Overall, this is a very relevant work that can add to the body of knowledge in the context of maternal and newborn health.
