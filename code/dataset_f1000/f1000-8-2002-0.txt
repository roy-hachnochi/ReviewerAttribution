I have prepared a PDF file with most of the points I think need to be addressed in order to make this case acceptable for indexing - please find the file here . For the second case we have really no proof, even a single photo, showing that brodalumab led to improvement of HS. Both Psoriasis and HS need to be assessed using both descriptive terms but also objective and validated scoring systems, to quantify the improvement. Moreover, the improvement of HS under certolizumab pegol is not clear for me, since I cannot tell that inflammatory lesions (nodules, abscesses or sinus tracts) have decreased after therapy. Since I believe that this case report can add to the current literature, opening ways for more anti-inflammatory treatments for HS, I think that updating the documentation accordingly and providing some proof for the improvement of HS will make the manuscript acceptable for indexing.
