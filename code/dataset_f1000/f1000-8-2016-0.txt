 Comments: Once the MSCs are being isolated from the adipose tissue, the following details can be added: a. The passage number or doubling time of the MSCs. b. Time period of storage of the cells and the stability time of these cryopreserved cells. c. Any in vitro studies potency assay done for this indication for use of Adipose tissue-derived MSCs. d. Was Karyotyping analysis done as it is not mentioned in the text? e. Please mention the values of HLA DR during the release of the cells, if done. All the patients enrolled in the study were labeled as Rutherford III - 5. As per the definition Rutherford III - 5 is defined as "Minor tissue lossâ€”nonhealing ulcer, focal gangrene with diffuse pedal ischemia". But patient numbers 001 and 003 do not have ulcers at baseline. Please reconsider the grade of these patients. Was ABPI, ankle pressure or TcPO2 measured in these patients as they are very important indirect findings of increased oxygenation of tissues. Case number 002, the hands were also involved. Whether any injections of MSCs were given in the upper limbs also. In the discussion section more can be discussed on the advantage of CT anigiography on MRA or DSA as CT angiography was done in the three patients. No new data is coming out from this small study of three patients as it is now a well-known fact that stem cells improved angiogenesis in these patients.
