This case report on fondaprinux in a pregnant woman with LMWH allergy does not lead to new insights into the knowledge of heparin allergy or fondaparinux. Important references about the occurrence of type IV (?) allergy to LMWH and how to deal with this, have not been referenced (for instance, Schindewolf, Lancet) It is therefore surprising that the authors immediately chose to use fondaparinux and not other types of LMWH. The authors imply causal inference between use of anticoagulants and the successful pregnancy outcome, which cannot be made on a single case. Reference to guidelines regarding the use of LMWH to improve outcome in IUFD is missing.
