The paper titled "Effect of olive oil administration on the level of transforming growth factor β1 during orthodontic tooth movement in old and young guinea pigs " showed that TGF-β1 levels in the younger age guinea pigs were higher than the older age, and olive oil could increase TGF-β1 levels in the older age guinea pigs. Here are a few questions: At first, several references of publications should be added in Discussion. For example, “TGF-β1 can recruit osteoblasts precursors in the area of bone formation and stimulate osteoblasts to differentiate to produce bone matrix” and “During bone formation, TGF-β1 inhibits the recruitment of osteoclast precursor cells and directly inhibitsosteoclast activity in bone resorption.” And please check full of the manuscript. In this paper, the number of guinea pigs used in the current experiments is 12. I want to know how did you calculate the required number size and why? In addition, as the animals in Olive oil treatment groups were treated with olive oil, were the animals in the control group treated with mock oil? Finally, please add more details about methods including Isolation of the GCF and Orthodontic installation in order for peers to reproduce your research.
