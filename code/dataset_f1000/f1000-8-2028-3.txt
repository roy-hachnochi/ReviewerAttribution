This title of manuscript has described the main question that addressed by this study. It is relevant and interesting topic in related to relapse of orthodontic treatment. It is necessary to have a scientific background that can show the common thread between previous researches and requirement of adequate orthodontic treatment (including relevant references for previous work and time citation) to understand the motivation and context of research by explaining the experimental approaches and reasons. Such as: The reason of using olive oil as sample is not too clear to prove why the authors using olive oil as sample to increase TGF-B expression in crevicular fluid, and the amount of crevicular fluid that is taken should be explained more detail. Even though the text is clear and easy to be read, this manuscript may require more adequate well-written English and alert to citations. Be careful in citation writing and bibliography. Then, I suggest to re-consider few references in introduction and discussion. Then explaining any steps taken to minimise the effects of subjective bias when allocating animals to treatment and describe who was blinded and when assessing results in this study. “ Some researchers show that TGF-β can stimulate osteoclast apoptosis in the area. The effect of TGF-β pro apoptosis is mediated by several factors such as osteoblasts and stromal cells under TGF-β1 control 5 .” I recommend adding other references. Then I also recommend to re-consider the year of references and add some references in discussion. Finally, we recommend to revise this manuscript.
