This manuscript is a protocol and therefore this review affects that. The authors plan to implement a combined ML based patient parameter monitoring / alert system and human advisory system to aid in decision support. Operating rooms are individually randomised by day to the intervention or simply monitoring of the physiological parameters ("control" group). This will take place in a large University Hospital system in the USA. Outcomes assessed include: thirty-day postoperative mortality, postoperative delirium, postoperative respiratory failure and postoperative acute kidney injury. The manuscript is well written and will be a fascinating study if and when they complete it.
