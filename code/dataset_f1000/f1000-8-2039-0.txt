The paper is well written and can help the clinician to perform a better diagnosis and treatment plans in such cases. The case series seems to be well-executed and respected the scientific evidence in the literature. The abstract was concise and explained well the purpose and results obtained in the case series. It can be suggested the use of more recent references (2015-2019). In the 5th paragraph of the discussion, the authors discussed the instrumentation methods, comparing manual x rotary. It could be useful to discuss more about different points of view. In the 7th paragraph of the discussion, the authors discussed new methods such as revascularization and surgical therapy. Why revascularization not used in this case? And in which cases is the traditional conservative management not preferred? This information could help the clinicians to perform better treatment planning.
