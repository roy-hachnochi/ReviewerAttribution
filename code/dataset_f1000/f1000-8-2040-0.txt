The authors of "Study of interaction energies between residues of the active site of Hsp90 and geldanamycin analogues using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods" describe the implementation of the methodology QSAR to explain the biological activity of geldanamycin analogues. Overall, the design of the calculus is good, and the results are of reasonable quality. There are several points that the authors should address before indexing in F1000Research: The authors must clearly explain the contribution to the state of the art of this study. Apparently, the QSAR methodology doesnâ€™t have new information, if there is something new in it, this should be highlighted in the summary and conclusion. It is possible that the novelty of the study is the explanation of how the geldanamycin analogues interact with Hsp90. Please emphasize this. The authors generate models with 43 of 48 analogues that were reported in reference 21. The other 5 are not used because they do not report their IC 50 value. Why is the activity of these 5 not predicted? Figures 7, 9 11-16: the y-axes have no units (EI?). Apparently, the authors do not indicate the method of DFT used for the calculations of reactivity descriptors. The direct application of this study is the use of models to predict or propose new molecules with more activity. As a recommendation, the authors should propose other molecules of this type that present greater activity. It would be more interesting to study for those who are working on the synthesis of these molecules.
