The Authors performed the scoping review clarifying the ways of obtaining and analyzing data on operational tolerance in liver transplant recipients, both adults and children. The aim of this comprehensive review is to identify prognostic factors, clinical parameters and biomarkers, for spontaneous operational tolerance after complete immunosuppression withdrawal. This is extremely interesting topic from scientific point of view but even more then that it has high relevance from patient’s perspective, especially children for whom lifetime immunosuppression is significant burden. Nevertheless, this task requires high quality data, clear inclusion criteria and cautious interpretation. Do the Authors plan to pool adult and pediatric data together or review it separately? Interpolation of adult data for children should be avoided. Eliminating autoimmune or viral etiologies may cause selection bias – what was the rationale for this criterion? If manuscripts with unknown etiology or less then 20% of autoimmune/viral are eligible for the study, this criterion should be more clarified or maybe just simplified. I’d be cautious in adding conference abstracts, or maybe the Authors should exclude abstracts older then 2-3 years which were not published so far or direct contact with the Authors of conference abstracts should be considered for data clarification and update. In terms of study aims/objectives: Success rate of ISW: how the Authors plan to define the outcomes, regarded different efficacy endpoints among the studies (minimum period of follow-up without rejection, protocol liver biopsy)?
