The manuscript entitled: "Epidemiology of viral hepatitis B and C in Punjab, Pakistan: a multicenter cross-sectional study, 2017-18" was aimed to assess the prevalence of HBV and HCV infections in individuals who visited the Hepatitis Prevention and Treatment Clinics (HPTCs) in Punjab, Pakistan. The authors also performed a multivariate analysis to analyze potential risk factors. The study was conducted on a large sample size of 141,705 individuals. After reviewing the above manuscript in detail, I consider the manuscript well-written, and the arguments are developed in an orderly manner. Still, there are some concerns about this paper to be addressed. In the "Statistical analysis" section, the authors claimed that variables with a significance level of 0.25 were maintained in the final logistic model, but all variables are included in tables 2,3, and 4. Please explain whether all variables in all tables have a significance level of 0.25. In addition to multivariate analysis, please include the univariate logistic regression model results in tables 2,3, and 4. In the result section, part: "Seroprevalence of HBV, HCV and co-infection" line 1, it seems figure 1 was not appropriately cited in the text. In the discussion section, the authors try to compare their results that using samples from hospitals with hepatitis disorders (current manuscript), with the data from Akhtar et al. (ref 25) that estimates the prevalence of HCV and HBV infection in transgender males. Any comparison between these two groups, because of using different sampling population is not valid. In the discussion section, part: "Epidemiology of hepatitis risk factors": for probable reasons for elevating trend of HCV seroprevalence with an increase in age, the authors should consider that about 70% of people infected with HCV will develop chronic HCV infection. So, they may remain seropositive for several years.
