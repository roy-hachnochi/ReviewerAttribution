The manuscript by Snchez-Cruz et al. describes the cheminformatic analysis of the updated BIOFACQUIM database consisting of 531 Mexican natural products. Despite its relatively small size, the results supported the potential of using BIOFACQUIM as a good source for virtual screening in drug discovery. Generally, the study was well designed, and the paper was well-written. However, since stereochemistry plays a significant role in the interactions between small molecules and protein targets, I suggest the authors should add the analysis of the fraction of sp 3 -hydridized atoms for the new BIOFACQUIM version and compare that value with those of other databases to assess its 3D unique. Can authors detail the “eight indexed journals” which was referred in the “Methods - Databases and data curation”? All in all, I feel this manuscript is suitable for indexing.
