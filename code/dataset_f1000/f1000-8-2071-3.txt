Snchez-Cruz et al. report on the diversity of an extended version of BIOFACQUIM, a database of natural products extracted from organisms endemic to Mexico. The overall scientific approach is sound. The only technical issue that I believe requires attention is tautomerism, which appears to have been neglected. Consideration of tautomerism will unlikely change the outcomes and conclusions of the statistical analysis but for the functional group analysis it will be important to understand whether the five new functional groups from BIOFACQUIM presented in Figure 2 are indeed unique to that source. Could the authors please use InChI, MolVS or a similar notation/approach for standardizing the molecular (sub-) structures and conduct a tautomer-invariant identification of functional groups? Language issues are apparent throughout the manuscript and careful proofreading will be required. Some (parts of) statements are unclear, e.g. "it was reported an initial scaffold content" "the articles should have described the procedure" "decided to augment the number of Mexican institutions" "A similar procedure can be done using RDKit" Minor comment: Could the authors please clarify in the manuscript the sources of the natural products included in BIOFACQUIM (e.g. plants, bacteria, fungi)?
