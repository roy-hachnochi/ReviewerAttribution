The article aims to evaluate the prevalence rate of intestinal parasites in H. pylori positive patients in a specific state in Sudan. Major revision : The introduction needs to be more updated (ex. Haque (2007) and Nyantekyi et al., (2010) instead of (Smyth, 1990), both articles associated with helminthic infections in developing countries. In the method of stool examination part, I prefer to make also examination with acid-fast stain (AF), in case of diarrhea or immunodeficiency to detect coccidian parasites. In data analysis part, if there are any data about socio-demographic characteristics such as (residency in rural or urban areas, animal contact, and water source) and clinical symptoms such as (diarrhea, vomiting and fever) were collected, I prefer to analyze its association with the infection as estimated risk factors (multivariate logistic regression, 95% CI and OR). The current study associated with the " developing countries" especially Sudan, while the discussion is focused on studies conducted a specific country “Turkey”, which mainly not considered as a developing country. I prefer to compare the present study with other studies in Egypt (10.1007/s12639-018-1075-y 1 ), Iran (10.5812/pedinfect.15294 2 ) and Ethiopia (10.1186/s13104-018-3246-4 3 ). These countries more suitable for that topic.
