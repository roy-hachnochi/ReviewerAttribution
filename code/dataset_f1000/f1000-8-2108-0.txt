AHPND is one of the important threats for the shrimp aquaculture industry to be prevented worldwide. The authors succeeded to have the complete genome of a Vibrio parahaemolyticus strain MVP1 isolated from a Malaysian aquaculture farm. The study is so important but studies on AHPND should be moved to studies on population dynamics based on complete genomes. Nanopore and Illumina hybrid assemblies are available commercially. The cost-effective methodology can achieve dozens of strains to be sequenced completely. The current manuscript is likely to trace such published known reports. In this aspect, the manuscript is unlikely to be technically sound.
