In this manuscripts, authors used Mendelian randomization to determine the role of circulating sphingomyelin in breast cancer. Although the manuscript is worth indexing, the following issues should be addressed. The introduction needs more explanation about breast cancer, the possible role of sphingomyelin, and MR for the general readers of the journal. How the second and third MR assumptions (which they mentioned in the manuscript) were met? As the authors said, the sphingomyelin is affected by estrogen signaling. Why did authors not do the subgroup analysis and not investigated the MR assumption in the ER-positive vs. negative patients? It seems the result may be significant in the ER-positive group. This analysis is necessary. A similar publication in the same data set ( 10.2217/bmt-2020-0002 1 ) is available. Please explain the novelty or differences of the recent manuscript with the mentioned paper? Why is it not in the references? The authors should provide a table containing a summary of the statistical data. Mentioned the selected SNP, allele frequency, hazard radio, p values, etc. Survival analysis should be included. A table of demographic data and clinicopathologic characteristics of patients should be included. It seems more data should be included in regards to sensitivity analysis and power estimate. I am not an expert in this field, and another person should revise this part. The authors should mention the previous studies related to sphingomyelin and breast cancer in the discussion. The body of the manuscript needs some English polishing. The text should be more fluent to read.
