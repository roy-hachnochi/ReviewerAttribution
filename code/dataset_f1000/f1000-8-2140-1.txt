In my opinion, this is a well-written paper. Although the study is descriptive in nature, it provides relevant evidence about a recent public health topic in the Colombian literature. In this regard, I recommend the authors provide some potential areas of research that need to be addressed to extend evidence on this relevant area. For instance, based on the descriptive findings, some hypothesis could be proposed. In addition, I suggest to review some minor aspects: Check the order of the education category in table 1 (completed high school has to be the last category). It is clear there are few comparable studies on this topic. However, it could be relevant to see if, for example, for out of pocket payments it is possible to compare with reports from rural areas in Colombia. Undoubtedly, perceptions play a key role in explaining and influencing how people relate to health providers. I am wondering, why in this study authors recognize the role of theory and models as the Health Belief Model, but they decided to use a more general model to guide the conceptualization of the study. It does not invalidate the study but could be interesting to see if models that address specifically perception can lead to similar to different results. Finally, I suggest trying to reduce the extension of some paragraphs and the discussion section itself.
