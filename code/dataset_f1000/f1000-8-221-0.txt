This protocol describes methods for the conduct of a living systematic review focused on the methods for living systematic reviews. The objectives of the study will be to assess the methods of conduct and reporting of living systematic reviews and to describe changes over time to living systematic review methods and findings. The research will include a cross-sectional survey of the methods and findings of living systematic reviews that will be updated every six months to include newly published living systematic reviews. The research will also analyze the changes over time in the methods and results used in the included living systematic reviews. The study will make an important contribution. When new methods such as those for living systematic reviews are introduced in the literature, researchers wanting to use the method may have difficulty accessing articles and guidance. A living systematic review that documents methods for these types of systematic reviews gives researchers access to the most current applications of this method. These methods are also developing rapidly in the literature and living systematic reviews serve to keep the field aware of how researchers are applying the methods. As described in the protocol, living systematic reviews are more likely to use emerging technologies in the field such as machine learning-assisted methods. A living systematic review demonstrating the use of these emerging technologies is another potential contribution of the research. The study methods are appropriate and use best practice standards for systematic review. The protocol does not provide a sense of the number of these reviews that are currently being conducted so it is not clear how large a review will result from this research. Sufficient details are provided to allow replication by other researchers.
