The topic of this protocol is interesting and important. LSR is an emerging method and this study will contribute to enhance its methodology and publication process. Major remarks The background could be developed in order to describe more precisely the issues, methodological difficulties, funding and publication of the LSR. When the first one was published? How many are currently published, are they published in scientific journals? For these last questions it is one of the aims of the study but authors should have an idea at least in the Cochrane library. In the discussion, other goals could be described such as contributing to an extension of PRISMA for LSR, providing information to contribute to build another editorial and publication process for living SR? Build collaboration with teams identified to collectively share tools, skills or enhanced methodology? Minor remarks The author stated "a librarian experienced in systematic review methodology". Could they provide his/her name and affiliation. The authors stated in Abstract "We will also contact groups conducting LSRs to identify eligible studies that we might have missed" and in Methods: "Lastly, we will contact groups conducting LSRs to identify eligible that we might have missed". Indeed, In SR methodology it is normal to contact experts in the field and authors to obtain additional studies potentially missed. But in this setting is it relevant? The authors stated "Then, we will update the cross-sectional surveys at regular time intervals (e.g., 6 months) by including LSRs published since the previous update (the ‘LMS updates’)". Does this mean that you have not decided yet the frequency of your updates? Could you discuss that considering the methods and tools used if you are focused on RCT Living SR? Will this protocol be registered in Prospero as well? Could you explain why you chose to use AMSTAR rather than ROBIS? Could you explain how do you plan to published updates each 6 months?
