 Incidence of the thermal transition in the range of 45-5C in chromatophores present in the wings of Schistocerca Americana The manuscript presented by Caizares and co-authors reports the effect of temperature (radiant heat) in wing chromatophores of S. americana . There are other publications about this topic, and the present manuscript is in accordance of reported results. However, the manuscript requires addressing of different issues to be accepted. The suggestions are the following: Introduction: The citations 11-12 could have a peer review source. The description of the natural environment of S. americana is missing. This information will enrich the description of the hypothesis of the manuscript. Material and methods: The description of house-keeping is not clear. The range of temperatures is between 45-5˚C however there is a gap between 25-5˚C. There is no statement about how the temperature was controlled. There is no statement of how long the S. Americana was kept at certain conditions. Results and discussion: It’s true that “Temperature, precipitation and solar radiation are the meteorological elements that most affect the distribution, rate of growth, reproduction, migration and adaptation of insects” as stated in paragraph 3 lines 1-3. However, are the authors sure that they can mention this in a very short time of exposure in their experiment? The last paragraph about the negative correlation requires more discussion; as it is the most interesting part of the paper.
