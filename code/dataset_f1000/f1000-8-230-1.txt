This manuscript describes a new protein disorder prediction web server that makes use of (shallow) convolutional neural networks. There are already many disorder predictors, some of which are based upon deep convolutional neural network and can do prediction directly on amino acid sequence instead of sequence profile. This manuscript does not have sufficient results to justify why one more web server for disorder prediction is needed. Here are some concerns: Please compare with existing, similar methods. It is better to test the method on more recent CASP datasets and make sure that there is no redundancy between training and test data. Ideally, a much larger test set shall be used to evaluate the method. AUC may not be a good metric for disorder prediction since the ratio of disordered residues is quite small. Precision and Recall may be better. Existing work shall be cited.
