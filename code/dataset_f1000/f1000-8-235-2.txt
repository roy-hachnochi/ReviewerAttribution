The scientific names in the manuscript need to be reviewed. The author use incorrectly the terms prevalence and incidence as synonyms. Incidence is defined as the presence of new cases of an illness over a period of time. The manuscript does not correspond to an incidence study. I would like to see more information in the manuscript about the design to consider the results as prevalence. I have not found details about the representativeness of the sampling (sample size to get a prevalence) or if they were obtained randomly. If the method does not satisfy the requirement to be considered as prevalence, I recommend replacing the term prevalence by frequency, presence or proportion. The confidence interval in one case was incorrectly estimated. "Feces from backyard layers showed the presence of Salmonella in 2 of 21 samples (10%, 95%CI: 0â€“22)" This values have to be calculated based on binomial distribution. Actually in the manuscript, the confidence interval was estimated based on normal or t distribution and 0 was included as lower interval.
