 What was your grade 1 liquid smoke composition? I think the biggest gap of your work is the lack of any characterization method for liquid smoke. According to which reference you have chosen the TVBN method? As far as I know, "TVBN" is correct, not "TVB". What is the compositional difference between 340C and 380C smoke? Figure numbers are inaccurately typed in the text - where is Figure 3? TVBN data reported in the text are equal for 2 temperatures. How long did you soak treatments in liquid smoke? Where is the total count assay in the method and materials section? You should have control samples in all exams, I couldn't see anything like this. If you have done the antibacterial test by discs, why didn't you explain it in method and materials? Also, the reported results in Table 6 are not acceptable (you should report inhibition percent data). There isnâ€™t any statistical comparison in your work, and I think a big mistake like this is not acceptable.
