This article describes the resources used to teach students about the Gene Ontology and one of the many functional analysis tools that are available. As someone who provides Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and teaches MSc students about bioinformatics resources, I found this article very interesting. I am surprised that high school students were engaged and understood sufficient biology to appreciate the application of GO and DAVID. An aspect not apparently covered by this course is the source of the annotations included in these resources. Biocuration is a poorly appreciated aspect of annotation resources, the majority of scientists have no idea how the data from scientific papers is being summarised and incorporated into annotation files. This is an ongoing process and it would be useful to discuss this as well, for example the similarity of the GO resource with Wikipedia (which also includes GO annotations). Also to point out that the annotation files are not static but updated on a monthly basis. My final question is whether the authors considered using any other tool? DAVID does not regularly update the annotations used in the analysis (last updated in 2016) and it is difficult to see how the same genes are enriched with similar terms. DAVID also has a complicated system of GO FAT etc, which requires the user to understand the ontology structure. But this does help to limit view of the GO terms retrieved. However, the figures only seem to show the list of GO (and other) terms associated with each gene. A figure showing the enriched terms for the full list would be useful.
