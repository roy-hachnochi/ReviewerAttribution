The authors have provided some data in a table to show that the students liked the database method and felt that it was helpful in their learning. I feel that the authors need to dig more deeply into the data, though, to explain this to readers. The results and conclusions sections were very short, and did not explain the data in enough detail. As an educator or someone wanting to follow this new method, I would want more data to show that it does work and why/how it is working. Since the results are qualitative, more work with the data is needed to show that the qualitative data actually shows the reader that this method works (i.e. coding of open ended survey responses).
