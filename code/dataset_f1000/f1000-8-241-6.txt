This article is aimed at describing an easily searchable database that can be used by students to search by gene ontologies. The point of the article is to provide a guide to use this tool in education at the high school level, but the article could provide a good starting point for college level instructors and even industry trainers. The article describes the underlying question well and chooses a gene, RAB5A, whose function should be readily understood by most biologists. The submitted article is timely because the DAVID tool described is not very intuitive. Thus, an easy to follow guide such as the article provides is most welcome. Notably, database tools are becoming more elaborate, and their complexity has created a barrier for effectively use in teaching, particularly at lower levels. The article does a good job of describing this tool, DAVID, in a fashion that will be intelligible to high school and college level students. Lavish illustrations are provided as are links to videos to aid in instruction. The use of Entry Ticket and Exit Ticket questions is an excellent pedagogical idea. The questions, however, seem a bit simplistic. A bigger problem with the article is that there are no data showing how using the DAVID tool in teaching has produced changes in measurable ways. Do students do better on tests of content knowledge? Are students more sophisticated in their thinking as a function of using the DAVID tool? Are they better able to navigate other genomic tools? Do they simply enjoy the lessons more than with traditional instruction? Many of these questions can be answered with a simple pre- and posttest quiz or even comparing current scores on tests/evaluations to historical scores. This addition would make this article of much more value to educators who could then see if incorporating this tool into their pedagogy is worthwhile.
