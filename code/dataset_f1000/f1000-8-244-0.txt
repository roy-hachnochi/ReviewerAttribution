This manuscript details application of nano silver incorporation into a self-etch dental adhesive system. The antibacterial efficacy of the adhesive system was tested, in vitro . Even though the experimental approach seems to be fine, the experimental design and technical details appear to be poor. This manuscript requires additional details and clarification as detailed below: Comments: What is the source of nanosilver powder? If silver nitrate is used, then the calculation needs to be based on elemental Ag. If AgNPs are insoluble, then how can you get solution? It may form an emulsion or suspended particles only. What is the wave length (λ) of LED? Table 1: Silver Nitrate powder is not nano silver. The valency of nano silver is ‘zero’. If you have nano-silver powder, why are you reducing it again by sodium borohydride? The authors should provide an additional representative figure showing the zone of inhibition (ZOI), in addition to table 2. Delete fig. 1. The authors need to check the silver nitrate ions as additional control in the agar – antimicrobial assay. If the adhesive solidifies along with nano-silver, then how does it diffuse in agar medium? What happens beyond 6.25g/ml concentration of silver nano? What is the rationale to consider 10 mm ZOI as cut-off? It is appropriate to establish the IC 50 value for the nano metal. Recommendation: the manuscript is not acceptable in the present form.
