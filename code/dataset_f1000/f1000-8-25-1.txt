The study "aimed to compare the accuracy of linear measurements conducted using a low dose CBCT protocol in comparison with direct skull linear measurements". I have seious doubts if "CBCT protocol operated at 90 kVp, 7.1 mA, for 9 sec" is really low dose CBCT. The authors cite Hidalgo et al. 13 that used 80 kV and 3 mA and Vasconcelos et al. 14 that used 2, 4, 6.3, 8, 10, 12, 15 mA and 60 kV, 10.8 seconds. Another problem, it was that the skulls not were placed in a polystyrene box filled with water before the CBCT examination to simulate soft tissue attenuation. This situation would cause more artifacts on the tomographic images. So, the conclusion is not fully real.
