The attempt to associate paired-box gene 9 ( PAX9 ) mutation to tooth impaction in patients was interesting and the decision to target on the occurrence of maxillary canine impaction was logical and appropriate. The study design was clearly outlined, well described and detailed. Data obtained was adequate, which enabled derivation of meaningful outcomes. The authors were able to demonstrate that the presence of SNPs 3 and 4 is actually associated with the increased likelihood of suffering from maxillary canine impaction. This finding definitely adds valuable information to the current knowledge. In general, this is a nicely written manuscript. The flow of ideas and thoughts of the authors throughout the manuscript were effectively presented, focused and of high quality.
