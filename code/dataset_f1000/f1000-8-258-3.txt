This is an interesting study design investigating the role of the ileum and its microbiota in the processing of dietary fibers on 3 different diet, a low fiber diet and 2 high fiber diets, one with intact cellular structures and the other one with disrupted cell structures. This study gives a real time perspective how the ileum content changes in response to different diets and is therefore unique. The hypothesis may be formulated a little bit sharper, the idea is that minimal processed fiber may lead to a higher fermentation in the colon with a more beneficial metabolic profile, how exactly is this question answered since fermentation and SCFA production is not directly measured in the colon? Would an increased fermentation in the ileum also be beneficial? How much time does the sampling of the ileum take? Is also the total microbial content determined in ileal and fecal samples, expressed per what? What is the period between the visits i.e. the washout period? The in vitro approach may be an interesting addition. Sampling takes place at baseline and at 24 h, why are these time points chosen and is more frequent sampling a possibility? Looking at the effect of whole diets in the 'in vitro' system, diets are first freeze dried, to what extent are the cellular structures maintained in this procedure and to what extent are the outcomes still relevant for the in vivo conditions? Overall, a challenging and interesting study protocol.
