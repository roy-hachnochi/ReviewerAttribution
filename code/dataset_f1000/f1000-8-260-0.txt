In this study, the authors have attempted to use a very small cohort of patients with dengue infections (43 patients) to describe some aspects regarding their fluid requirements and management. Some of the groups analysed in Table 2 had only 2 patients. This would introduce a high level of bias and it would not be possible to make reliable conclusions using such small numbers. The authors should combine their data with that of a clinical group managing a bigger number of dengue patients and this may then allow them to arrive at more reliable conclusions. It would not be appropriate for day 1 to be considered from 8.00am on the following day after admission. Important information on fluid requirements from the point of admission to this arbitrarily defined time would thus be missed.
