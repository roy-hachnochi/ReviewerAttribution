In version 2 of their paper, the authors thoroughly and comprehensively addressed my minor points from version 1. I appreciate the effort the authors did to improve the reproducibility of their work thanks to the R session information and their vignette provided in response to another reviewer 1 . Given this, I'm happy to approve their article for indexing. My only minor comment is that it would have been ideal to mention in the amendments from Version 1 that featureCounts and kallisto were removed from Figure 3. This change initially confused me, given my version 1 comment on the color issue between `featurecounts_flat` and `salmon`. I have checked that this change in Figure 3 does not affect the rest of the main text. Anyhow, for other readers: this change in Figure 3 was requested by one of the reviewers and the authors complied in their response 2 . References 1.
