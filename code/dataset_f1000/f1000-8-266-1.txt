 The article is generally well done with respect to its method and purpose. My major concern is its purpose: assuming adequate methods, statistical analyses and result, what is the significance? If there are implications of the research or significance of the conclusions, they should be clearly stated. The article is dependent upon the accuracy and scope of the Scopus database. I wonder how that was chosen and whether Pub Med might have been consulted as well. The accuracy of the conclusions is no better than the comprehensiveness of Scorpus. Are articles that appear in print but are archived online included? Otherwise the study seems to have been conducted well (methodologically) and the results competently reported.
