This study by Tran et al ., is important, but preliminary report that shows colloidal silver to be effective against three Streptococcus species. Following are some of the concerns I have regarding this manuscript. The authors state that “the Ag-gel should be tested for the ability to block plaque formation in the mouth, through its use as a toothpaste”. Let’s consider the following: (a) Oral microbiome is very rich and its composition is important for health status of an individual and (b) Literature says colloidal silver is toxic to the host cells. Considering (a) and (b), using the Ag-gel as a toothpaste may not be a good idea as it is not specific towards the pathogens. Thus, I recommend the authors to measure the cost-benefit ratio and mention about the conditions or stages of oral disease at which it could possibly be used as a toothpaste. Why only one concentration of 0.5g of colloidal silver used for the studies? Please provide the details for the figures in the legends, like (i) what is the sample size, (ii) what do the error bars indicate, and (iii) which statistical test was performed on the data. I fail to understand the biological relevance of negative data of CFU in Fig. 1. What happens to biofilm formation at lower concentrations of silver? As the previous reviewers commented, eradication of biofilms should also be tested. Therefore, this manuscript should accompany the Minimum Biofilm Inhibitory Concentration (MBIC) and Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentration (MBEC) of colloidal silver. Determination of interaction of colloidal silver with antibiotics is also an important test that has to be performed.
