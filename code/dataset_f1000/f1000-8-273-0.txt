The research in this article describes the use of zebrafish Tol-2 Kit transposase-system with Gateway constructs to express wild type and mutant form of the human PTDSS1 gene in zebra fish. The authors attempt correctly to generate a model Lenz-Majewski Syndrome previously shown to be caused by mutations in PTDSS1 gene. The article is very well written and clear on the methods. The design of the constructs are well explained and correct, but the transgenic fish did not exhibit the predicted phenotypes. This is mainly due to the lack of expression of the transgene generated although integration of the transgene was achieved. The authors clearly explain several possibilities which could account for the lack of phenotype mainly as part of generating the transgenic fish. Although the results yield inconclusive results on the role of PTDSS1 in the Lenz-Majewski Syndrome in fish, I recommend the indexing of this article. I think that the lack of publications on technical challenges encountered in production of such transgenic lines will be useful for the zebra fish transgenic community that may encounter this type of difficulties in performing such studies. Minor comments: The Tol2-Kit is a transposon-mediated whilst the authors refer to it as a transpose-mediated (abstract and thereafter). Transposon-mediated would be more accurate way to refer to this system. Figure 4 needs to be improved to make it easy to read for the none expert. Authors could add arrows to indicate the exact morphological abnormalities observed. Figure 4C: Which is the genotype of the transgenic fish, are both transgenics? I think the authors could improve the figure by adding more annotations and a clearer table of genotypes will help the general readability
