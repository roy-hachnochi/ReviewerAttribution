The study aimed to assess the knowledge of genetics in a selected population of students from both public and private institutions. The work is described in sufficient detail (regarding the samples size, study design and statistical analysis). The authors acknowledge the study limitations. Although similar studies have been performed in other countries, this is the first study assessing genetic knowledge in Ecuador. The result of the study could be proved useful for policy makers and educational programs.
