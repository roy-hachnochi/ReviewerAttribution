 The article contains 12 month results of a randomized clinical trial in partial crowns using two different dental ceramics. The title does match the content of the publication. The keywords are appropriate. The introduction is very short. The paper is linguistically sufficiently written and structured. Sample size calculation is insufficient, calculating for surface roughness, a parameter not reported and potentially secondary aim at best. This caused a severe miscalculation in number of patients needed to answer the scientific question, reflected by insignificant p-values in the results. According to material and methods each participant receives 2 crowns, one of ZLS and one LiS. When 14 participants are included this should result in 28 crowns, not 46. This difference should be explained and is probably due to more than one pair of partial crowns in each participant. The time frame of 12 months follow-up is much too short to find differences in respect that known clinical survival within 5 years is up 98 percent. A report about the distribution of included restorations in premolars and molars is missing. With the current number of participants the scientific value is low.
