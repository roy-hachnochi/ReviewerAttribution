The title, objective, and abstract donâ€™t say that the analysis is limited to stage I up to IIA diseases. If you find the NLR and PLR are not homogeneous to stage III of the disease, it is better to stratify analysis and clearly show the difference in survival according to the stage, or clearly state why you chose stages I - IIA in your study. In the first paragraph of the result, is the proportion of exclusion from the analysis too big? Please give the reasons why you excluded them. I think you walked through steps of case selection, and many cases probably were not in your inclusion criteria, but you counted in 1167 files. Am I right that you recruited the cohort and measured all the predictors in the past? And then you followed them up for 36 months and saw the results at the end of the follow up when the event occurred or at the end of the follow-up time.
