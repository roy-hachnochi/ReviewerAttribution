 Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature? Yes, the current work is accurately presented including the recent literature. Authors have discussed about the recent updates and potential application of Astragalin. The role of C-C motif chemokine ligand 28 (CCL28) has been cited explaining the recruitment of leukocytes and other proinflammatory factors at the site of joint inflammation and arthritis. Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound? Yes, authors have designed in silico study properly and focused on computational evaluation of astragalin as inhibitor of CCL28 for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others? Yes, the detail has been provided to replicate the steps of study. The quality valuation of CCL28 was estimated and Molecular Operating Environment software was used for binding affinity analysis. Along with astragalin, naproxen was used as standard drug. If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? Not applicable Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility? Yes, the source data underlying the results are available. Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results? Yes, the conclusion is supported by the results revealing that astragalin could have potential to serve as inhibitor of CCL28 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Binding energy of astragalin with its target is -5.40 kcal/mol is very low in comparison to standard naproxen which has -4.87 kcal/mol binding energy. Docking results proved that astragalin can act as potential inhibitor for CCL28 enzyme. However, some minor comments are recommended. Add some pharmacological aspects of astragalin in "Introduction" section. Better to combine Figure 5 and 6. Improve the resolution of the figures. Proof reading is required.
