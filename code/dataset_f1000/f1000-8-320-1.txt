Overall, the manuscript was well written and contains all relevant information in accordance with its scope. Probably, it would be better if Table 3 is being presented in a figure form (e.g. Venn diagram), showing overlapping regions of genes between species. A linkage map (e.g using zebrafish as reference genome) and gene synteny analyses would be another interesting aspect that can be included. It would be more interesting if the genome of male and female of this species can be compared and analysed, since the fish is known as protandrous hermaphrodite.
