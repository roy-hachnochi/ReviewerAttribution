 The abstract needs to have a clear result of the metal elements instead of using 'a lot'. Introduction: I would suggest the authors add some description or mechanism of plants producing energy or electricity. This is optional. The method is fine. Results: the author analyses the nutrient concentration in the leaves. How about the stem and roots? Is there any specific reason to not include the nutrient concentrations in the stem and roots? How about the biomass of each plant part? The conclusion is fine.
