I think this version is better than the previous one, but I still think the connection to sidA could be made stronger and the relevance of the focus on that gene and this subgroup also. Any conserved gene could be a target for drug. So is this gene more interesting than others in that group, the question should be more precise from the beginning. The focus on some nonsynymous mutations is interesting, but if these mutations are neutral there is not much interest in showing a detailed structure. A precise Ka/Ks study should be done to tell if these few non synonymous are more than expected.
