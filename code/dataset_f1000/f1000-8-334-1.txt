I found this article to be fascinating and elucidating but also a bit frustrating to read. The central claim of the article is that one can construct a family of distributions such that Zipf's law and species abundance are the endpoints of a more general process. For that result to be interesting, the result has to be for a general process and not for a family of distributions. The latter is easy. I just say, "here is a family of distributions, f(x) = x^{-a}” and then say that at one endpoint a=1 I have a species area law and at the other endpoint a=2, I get Zipf's law. The contribution of the article lies in convincing us that the paper has done something other than an elaborate change of variables that simply restates that result through obfuscation. So what does the paper do? The paper shows that if we restrict attention to probability patterns (by the way, it would be nice if "pattern" were formally defined) that are invariant to affine transformations then we have a specific form given by equation (3). Given the form in equation (3), the author then claims that n represents pattern and r represents process. This needs to be elucidated. For the main result, once we have invariance to affine transformation we get the differential equation with dT_z/dw = \alpha + \beta T_z From here, why doesn't it just follow that if \beta = 0, we have something that's going to fall off with a common invariant scale and for \beta = 1 the invariant scale changes with n. The conclusion of the paper needs to be expanded. As a reader, I need a richer explanation for how the approach "reveals the simple invariant structure" of common probability distributions. In the conclusion, we should be given more intuition for how the holding the average abundance constant drives the results. Also, it would be nice to have more insight into what would cause a system to have more or fewer proportional processes acting on it. Quibble: Why isn't r a function of tau—the period of time?
