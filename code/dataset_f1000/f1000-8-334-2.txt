 The manuscript addresses the relationship between two probability distributions that, although originated in specific research domains, have gone on to be widely used as representations of growth processes. The mathematical derivations are clear. The conclusion that "two great and seemingly unconnected puzzles solve very simply in terms of a single continuum between alternative invariances. This approach reveals the simple invariant structure of many common probability patterns." clearly follows from the exposition and is a useful contribution. The usefulness and scope of the conclusion would be strengthened if the author considered another distribution which arises often in the explorations of growth processes: the log normal. It would also strengthen the usefulness of the manuscript if the author were to expand on "this approach reveals the simple invariant structure of many common probability patterns.", in particular recapitulating what is the invariant structure. Having connected two widely used distributions, what sort of research questions can now be addressed? How can the invariant structure linking two distributions be used in contexts other than Zipf's law or species distributions?
