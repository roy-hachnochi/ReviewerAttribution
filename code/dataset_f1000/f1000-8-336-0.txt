An interesting case of a 'paradoxical' reaction to a biologic agent, secukinumab, which is used to treat psoriatic disease. In this case, acrodermatitis of Hallopeau developed in this patient being treated successfully with secukinumab for psoriatic arthritis. It is important to report these rare events as we build our knowledge of real-world experience of the use of biologic agents in psoriatic disease. However, this is not the first report of this type of reaction to secukinumab in the literature. Sladden et al . 1 reported a similar reaction of fingertip and nail psoriatic disease (ACH-like) after treatment of plaque psoriasis with secukinumab. The similarity in the presentation of these cases is quite interesting and should be noted. Similar to the story of 'paradoxical' psoriasis/psoriasiform eruption with TNF antagonists, as we use more IL-17 inhibitors in the real world, we can better categorize these unexpected eruptions and further research can help to determine the underlying pathophysiological relationship.
