The paper by Smith et al, looks at the interactions between influenza virus and ciliated epithelial cells. Specifically, they compare infection and cytokine production after PR8/34 is delivered by immersion or aerosol. Overall, the article is well written and data is presented clearly. The infection via aerosol developed herein is a highly useful method and could be employed by other researchers in a variety of different contexts, including trying to better understand influenza virus transmission. Overall, I just have two minor points: The authors use PR8/34 in this study and describe it as a ‘human influenza virus’. Whilst originally this was a human influenza virus strain, it has since been passaged over 100 times in mice and is more accurately described as ‘mouse adapted influenza’. Can the authors explain the choice of virus? It would be fantastic to see some of these data repeated with a real human influenza virus strain. At a bare minimum, it should be acknowledged that PR8/34 is a suboptiminal virus strain to use for studies with human cells. The authors state that “the total number of infectious influenza virus particles produced by the nebuliser was 2x109 PFU indicating an approximate 5-fold loss in viral viability” yet in the discussion they state that “the infectious nature of the virus was not altered by aerosolisation”. Can the authors please clarify? I would hypothesise that the process of aerosolisation resulted in more non-infectious virus particle which, in turn, stimulated a differential pro-inflammatory response in the ciliated epithelial cells. Can the authors please comment?
