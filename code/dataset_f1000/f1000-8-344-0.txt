 General Comments Paediatric TB includes children between ages 0-14, not above them. You must clear this point. In the previous version the reviewer asked about from how many children at that hospital who had TB. These 50 cases were selected and how many cases were excluded for the different exclusion reasons? This has not been addressed at all in the revised manuscript. Specific comments In introduction, first paragraph first line; figures and facts of 2014 are mentioned. Update them according to latest reports. Introduction first paragraph, last line; add updated reference. In Discussion, first paragraph, second last line it is written that “the incidence of rifampin resistance is rising”. Rifampicin resistance MTB, are not always MDR TB cases, make it clear whether you are talking about rifampicin mono-resistance or MDR-TB? In Discussion section, second paragraph, line number 5; 1467 household contacts were screened not 1463. 1463 contacts were those who are not on TB treatment. In the same line, 378 children were under the range of 0-14 years according to cited study, not ranging from 0-15. In the very next line, it is written that “Of these, 11 children were symptomatic for TB, were tested”, but according to the cited study, only 9 out of 11 children were screened for MDR-TB. In discussion, second paragraph last sentence; you have compared your study with the paper entitled “Resistance patterns, prevalence, and predictors of fluoroquinolones resistance in multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients”. The authors in the above mentioned study didn’t specifically report the paediatric TB cases. In fact, more than 70% of cases in above mentioned study were adults, so, it is not a good idea to compare your study with the aforesaid study.
