This paper describes that the pollen tube content is sufficient to partially initiate seed coat without fertilization in Arabidopsis. This work appears the extension and further clarification of the previously published work (Kasahara et al., Science Advances 2016 1 , and Roszak and Kohler, PNAS, 2011 2 ). During plant fertilization, many cellular processes are happening, and it is important to integrate the identified phenomena together for comprehensive understanding of plant sexual reproduction. The authors studied the relationships among FRS, POEM, seed coat initiation, and endosperm development, and I think the work reported in this paper is an important piece of information in sexual plant reproduction. I have a few suggestions: The first paragraph of the introduction, the author stated that "gametophytes" fuse. I believe the authors mean "gametes". From the authors previous work in Science Advances, 2016 1 ), it is clear that PTC initiates seed coat development (transcriptionally and anatomically). It is important to state these details in the introduction to remind the readers. Along with this, please describe what vanillin staining detects (proanthocyanidin accumulation) and why this can be used for seed coat visualization. In Roszak and Kohler, 2011 2 , the authors reported that not fis2 and mea , but fie and msi1 autonomously developing seeds differentiate seed coat, suggesting that fertilization is not required for seed coat initiation. The authors also described seed coat phenotypes in agl62 . Please refer this publication and highlight and/or discuss new findings/hypotheses in this paper, then this paper will be more impactful. As other reviewers suggested, Figure 1E is difficult to dissect information. I believe "vamiline" in the Y-axis label should be "vanillin".
