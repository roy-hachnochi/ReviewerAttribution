Thank you for asking me to review this manuscript. While this is an interesting topic the authors assumed that the prevalence of TB will be the same in PPM supported and Non-PPM supported district. That is why they compared them. This assumption may not hold. Factors like the presence of slums and socio-economic status of peoples may not be evenly distributed. In conducting this study, authors should have compared the Case notification rates in the PPM supported districts before and after the commencement of the PPM scheme. In that way, all potential bias will be corrected for. This is a major flaw for me in this manuscript
