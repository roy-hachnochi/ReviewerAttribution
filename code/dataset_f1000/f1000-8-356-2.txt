In this manuscript author obtained quite interesting experimental results according the conformational possibilities of DNA. However, in this work no other confirmations, except electrophoretic, are presented according the presented conformation of DNA. So, author should provide additional arguments obtained by atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, optical, in particular vibrational spectroscopy. Only after this submitted manuscript can be accepted for indexing.
