​​​​​​This is a concise draft with clear, specific aims and somewhat reasonable conclusions. The authors conducted an RCT to study the specific radiographic outcomes between the “enhanced conventional” and “computer assisted” TKAs. However, some points related to the article can be raised for discussion. These were described in the following: Two terminologies, “optimized conventional” and “enhanced conventional” methods, were stated inside the article. What was the difference? The “enhanced conventional method” was not clearly defined, please address it. The “Radio-opaque marker” method was used before and abandoned later. During the TKA procedures, the lower limb was frequently moved. The accuracy of femoral head center is uncertain, especially in the obese patients. The stability of marker locations were in question. That is why this method is not popular in current TKA practice. Was there any modification in current method comparing previous recants? “BMI” might have some influence on this “enhanced conventional method outcome, please discuss it. The use of fluoroscopy with potential radiation is another disadvantage with this method. The overall alignment of lower limbs. Including MA and FVA in the coronal plane are not the only factors which might affect the final ”functional outcomes”. The impact of this "enhanced conventional method” on future outcome is still unknown.
