The authors did come up with solutions for container technologies and have started to implement and/or mention these in the discussion of the article. However, the aforementioned comments that "A key advantage of this is that Python code can be used to link individual steps, as well as in processing tasks." is still not adjusted accordingly. That statement is unfortunately prone to misinterpretation, such as that users might think that this is something setting apart CGAT-core from other workflow management systems such as Snakemake or Nextflow (which is not true). The next statement mentioned in my review beforehand ("Thus, parameters can be set specifically for each dataset, without the need to modify the code, a feature seen in many other workflow management systems.") wasn't adjusted either - and here it's explicitly stated that this sets CGAT-core apart from other workflow management systems, which is not true either. Snakemake, Galaxy and Nextflow CAN import parameter / JSON / YAML files. Stating that this sets CGAT-core apart from others is incorrect unfortunately and should be adjusted.
