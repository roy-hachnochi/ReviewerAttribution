HFJV causes minor movement of liver tissue and is thus advantageous in liver ablation, compared to standard mechanical ventilation. This study shows that gas exchange can be maintained at a reasonable level for an hour-long anethesia/surgery. A successive fall in PaO2 was seen but in no patient was hypoxemia seen. Similarly, PaCO2 rose during the hour-long observation period, but not to any critical level. The authors found no correlation between fall in PaO2 and increase in PaCO2. Thus, hypoventilation was not the major or only cause of impaired oxygenation. FIO2 was in most patients 0.8, but in an open system, as here, the alveolar FO2 may be different and also vary between patients. The authors discuss a certain degree of auto-PEEP but have not been able to make measurements of it. Atelectasis may be reduced with increase in auto-PEEP, as inferred by the authors. One may speculate in varying distance between catheter tip and carina with effects on ventilation of each lung. Impairment in lung perfusion, possibly reflected by decrease in cardiac output, might be an additional cause of varying oxygenation. However, all these comments are speculations and need not be in a paper. On the whole, the study is well performed in a simple and straightforward way. Results are clear and show a reasonably maintained gas exchange under the studied conditions. My only minor criticism is that the ventilatory technique is mentioned in different parts of the paper and could be brought together in the Methods section.
