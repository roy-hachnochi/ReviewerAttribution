In this revision, the authors have performed additional analyses to address a few concerns as well as interesting questions raised from their original report. This new data, in my view, seriously corroborate their findings for a sex-dependent transcriptional control associated with APOE expression. The texts are also modified adequately to convey their points. Hence, I fully approve this revised article with no reservations.
