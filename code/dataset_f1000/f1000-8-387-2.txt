The article by Hsu et al. is an interesting and worthwhile article. My 3 problems with such articles are: Grouping genotypes as e4 positive or negative – the e4/4 group is as different from the e3/4 group as the e3/4 group is from the e3/3 group, and the e2/4 is very similar to e3/3 – so this is poor data analysis. There is an exponential increase of dementia/Alzheimer rate with age, doubling every 5 years, which is rarely taken into account. Since women live on the average 5 years longer than men, this totally ignored discrepancy can fully account for the male/female difference in Alzheimer incidence, and should definitely be discussed in such studies. Only precise age adjustments with an exponential term can be correctly interpreted. Most such data sets use 5-year cohorts, which is why this issue is wrongly considered. To really resolve Alzheimer’s disease, more precision of simple epidemiological data is needed. A major issue is Leptin, which has a level twice as high in women as men. Leptin is related to energy metabolism and learning, both important issues in AD. For yet another perspective, see Smith et al., 2019 1 .
