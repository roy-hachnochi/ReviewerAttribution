 The study population is enough but the control group is to small. Maybe a power is needed. In the abstract section the authors wrote "According to the results of receiver operating characteristic analysis, the diagnostic value of the urea parameter in determining the COPD + pneumonia group was not statistically significant (p0.05). ROC curves gives the sensitivity and specificity and cut off values not the difference between two variables. I think they mean the AUC value. So the article should be revised by an statistican specialist. There is no information about the study population whether they are outpatients or hospitalized patients. All the patient are CAP? Also in the eligibility criteria, I did not understand the meaning of: - Previously diagnosed with pneumonia, (did you mean: diagnosed with pneumonia?) - First diagnosed with COPD, (did you mean: new diagnosed COPD?) - Without a history of clinical intervention in patient epicrisis? The authors should explain what did they mean and clearly explain the including and excluding criteria. Are the all COPD patients are stable or in acute exacerbation? In table 1: authors give the descriptive values of study groups but the p values is absent. In the table 2 comparing the paired group there is no information about mean age, gender In table 2 when compared the paired groups, interestingly there is no difference between COPD group and COPD with pneumonia and pneumonia without COPD. How can you explain these results? The discussion section too small and it is similar with the result section. The authors should detail in the discussion section and discuss the results, not repeat the results I am not a native speaker but the article should revised for language. ​​​​​​As a result according to me: The article is not well written, well designed and well discussed. So it is not eligible for indexing without a major revision.
