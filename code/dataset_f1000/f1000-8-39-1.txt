The mean time taking care of HIV/AIDS patients was 6.61 + 4.96 years. In term of health status among the elderly participants, the majority did not have chronic diseases (61.4%), amongst those with chronic diseases (38.6%), hypertension and diabetes were the most common. The average quality of life score was at a fair level.

In order to improve quality of life among elderly caregivers to family member living with HIV/AIDS, time taking care of HIV/AIDS patients and health status should be focused on, amongst other factors.
