I have many concerns about this paper: When was this reef deployed, and was this close to the time of the first survey? What is the nature of the seabed? What is the distance to natural reefs? How does the survey transect relate to the artificial reefs? Tables 1 2 are unnecessary and could simply be summarised as a single species list ranked in order of total abundance over the whole study. The raw data could be given as a separate Dataset as with the “Raw water quality data for each survey”. Page 7: “Fish colonisation size” describes numbers, not the dimensions of the fish. Figure 2 is not particularly useful, better would be a larger version the Caesio teres photographs showing the fish in relation to the reef structure. Table 3: limit similarity to 3 significant figures. Table 6: shows very similar conditions throughout and could be summarised in a single sentence. The biggest issue, which makes the study of limited scientific value is the lack of any control data. This 1985 paper highlighted this issue (Bohnsack and Sutherland, 1985 1 ). Arguably, the control is the first survey and the study tracks the fish community development over the subsequent 3 surveys. I would expect a parallel study of seabed distant from the artificial structure to show the value of creating a reef. Equally direct comparisons with natural reefs in the area would be useful. The timescale of the whole study is very short; November 2016 to July 2017. I consider that the main value of this study is in describing the partial diurnal behaviours with the 3 set times 09:00, 13:00 and 17:00.
