 Little more clarification is needed in the radiological findings. How was a plan decided for partial in presence of haematoma? Was a serum creatinine repeated before taking the case for surgery? Initially it was 1.8 mg% and after 3 days of surgery it was normal. Better to write the value. What is the follow up schedule?
