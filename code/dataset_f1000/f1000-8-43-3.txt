This article intends to show that machine learning methods might be able to pick on subtle EEG activity and perform classification above chance level and show true EEG correlation at a distance. The article is well written and clear. I was able to download the data and reproduce the results of experiment 2. I am not sure about the first experiment as the processing script for that experiment seems to be missing. The data processing, machine learning and cross-validation scheme seemed straightforward and appropriate. It is still possible that by trying many machine learning approaches, one could obtain positive results just by chance. This should be mentioned in the discussion as a potential limitation. The most interesting result is that participants who are not exposed to stimuli nevertheless have a response to them that the classifier can pick up above chance expectations. One important caveat I have seen in the experimental design of experiment 2 is that the stimuli are not randomly intermixed. Instead there is a sequence of one stimulus type and then another one, etc. As subjects perform the experiment, their EEG changes (for example they might get tired as the experiment progresses which could affect their alpha brain waves). So one might have more alpha for one stimulus type simply because a given stimulus type is presented first. The classifier can then pick up on that. The sequence of stimuli should have been randomized for that reason. In other words, since stimuli of a given type are grouped, the classifier might simply pick up on the fact that some epochs belong to the beginning of the experiments, and some others belong to the end. If my assessment is correct, I would remove the second experiment from the manuscript. Once I get the processing script for the first experiment, I would be able to assess potential pitfalls. Abstract: the abstract should mention statistical results.
