The study is a genuine and ethical presentation of the practices in the Omdurman Maternity Hospital in Sudan and has proved the efficacy of the magnesium sulfate in the treatment of preeclampsia and eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate is a valuable therapy in the management and prevention of eclampsia 1 . But many parts of the world obstetricians continue to have reservations of using magnesium sulfate due to the fear of apparent toxicity. As the evidence is coming up and the experience of the use of the drug is increasing, magnesium sulfate is proving to be an effective therapy for seizure prevention and control with the added advantage of fetal neuroprotection and pain alleviation. The fear among the physicians is a result of inadequate knowledge, and infrastructure and lack of organization and this are beautifully depicted in a recent study in Brazil 2 ​​​​ . The current publication in Sudan has scientifically designed and conducted the study and has come up with valuable information on the magnesium level and the significant advantages of using magnesium sulfate. This study is important as the blood levels of magnesium have been studied and correlated. In practice actually, it is not essential to determine the blood levels of magnesium. Clinical signs if studied well and closely monitored are enough to ensure the correct delivery of the drug at the right dose. Also, it is important to keep the calcium gluconate 3 injection handy as an antidote to excessive levels of magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate especially is of benefit during labor management to prevent eclampsia 4 . I would also suggest the center to take up the universal and optimum delivery of magnesium sulfate as a quality improvement parameter and this would go a long way in reducing the perinatal adverse outcomes in the association of gestosis (preeclampsia).
