 Page 1: Abstract: In methods, the authors should add the study design, sampling technique and statistics used. Objectives should be: to determine patterns of pesticide use, health literacy, pesticide use behaviors, and the association between health literacy and pesticide use behaviors among sweet corn farmers in Pak Chong District, Thailand. The conclusion from the findings on HL should promote focusing on the significant factors to HL including cognitive skills. Page 3: Introduction: In paragraph 2, please show the statistics of the increasing pesticide use among Thai farmers to see the trend. As the authors mentioned about the effect of pesticide use to human health, please give an example of the screening results of the toxins prevalence in Thai farmer blood stream from a survey. Page 4: Methods: Statistics: Levels of health literacy can be explained by descriptive statistics. If the authors use the chi-square test, please check the assumption since there are some expected values, less than 5, greater than 20% of the cells in self efficacy management and functional literacy. The authors should use Fisher exact text or Pearson chi â€“square test instead for these two factors. Page 7-8: Results: Please check percentage in each variables in Table 4. For example, communicable skill, the total of percentage in low, moderate, and high levels must be 100.0% in total, not 99.9 or 100.1%. The results in Table 7, zero numbers in low level of self-management should be deleted for presentation or analysis if possible.
