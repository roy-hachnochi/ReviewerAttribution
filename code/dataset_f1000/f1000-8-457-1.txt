This paper by Wang has systemically reviewed cellular units of engrams, presumably associative memory cells. In addition to the history and research approach about engrams, author presents major features of associative memory cells at primary and secondary levels, as well as their impacts in psychology and pathology. The concepts about associative memory cells and their circuits are renewing our understanding to various patterns of learning and memory. This is one of the best reviews in the topic of memory traces, which I would like to approve its publication in F1000Research without delay. I have a few suggestions for the author to move forward in future study: Three diagrams assume neural circuits for associative memory cells to execute memory formation and retrieval, which are mainly based on the studies by author’s group in sensory modalities including somatosensory and olfactory cortices, as well as their downstream regions, the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In order to have these diagrams to be generalized truth, the author should also conduct his studies in other areas, such as the visual cortex and auditory cortex. Memories to visual images are mostly complicated in the integration of spatial and temporal information, in comparison with other modalities. Although the author has assumed potential processes for the integration and memory of visual images, I feel that the hypothesized diagram is not perfect and remains to be experimentally tested. The author should design experiments to examine how associative memory cells become dysfunctional under pathological conditions in relevance to memory deficits or amnesia, and are influenced by abnormal internal environments, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.
