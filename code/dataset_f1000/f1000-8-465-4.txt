The paper by Baum et al describes a method to construct biological networks from omics data using stochastic block models (SBMs). The application of SBM on mRNA, protein and metabolic data gives a new way of deriving information from correlation based biological networks. The proposed method could be a useful addition to network biology. To strengthen the manuscript, I would suggest the following points to be addressed: In the over representation analysis, while the statistics on distance of Reactome/KEGG terms shows the block generated here is significantly better than random. Is it possible to provide a such comparison between the clustering result by SBM and WGCNA? In the network reduction step, a linear relationship is expected between log-frequency and log-node-degree. While the scale-free fit index (R 2 ) will be 0.85 with WGCNA default requirement, how different threshold affect that linearity is not clear from Fig 1D. Also, how well can the network be reduced by significance of correlation fit to a scale free network? To demonstrate that SBM can provide biological insight, more detailed analysis on the benchmark data sets could be useful. For example, what are unique and common pathways for different breast cancer subtypes, how well are these findings consistent with existing knowledge? Figure 4 shows SBM based confidence score can be used to predict the existence of an edge. However, it is not clearly stated how the edges are determined as putatively missing or spurious. Also, the description for figure 4A is hard to understand.
