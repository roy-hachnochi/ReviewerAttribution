This is a useful review of a subject that, as the author says, deserves more attention than it gets. One of my concerns is that the abstract and opening sentences state that nocebo is a result of negative expectation, and yet, as mentioned later this is only one of a number of theories as to how the nocebo effect may be activated. Others include invalidation (mentioned briefly), conditioning (mentioned briefly) and activation of the fight or flight response (not mentioned at all). Another issue for me is the contexts in which nocebo can be an issue. This article mentions clinical trials, experimental settings such as pain perception, and clinical practice. I would find it easier to navigate the article if there was a clearer differentiation between these very different contexts, perhaps with subheadings. In relation to clinical practice, the article does not mention the fact that a consultation can make a patientâ€™s disease or symptoms worse as a result of nocebo mechanisms. In the context of clinical trials I think that more attention should be given to the fact that the consent procedure can make symptoms worse, as well as resulting in a reduced response or adverse events. I found the English a little clumsy in places.
