 The author wants to discuss cutaneous tuberculosis, but the case is not fitting in any spectrum of cutaneous tuberculosis. Irrelevant case history has been mentioned without diagnostic features of cutaneous tuberculosis. Histopathology of any lesions has not been mentioned. There is more description of cold abscess rather than cutaneous tuberculosis. Ideally culture for AFB is positive in hardly 5% cases of cutaneous tuberculosis. So what is the meaning of given title and conclusion? The case looks like extrapulmonary tuberculosis, rather than cutaneous tuberculosis. The morphology of cutaneous lesions is not fitting in description of cutaneous tuberculosis. So, with this title and description, this manuscript is not acceptable for indexing.
