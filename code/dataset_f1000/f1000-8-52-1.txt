For author response 1, the authors can perform the seqmental sequencing using several primers inside the full-sequence. For author response 2, the authors can find the homologus genes of NPR1 from other plant species, whose genomes were well-sequenced, like tomato, tobacco, even arabidopsis, and then get their distal promoter sequences based on the genome sequence. For author response 3, only the sequence from a susceptible variety is not enough to explain its biological functions. I suggest the authors to compare the sequences from several varieties with different disease resistance (even a little difference).
