This study reports the cloning and bioinformatic analysis of the putative promoter region of PD_CbNPR1 from chili pepper. This putative promoter region was isolated from a local chili pepper genotype (Berangkai) known to produce large yields but susceptible to viral infections. The putative promoter sequence of PD_CbNPR1 could be useful for enhancing the immune system of the Berangkai genotype. I have the following observations and comments: Indicate the Genbank accession number of the NPR1 sequence used to BLAST the chili pepper genome. Also, perform a phylogenetic analysis to determine whether the chili NPR1 sequence used to isolate PD_CbNPR1 belongs to the NPR1 clade (e.g., Arabidopsis has five NPR1 homologs: NPR2, NPR3, NPR4, NPR5 and NPR6. NPR1 and NPR2 form a single clade). Check the concept of homology. It is wrong to say "99% homology". The KOD-Plus-Neo kit is designed for long range PCR (up to 24 kb from human genomic DNA), so it is not clear why the amplification of the full-length putative promoter region (5950 bp single amplicon) was not possible. The search for putative cis-acting regulatory elements in the putative promoter of PD_CbNPR1 should also include other databases such as: a. PlantCare ( http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/ ) b. PlantPAN 3.0 ( http://plantpan.itps.ncku.edu.tw ) Figure 1: the length of the core promoter should be indicated along with the 5â€™UTR. The transcription start site should be provided as part of the characterization of the promoter region. A transient expression analysis using GUS as reporter gene would be useful to determine whether this putative promoter is functional.
