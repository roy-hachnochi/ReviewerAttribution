This is an interesting resource that can be of use for people dealing with comparative genomics in viruses. There are some points that need to be clarified before this paper can be indexed though. In order to ease reproducibility, the parameters used for the different programs (e.g. HMMER, SiLiX) of the pipeline should be provided. Why is it required to locally translate the Coding DNA Sequences (CDS) from the original RVDB nucleotide database instead of downloading them from the resource? I have a question for the taxonomic assignation to the Last Common Ancestor (LCA) when building the clusters. How are handled the possible contradictions within a cluster? More exactly, what is done exactly if sequences that belong to distantly related taxa are clustered together? If a strict LCA rule is applied, then it would be possible to have a really inprecise assignation (something like "virus" and that's it).
