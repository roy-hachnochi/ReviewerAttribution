1. Abstract: It is ok, but the result is focused only on knowledge. 2. Methodology: How was the sample size (101) calculated? On what basis? Since the population of this study is Nurses, you need to define it. Did the nurses selected in all three settings have similar experience and educational level? Brief description of the knowledge questionnaire must be mentioned. How it was interpreted? Need to mentioned the reliability of the tool. 3. Result: Socio-demographic profile is not highlighted. Add on this. Figure 1 there is no index. Its not understandable [Color code used]. If you have observed the Nurse’s task performance, nowhere its mentioned. It will be nice to include this aspect as your study is looking for practice gap. You can include like frequency of observation while caring the post-operative patients. Was it a participatory or non- participatory observation? How did you over-come the biases? Statistical analysis was extremely basic. Only descriptive analysis was used. You could have used inferential statistical analysis consulting the statistician. 4. Ethical consideration: How did you maintain the confidentiality and privacy of the nurses at the time of data collection? 5. In your title you’ve mentioned that there is a gap in Practice and also mentioned to find the gap. I see that your second objective is un-answered. Please include it.
