 Introduction: 1 st paragraph – Citation number can be provided once at the end of the paragraph instead of repeating it a number of times. Similar correction can be done in 6 th and 7 th paragraph. Methods: Is it a observational analytical or descriptive cross sectional study? I think the design adopted is descriptive cross sectional study. How did you do the scoring in percentage and average scoring (2.27, 2.45 2,54), please discuss about the scoring part in detail. Data acquisition: Is the data shown in the table? I think it’s better to write “frequency distribution is shown in the bar diagram and line graph." Results: Please write the sample size n = 101 in all the figures. Figure no. 2: No need to keep percentage in the 2 decimal like 120.00%, 100.00%, 80.00% etc. instead it can be written as 120%, 100%, 80%, etc. I think there is repetition of the same data in line graph (Figure 2) and bar diagram (Figure 5)…can keep only of one those.
