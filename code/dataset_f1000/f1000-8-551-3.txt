I have provided my comments directly in a PDF document because the manuscript pages are not numbered to facilitate the reviewer's work. My main comments are: The intent of the authors is good. They made a lot of effort to well describe the intervention and conduct pre- and post-intervention surveys. However: The design does not optimistic conclusions. I think the authors should be very modest and discuss some key limitations: the selection was not randomly done, there was no comparator to your study (cluster randomized trial). Also, the questionnaire was quantitative and you did not capture the qualitative aspect of the intervention (feasibility, acceptability, sustainability, etc). The introduction is long but the authors did not use the space to justify the study in Pakistan. Just saying that "there is insufficient information" is not the good justification. There are many typos in the text, I have flagged some but the text needs some corrections.
