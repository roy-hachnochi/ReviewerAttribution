 Title I would suggest a title that contain "heavy metal" term in it. Not everyone is familiar with the word metallothionein. e.g. "Determination of heavy metal contents of oysters ( Crassostrea cuculata and Crassostrea glomerata ) from the .....using metallothionein expression method" Abstract Background - ...MT level in both types of oyster (replace types with species). Conclusions - The sentence needs to be improved - Eg. The level of heavy metals ...has a strong relationship with MT... Introduction This section requires language editing. You also need to mention the purpose of comparing two different species of oysters in this study. Methods How many samples (n) altogether were used in the study? I cant find any information on this. The first line stated that three samples of oysters were used? Were these three groups of samples? Several typo/formatting issues here to be fixed. Results and Discussion Similarly, this section also requires language editing. You mentioned that your findings in soft tissue exhibit the same pattern with Bilgin et al. - PbHg??? Figure 2 shows PbCd ???? There is no discussion on the background of the sampling areas. Any particular differences among the three areas (Eg. industrial activities) that may influence the results? I suggest the "Water quality analysis" to be presented before other results and discussion. General The findings of the present study is considered very significant to the local community. I recommend this manuscript to be accepted for publication with minor corrections.
