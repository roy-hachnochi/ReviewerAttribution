This interesting manuscript describes the construction and optimization of the ‘NG Morbidostat’ for in vitro selection of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae . The NG Morbidostat would be valuable for real-time investigation of the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae . I have a few comments for the authors to consider. What is the rationale for selecting the two WHO strains used for the proof of concept experiment? Did the authors perform species confirmatory tests on the presumptive N. gonorrhoeae colonies cultured over the period of the experiment (30 days)? Please mention the media and QC strains used for Etest. I would recommend performing agar dilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing with a standard panel of antimicrobials to confirm that there was no cross-resistance to other antimicrobials. It has been described previously that high-level azithromycin resistance can develop rapidly in the laboratory in N. gonorrhoeae isolates with a single mutated 23S rRNA allele. 1 What are the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the two WHO strains? Could the presence of multiple resistance-conferring mutations, including a single-base-pair deletion within a 13-bp inverted-repeat sequence in the mtrR promoter of WHO X 2 have contributed to the higher azithromycin MICs obtained when compared to WHO F?
