Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. Overall the manuscript is sound but there are several grammatical errors and some sentences that do not make sense eg the reference to the National Guidelines. Additionally, there does not seem to be ethical approval. My understanding is that Mkushi District Health Office is the administrative body that falls under the Ministry of Health and manages the public health services in that area. Unless they have a special mandate, of which I am not aware, they are not authorized to provide Ethical Clearance as they are not considered a regulatory body. They are, however, required to give permission for research to occur in their facilities. Given that this study involves human subjects, I recommend getting retrospective ethics approval if not yet obtained or, if it has been obtained, including this in the manuscript from a recognised regulatory authority. Also, please include the total number of patients who were seen during the same period as the enrolment (ie the denominator), it is not clear what proportion of patients who were seen, enrolled in the study and had a specimen drawn. Please also check citations- the paragraph that starts with ... in Zambia (17-29) includes references that are regional but not necessarily in Zambia. Lastly, I suggest using STI instead of STD as it appears many of these infections were subclinical.
