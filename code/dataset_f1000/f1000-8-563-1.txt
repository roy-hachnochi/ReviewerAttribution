Overall, I think more time is needed to explain what you did and show the reader that a quality process has been undertaken. Some points below are critical for me. Abstract As a reader I am not sure how you integrated and weighted findings from different designs e.g., you mention two random trials in the results EPOC and FACETS – yet review evidence would include more accurate results and you have identified 13 reviews? Introduction Does the reader need to know about the different drugs for treatments of MS or the main point which is fatigue remains Not sure of the need for Figure – given the focus and aim of this work There is no overview of why a review or what type of review is needed within this section? Methods There is no protocol If you are using Cochrane then you would include systematic reviews in your synthesis – you would ideally aim to get a meta-analysis done of past empirical research. So the design is questionable. As your review is mixed methods review requiring aspects which are needed for mixed methods design including a decision around the point of integration of data. If you used Cochrane as a basis your key words would have likely increased and the number of databases and search methods would be different from what you state Your methods has no detail on synthesis as point in abstract is made Results Page 5 Think about the how you lay out the information – currently for me there is limited information which is hard to understand how and why you have presented it like this. Think about how you integrate the quality assessment onto findings Discussion Without clarity from above – I can't assess the discussion currently
