Drs Sekhon and Singh have presented an in-vitro study "Human aldose reductase unfolds through an intermediate" to F1000Research to be considered for indexing. Foremost, the authors should describe the newly described intermediate more with respect to its potential physiological relevance to stress the relevance of this study. Please remove "ultra" from any description for protein crystal structures, but add the actual resolution of that structure, 0.66 A from Ref. 5, and explain what additional features were derived from these, compared to average crystal structures. "Understanding the capability of a polypeptide..." - this sentence only has limited linkage to the sentence beforehand and should be deleted. Instead, novel concepts of protein folding and stability should be briefly covered. 1 , 2 Figure 1: A) it is not clear what the blue and red dots mean. B) Please do not use green and red as colors. Figure 2: A+B) Please label the different graphs within the diagrams. The manuscript needs careful copy-editing.
