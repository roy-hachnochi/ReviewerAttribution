 Was an interview for the informant to confirm participant data/information? Did you find participants who only speak Quechua or a dialect? If so did you translate the questionnaires? Differences between urban and rural areas? Need to discuss Peruvian research. Discussion must be done around community findings. You found no association between poor physical performance and disability. Explanations beside statistical results.
