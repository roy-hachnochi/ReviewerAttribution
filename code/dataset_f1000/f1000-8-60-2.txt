 The study is simple and is a good start for a more complex study with more in-depth analyses. The author should describe the ecological zones in more detail. What makes zones homogenous or heterogeneous (poverty, sexual relations, business activities, etc.)? Can you relate ecological zones with the geographical, economic, ethnic etc., situation in India? The author reports that States were classified as low and high risks previously; it would be important to show a correlation between his/her selected States and the previous high or low risk States. The author states that the study was controlling for two socioeconomic variables (education, and poverty), but never indicated in the results and discussions how the controls affected the results. Simple correlation analyses were conducted, but the author mentions “likelihood” in stating that there is a greater likelihood of having high HIV prevalence if men were uncircumcised or had multiple partners. Greater or lower likelihood cannot be used with simple correlation. We can only talk of a relationship, to report likelihood the author would have to do further statistical analyses such as logi/probit/tobit models, and chance ratio. The results in Tables 3 should be divided between high and lower States. What are the high and low risk States? The signs of the coefficients should be mentioned, what does a positive sign signify? Each table should be fully understandable on its own.
