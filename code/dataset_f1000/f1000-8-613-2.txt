In this study authors analyzed mutation patterns by next generation sequencing (NGS) in order to determine genomic changes in an anaplastic ependymoma. Authors identified one novel synonymous mutation and one deleterious missense mutation in this grade III ependymoma. Comments: In the clinical specimen section authors state “Specimens from all patients willing to give written informed consent and diagnosed with gliomas were eligible to be included in this study.” However, the specimen used in this study for NGS analysis was obtained from a single patient’s tumor tissue. What are the other samples and in what study they were used? Figure 2A: authors indicate yellow arrow showing palisading necrosis; is this the correct location? Authors conclude they identified four known missense mutations, eight synonymous and seven intronic, in this grade III ependymoma. How global these signature molecules in the context of grade III ependymoma? Can the authors add additional correlation analysis by analyzing TCGA or other bioinformatics based data? Authors indicate FLT3 (c.1776TC, synonymous) is novel, which is interesting; is this mutation reported in other cancer than ependymoma? What is the clinical and functional significance of this mutation in ependymoma progression?
