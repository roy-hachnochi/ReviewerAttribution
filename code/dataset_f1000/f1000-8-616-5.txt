 Suggestions: Abstract and Introduction: I think that the manuscript, in the Abstract and Introduction, needs to express rationales of this study in more detail, such as, why did the authors want to know the detection rate and distribution of oral Veillonella species in saliva of Japanese children? Why did the authors want to compare the results with those of Thai children? Figure 1 and Tables 1-3: I think that the data in Figure 1 and Tables 1-3 are overlapping, and Tables 1-3 could be deleted from the manuscript, because the authors mainly stated the total and the mean (proportions) of the isolates of Veillonella species in the Results and Discussion. Minor: The authors should check the meaning of the phrase "although": P. 7, Discussion: in the 6th paragraph L. 1-2: "although 179 strains were isolated members of the genus Veillonella from saliva of 15 Japanese children, …". P. 7, Discussion: in the 6th paragraph L. 6-7: "although in this study 1,609 Veillonella strains were isolated from 107 Thai children". P. 8, Discussion: in the 8th paragraph L. 7-8: "although 10 unknown Veillonella strains analysed in this study formed three clusters distinct from V. dispar , …". Typographical errors; P. 4, Results: Species identification L. 6: "numberof" should read "number of". (Put a space in between.) P. 7, Discussion: in the 5th paragraph L. 4: "conforms" should read "conformed".
