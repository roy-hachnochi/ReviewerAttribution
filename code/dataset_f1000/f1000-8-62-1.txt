The authors report a case of basal cell adenoma of the esophagus. The authors could focus on benign tumors of the esophagus, as well rare epithelial tumors. The authors could add information on the 2 other lesions observed. (Biopsied or not biopsied?) The standard microscopy feautures should be noted before the IHC features. What do the authors mean by “muscular epithelium”? Indicators (arrows) could be added to photos.
