I give the following suggestions on this manuscript: 1. The Results and Conclusion in the starting of this manuscript itself are confusing and not so clear. 2. Vibrio spp. and Saprolegnia spp. need NCBI accession number for authentication. 3. How did the authors determine the initial doses for these bacteria and fungi? 4. The Introduction is not elaborate and objectives are not specifically mentioned. 5. The English language needs to be improved, especially tenses. 6. The RPS formula itself is confusing. 7. “Mayor” or “Major”; “damaged” or “damage”? 8. Values should be with S.E or S.D. 9. Please refer to Ananda Raja et al. (2017 1 ).
