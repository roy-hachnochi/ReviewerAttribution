The article provided by Benson provides a clear conceptual description of the structural, functional and docking analysis and potential Schistosoma mansoni dihydroorotate dehydrogenase chemotherapeutic drugs. The work follows cheminformatic standards for drug development, and demonstrates the physical characteristics of the SchDHODHs, HsDHODHs and MmDHODHs identified as potential small molecule inhibitors of Schistosoma mansoni dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The rationale, testing, and work supporting the compounds is well described and clear to follow, and the rationale for searching for Schistosoma mansoni dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitors is well explained. The scope of the article is narrow, in that it focuses on lead cheminformatic validation, but it is relevant to several potential audiences and is rationally screened through those pipelines. Additional in vitro validation would raise the impact of these compounds, but may not be necessary to report them as a suitable candidate for follow-on work.
