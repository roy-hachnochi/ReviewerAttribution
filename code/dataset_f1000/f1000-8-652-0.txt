The authors presented a case report and a review of related literature about sigmoid colon schwannomas. This is a rare disease and an interesting subject. Although it is a beautifully written review in general, some corrections are required: The authors claimed segmenter resection is enough for sigmoid colon schwannoma but in their case report they prefer to anterior resection. it is necessary to explain this in the discussion section. The authors shared a photo of the specimen they resected in figure 3. This image resembles segmental resection rather than anterior resection.
