Overall this is a good case report and review of a rare tumor. There are a few small grammatical errors, but the paper is otherwise well organized and easy to follow. Minor suggestions: When referring to the size of the tumor, especially when giving dimensions that seem fairly exact ("4.5 x 4.0 cm") it is unnecessary to say "about", you can just state the size. Replace "Most of the" with "Most", as in "Most GI tract schwannomas" or "Most colon schwannomas" Figure 6: "proper muscle layer" should be "muscularis propria layer"
