This SWAT (Study within a Trial) is a useful addition to the literature on trials recruitment methodology, and is no less valuable for attempting to replicate a previously tested intervention. The methods are appropriately described and there are links to the intervention and comparator letters as well as to the underlying data. The numbers are small, but the results are reported appropriately and the small numbers are acknowledged in the discussion. Limitations are appropriately discussed and conclusions are appropriately cautious. Points for consideration: I would like to know who actually wrote the participant name on the letters and produced the mailout packs; in particular, it needs to be clear if they had any role in the SWAT or the main trial beyond generating the mailout packs? This would reassure readers that the analysis was masked and that the allocation of packs did not influence any other study processes. A statement about who was masked (analysis team, main study team) and who wasn’t masked would also be helpful. The choice of a 10% significance level is non-standard (but is not inappropriate given the small anticipated sample size) – please could the authors explain and justify this choice to readers though? Ref 16 in the reference list is a reference to this paper, but without the hyperlink to the supplementary data to which the in-text reference seems to apply. Could this be fixed please?
