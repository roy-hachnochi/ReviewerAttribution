This is a useful trial within a trial to explore different invitation methods. The report clearly describes what was done and presents clear conclusions. Comments: The intervention appears to be under-theorised as a behaviour change intervention. It might be useful to cross reference the behavioural insights approach (e.g. publications by Anna Sallis) as well as using the TIDIER checklist. In the analysis, the paper presents both a difference in proportions and an odds ratio, though the P value is not given for the former. The odds ratio appears to be considered the primary analysis, though the difference in proportions is more relevant. It is not clear that both analyses are needed. In the Discussion, where it reads 'and this difference was statistically significant at the 10% level.' The ASA guidelines suggest that bright lines such as 0.1 or 0.05 should not be used. This P value does not appear to provide evidence of any real effect. https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/P-ValueStatement.pdf May want to reference the Cowie study. 1
