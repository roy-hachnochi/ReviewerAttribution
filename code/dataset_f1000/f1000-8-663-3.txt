Thank you for the resubmitted report, which I have now read and find much improved. The inclusion of the flow diagram (Figure 1) is a great help. However, some additional points still need to be addressed: Minor: Page 3, line 4 of Results: please add "years" to the age being quoted. Page 5, line 2 of Figure 2 legend: please change "uV" to the appropriate abbreviation for "microvolts". Major: I think that Table 1 needs to be corrected. For example, if you consider the top 6 rows related to NCS and check the numbers against the data in Figure 1 there appears to be an inconsistency. For example, row 4 tells us the number of cases with NCS as dead/alive, and by duration 1m. Cross-checking with Figure 1 the sub-totals for cases with NCS should add-up to 52/202, and of the 52, 22 died and 30 were alive at 60 days (22+30 = 52), which is correct. There is a problem in row 1 (the cases not exhibiting NCS). The total here should be 150 (ie, 202 minus 52). Indeed, for mortality the dead/alive (40 + 110) adds-up to 150. However, in the 1m three-way split, the total (44 + 60 + 44) adds-up to 148, and so 2 cases are missing. Please recheck the numbers and percentages, and the statistical tests as described in the text to make sure that everything is correct. Again, Table 1, but now the bottom 6 rows related to RPPs. If you cross-check the numbers against the data in Figure 1 there appears to be some inconsistencies. For example, row 4 (row 10 in the Table) tells us the number of cases with RPPs as dead/alive, and by duration 1m. Cross-checking with Figure 1 the sub-total of cases with RPP should add-up to 104. however, in the dead/alive split we have 46 + 92 = 138 (so an extra 34 cases). In the 1m three-way split, the total (30 + 62 + 46) also adds-up 138 (again an extra 34 cases). I think, based on the data in Figure 1, the three-way split (1m) should in fact be 26+46+32=104. Then, the first row of this subsection (row7 in the Table) then needs to be adjusted, and the statistics rechecked. Thank you for the extra work in doing this - making sure that number are accurate and consistent is always a hard task.
