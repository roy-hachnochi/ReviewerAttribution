This article by Cherfils and Navaza provides an important path forward to model refinement in cryoEM, which deals with noisy data. The authors draw on rather rigorous methods of refinement and validation of coordinates in X-ray crystallography to propose the use of central section (or particles) in cryoEM as experimental data rather the reconstructed map. I would like to state that Michael Rossmann (Purdue University) would have been an appropriate reviewer for this paper as he was thinking on the same lines for the last few years. Unfortunately, Michael passed away recently. Nevertheless, this is a very interesting idea and provides a direction to incorporate true experimental data rather than depending on reconstructed maps, which could potentially have their own problems. While I support indexing, I have a strong recommendation for the authors: the word "model" often does not translate well between crystallography and cryoEM. It could refer to coordinates in crystallography but in cryoEM, it could be the actual map or in later stages, the model of the atomic coordinates. Could the authors please ensure that they clarify this in the paper? On similar lines, "cryo-EM refinement" becomes ambiguous because it could refer to the reconstruction process (i.e., refinement of centers, orientation angles, defocus etc) or it could indicate the refinement of atomic coordinates against the map (or images as in this case). It would be extremely helpful to the readers if the authors could ensure that such confusion does not arise.
