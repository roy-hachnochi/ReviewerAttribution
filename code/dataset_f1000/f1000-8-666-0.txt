The critizisms raised during the first Review process have been carefully addressed by the authors. Especially, the information on the maternal serum magnesium level has been added, and the milder hypomagnesemia in the two heterozygous siblings is discussed in more detail now. Also, the possibility of both, a transient phenomenon as well as a mutation-specific effect is discussed. Finally, the minor comments and suggestions have been implemented. From my point of view, the manuscript in its present form is suitable for publication!
