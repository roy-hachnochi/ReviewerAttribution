I find this manuscript interesting since it gives a new perspective on the literature. I would like to propose the following changes in order to improve the conclusions: Single papers on blood diseases - haemophilia and leukaemia - are not enough to draw conclusions from. Therefore, I would tend to disregard these papers both in the discussion and in the abstract. I am not so convinced in the existence of three distinguished time phases. I would prefer a two time phases division: before and after 1995.
