In the manuscript, Shahjaman et al. presents a new median control chart method for controlling outliers in RNA-Seq data. They applied this method on simulated data and also a real mouse dataset. In general, a useful bioinformatics method for outlier detection will be valuable for biomarker detection. However, in the present state of the manuscript the robust and efficiency of this method is not clear. There are a few concerns that should be considered to improve the manuscript. Outlier methods has actually been implemented in a few tools such as DESeq2 (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#approach-to-count-outliers). The authors need to compare their method with other available outlier detection methods? Also, what is the tool parameters for the authors use in their evaluation? The outlier performance may largely depend on the parameters used. The figure legend needs to be well described. What is the meaning of Figure 1A and Figure 1C, is that one for pre-control and one for after-medial control? Also, Figure 1c and Figure 1d? Why only use three, not five methods for real data performance evaluation? The released github code cannot reproduce the authorsâ€™ result.
