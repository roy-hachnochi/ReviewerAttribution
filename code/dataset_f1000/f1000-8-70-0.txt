This study provides comprehensive experimental evidence for the activity of Punica granatum peel extract in modulating pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and quorum sensing pigment producing Chromobacterium violaceum . The effect of PGPE on various aspect of pathogenicity related to antibiotic sensitivity, biofilm formation, surface hydrophobicity, quorum sensing, hemolysin catalase production and in vivo C. elegans infection model together make a comprehensive and elegant study of the herbal extract activity. The effect of concentration dependent PGPE treatment on various parameters and subsequent generations of the pathogens make for an interesting read. It is recommended that the article be indexed with some minor improvements as suggested below: Introduction : At several places, relevant references may be cited. Material and Methods: Pigment production can be separate heading and subheadings for each pigment, to make clear. Growth measurement can be included in the write up. Details of Chloramphenicol enhanced catalase maybe provided. Results : The quality of all the figures requires significant improvement. The details of significant values maybe kept in the figures to avoid crowding and enhance understanding. Font size of Figures, for example Figure 2C, needs to be clarified. The standard deviations are not visible in most of the figures. A brief summary of comprehensive results at the end of each section will help the reader grasp the crux of the experiment without having to go through the written text regarding working concentrations of the extracts etc. Discussion: Requires a section wherein the findings are succinctly concluded regarding the findings for Ps. aeruginosa and C. violaceum . Please include in Discussion why does the PGPE enhance probiotic activity while showing anti-infective activity against the pathogens studied.
