The study protocol aims to test associations between three variants (rs855791, rs4820268 and rs2235321) in TMPRSS6 gene and serum iron concentration after an oral iron supplementation. While this study is interesting and the findings are of potential importance, there are some concern/suggestions highly recommended to be addressed by the authors. It has been suggested that a linear model will be fit with genotypes as the outcome, serum iron as the predictor, and age, sex, and inflammation status biomarkers as covariates. As it has been well established that serum iron levels can be influenced by environmental factors such as smoking (Ghio et al. 2008) 1 , alcohol consumption (Whitfield et al. 2001) 2 and also BMI (Shattnawi et al. 2018) 3 , the authors should consider collecting these measures and incorporating them into a more complex regression model. Blood collection can be conducted in a detailed plan considering participants’ diet, time of day, and so forth. More importantly, the authors could improve serum iron measurement by considering a fasting blood test with the pre-defined fasting period such as 12 hours. In ‘Sample size calculation’ section author claimed that ‘This study size will be able to detect a 12% mean decrease in serum iron at five hours after oral iron supplementation between the wild type and the variant genotype groups with 90% power and a type 1 error of 0 in this study.’ Please elaborate on this sentence and explain how a 12% mean decrease in serum iron was estimated (e.g. please state the assumed parameters such as mean and standard deviation of serum iron). To further understand causal connection between rs855791, rs4820268 and rs2235321 SNPs and iron serum level, or iron-deficiency anaemia, the authors will need to conduct molecular experiments on mRNAs and proteins to experimentally identify direct effect of the listed SNPs on gene expression and then relate the expression level and corresponding genotypes to the trait, in this case serum iron level. In addition, a huge accessibility of GWAS, eQTL and pQTL studies enables the authors to perform in-silico analysis to verify their protocol and also hypothesise new ideas. Herein, I summarised some of GWAS results relevant to these three SNPs which can be furthered investigated in this proposed study. While rs855791 SNP is a missense variant at TMPRSS6 gene, it is associated with protein levels of TFRC (Sun et al. 2018) 4 and transcript expression of ALAS2 in blood tissue (Westra et al. 2013) 5 . rs4820268 SNP is a synonymous coding variant of TMPRSS6 gene, but again it is recognised as trans-eQTL of ALAS2 in blood tissue (Westra et al. 2013) 5 . rs2235321 SNP is another synonymous coding variant of TMPRSS6 gene and the SNiPA tool reports that it is associated with neither complex traits (e.g. iron status biomarkers) nor transcript/protein expression (Arnold et al. 2014) 6 . Altogether, it seems that rs855791 and rs4820268 variants have an impact on ALAS2 expression that is most highly expressed in bone marrow tissue (Fagerberg et al. 2014) 7 and contributes in heme metabolism and iron homeostasis (Barman-Akszen et al. 2015) 8 . Last, it is necessary to make sure that this study will potentially add novel findings into the literature in which several studies focused on TMPRSS6 polymorphisms and iron related traits to date (Nalado et al. 2019 9 ; Srensen et al. 2019 10 ). The authors may consider to focus on knowledge gaps and aim to comprehensively relate gene variants to gene expression/activity and then serum iron level. Notably, as a functional analysis, population-based differences are not much interesting because the functional effects of variants less likely vary from population to population.
