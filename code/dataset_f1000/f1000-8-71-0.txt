Outcomes of women with breast cancer in Iraq is an important, and the authors have done substantial work collecting and analysing the data. The primary area that is unclear is whether all patients in this cohort had radiation, or some did not. If all had radiation, then it cannot be concluded from this data that radiation improves disease outcomes, as there is no control group for comparison. The outcomes of this series can be compared to historical published series of no radiation. This statement is not substantiated by the data presented: “The PFS for relapse were 35 vs 264 with non-relapse… which indicated that when a woman received radiation therapy, she was 9 times more likely to survive… than someone who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy.” If all patients received radiation, then this comparison cannot be performed. If some did not receive radiation, then the numbers for those who received and did not receive radiation need to be provided. Were recurrences more common in those with positive lymph nodes? What percent of patients had recurrence after having undergone lumpectomy versus mastectomy? Did patients receive adjuvant endocrine therapy if they were estrogen/progesterone receptor positive? Specifics of the radiation techniques would be very helpful. Was CT simulation used? Were contours drawn? What energy photons? Was bolus used for the chest wall? What nodal levels were treated (ie were internal mammary nodes included)? What were the indications for nodal radiation? What type of chemotherapy was used? What % of patients received chemotherapy? How was the axilla addressed – what % of patients had sentinel lymph node biopsy versus axillary lymph node dissection? This data is interesting and important, and can be strengthened by consideration of the above points.
