It is a very interesting job. The authors have conceived a serious and exhaustive analysis of their own data. The study is well justified, and the characteristics of the patients and the intervention are clear and concise, both in the text and in the tables. The results are in agreement with the existing data in the current scientific literature. However, the authors state that the observed progression-free survival data allows them to argue that adjuvant radiotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence and significantly increases PFS, which is a gratuitous statement since it has not been compared to any control arm without radiotherapy and, therefore, the conclusion is only an extrapolation of the data of a particular series. It would be much more correct for the authors to limit their conclusions to presenting their own data, very satisfactory and consistent with the evidence, rather than maintaining statements that cannot be substantiated scientifically in the analyzed data. Finally, the article is well structured and written and the bibliography is consistent and updated.
