The authors developed a rapid method for the detection of a nitrite treatment of tuna fish meat. It is a straight forward static headspace GC-MS method and may be most probably combined with the determination of carbon dioxide, another agent to stabilize the red color of the meat. Brining experiments with 15 N labeled sodium nitrite proved the reaction path. The subject is of current importance and I suggest the indexing after minor revision. Minor comments: Page 3, “introduction”: Is there the possibility of combining the determination of CO and N 2 O, e.g. even within the same GC run? If so, please mention that option/possibility. Page 3, “Samples and sample preparation”: Please provide more details on the quantification, how was the calibration performed (one-point calibration, calibration curve, range of calibration…)? Page 4, “method development”, first and second paragraph: Within the second paragraph of the chapter it was concluded N 2 O to be the analyte in terms of robust chromatography. That explains the procedure of the two-step reduction described in the first paragraph. The GC temperature program was adjusted presumably based on the stronger retention of N 2 O. Please revise order of chapters and/or conclusions. Page 5, figure 3 text: Please mention the value of the untreated samples (below LOQ?) within the figure text. Page 5, “Validation with reference samples”: Please specify “free of N 2 O”; according to the supplementary data the findings ranged between 13-31 ug/kg N 2 O.
