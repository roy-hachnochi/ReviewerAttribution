HSV-1 accumulates in the perinuclear space when US3 is deleted. The authors investigate the distribution of gK in the context of US3 deletion. gK is a glycoprotein proposed to be involved in the envelopment of capsids by Golgi membranes, but not by nuclear membranes. The incorporation of gK into the virus envelope in spite of virus morphogenesis being arrested in the perinuclear space in the absence of US3 suggests new functions of gK during budding of HSV-1 at the nuclear membranes. This is a novel observation in relation to the function of gK in viral morphogenesis. The authors generated two new recombinant viruses, CK177deltaUS3gK-HA and CK177gK-HA, using the BAC system. A major concern of the experimental work presented is the limited characterization of the genomic structure of these recombinant viruses. The possibility that undesired mutations in other loci of the viral genome may have been selected during the construction of the recombinant viruses should be controlled by either sequencing of the viral genome or the construction of a revertant virus in which the modification (introduction of gK-HA with or without the deletion of US3) is restored, and demonstration that the revertant viruses behave as WT viruses. Also, there is no evidence that US3 protein expression is absent in CK177deltaUS3gK-HA. A detailed characterization of the recombinant viruses is necessary to fully support the conclusions of the study, and to rule out the introduction of mutations in other genes. The presentation of more quantitative data to support the distribution of gK by immunoelectron microscopy would strengthen the conclusions.
