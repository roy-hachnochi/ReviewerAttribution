The authors comprehensively discussed the diabetic patients, their complications, and recommended the future guidelines. A thorough study was conducted using MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS, DARE, and national health bodies. Additionally, importance of suspecting and diagnosing skin, superficial infections, and bone infections in diabetics have been studied. I strongly recommend it.
