This review by Huidi Tchero et al. reports ‘Management of infected diabetic wound: a scoping review of guidelines’. The authors claimed that the results are encouraging to develop a plan for diabetic wound and eco-friendly approach. This article signifies the importance of suspecting and diagnosing skin, superficial infections, and bone infections in diabetics. The suggested guidelines seem consistent with the suggestions on the assessment of the severity of infection, diagnosis, start, selection, and duration of antibiotic therapy. The authors further claimed that the IDSA 2012 guidelines are commonly followed across the world and there is a consensus among the Australian guidelines, Canadian guidelines, IDSA 2012, NICE 2015 and IWGDF 2016 guidelines on the management of infected wounds for patients with DM. Due to the lack of evidence, the therapeutic status of treatment options like hydrocolloid gels, NPWT, hyperbaric oxygen and aligate dressings could not be ascertained. There is a need to generate stronger evidence regarding the commonly used methods in the treatment of diabetic wound infections. The authors may refer to this latest literature to enhance their review; Aljerf et al. (2019 1 ). The manuscript has however some grammatical mistakes which need to be improved. As a whole, the topic is interesting. The manuscript is well organized and the authors systematically addressed the issues. I recommend indexing of this article after minor revisions.
