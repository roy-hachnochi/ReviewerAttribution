The authors describe ocular findings associated with H1N1 infection. There are 2 cases with asymptomatic retinal hemorrhages and 1 patient with retinal artery occlusion. This report of retinal involvement with H1N1 is new and interesting. The authors also ruled out the possibility of bleeding diathesis in these patients, supporting the possibility these findings are associated directly with H1N1 pathogenesis rather then a result of secondary systemic hematologic changes due to infections in general. There are some issues related with the manuscript: The authors mention that they have collected the patients over 9 years in the abstract. In the methods section, they mention that records of patients between 2015 and 2018 were examined. The dates donâ€™t match. The authors report that pre-existing type 2 diabetes in 3 patients among 14 H1N1 patients. However, it is unclear whether the cases that developed retinal lesions had diabetes or hypertension. The authors mention that there were 12,942 infections of H1N1 in India last year, but they have only 14 cases from 3 years. A multicenter study with more cases would better describe this disease picture. This can be at least mentioned in the discussion.
