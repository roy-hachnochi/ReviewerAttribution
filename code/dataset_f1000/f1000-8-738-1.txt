 In the abstract, the authors state ‘over a period of nine years’, whereas in the text, the study period mentioned is 2015-2018. Please clarify this. As rightly said in the manuscript, the ocular involvement in H1N1 is very rare. However, the authors have missed discussing the following references, relevant to the disease: Knapp A. Optic neuritis after influenza, with changes in the spinal fluid. Arch Ophthalmol. 1916;45:247-249. 1 Mathur SP. Macular lesion after influenza. Br J Ophthalmol. 1958;42:702. 2 Lai CC, Chang YS, Li ML, Chang CM, Huang FC, Tseng SH. Acute anterior uveitis and optic neuritis as ocular complications of influenza A infection in an 11-year-old boy. J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus2011 Jul 6.48 Online:e30-3. doi: 10.3928/01913913-20110628-03. 3 Rifkin L, Schaal S. H1N1-associated acute retinitis. Ocul Immunol Inflamm 2012;20:230-232. 4 The manuscript largely discusses the systemic (rather than ocular) findings in details, both in Results as well as Discussion, leading to its suitability as an article for a Medicine journal, rather than Ophthalmology journal. Almost all the references cited by the authors relate to systemic findings in H1N1. Although the authors have discussed the limitations of their study, their findings are not robust enough to have a publication out of this study. None of their patients have been symptomatic for ocular examination. Moreover, the mere finding of an incidental retinal haemorrhage does not merit ophthalmic screening of these critically ill patients.
