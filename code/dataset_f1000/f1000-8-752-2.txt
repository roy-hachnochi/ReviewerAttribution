This article presents the new Bioconductor package, BiocPkgTools, which allows users to obtain various statistics about Bioconductor packages, including the number of downloads by month, the build status, and the package dependencies. Overall, this seems to be a very useful package! I'm excited about using it as a way of measuring the use of my own package and perhaps doing some other exploratory analyses on the Bioconductor ecosystem. I was able to load and run everything and obtain similar results to those presented (slight differences due to running it at a different time) after reading this article and the package vignette. I believe the following minor edits could improve the presentation: Provide the code for generating Figures 2 3, even though it is in the vignette. This would be helpful from a reproducibility perspective. Specify how often the data presented are updated. Presumably this is done almost immediately, given that the build status is included. It would also be interesting to give an idea of how this is done. Specify in the output/help page that the filtering in the bubble chart obtained by running biocExplore() is done by biocViews (this can be a bit confusing since, for example, under "Bioinformatics" only a few packages are selected, but that is not something you can fix, since it's up to the authors to include the appropriate biocViews). Specify that the stats downloaded from biocDownloadStats() are the total number of downloads, not the number of downloads from distinct IPs, as the Bioconductor package page provides both.
