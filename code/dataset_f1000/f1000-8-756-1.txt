This paper is very interesting. It is well written and with scientific evidences. This lesion has clinical diagnosis very complex and the criteria used by the authors was well discussed in the paper. Are enough details provided of any physical examination and diagnostic tests, treatment given and outcomes? Yes, the authors have showed for each case presented the investigation methods including diagnostic tests, as well as, the treatment. Although in some cases there was recurrence the lesion after protocol treatment, we believe that economic condition of the patients might contribute to unsuccessful treatment. Other point is the access to public health system in the country nor always favorable. In addition, the authors have discussed this aspect and limitations. Is sufficient discussion included of the importance of the findings and their relevance to future understanding of disease processes, diagnosis or treatment? The discussion section was well presented , however would be interesting the authors to include which is the best scientific evidence for treatment in the actual moment? For example, glucantinme or anphotericin ? Or other? Is the case presented with sufficient detail to be useful for other practitioners? Yes, but in my opinion in the discussion section the authors should emphasize the high index of recurrence associated to treatment protocol used and comorbidities. Maybe the protocol treatment was not followed by the patient as prescribed by medical team. Is the background of the caseâ€™s history and progression described in sufficient detail? Yes, the cases are well presented and clinical history can be easily followed by the reader. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
