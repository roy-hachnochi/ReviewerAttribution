The following observations have not been addressed: Case 6: This is purely a DisL case. Due to the lack of oral involvement, this case is eminently of the dermatology or infectious diseases fields. Case 7: as in case 6, no substantial evidence was provided to assume oral involvement. Authors described "we accessed the PCR laboratory test", but it's not clear where was this sample obtained. Partial improvement of the oral lesion after AMB is not conclusive to assume the parasitic etiology. Paragraph 4: there is no reasonable evidence suggesting MCL is generally associated with VL or immunosuppression. All references supporting this statement (11-19) are case reports informing unusual clinical presentations. It's highly recommended to authors review https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-55512-8.00104-6 for a better understanding of the pathobiology and risk factors of MCL. Paragraph 8 and 9: authors must review the therapeutic section of https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-55512-8.00104-6 to understand how differently pure mucosal lesions and cutaneous lesions are treated. In the context of oral leishmaniasis, the suggestion of topical therapy for mucosal lesions is unacceptable. These are significant imprecisions which, if not addressed, are going to generate a deficient review.
