All my comments were addressed by the authors. Some of the suggested improvements were introduced, other not but the authors explained they did not overlap with the objectives of the article. I only suggest to correct a few editorial errors: "Normlisation” instead of "Normalisation” occurs once in the chapter “Transformation to FPKM values and normalisation”; "those those” – repeated word in the sentence started from “Figure 2 shows that the set of down-regulated genes has more discriminant power…” there is no dot at the end of the last sentence of the Summary chapter. Moreover, I suggest not to use a term “wild-type NPM1c samples” formed as an equivalent of “NPM1c mutated samples”, e.g. in the description of the Figure 3 and 4, as “NPM1c” means “cytoplasmic NPM1” which is typical for samples with the mutated NPM1 gene. The term “wild-type NPM1 samples” is more appropriate.
