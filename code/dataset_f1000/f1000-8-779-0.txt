 This article describes a rare case of trichilemmal carcinoma (TC). It may be valuable, from educational aspect, for the practitioners who have not encountered such a rare tumor, with a condition that pathological diagnosis is accurate and strict. It seems to me, however, that Figure 2 does not show characteristic features for TC or pilar cyst (PC). Although the microphotographs in Figure 2 are somewhat out of focus and are not discernible enough, the tumor looks squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). I suggest the authors to present characteristic histopathological features for TC/PC, as follows: Figure 2A: Low-power view showing cystic structure Distinct feature of trichilemmal keratinization. Figures 2B/2C/2D: Low-power view showing folliculo-centric structure of the tumor Distinct feature of trichilemmal keratinization (Absence of granular cell layer is not a warrant of trichilemmal keratinization, because conventional SCC usually shows keratinization from squamoid tumor cells without interposition of granular cell layer) The tumor cells with clear cytoplasm, stained by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) procedure. In case that the present tumor is difficult to distinguish from SCC, immunohistochemical markers for trichilemmal differentiation, such as CD34 and CK17, should be examined and presented.
