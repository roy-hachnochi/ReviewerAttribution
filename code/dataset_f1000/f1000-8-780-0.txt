This data note is on the brain fMRI data of patients with Parkinson’s disease in Openneuro. They provide unprocessed and also preprocessed fMRI data from 25 patients and 21 healthy controls acquired during the attention network test tasks along with T1 structural MRI. The MRI acquisition parameters and preprocessing codes are also provided thus other researchers can replicate the results or use them for other purposes such as machine learning-based classification. They also provide the basic demographics and the performance of cognitive tests. Given increased activities of neuroimage data sharing, the data has values of providing unique fMRI data from patients. There are available task fMRI data from normal controls, however, limited data from patients with neurological diseases or psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, patients with Parkinson’s disease showing motor problems have difficulties in performing taskㄴ in the scanner and commonly have motion artifacts. There are some items needed for the wide use of the data. First, the authors need to provide the medication history of the patients, at least the levodopa dose equivalency. Since, the medication influence a lot on the motor and cognitive performance in the patients and also on brain activities, one may use them as covariates depending on their interests. Second, they need to provide the performance of ANT task corresponding task scan. One can separate sessions into correct or fail, omit, or commit. This approach is popular in the attention fMRI experiment. Third, it will be great if they can provide resting fMRI and/or DTI data. These data can be used for investigating the functional/structural connectivity or network change in the disease.
