The authors have done a nice job presenting their imaging data that are being made available for public download. The article is well written and concise and provides background information necessary to enable the utilization of these data by other investigators. A sampling of imaging data provided online was looked at and appears to be appropriate and of good quality. The accompanying demographics file was reviewed and contains pertinent data. One issue I noticed on quick review is that there are MoCA and MMSE scores that exceed 30. Otherwise I have largely minor suggestions in order to improve the accessibility and utilization of these data by others: Please state reason for repeating scanning sessions. If time between two sessions may be relevant for analysis, then please provide timing log for each subject. Would include sex difference comparison between groups. They look like they may be different. BIDS in Materials section could be referenced as is done later under “Organization”. Would use “MDS-UPDRS” in Table 1 to distinguish values from the “UPDRS” scale. Tables should note if parentheses represent standard deviations. (Parentheses are incorrectly used to note units.) There were 149 volumes resulting in 357.6 sec of scanning time. Were the scans actually 6 min long? Were there any dummy scans at begging for T1 equilibration and if so have these been removed? Would explicitly state matrix size and thickness for EPI scans. Was there any gap? Under “Organization” do not need to define BIDS again. Also the sentence about “skull-stripped anatomical images” being included is confusing as all images provided are the defaced images.
