The review in my opinion will be approved with reservations to improve the paper I will make some suggestions: Picture of fundus of both eyes. Is it possible Autofluorescence or AFG? What kind of Electroretinogram has been made? Picture of it to show the response. Differential Diagnosis, 27-month-old girl is too young to think in PPRA, what kind of systemic or genetic diagnosis has been made to get to that excluded diagnosis? Ask for pregnant infectious illness: Rubeola, Toxoplasma.... I have doubts that the diagnosis will be correct with the information provided in the paper.
