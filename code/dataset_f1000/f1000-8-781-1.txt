 What is the name of the imaging device/fundus camera? Can we get the periphery photo? Any history of laser photocoagulation done? The current figure shows 2 pigmented spots at the left margin. Other eye Fundus photo? ERG report available? Please provide the report or at least the important line graphs e.g scotopic, combined response and photopic response. In the case report it is described that: "The pigmentations consisted of coarse black pigmentations and fine subretinal yellowish round flecks. They arborized into the peripheral retina along the veins". However practically, the abnormal pigmentation is a hypopigmentation of the affected area of fundus. In the discussion section, there is no need to start with “the best of authors’ knowledge, this patient is the youngest with PPRCA ever reported.” This can be written at the end.
