This is a well-written opinion article of a topic of significant topical relevance as many developed health systems grapple with the challenges of growing healthcare needs with finite resources. Increasingly complexity science is being used to understand the behaviour and performance of healthcare systems and their agents, and this paper makes a convincing case for the importance of values/purpose/goals (which are sometimes neglected over financial/economic concerns). The logic and flow of the argument is sound and well-supported by the cited literature. While the benefits of bottom-up approaches to leadership are the main thrust of the paper, with interesting case studies used as examples, the paper is measured in its conclusions: recognising that the top-down and bottom-up approaches are not mutually exclusive. I suggest revision of the following sentence in the section 'From theory to first-hand experience'. "Observation would suggest that it is always “easier” to live with the imperfection of the status quo and to fiddle with its imperfection at the margins." As the writing style feels out of place, although this is only a minor point.
