The authors argue in favor of organizing healthcare systems bottom-up instead of top-down and discuss several examples of successful implementation of that principle around the world. The contribution is an ‘opinion article’. Whether or not I agree with the authors opinion is not relevant. In my view, the article is a stimulating contribution to the debate on healthcare systems reform and should be indexed as such. For a final version of the paper I suggest explaining "the Meikirch model" on p. 7 where it is first mentioned. In the fourth paragraph on the left hand side of p. 8 I think it should read 'limit' instead of 'limited'. Finally, I recommend dropping the first sentence on the right hand side of p. 8 because, in my view, it sounds a bit too lofty for a scholarly article.
