I have found the study very interesting and partially relevant in flagging the deficit for minimal staffing by label of care (based on the BPEHS standards) in Sierra Leone. Some of my question and concerns are: Health Workforce (HWF) staffing usually measured based on population and there are intentional standards for developing countries. Why the authors are not interested to use or at least mention that? What is the catchment population of those health facilities and what is the health workforce staffing deficit based on the WHO criteria (for a developing country)? Do you need the HWF just to fulfil the BPEHS standard or is there any evidence suggesting compromisation of the routine health care service because of the stated HWF deficit. For prioritization and focused action, I would recommend the showing the dis-aggregated deficit from nurses, midwifes and doctors which would be much more important for the policy maker for action.
