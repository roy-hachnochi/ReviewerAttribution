I donâ€™t think the authors have really responded to my comment 2 (which is also linked to the response to comment 1). The CHW programme ie. the way that supervision and incentives were provided may affect how well the reporting was done and the overall performance of the programme. It is not clear how the programme was run in the three different phases and how this may influence the results. What role do supervision and incentives play in the overall performance should be discussed in the discussion?
