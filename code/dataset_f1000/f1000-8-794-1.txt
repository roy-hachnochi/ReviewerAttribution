This is an interesting study which investigates the CHW system performance pre, during and post Ebola periods looking at CHW reporting, reported diagnosis and treatment services. It particularly looks at sustained trends of performance 18 months after the end of Ebola. The article is well written and presented. I suggest the following improvements to the paper: In the introduction, a more detailed description of the CHW programme pre-Ebola, during Ebola and post Ebola is needed to provide context to the study and the findings. For example, who provided the supplies for the RDT and treatments, the financial incentives for the CHWs, and the supervision? How was this funded? Then in the discussion, this can be drawn upon to discuss the findings and offer recommendations. Financial incentives for CHWs are included in the national CHW policy 2016-2020. However, there have been issues with getting the incentives to the CHWs, with many CHWs not receiving them. So, a discussion of the role of incentives in CHW performance should be discussed - is it the promise of money that motivates CHWs? How long will this willingness last, if the payments do not materialise? The definition of the reporting completeness is unclear. and needs revision. It is unclear whether completeness indicates the reports from ALL the CHWs within the catchment area of the facility. If not, then how this affects the figures for reporting cases and treatment, needs to be discussed. Reduction in diarrhoea treatment trend needs to be explored more, for example, comparisons made with diarrhoea treatment rates in other areas of Sierra Leone or national rates, and changes in availability of drugs.
