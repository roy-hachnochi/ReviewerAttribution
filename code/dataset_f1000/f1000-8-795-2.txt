I appreciate the opportunity to review this well written and timely manuscript submitted by Koroma et al. It is certainly telling of the impact of the Ebola outbreak and the effects on the health system within Sierra Leone. Although it only uses aggregate data, the analysis is straight forward and highlights the struggles of providing/reporting on healthcare within a developing country. I believe this manuscript is very much worth of indexing and will add significantly to the growing knowledge base surrounding healthcare system management in developing countries. I would suggest one minor correction and an area which could be further discussed, where there is a gap in services being at least reported, if not provided. First, the last sentence in the 3rd paragraph is incomplete and needs to be corrected. Secondly, it is extremely interesting the lack of reporting of mental health visits - across all three levels of care. Additionally, I am curious, as with other African countries, do mental health visits include epilepsy as well? If so, this is an interesting perspective that should be mentioned. The authors mention that "the small number of individuals reported with MHD is of concern...especially... post Ebola..." I think this could be another key finding, especially if it includes those with epilepsy. The prevalence of MHD and epilepsy in developing countries is unknown and regardless of the Ebola outbreak, the tremendous gap in reporting found in this study suggests that they are under-recognized and under-treated. The authors might want to point this out and provide some recommendations for Sierra Leone and other countries with similar contexts.
