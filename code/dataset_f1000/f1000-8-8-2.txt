This study focused on dental caries prevalence and some associated factors among Egyptian children and adolescents. The study has a good rationale and reasonable theoretical framework. There are some issues and problems that should be corrected by authors: The term “correlation” should be modified to “association” in all sections of the manuscript. The term “correlation” should be maintained only where Spearman’s Correlation Coefficient was correctly calculated. The authors should present a good justification for not using d m ft index. “Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, may be non-compliant with study procedures.” – This criterion is quite subjective. In the sample size calculation, the authors should clearly point out that they use the prevalence of “60%”. The most serious issue is how the individuals were selected (simple random sample? Cluster random sample? Another sampling strategy?) There are some English language errors that must be corrected. I strongly recommend that a professional native English be contacted. Statistical analysis is worrisome. Why authors use the Shapiro-Wilk test? Why did they not use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test? The indication of correlation analysis for comparing nominal and quantitative (Eg. Gender and dmft) variables is also incorrect. The influence of age in dental caries is not a new finding in the literature. Therefore, authors should stratify the age groups with similar prevalence and severity of dental caries in order to perform a better and rigorous analysis. The authors should perform multiple regression models for all dependent variables. Without these previously corrections, it is not possible to evaluate the results, discussion, and conclusions.
