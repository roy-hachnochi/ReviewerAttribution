The work done by Nwonuma et al. is a interesting work but lacking proper execution. I felt that authors should have done the assays at-least till quantitative analysis. Major issue is the use of strain ATCC 21784, which shows as Rhodococcus sp. (21784) at ATCC site (https://www.google.com/search?q=ATCC+21784ie=UTF-8) Were Aspergillus fumigatus using, bad language, language of the manuscript needs revision. Aspergillus fumigatus, accession number? I would suggest a serious revision of the manuscript before accepting for indexing.
