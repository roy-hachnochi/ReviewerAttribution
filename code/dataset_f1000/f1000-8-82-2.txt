This is a clearly written overview of the Hertfordshire Cohort Study. The manuscript presents the background leading to the start of the Cohort and then logically describes the study phases and methods with clear summary tables of the variables collected. The manuscript reports key outcomes in some of the major areas of research that have been conducted using the Cohort, particularly in relation to bone and musculoskeletal health and diet. Details of linkage to routinely collected data, contribution to genetic and epigenetic studies and key collaborators are listed. Plans for the future directions of the cohort, including recruitment to an intergenerational study are described. Overall, the manuscript provides a very useful reference tool and resource for parties interested in collaborating with the Southampton team. My only suggestion for improvement of the manuscript would be to add a paragraph on the limitations of the Cohort e.g. whether there are variables that are not available or with missing data, and whether the lack of these data means that there are certain study questions that cannot be readily addressed using the Cohort. For example, it does not appear that pregnancy-related variables are available in the original cohort, but I presume some may be available in the new intergenerational cohort?
