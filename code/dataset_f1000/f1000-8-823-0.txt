Neuroblastoma is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous pediatric tumor. Precise biological and molecular characterization of tumor cells is increasingly becoming an integral part of patient care, with treatment stratification depending not only on clinical, but also on molecular characteristics. However, tumor samples are frequently small, especially when obtained by fine needle biopsies, with frequently only a limited amount of biological material available for increasingly complex molecular investigations or cellular screening procedures. In this manuscript, the authors describe the technical aspects of direct culture of neuroblastoma samples for the establishment of neurosphere cultures. Importantly, they describe a procedure which is applied to consecutive cases in a single center, with samples obtained by different techniques (surgical resections, fine needle biopsies, transport fluid) and at different time points (at diagnosis, post chemotherapy). The success rate is 55% (37/67 samples), without any significant association between the success rate of establishing a neurosphere culture and clinical/histological/genetic features. Characterization of the obtained neurosphere cultures is still limited, but the results indicate that the cultured cells do express neuroblastoma markers. The ultimate usefulness of the established neurosphere cultures will depend on a number of aspects. It will be necessary to compare genetic/epigenetic/cell identity features between the primary tumor and corresponding neurosphere culture, to search more in detail for features linked to culture success rates and to establish the duration of tumor growth. The importance of this work is linked to the presentation of a reproducible method for the expansion of frequently rare tumor tissue, enabling more large scale use of such samples for molecular characterization, drug screening and other applications for the patientsâ€™ benefit.
