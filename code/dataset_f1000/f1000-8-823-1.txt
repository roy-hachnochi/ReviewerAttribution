Neuroblastoma is a rare paediatric tumour which accounts for a disproportionately high number of paediatric cancer deaths. Fresh tissue samples are usually small and scarce, and established cell lines are likely to poorly represent the heterogenous nature of the disease. This paper describes a simple methodology for establishing neurosphere cultures from small samples of fresh biopsy tissue, with a relatively high success rate. This is a potentially very useful technique for extending the use of limited primary tissue samples to maximal benefit. Of note, success was even achieved with fluid from around surgical/biopsy samples, rather than solid tissue samples, which is potentially very useful when sample size is limited. The article is clearly written and will be of interest to those working in the field.
