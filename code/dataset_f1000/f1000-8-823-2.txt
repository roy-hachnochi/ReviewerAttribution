This is a straightforward technical report on direct culture of neuroblastoma samples from consecutive cases treated at Great Ormond Street. The research team has taken a logical approach to establishing an easy method to establish patient-derived neurospheres. Tumour samples were derived from a number of sources (open biopsy, needle biopsy from transport fluid). The overall success rate (37 cultures from 67 samples) confirms that this approach is feasible. The characterisation of the resulting neurosphere cultures has been limited, but expression of both CD56 and GD2 suggests that the cultures really are neuroblastic tumours. The significance of this work really lies in the downstream application of patient-derived cultures. There are a number of unanswered questions, specifically how representative the neurosphere cultures are of the donor tumour, whether there is any correlation between the capacity to establish a culture and patient outcome, whether the neurosphere models can be propagated as xenografts, and if it is possible to derive neurosphere cultures from each genetic/genomic subtype of neuroblastoma (e.g. MYCN amplified, TERT rearranged, ATRX deleted, etc.). Overall, with an increasing focus on personalisation of therapy, whilst a simple piece of work, I believe it is a valuable contribution to the field and will be helpful for other groups engaged in such work.
