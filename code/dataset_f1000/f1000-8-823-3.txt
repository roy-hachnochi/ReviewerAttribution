The article is scientifically sound. My only criticism is stylistic. I think the sentences are too long and the punctuation could be better. The text is clunky. For example: “The disease is strikingly heterogeneous with a range of clinical phenotypes, from spontaneous regression, including in cases with metastases, to aggressive disease with marked resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. New approaches to therapies supported by the availability of suitable tumor models that more closely resemble the human disease are essential for improving outcomes for this disease.” Edit to: Neuroblastoma is strikingly heterogeneous. Clinical phenotypes range from spontaneous regression to aggressive disease characterised by marked resistance to radio and chemotherapy. New therapeutic approaches, supported by tumor models more closely resembling human disease, are essential for improving outcomes in children. There are many more examples in the subsequent manuscript. Tight editing would vastly improve readability.
