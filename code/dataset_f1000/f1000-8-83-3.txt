This paper is an original work. The study rationale is sound, the underdeveloped introduction has made it hard for the reviewers to see how this study differ to the previous ones. As findings and discussion are suggestive of the use of Transtheoretical Theory, it needs to be included in the introduction chapter. Findings are presented as series of quotes and at a few points were confusing for readers. I suggest rework of the finding sections, and give signposting to each section. For example for Behavioural factor, states clearly that behaviour factors including mothers' time restriction, conflict of interest, or not keeping up scheduled immunization. Very interesting and specific cultural context was presented in the finding and discussion, unfortunately it has not been described earlier in the study sample. I suggest to add a small Par on participants context explaining who there are, family, structure, and other relevant context which may support or hinder immunization. A couple of notes on the methods section re 'saturation" nature, purpose of saturation shall be operationalised in a way that is consistent with the research question and theoretical position (in this case seems like the Transtheoretical theory). Re: Inter rater reliability to establish consistency of findings. In Qualitative research do not make explicit this concept, however implicitly they can provide descriptions of the procedures for carrying out the analysis. Needs to be referenced and mentioned, saturation to which study question? Re: inter-rater reliability, in a qualitative research it is implicitly mention as a process of which are followed by both of the authors. For example meetings of two researchers' to discuss and negotiate agreements and disagreements about coding. Or codings were brainstormed to put the first order statement from respondents and agree them.
