In this experiment report the authors present their work on derivatising crystals of a single-domain antibody protein with cadmium ions and subsequent solving the structure via SAD. They demonstrate that home-lab X-ray crystallographic equipment is capable of solving crystal structures via SAD at CuKalpha X-ray energy. The authors then conclude by discussing the result and suggesting the method for use in home-lab source diffraction experiments. To sum up, I find the study to be clearly presented and well prepared. Additional notes: To my point of view, the data were collected competently to reach higher multiplicity (which is indispensable for SAD phasing) for P1 space group by exploiting kappa goniometer. The workflow for structure solution via Cd-SAD presented in this article seems to be relatively straightforward even considering the problem with centrosymmetric Cd sites (easily resolved by chain tracing). "The phasing of protein crystals by SAD starts from finding the positions of an anomalous substructure, which is usually done by direct methods." - In fact, the process involves Patterson search coupled with direct methods-based calculations 1 namely dual-space refinement. I might suggest adding a few words on how the authors introduced cadmium ions into the crystal (I see that it was co-crystallisation as reported in their previous article).
