This article presents the de.NBI IaaS federation which brings together 5 different OpenStack installations for researchers in life science. The system provides single-sign on by leveraging federated identity technology such as SAML and OpenID Connect with ELIXIR AAI, an established source of identity in the life science community in Europe. Access to the federation is managed by a central de.NBI portal that manages users in projects using Perun and synchronises that information to the different OpenStack providers using an Open Source tool. Source code of the portal is not available (or not references in the article at least), but it may be interesting for other similar initiatives to replicate the setup. Authors should consider adding a reference to the source code if available. Description of the federation is clear. Comparison with other existing cloud federation initiatives would improve the article. de.NBI is sometimes written as De.NBI, this should be consistently capitalised. Consider using the "Software Tool Article" instead of "Method Article".
