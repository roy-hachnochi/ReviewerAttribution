This article describes a case of D. caninum in a pregnant woman. Although the report in a pregnant woman appears to be slightly novel, the finding of D. caninum in a human is not unusual. There is no direct evidence (images, DNA sequences, histology, etc) presented. “Most of the cases ….are likely kissed or licked by pets”. This is an incorrect. The definitive host has to ingest the flea intermediate host, so licking/kissing doesn’t lead to to transmission. The case was from 2013. It is odd that it took 7 years to be reported, which makes me somewhat skeptical of this report. Especially since there isn’t even an image of the egg. In general, there should be some evidence for the case report - images, genetic sequences, etc. It is rare for cats to have obstruction, seizures, and convulsions. In animals, it is usually asymptomatic except for perhaps mild enteric signs and/or anal pruritis. “Diphylidiasis” should be dipylidiasis Since the authors suggest that the finding in a pregnant woman is novel, they should point out why it is especially important in this demographic.
