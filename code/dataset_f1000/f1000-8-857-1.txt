The article describes a case of Dipylidium caninum on a pregnant woman. The case is interesting as this is indeed a rare event. There are however a few things which should be improved in the paper. Those have to be discussed. The case report describes the inspection of a woman in 2013. Is this a typo? If it is not a typo. It is not clear why the case is reported now after 7 years. The situation of the parasites can have changed a lot. The tapeworm could have evolved, the environment can be different now, the cures could not be effective anymore…. This is a possible limitation that should be reported. Given the description of the case it seems a very risky transmission with minimal contact (“the woman had no contact with dogs and cats but was just in areas where they were”). Can you compare the risk of transmission of dipylidiumto the taxoplasma gondii or similar hazards in the same area? e.g. in Kowofie et al. 2016 1 . It is not clear what are your perspectives and the lessons learned by the case. Do you suggest future policies to avoid contacts with dogs and cats? Do you suggest to reinforce stool analysis in case of reported vomiting? Do you suggest those to be applied to pregnant women or to the population in general reporting symptoms? Or since the case was treated so simply it is not a big deal? Then why reporting it? In previous studies, including one of the reviewer (Amoah et al. 2016 2 ) women in rural areas avoid antenatal cares for series of reasons. Do you have updated statistics? Even just for the area of the reported case.
