Overall, this article is a systematic review of the economic and personal burden of heart failure. The authors have preformed an admirably and extensive task given the scope of the project. The size and scope of the project limits it's utility, given the lack of bias assessment for each article and lack of clarity comparing outcomes and healthcare costs across vastly different healthcare systems. Introduction: Doesn't provide background on previous estimated or quality of life reviews regarding HF. Does not compare HF to those of any other chronic disease process (such as renal failure, respiratory disease etc.). Nor does it explain the significant differences in HFpEF and HFrEF from an economic perspective. Methods: Not registered prospectively. Results: Well presented given the wide reaching scope of the review. Discussion: Reasonable discussion. Should be noted that patients with HFpEF have limited treatment options and they're major mortality drivers are usually non-cardiac. Conclusions: The authors conclude "Our findings indicate that patients with HF experience a greater humanistic burden and incur higher economic costs than individuals without HF or patients with other chronic diseases" and this conclusion is outside the reach of the review and would be better worded: "Our findings indicate that patients with HF experience a greater humanistic burden and incur higher economic costs than individuals without HF" as there is insufficient scope to comment on other chronic diseases.
