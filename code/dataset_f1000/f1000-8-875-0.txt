This paper evaluates predictors for a positive systematic biopsy. These predictors included PSA, age, prostate volume, and PSA density (PSAD). The authors concluded that PSAD was the best predictor for a positive biopsy based on ROC analysis. The authors have done great work by including 1232 patients. The manuscript is nicely written. There are some considerations before accepting this manuscript for indexing: Why are men with normal DRE not included? If you only include men with abnormal DRE you will make a high risk cohort and you will miss tumour located on the ventral side of the prostate. In the method section, the authors describe that inclusion criteria were age 45 years and PSA 4 ng/ml. However, in Table 1 the range for men with positive biopsy was 35-89 and for men with negative biopsy 40-83. In addition, the range of PSA is 0.8 â€“ 7740 ng/ml. A more proper way of reporting is by providing the median and the interquartile range. Figure 1 is composed of a section A and B. However, I do not see the added value of separating prostate volume from the rest of the predictors. The methodology is not sufficient to conclude that PSAD is the best predictor. Multiple testing will lead to biased results. The best methodology is to make a logistic model in which age and PSAD are used as predictor. Since PSA and prostate volume are combined into PSAD, it is not recommended to use both PSAD, and PSA and prostate volume in one model. On the basis of this model, it is possible to calculate an AUC and to make an individual prediction for a men. Before an accurate message can be given, it is first important to take the previous considerations into account. The results of an Indonesian cohort will be of interest for both researchers and urologists.
