Thank you for revisiting your manuscript and replying to the reviewer questions. It is unfortunate that you can't repeat the experiment but you do have a valid reason as well as you have given a response about the specific control group results. Thank you for testing sex differences and adding the information on the supplementary data. However, you should use the word sex and not gender.
