 Introduction: The concepts of ES and VE should be introduced briefly. Please explain what they mean and how they are defined related to mangrove forests in order to assess fishery activities. What is the state of the knowledge of this research? From what I see I have found this research only reports what has been done by the project. So I suggest that the authors should be able to convey the novelty of this research. What's different about VE in Kalimantan from VE in Indonesia or elsewhere in the world? Materials and methods: Please give more information about fishers, for example of their activities. Do they do one day fishing or not, and whether being fishermen is their main job, like many fishermen in Indonesia? This time is allocated for fishing for one week, month or year. Discussion: The authors should also be able to discuss the relationship of mangroves ( Rizophora apiculata ) with fisheries production based on location. Does low area abundance provide low fisheries production in areas with Rizaphora ? This is seen from the EV approach. Conclusions: Conclusions should be corrected or revised. I see that the current conclusion is still a summary of the methods and results and discussion. Summarize what has been learned and why it is interesting and useful.
