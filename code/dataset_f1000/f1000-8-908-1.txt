In this article, Blucher et al. present important updates to the ReactomeFIViz app for Cytoscape. They added several very useful features to this popular plugin that now enables easy visualization of drug and their targets in the context of biological pathways. In addition to retrieving and overlaying the drug-target information on the Reactome pathways, the updated app provides convenient visual representations of several layers of related information. Moreover, they added the capability to model the impact of single or multiple drugs on the pathways using a simple yet elegant approach based on Boolean Network modeling. Overall, the authors have done a great job in providing a thorough description of the new capabilities of the software. I only have some minor comments and observations: The fuzzy logic modeling examples are very well described but It might be useful if the description included some discussion on the biological interpretation of these results, especially in the context of precision medicine. I found the online documentation for the reactomeFIViz documentation very useful to follow the analyses discussed in the manuscript. However, I was not able to test the “systems pathway impact analysis” which kept returning an HTTP status 500 error message. I am not sure if it’s a user-specific error, but it might be worth checking. Some of the drug-target overlays are very difficult to read because of high edge-density. It might help if the edges were semi-transparent. Consider using a color-blind friendly palette for visualizing simulation outputs, as the red-green gradient may be challenging for some users to differentiate.
