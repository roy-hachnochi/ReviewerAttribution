This paper describes umbilical cord practices among mothers in a low resource setting and assesses the relationship between umbilical cord hygiene and neonatal sepsis, its impact on the population, as well as the influence of other neonatal and maternal factors on this relationship. The methodology is clearly written and well presented. However, criteria used for cases were purely clinical and do not quite fit into the seven clinical signs identified by WHO especially in developing countries which includes: difficulty feeding, convulsions, movement only when stimulated, respiratory rate 60 per min, severe chest in drawing and axillary temperature 37.5 C or 35.5 C 1 . For example, the authors include an axillary temperature of 37.5 C but are silent on temperature 35.5 C. Other useful signs like cyanosis and grunting are also not included 2 . It is important to remember that neonatal sepsis shares similar clinical presentations to other common conditions in the neonatal period, thus a combination of clinical and laboratory findings is necessary to provide a correct diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. The limited access to laboratory tests in developing countries 3 which perhaps may have been a challenge to the authors should probably be stated if applicable. The study describes the statistical methods that were used and the results obtained are clearly stated. Statistical analysis and interpretation of results are adequate. This is a very good paper and is an important addition to the literature on the importance of cord care especially in low resource settings.
