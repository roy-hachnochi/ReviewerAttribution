This study describes the correlation between hormone profile, lipid profile and clinical profile with free testosterone index in subjects with PCOS. Triglycerides, testosterone, and SHBG were associated with hyperandrogenism in PCOS patients, while FGS showed no such association. Overall the paper is well structured and written, with results and a strong discussion. However I would have the following comments to the paper: The average BMI of all PCOS patients were more than 25 (27.6). Could obesity influence the statistical analysis of the hormone? There are some evident errors in Tables. For example, In Table 1, is the average value of the body weight 0.6? The manuscript must be edited again for typo errors. In the discussion, “There are marked increases in GnRH and LH secretion, along with relative deficit in FSH secretion……” I think it should change deficit to deficiency. There are too many references in the discussion part, which should be moved to the introduction part. Because it only includes 9 references in the introduction.
