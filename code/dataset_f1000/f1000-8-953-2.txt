F Razi et al. reported the performance of BSA filtration by PES-Tetronic 304 UF membranes. Authors have reported enough characterization and comprehensive discussion. It may be indexed and authors should consider the following issues: Commercial membranes used made it less attractive. If we synthesize, it can optimize the performance characteristics much better. For example: BSA Rejection reported in this study is 80%. If we fabricate, still higher rejection can be achieved The role of Tetronic 304 in the modified membrane may be clearly explained in discussion section. Is it ok for long term operation?
