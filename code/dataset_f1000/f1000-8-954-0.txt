Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper, which presents data from two MSF hospitals in Pakistan to explore clinical factors associated with mortality among children admitted to these facilities. The analysis of seasonality in particular is an interesting and novel feature of this analysis although it is notable that differences between the two sites in this regard are not commented on in the manuscript. There are some important ways in which the work could have been strengthened. For example: The choice of a 7-month age cut off in defining the patient group is unusual as it corresponds neither to traditional definitions of the neonatal nor infant periods. It would have been helpful to know exactly why it would possible only according to the 7-month cut off and to have read a clearer explanation of the implications of this limitation for the analysis - and more on data limitations overall would have been useful. Tables 2 and 4 aggregate diagnostic categories differently - why is this? Were no cases reported against the other categories? Separating out categories in the same way would have aided qualitative comparisons between the two sites. The authors state that a pooled analysis across the two facilities was not practically useful to the teams. This is fine - but it would then have been helpful to include more data (if available) to test to account for observed differences - especially in mortality within the first 48 hours of admission. Were any triage assessment measures on admission available to include?
