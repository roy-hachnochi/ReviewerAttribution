This is an interesting approach to study such data in retrospective fashion. Findings on most common newborn or infantsâ€™ illnesses and their outcomes (discharge or mortality) in Pakistan are well known and covered under various national surveys also. PDHS and MICS are two such examples besides various individual and organizational work published in recent years. The paper under consideration has used PDHS 2012-13 as a baseline and has attempted to make a case for two sites in Balochistan. The main thrust is that province under-performs vis--vis national statistics. This is not a new revelation and is a well-known and documented fact for many decades. With new PDHS 2017-18 released, this paper becomes redundant. Secondly, the causes of hospital admission or diagnoses found in infants are also chronologically known. Only thing which could have made this paper more interesting is adding the work of MSF which is being done at these two sites to address the issue of neonatal morbidity and mortality and the details of interventions which are being introduced at hospital or community level and then results shown with a significant difference made.
