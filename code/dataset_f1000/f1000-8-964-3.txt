The authors attempted to study and report the finger dermatoglyphic characteristics of normal, overweight and obese children. The choice of cross-sectional study design for the purpose of reporting the palmer dermatoglyphics characteristics in the sample population is commendable as it provided the baseline distribution of arch, whorl ulna, and radial loops in the study population. The analysis of the distribution and comparison of the finger dermatoglyphic characteristics between the normal, overweight and obese subjects was exceptional. I am not sure if some of the conclusions were intended, e.g. suggesting that a particular fingerprint pattern is predictive of an outcome (in this case either of obese, overweight and normal weight) was overreaching. More so, since the study design and statistical analysis, did not provide sufficient evidence for such a conclusion. The correct reference of the manual ink pad dermatoglyphic collect method is by Antonok et al. 1 It was challenging to comprehend most of the paragraphs, because of challenging lexical semantics. A detail grammatical edit is recommended. In general, the objective and study design of the article good; however, a major revision is required before final publication release.
