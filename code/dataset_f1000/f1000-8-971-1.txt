This is an insightful and interesting article that reports the results of a qualitative study that includes interviews with key actors in the preprint domain in order to find out about the current and future role of the preprints. The study uses innovation diffusion theory as a framework. The paper is well-written and presents the results as it is the norm in social sciences. The literature review covers several aspects related to preprint that are relevant to the context of the research. The method has been described clearly and sufficiently. The findings are supported with evidence from the interviews (quotes) and they are discussed using the framework of the study (IDT). I found the comparison of the findings from the interviews with the literature and the questions for future studies (Figure 1) particularly useful. I also enjoyed reading the comments of previous reviewers and the authors’ response to those comments. I believe the methodology is fine and well-justified in the current version. I have no more corrections to suggest. As a minor point, RPO used in the figure hasn’t been mentioned in the paper and I had to find out what it stands for, although the phrase has been used in the paper.
