This is a valuable brief summary of the regulatory landscape in the UK within which research use of pathology-related biosamples sits. It highlights the core contributions of the national bodies that regulate clinical trials, and the requirements of laboratory accreditation in the UK that underpin quality assurance of pathology samples. The cited sources will provide a useful and regularly updated source of information regarding MHRA, HRA, HTA and UKAS/ISO 15189. I think that it would be helpful to extend the focus more explicitly beyond the field of clinical trials, to provide confidence for pathologists working in diagnostic settings who wish to undertake research work unrelated to clinical trials. To this end, a little more discussion about how NHS pathology laboratories can achieve HTA licensing for research storage of 'surplus' tissue, the topic of generic/specific consent, and HRA processes for achieving ethical review of research (particularly the processes for research deemed to raise minimal ethical concerns) would all be valuable. Legitimate access to a useful dataset of clinical information to accompany tissue samples is often a perceived barrier to pathology-based research, which could usefully be 'myth busted' in an article such as this (HRA and GDPR considerations, in particular). In my opinion, the topics I've touched on above are all inextricably linked to the regulation of tissue-based research and to the encouragement of pathologists to engage in well-regulated research - the 'holy grail' of the NCRI's CM-Path initiative.
