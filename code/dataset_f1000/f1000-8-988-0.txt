This is a well selected review that covers most of the essential 2018 works on Tourette syndrome. One area that will probably have a big impact in the future, is the ability to predict which neurocognitive variables represents good predictors of clinical evolution in TS. Electrophysiological measures were useful to predict outcome, following a psychological intervention, in other psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disorders, depression and obsessive-compulsory disorder (Krause et al., 2015; Burkhouse et al., 2016) 1 , 2 , but has yet to be tested in TS. One article did just that last year. I suggest to add an article by Morand-Beaulieu and colleagues (2018) 3 that suggest that electrophysiological markers could offers new predictors for therapeutic outcome in TS and CTD patients with its high temporal precision to follow the stream of fast cognitive and motor processes. Morand-Beaulieu et al (2018) suggested that motor-related and slow cortical potentials could constitute electrophysiological markers of TS. These measures are related to SMA and basal ganglia functioning which is pretty consistent with neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies already reported in the current manuscript. I believe that this article could fit well in the ‘’clinical and neuropsychological studies’’ section or perhaps in the ‘psychological intervention’ section if you decide to integrate it.
