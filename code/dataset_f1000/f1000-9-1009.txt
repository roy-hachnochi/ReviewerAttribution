            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: The incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been noted to vary dramatically between population groups and over time. Here, the hypothesis that changes in network connectivity underpin these changes is explored. 
 Methods: The incidence/prevalence estimates of HIV, herpes simplex virus-2, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea, as well as two markers of sexual network connectivity (partner concurrency and multiple partnering) by ethnic group and sexual orientation in Kenya, South Africa, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (USA) were extracted from published studies. Pearson&rsquo;s correlation was used to test the association between the markers of network connectivity and the incidence/prevalence of these five STIs. A literature review was performed to evaluate the possible causes of the increases and decreases in syphilis incidence over the past 60 years. 
 Results: In each country, the five STIs were found to cluster in particular ethnic groups and sexual orientations and to be positively associated with the two markers of network connectivity. Syphilis incidence in the UK and USA was found to increase dramatically in the 1960s/1970s, decline in the 1980s and again increase in the late 1990s. These changes took place predominantly in men who have sex with men, and were preceded by corresponding changes in network connectivity. The large decline in antenatal syphilis prevalence in Kenya and South Africa in the 1990s were likewise preceded by declines in network connectivity. 
 Conclusions: Although other explanatory variables are not controlled for, the present analysis is compatible with the hypothesis that differential network connectivity is a parsimonious explanation for variations in STI incidence over time and between populations.">

  "description": "Background: The incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been noted to vary dramatically between population groups and over time. Here, the hypothesis that changes in network connectivity underpin these changes is explored.
Methods: The incidence/prevalence estimates of HIV, herpes simplex virus-2, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea, as well as two markers of sexual network connectivity (partner concurrency and multiple partnering) by ethnic group and sexual orientation in Kenya, South Africa, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (USA) were extracted from published studies. Pearson&rsquo;s correlation was used to test the association between the markers of network connectivity and the incidence/prevalence of these five STIs. A literature review was performed to evaluate the possible causes of the increases and decreases in syphilis incidence over the past 60 years.
Results: In each country, the five STIs were found to cluster in particular ethnic groups and sexual orientations and to be positively associated with the two markers of network connectivity. Syphilis incidence in the UK and USA was found to increase dramatically in the 1960s/1970s, decline in the 1980s and again increase in the late 1990s. These changes took place predominantly in men who have sex with men, and were preceded by corresponding changes in network connectivity. The large decline in antenatal syphilis prevalence in Kenya and South Africa in the 1990s were likewise preceded by declines in network connectivity.
Conclusions: Although other explanatory variables are not controlled for, the present analysis is compatible with the hypothesis that differential network connectivity is a parsimonious explanation for variations in STI incidence over time and between populations."

Here, the hypothesis that changes in network connectivity underpin these changes is explored.<br/> <b>Methods:</b> The incidence/prevalence estimates of HIV, herpes simplex virus-2, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea, as well as two markers of sexual network connectivity (partner concurrency and multiple partnering) by ethnic group and sexual orientation in Kenya, South Africa, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (USA) were extracted from published studies. Pearson’s correlation was used to test the association between the markers of network connectivity and the incidence/prevalence of these five STIs. A literature review was performed to evaluate the possible causes of the increases and decreases in syphilis incidence over the past 60 years.<br/> <b>Results:</b> In each country, the five STIs were found to cluster in particular ethnic groups and sexual orientations and to be positively associated with the two markers of network connectivity. Syphilis incidence in the UK and USA was found to increase dramatically in the 1960s/1970s, decline in the 1980s and again increase in the late 1990s. These changes took place predominantly in men who have sex with men, and were preceded by corresponding changes in network connectivity. The large decline in antenatal syphilis prevalence in Kenya and South Africa in the 1990s were likewise preceded by declines in network connectivity.<br/> <b>Conclusions:</b> Although other explanatory variables are not controlled for, the present analysis is compatible with the hypothesis that differential network connectivity is a parsimonious explanation for variations in STI incidence over time and between populations. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> network connectivity, STI, syphilis, gonorrhoea, herpes simplex virus-2, HIV, chlamydia, epidemiology </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Chris Kenyon (<a href="mailto:chriskenyon0@gmail.com">chriskenyon0@gmail.com</a>) </div> </div> <div class="margin-top margin-bottom float-left"> <button id=close-popup-window class=general-white-orange-button>Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-corresponding-author> <b>Corresponding author:</b> Chris Kenyon </span> <div class=clearfix></div> </span> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom competing-interests-display"> <span class=competing-interests-title>Competing interests:</span> No competing interests were disclosed. </span> <div class="info-separation padding-bottom grant-information-display"> <span class=grant-information-title>Grant information:</span> The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work. </div> <span class="f1r-article-desk info-separation padding-bottom"> <span class="copywrite-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-100_open_access"></span> </span> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-copyright-text> <b>Copyright:</b>&nbsp; © 2020 Kenyon C.

Not infrequently the incidence of specific STIs varies by an order of magnitude or more between ethnic groups and between groups defined according to sexual orientation<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>–<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Furthermore, over the past century, there have also been numerous examples of dramatic changes in the incidence of specific STIs. The incidence of syphilis in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States (USA), for example, was high in the 1970s, but declined dramatically in the early 1980s only to return to 1970s levels more recently (<a href="#f1">Figure 1</a>)<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. In this paper we test the hypothesis that differences in the connectivity of local sexual networks play an important role explaining these cross sectional and longitudinal variations in STI incidence<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Although the connectivity of local sexual networks is determined by a number of parameters, we focus on two of the most important - the rate of partner change and the proportion of partnerships that run concurrently<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Previous analyses have typically found that one, or a combination of markers of network connectivity, are raised in populations with a higher prevalence of a particular STI<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. These studies have however typically been limited to single countries and frequently only investigated variations in a single STI and either considered variations between ethnic groups or sexual orientations but not both<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>–<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Global country-level analyses have produced a mix bag of results with a small number of studies<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup> finding positive associations between markers of network connectivity and STI prevalence, and a larger number finding no association<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a>–<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is a type of misclassification bias that could be termed a ‘fruit salad bias’<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. It is increasingly appreciated that each country is made up of a number of sexual networks (defined by sexual orientation, ethnicity, class, religion etc.) that interconnect to varying degrees<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup>. If the connectivity of these sexual networks is a major determinant of STI prevalence, then it would be most appropriate to compare the association between network connectivity and STI prevalence between sub-populations of sexual networks within a country rather than combining them all into one national population (fruit salad) as a number of studies have done<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>.</p><a name=f1 class=n-a></a><div class="fig panel clearfix"><a target=_blank href="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/27545/11570eb8-f0a7-42ea-96bd-7e0c436707f1_figure1.gif"><img alt="11570eb8-f0a7-42ea-96bd-7e0c436707f1_figure1.gif" src="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/27545/11570eb8-f0a7-42ea-96bd-7e0c436707f1_figure1.gif"></a><div class=caption><h3>Figure 1.

We expanded the previously conducted analyses of this association in four ways. Firstly, we assessed this association in four countries: two high income countries (the United Kingdom [UK] and [USA]) where STIs are predominantly concentrated in MSM and certain ethnic groups and two low/middle income countries that have been affected by generalized HIV epidemics (Kenya and South Africa) but where certain ethnic groups have largely escaped this epidemic. Secondly, in each country we assess this association at the levels of both ethnic groups and MSM versus heterosexuals. Thirdly, we assess this association in five STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, HIV, herpes simplex virus-2 [HSV-2] and syphilis). Fourthly, we conduct longitudinal analyses over the past 60 years to assess if increases and decreases in syphilis incidence and prevalence are preceded by corresponding changes in network connectivity.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d11254e283>Methods</h2><div class=section><a name=d11254e286 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Data sources</h3><p class="" id=d11254e291>A search was conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar on 15 February 2020 using the following terms: ‘chlamydia’, ‘gonorrhoea’, ‘HIV’, ‘HSV-2’, ‘syphilis’, ‘concurrency’, 'multiple partnering’, ‘Kenya’, ‘South Africa’, ‘UK’, ‘United Kingdom’, ‘USA’, ‘United States’, ‘men who have sex with men’, “MSM”.</p><p class="" id=d11254e294><b><i>Cross sectional STI data.</i></b> The incidence and prevalence estimates of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, HIV, HSV-2, syphilis, concurrency and multiple partnering in Kenya, South Africa, the UK, and USA were extracted from published studies, as detailed in <a href="#T1">Table 1</a> and <a href="#T2">Table 2</a>.

In the UK, concurrency referred to the percentage of men who reported any overlapping sexual relationships in the past year<sup><a href="#ref-39">39</a></sup>. In the comparisons of sexual orientations, for the USA, concurrency was defined as the respondent reporting two or more sexual partnerships with overlapping dates in the prior year<sup><a href="#ref-50">50</a></sup>. As far as the UK was concerned, this referred to the proportion reporting overlapping sexual partnerships at any point in the past 5 years<sup><a href="#ref-51">51</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d11254e1214><i>Multiple partners:</i> For the ethnic group comparisons, the prevalence of multiple partners was defined as the percentage of men (15–49 years old) who reported having two or more sex partners in the last year. In the UK, this variable was not reported by ethnic group. As a result, multiple partnering here refers to the percentage of men who reported one or more new heterosexual relationship in the prior year. For the MSM vs. heterosexual comparisons, this variable referred to the mean lifetime number of sexual partners reported by respondents in the UK (aged 16–74) and the USA (aged 35–39).</p><p class="" id=d11254e1220>These variations in definitions between studies mean it would be appropriate to compare these variables between studies.

There is however a high correlation between region of residence and ethnic group, with large differences in STI incidence and sexual behaviour between regions<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup>. We therefore follow the approach used in previous studies and use region of residence as a proxy for ethnic group<sup><a href="#ref-31">31</a>,<a href="#ref-54">54</a></sup>.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d11254e1248 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Statistical analysis</h3><p class="" id=d11254e1253>We report the incidence/prevalence of the five STIs, multiple partnering and concurrency by ethnic group (all four countries) and MSM vs. heterosexuals in each country with available data (UK and USA). Where this data is provided, we report 95% confidence intervals. We used the Chi-squared test to assess if there was a difference in incidence/prevalence between the subgroups with the highest and lowest incidence/prevalence values in each country. For continuous variables (lifetime number of partners) the Man-Whitney U test was used. The correlation between the prevalence of the different STIs per subgroup in each country, and between the prevalence of each STI and the two behavioural variables was calculated using Pearson’s correlation. Because of the small sample sizes (between 2 and 8), tests of statistical significance were not performed for these calculations. In the case of UK and USA, the STI data is presented as an estimated incidence per 100 000 per year without reporting the number of cases and the total size of the study populations. As a result, we did not test if the association between the prevalence of each STI and each of the markers of network connectivity is statistically significant. The key differences were however large, which allows substantive inferences to be drawn. Where data was only provided in graphical form, we digitized the data using GetData Graph Digitizer version 2.26. STATA v15.2 was used for all analyses (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).</p></div><div class=section><a name=d11254e1257 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Longitudinal association between network connectivity and syphilis prevalence/incidence</h3><p class="" id=d11254e1262>A literature review was performed to evaluate the possible causes of increases and decreases in syphilis incidence in each subpopulation. We used a narrative approach here to evaluate if there was evidence from the literature that increases and decreases in syphilis prevalence were preceded by corresponding changes in markers of network connectivity. The approach adopted was not to perform a systematic review or a quantitative analysis, but rather to assess if there is evidence in the literature that corroborates or refutes the network connectivity hypothesis.</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d11254e1269>Results</h2><div class=section><a name=d11254e1272 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Cross sectional analyses</h3><p class="" id=d11254e1277><b><i>Kenya</i></b></p><p class="" id=d11254e1282><b>Ethnic group</b></p><p class="" id=d11254e1286>HIV prevalence varied 15-fold between 0.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-4%) in the North East and 13.9% (95% CI 11.0-17.9%) in Nyanza (<a href="#f2">Figure 2</a>; <a href="#T1">Table 1</a>, <a href="#T4">Table 4</a> &amp; <a href="#T7">Table 7</a>).

The incidence remained fairly stable in heterosexuals. Although quantitative data is very limited from this period, a number of analyses attributed this increased incidence in MSM to behavioural factors, such as increases in rates of partner change<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-49">49</a>,<a href="#ref-55">55</a>,<a href="#ref-56">56</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d11254e4425>In the early 1980s, incidence plummeted in MSM in both countries<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The AIDS epidemic played a large role in this decline. Individuals most centrally placed in sexual networks were more likely to die from AIDs, which resulted in a fragmentation of sexual networks<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-57">57</a></sup>. So too reductions in multiple partnering and increases in condom use both served to reduce effective network connectivity<sup><a href="#ref-49">49</a>,<a href="#ref-58">58</a></sup>. From around 2000, the incidence of syphilis has been increasing in both countries and this increase has been largely limited to MSM<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. A very similar trend has been evident for MSM in the UK for chlamydia and gonorrhoea where reasonable surveillance data is available and is likely the case in the USA where surveillance data is less detailed as regards sexual orientation<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-44">44</a></sup>. In both countries, numerous lines of evidence suggest that the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy from 1996 onwards together with other factors resulted in increases in sexual network connectivity, which was in turn responsible for these increases in STI incidence<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-48">48</a></sup>. Reduced deaths from AIDS, increases in rates of partner change and reductions in condom usage all played a role in this reconstitution of network connectivity<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-48">48</a>,<a href="#ref-58">58</a>,<a href="#ref-59">59</a>–<a href="#ref-61">61</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d11254e4487><b><i>Kenya and South Africa.</i></b> The prevalence of antenatal syphilis in both Kenya and South Africa was between 5 and 12% in the pre-HIV period (<a href="#f4">Figure 4</a>; <a href="#T3">Table 3</a> and <a href="#T4">Table 4</a>). A number of analyses attributed this high prevalence of syphilis to a number of factors that included behaviours that translate into dense sexual networks<sup><a href="#ref-45">45</a>,<a href="#ref-62">62</a>,<a href="#ref-63">63</a></sup>.

Using a range of data sources and study methodologies, a number of analyses have concluded that a combination of connectivity-reducing factors was responsible: reductions in multiple partnering (number of partners and concurrency), delayed sexual debut, increased condom usage and the effect of AIDS mortality removing more centrally placed transmission nodes<sup><a href="#ref-45">45</a>,<a href="#ref-62">62</a>,<a href="#ref-65">65</a>–<a href="#ref-67">67</a></sup>.</p><a name=f4 class=n-a></a><div class="fig panel clearfix"><a target=_blank href="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/27545/11570eb8-f0a7-42ea-96bd-7e0c436707f1_figure4.gif"><img alt="11570eb8-f0a7-42ea-96bd-7e0c436707f1_figure4.gif" src="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/27545/11570eb8-f0a7-42ea-96bd-7e0c436707f1_figure4.gif"></a><div class=caption><h3>Figure 4. Prevalence of antenatal syphilis (red circles) and HIV (black squares) in South Africa and Kenya the United States between 1990 and 2012.</h3></div></div></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d11254e4555>Discussion</h2><p class="" id=d11254e4558>Our analysis confirmed previous analyses of dramatic variations in STI prevalence between populations<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>–<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. A strong tendency towards clustering of STIs within subpopulations was evident. Furthermore, the cross-sectional variations in STI prevalence were almost all positively associated with two markers of network connectivity. In a similar vein, dramatic increases and declines in syphilis incidence could also be explained by corresponding changes in network connectivity. Taken together these findings suggest that network connectivity could represent a parsimonious explanation for both variations in STI incidence between populations and over time.</p><p class="" id=d11254e4568>There are however a number of caveats to bear in mind. Our study evaluated only 4 out of over 200 countries, and the data it used was limited in a number of ways. Not all the data was from nationally representative samples. The data also came from different and limited time periods. The way the behavioural variables were defined varied between studies and in the case of Kenya, region was used as a proxy for ethnic group. For the sake of simplicity, we focused on male sexual behaviours. On the one hand, our analysis is purely ecological and therefore susceptible to the ecological inference fallacy. On the other hand, the prevalence of STIs is to a large extent a function of network level properties. Networks are inherently ecological level entities and thus ecological analyses are appropriate and necessary forms of analysis. We assume that there is a degree of segregation of sexual network by ethnic group or sexual orientation. A high degree of sexual partner homophily by ethnic group has indeed been shown for Kenya, South Africa and the USA<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-69">69</a>,<a href="#ref-70">70</a></sup>. We could find no analyses investigating this type of homophily in the UK. If there was little or none of this type of homophily, this would however result in a homogenization of STI incidence between ethnic groups and would therefore be expected to reduce the strength of the association between STIs and behaviours by ethnic group.</p><p class="" id=d11254e4587>A further crucial weakness is that we did not control for potential confounders. The prevalence of circumcision and condom use are two examples of factors that could confound our analyses. Other papers have, however, evaluated this question and concluded that these are likely to be only one of many determinants of differential STI prevalence<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a>,<a href="#ref-65">65</a></sup>. For example, in South Africa, the highest STI prevalence ethnic group has been noted to have considerably higher circumcision rates and use of condoms than the two lower STI prevalence populations<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-65">65</a></sup>. Likewise, rates of condom usage are typically higher in MSM than heterosexuals<sup><a href="#ref-50">50</a></sup> and as far as we can ascertain, the prevalence of circumcision does not differ significantly between these two populations. A further limitation is that we have not controlled for other differences between MSM and heterosexual sexual networks such as the impact of role-versatility in MSM<sup><a href="#ref-71">71</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d11254e4618>These limitations mean that we cannot conclude how generalizable our findings are or even if the associations we found are causal. What we can conclude is that our results are compatible with the network connectivity explanation. We cannot exclude the possibility that other unmeasured variables are the predominant cause.</p><p class="" id=d11254e4622>Our findings are however logical if we recall that the number of sexual contacts per unit time is a key determinant of the rate of spread of an STI<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. So too increases in concurrency have been shown to lead to non-linear increases in sexual network connectivity<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-72">72</a></sup>. A number of mathematical modelling studies from the USA and South Africa have established that the actual self-reported differences in number of partners and concurrency between ethnic groups in the USA and South Africa were able to explain a large part of the differential spread of HIV in these populations<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-65">65</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d11254e4643>A strength of our analysis is its finding that the association between network connectivity and STI prevalence held in four different countries for both comparisons by ethnic group and MSM versus heterosexuals. In the case of Kenya, all the ethnic groups/regions, including those with very low STI rates, were ‘black’ Africans. The association was found for five different STIs and in the case of syphilis, was able to explain longitudinal changes in incidence. These findings do not fit with racial theories that biological differences between races explain differential STI spread<sup><a href="#ref-73">73</a></sup>. They fit better with sociological explanations that differences in sexual behaviours result in differences in network connectivity and consequent STI incidence<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-74">74</a></sup>. Furthermore, they suggest that behaviour change is possible and can result in rapid reductions in STI incidence. In fact, if network connectivity is a key determinant of STI incidence then it follows that reducing network connectivity would be an optimal way to effect radical STI prevention. Whilst high STI prevalence populations would first need to decide if they wanted to change behaviours that enhance connectivity, there are a number of positive precedents for this. Uganda’s ‘Zero grazing’ campaign was credited with large scaled reductions in multiple partnering and a subsequent decline in HIV prevalence<sup><a href="#ref-75">75</a></sup>. Similar campaigns amongst MSM in the 1980s had a similar effect<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-57">57</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d11254e4668>These insights are relevant in the current setting of increasing incidence of numerous STIs in high income countries<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. A number of analyses have found that a large proportion of these increases are occurring in MSM with high rates of partner change and particularly in contemporary HIV pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) recipients<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-38">38</a>,<a href="#ref-76">76</a></sup>. It is not unusual for PrEP recipients to report a median of 12 partners (IQR 6–25) per 3 months<sup><a href="#ref-77">77</a></sup>. Unsurprisingly these translate into very high STI incidence - the combined incidence of gonorrhoea, chlamydia and syphilis can be up to 169 per 100 person years<sup><a href="#ref-78">78</a></sup>. Tackling this high incidence via intensive screening and treating without addressing the underlying cause may result in antimicrobial resistance<sup><a href="#ref-79">79</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d11254e4697>Further studies are required to further elucidate the links between norms, structural factors, behaviour, sexual networks and STI incidence. In the interim, the type of evidence reviewed here suggests that reducing STI incidence/prevalence in high prevalence populations to those of low prevalence population may be difficult without reducing network connectivity.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d11254e4703>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d11254e4706 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d11254e4711>All data underlying the results are available as part of the article and no additional source data are required (see <a href="#T1">Table 1</a>–<a href="#T3">Table 3</a> and <a href="#T7">Table 7</a>).</p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d11254e4728 class=n-a></a><span class="research-layout prime-recommended-wrapper reference-heading is-hidden"><span class=faculty-opinion-icon></span><span class="prime-red big">Faculty Opinions recommended</span></span><h2 class=main-title id=d11725>References</h2><div class="section ref-list"><a name=d11254e4728 class=n-a></a><ul><li><a name=ref-1 class=n-a></a><span class=label>1. </span>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d11254e4735 class=n-a></a>Unemo M, Bradshaw CS, Hocking JS, <i> et al.</i>: Sexually transmitted infections: challenges ahead. <i>Lancet Infect Dis.</i> 2017;
