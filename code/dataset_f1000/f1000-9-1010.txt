            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: The aim of this paper is to investigate the associations between polymorphisms in the BDNF , COMT , and HTR2A genes with peculiarity of visual perception. In particular, how the carriers of different genotypes of Indicated genes emotionally evaluating visual scenes with distinct second-order features (images modulated by contrast) and how corresponding process is reflected in event-related brain activity (ERP). 
 Methods: The study involved students who underwent PCR-based genetic analysis with the release of BDNF , COMT , and HTR2A genotypes. Participants were asked to emotionally assesse the specific stimuli &ndash; visual scenes that were generated from contrast modulations. At the same time the EEG were recorded using a 128-electrodes system. The average frequency of responses and ERPs for different emotional evaluations (negative, neutral and positive) were analyzed. 
 Results: The study showed the BDNF Val/Val polymorphism was associated with the increase in the P2 amplitude in the occipital regions compared to the Val/Met genotype regardless of emotional evaluation. The COMT Met/Met genotype polymorphism associated with the increase of N170 negativity in the occipital regions during evaluation task. The HTR2A polymorphism A/A associated with increase in the P1 amplitude when positive or negative assessment were chosen, and decrease of later positive peak when neutral evaluation was chosen. 
 Conclusions: The results suggested that emotional evaluation and recognition of visual scenes with distinct second-order features, as well as various strategies for processing visual information, reflected in amplitude and latency of different ERPs components and associated with the different genotypes of BDNF , COMT , and HTR2A genes. The indicated interconnections can act as genetic basis of individualize the mechanisms of visual perception.">

  "description": "Background: The aim of this paper is to investigate the associations between polymorphisms in the BDNF, COMT, and HTR2A genes with peculiarity of visual perception. In particular, how the carriers of different genotypes of Indicated genes emotionally evaluating visual scenes with distinct second-order features (images modulated by contrast) and how corresponding process is reflected in event-related brain activity (ERP).
Methods: The study involved students who underwent PCR-based genetic analysis with the release of BDNF, COMT, and HTR2A genotypes. Participants were asked to emotionally assesse the specific stimuli &ndash; visual scenes that were generated from contrast modulations. At the same time the EEG were recorded using a 128-electrodes system. The average frequency of responses and ERPs for different emotional evaluations (negative, neutral and positive) were analyzed.
Results: The study showed the BDNF Val/Val polymorphism was associated with the increase in the P2 amplitude in the occipital regions compared to the Val/Met genotype regardless of emotional evaluation. The COMT Met/Met genotype polymorphism associated with the increase of N170 negativity in the occipital regions during evaluation task. The HTR2A polymorphism A/A associated with increase in the P1 amplitude when positive or negative assessment were chosen, and decrease of later positive peak when neutral evaluation was chosen.
Conclusions: The results suggested that emotional evaluation and recognition of visual scenes with distinct second-order features, as well as various strategies for processing visual information, reflected in amplitude and latency of different ERPs components and associated with the different genotypes of BDNF, COMT, and HTR2A genes. The indicated interconnections can act as genetic basis of individualize the mechanisms of visual perception."

In particular, how the carriers of different genotypes of Indicated genes emotionally evaluating visual scenes with distinct second-order features (images modulated by contrast) and how corresponding process is reflected in event-related brain activity (ERP).<br/> <b>Methods:</b> The study involved students who underwent PCR-based genetic analysis with the release of <i>BDNF</i>, <i>COMT</i>, and <i>HTR2A</i> genotypes. Participants were asked to emotionally assesse the specific stimuli – visual scenes that were generated from contrast modulations. At the same time the EEG were recorded using a 128-electrodes system. The average frequency of responses and ERPs for different emotional evaluations (negative, neutral and positive) were analyzed.<br/> <b>Results:</b> The study showed the <i>BDNF</i> Val/Val polymorphism was associated with the increase in the P2 amplitude in the occipital regions compared to the Val/Met genotype regardless of emotional evaluation. The <i>COMT</i> Met/Met genotype polymorphism associated with the increase of N170 negativity in the occipital regions during evaluation task. The <i>HTR2A</i> polymorphism A/A associated with increase in the P1 amplitude when positive or negative assessment were chosen, and decrease of later positive peak when neutral evaluation was chosen.<br/> <b>Conclusions:</b> The results suggested that emotional evaluation and recognition of visual scenes with distinct second-order features, as well as various strategies for processing visual information, reflected in amplitude and latency of different ERPs components and associated with the different genotypes of <i>BDNF</i>, <i>COMT</i>, and <i>HTR2A</i> genes. The indicated interconnections can act as genetic basis of individualize the mechanisms of visual perception. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Second-order visual features, BDNF gene, COMT gene, HTR2A gene, visual scenes, visual perception, emotions, event-related potentials, emotional assessment </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Alexander S.

In particular, second-order visual features – non-local characteristics of the perceived image, which including various options for contrast, orientation, and spatial frequency – are of special interest to human’s visual system researchers (<a href="#ref-7">Babenko <i>et al</i>., 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-6">Babenko <i>et al</i>., 2016</a>) These features are image regions characterized by spatial heterogeneities of brightness gradients – the first-order characteristics. These heterogeneities are distinguished by the so-called second-order filters, which detect regions with spatial modulations of contrast, orientation, and spatial frequency in the images. First-order visual mechanisms form the basis for subsequent spatial grouping. This is a multi-channel system that performs local analysis of the orientation of the brightness gradients at various spatial frequencies. Second-order visual mechanisms detect spatial changes and represent a certain set of filters.</p><p class="" id=d12669e307>A number of experimental studies demonstrated that second-order visual mechanisms are selective towards modulations of contrast, orientation (surface curvature) and spatial frequency (depth) and have different cortical localization. The search for second-order stimuli is pre-attentive (<a href="#ref-62">Yavna &amp; Babenko, 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-63">Yavna <i>et al</i>., 2012</a>).</p><p class="" id=d12669e319>Second-order features are known to play an important role in identifying images. The studies aimed at studying the role of second-order visual mechanisms in the recognition of emotional stimuli (especially scenes) are of particular importance today. Scenes are complex visual stimuli. Compared to the mechanisms of visual perception of faces and objects, little attention has been devoted to studying the brain mechanisms underlying processing of scenes (<a href="#ref-1">Aftanas <i>et al</i>., 2001</a>; <a href="#ref-14">Codispoti <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-16">Delplanque <i>et al</i>., 2004</a>; <a href="#ref-40">Mavratzakis <i>et al</i>., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-43">Olofsson <i>et al</i>., 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-45">Pegna <i>et al</i>., 2004</a>). Due to the fact that the human visual system often recognizes the scenes as combinations of images that include various elements, the study of these mechanisms can help us to clarify our understanding of the process of visual perception <i>in vivo</i>.</p><p class="" id=d12669e362>At the same time, we should take into account the influence of individual characteristics on the processes of visual perception. These may include psychological and biological characteristics. The genetic factors in the individualization of visual perception, i.e. genes that can affect the mechanisms of visual perception of images (including emotional scenes) are the catechol-o-methyltransferase (<i>COMT</i>) gene, the brain derived neurotrophic factor (<i>BDNF</i>) gene, the serotonin receptor gene (<i>HTR2A</i>), etc. In the science periodicals numerous studies examine the associations between these genes and individual psychological characteristics, including emotional intelligence, aggression, anxiety, and neuroplasticity and describe neurochemical processes characteristic to carriers of various genotypes. However, the influence of genes on the processes of visual perception, including the mechanisms for recognizing and evaluating (appraising) emotional visual stimuli (scenes) with the distinct second-order features are poorly described. This fact determined the topic of the present investigation. Let us now consider in more detail the functions of these genes.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d12669e377><i>BDNF</i> - the brain derived neurotrophic factor gene</h2><p class="" id=d12669e382><i>BDNF</i> is a key molecule involved in the plastic changes associated with learning and memory. The <i>BDNF</i> stimulates the growth of neurons, axons, and dendrites, the formation of synapses and other processes of neuroplasticity not only in early ontogenesis, but also in the brain of the adult organism (<a href="#ref-5">Antal <i>et al</i>., 2010</a>). Changes in <i>BDNF</i> expression in the brain structures involved in memory functions and perception processes (<a href="#ref-41">Miranda <i>et al</i>., 2019</a>) are associated with human normal and pathological aging, as well as with mental illness. Together with other neurotrophic factors, <i>BDNF</i> plays an important role in the processes of adaptation of brain neurons to various external impacts influences, as well as in their growth, differentiation, and survival (<a href="#ref-47">Popova <i>et al</i>., 2017</a>).</p><p class="" id=d12669e415>It is established that visual experience in the early postnatal period affects the maturation of the visual cortex. Furthermore, it was investigated the characteristics of maturation and plasticity of the visual cortex in mice with elevated level of <i>BDNF</i> (<a href="#ref-31">Huang <i>et al</i>., 1999</a>). Under experimental conditions of visual deprivation, the authors found that <i>BDNF</i> overexpression is sufficient for the development of normal activity of the visual cortex in the absence of visual experience.

Neutral, positive, and negative judgments of visual stimuli are associated with a significantly higher positivity of the P2 component in the occipital electrodes, which may be explained by the fact that compared to the carriers of <i>BDNF</i> Val/Met genotype the carriers of the <i>BDNF</i> Val/Val genotype consumed large brain resources for recognition and differentiation of stimuli, experiencing difficulties in the implementation of these processes. Moreover, brain activity in the anterior and central areas is more pronounced in carriers of the Val/Met genotype. We obtained similar results in previous series of the experiment (during recognition of unprocessed visual stimuli), which may indicate that the Met allele of the <i>BDNF</i> gene is associated with more efficient processes of recognition of emotional scenes (<a href="#ref-17">Ermakov <i>et al</i>., 2017</a>). This feature can be explained by a more intense activation of the structures of the limbic system (<a href="#ref-58">Vorobyeva <i>et al</i>., 2019</a>) and stronger functional cortico-limbic bonds (<a href="#ref-37">Loewenstern <i>et al</i>., 2019</a>), activated during recognition of facial expression in carriers of the Met allele of the <i>BDNF</i> gene.</p><p class="" id=d12669e1602>According to our results, when judging the stimulus as negative, neutral, or positive negativity was reliably expressed in 110–175 ms (i.e., there is a higher, more negative amplitude of the N170 component) in the occipital electrodes in carriers of the <i>COMT</i> Met/Met genotype.</p><p class="" id=d12669e1608>This aspect may be related to the fact that, when evaluating scenes with distinct second-order features, the carriers of the <i>COMT</i> Met/Met genotype primarily pay attention to the facial expression of individuals depicted in the stimulus pictures and assess the emotional valence of the stimulus based on these data (<a href="#ref-18">Eimer &amp; Holmes, 2007</a>). However, this process consumes more brain resources to recognize faces emotional expression.</p><p class="" id=d12669e1617>According to a number of studies, carriers of the <i>COMT</i> Met/Met genotype have higher indices of emotional intelligence (<a href="#ref-34">Kosonogov <i>et al</i>., 2019</a>), more successfully differentiate and express emotions (<a href="#ref-24">Gohier <i>et al</i>., 2014a</a>). Carriers of the <i>COMT</i> Met/Met genotype more decently respond to positive stimuli. The Val/Val genotype is associated with less intense feelings in negative experience, i.e. their level of life satisfaction is less dependent on external events (<a href="#ref-35">Kovalenko &amp; Pavlenko, 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-53">Shield <i>et al</i>., 2004</a>)</p><p class="" id=d12669e1649>The <i>HTR2A</i> G/G genotype is associated with a significantly more frequent evaluation of stimuli with distinct second-order features as neutral ones, as well as with a significantly rarer assessed of stimuli as positive ones.

These results may indicate that carriers of A/A genotype consume more brain resources at the stage of distinguishing of a significant stimulus among insignificant ones, experiencing difficulties in the implementation of this process (difficulties in pre-attentive processing; component P1 is associated with selectivity of attention), and less resources are consumed duding categorization and conscious evaluation of the emotional content of stimuli (<a href="#ref-35">Kovalenko &amp; Pavlenko, 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-46">Polich, 2012</a>).</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d12669e1664>Conclusions</h2><p class="" id=d12669e1667>The analysis of the electrical activity of the brain in carriers of various genotypes of the <i>BDNF</i>, <i>COMT</i>, and <i>HTR2A</i> genes when choosing different types of responses in attributing emotional valences to visual scenes processed by the filters with the distinct second-order features enabled us to draw the following conclusions.</p><div class=section><a name=d12669e1679 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>BDNF</h3><p class="" id=d12669e1684>1) In carriers of the Val/Val genotype the amplitude of the P2 component of visual event-related potentials in the occipital regions of the brain is higher than in carriers of the <i>BDNF</i> Val/Met genotype, regardless of the type of response chosen when evaluating the presented images.</p><p class="" id=d12669e1690>2) The highest ERP amplitude of the three possible assessments (positive, negative, neutral) was found in the response recorded in the neutral evaluation of the presented stimuli; this fact is valid for carriers of the <i>BDNF</i> Val/Val and Val/Met genotypes.</p><p class="" id=d12669e1696>3) Regardless of the type of stimuli, the participants chose responses of different modalities with approximately the same frequency.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d12669e1700 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>COMT</h3><p class="" id=d12669e1705>1) In the group of participants with the <i>COMT</i> Met/Met genotype for all the three types of responses (regardless the stimuli images) the induced brain activity is characterized by a significant increase in negativity in peak amplitude latency from 120 to 170 ms and occurs mainly in the occipital cortex brain.</p><p class="" id=d12669e1711>2) When carriers of Met/Met assessed the stimuli as negative the amplitude of this early ERP component is showed increasing negativity, compared with that when choosing neutral or positive responses.</p><p class="" id=d12669e1714>3) Met/Met genotype carriers statistically reliably chose neutral assessment more often and positive less often than carriers of other two genotypes.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d12669e1718 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>HTR2A</h3><p class="" id=d12669e1723>1) There were no statistically significant differences between the ERP waves in carriers of the <i>HTR2A</i> A/G and G/G genotypes, regardless of the choice of the emotional valences of responses.

This may be explained by the work of autonomous mechanisms operating at a pre-attentive stage of visual processing (<a href="#ref-8">Babenko &amp; Yavna, 2018</a>). At the same time, various genotypes are associated with varying degrees of success of the pre-attentive and conscious stages of processing emotional visual stimuli (scenes), which confirms the hypothesis that there are genetic factors that individualize the mechanisms of visual perception.</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d12669e1761>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d12669e1764 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d12669e1769>Open Science Framework: EEGLAB datasets for study of event-related potentials during categorization of emotionally-charged and neutral images with distinct second-order features in carriers of polymorphisms of the <i>COMT, HTR2A, BDNF</i> genes. <a target=xrefwindow href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PDHGZ" id=d12669e1774>https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PDHGZ</a> (<a href="#ref-55">Stoletniy <i>et al</i>., 2020a</a>).</p><p class="" id=d12669e1784>This project contains the follow underlying data:</p><div class=list><a name=d12669e1787 class=n-a></a><ul><li><p id=d12669e1791>1_Negative estimation (ERP datasets recorded when participant chose negative assessment of stimuli).</p></li><li><p id=d12669e1797>2_Neutral estimation (ERP datasets recorded when participant chose neutral assessment of stimuli).</p></li><li><p id=d12669e1803>3_Positive estimation (ERP datasets recorded when participant chose positive assessment of stimuli).</p></li><li><p id=d12669e1809>Data Characteristics.xlsx (detailed description of datasets files).</p></li><li><p id=d12669e1815>Data Description.docx (detailed description of experiment condition and datasets).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class=section><a name=d12669e1821 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Extended data</h3><p class="" id=d12669e1826>Open Science Framework: Stimuli database for studying emotional assessment of emotionally-charged images with distinct second-order features. <a target=xrefwindow href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WY2VF" id=d12669e1828>https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WY2VF</a> (<a href="#ref-36">Kovsh &amp; Yavna, 2020</a>).</p><p class="" id=d12669e1835>This project contains all visual stimuli provided for this study, alongside a data description list of the image features.</p><p class="" id=d12669e1838>Data are available under the terms of the <a target=xrefwindow href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" id=d12669e1840>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a> (CC-BY 4.0).</p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d12669e1849 class=n-a></a><span class="research-layout prime-recommended-wrapper reference-heading is-hidden"><span class=faculty-opinion-icon></span><span class="prime-red big">Faculty Opinions recommended</span></span><h2 class=main-title id=d13114>References</h2><div class="section ref-list"><a name=d12669e1849 class=n-a></a><ul><li><a name=ref-1 class=n-a></a>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d12669e1853 class=n-a></a>Aftanas LI, Varlamov AA, Pavlov SV, <i> et al.</i>: Affective picture processing: Event-related synchronization within individually defined human theta band is modulated by valence dimension. <i>Neurosci Lett.</i> 2001; <b>303</b>(2): 115–118. <a target=xrefwindow id=d12669e1864 href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11311506">PubMed Abstract </a> | <a target=xrefwindow id=d12669e1867 href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0304-3940(01)01703-7">Publisher Full Text </a></span></li><li><a name=ref-2 class=n-a></a>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d12669e1873 class=n-a></a>Alekseeva D, Ermakov P, Babenko V, <i> et al.</i>: Studying the Functional Equivalence of Mechanisms for Emotion Perception and Emotion Generation by Means of Evoked Potentials [Issledovanie s pomoshh’ju vyzvannyh potencialov funkcional’noj jekvivalentnosti mehanizmov vosprijatija i generacii jemocij]. <i>Russian Psychological Journal.</i> 2017; <b>14</b>(4): 97–120. </span></li><li><a name=ref-3 class=n-a></a>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d12669e1888 class=n-a></a>Alfimova MV, Golimbet VE: Genes and neurophysiological characteristics of cognitive processes: A research review [Geny i nejrofiziologicheskie pokazateli kognitivnyh processov: Obzor issledovanij]. <i>I.P.
