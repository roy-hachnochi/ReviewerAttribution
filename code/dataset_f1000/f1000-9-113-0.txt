Baltruschat and Czodrowski report on the development of a Python-based tool for the prediction of pk a values. The tool is made available open source and will certainly be useful to the scientific community. Could the authors please comment on the structural relationship between the training and the test data (how far apart are these datasets, e.g. measured by the distribution of pairwise Tanimoto coefficients based on molecular fingerprints)? Could the authors please confirm statistical significance of the key statements made in the first paragraph of the Results section, starting with "This shows that our model slightly outcompetes..."? In the Abstract, please name the open source model that was tested as part of the comparative performance analysis. It is not clear from the manuscript text whether capillary electrophoresis and potentiometric measurements were the only two experimental methods considered in this work (or, for the Novartis dataset only). Please revise the sentence starting with "We also compare the overlap...". "make use of a" should be replaced by "makes use of a". Please explain where DataWarrior's data originates from. Please comment on the outliers observed in Figure 2. Please explain the procedure that was followed to ensure that there was no overlap between the training data and the external validation sets (the Novartis dataset in particular). "isomeric SMILES": is it canonical as well? Avoid using "you" in the Implementation section (use "one [can]..." instead). The part starting with "For the two external test sets..." is difficult to read. Could the authors find a more simple way to describe this and enable readers to compare the individual values more easily?
