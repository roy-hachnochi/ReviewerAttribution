The article describes a machine learning method for pkA prediction. The presented method and results are scientifically solid. Therefore, I recommend the article for indexing. However, the methods and results should be presented more clearly before the article is indexed. The following points should be addressed: Past tense should be used consistently to describe the methods and results. The “different experimental methods” should be moved to the results part as it contains results. A short description of the molecules in the self-compiled data set and the Novartis set should be added. What type of molecules are contained in these sets? Why does the user need to train the model before making predictions? Could the trained model be provided to make the developed tool easier to use? In the discussion section, the developed method should be first discussed before discussing its performance relative to other methods.
