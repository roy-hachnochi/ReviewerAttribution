This study investigated whether frequency modulation depth could moderate interaural temporal difference (ITD) thresholds. As modulation depth decreased from one ear to the other, interaural time-difference thresholds increased. This study makes a small but meaningful contribution to the ITD literature. Though the study was conducted in a sample of normal-hearing younger adults, the results have implications for hearing replacement devices (i.e., hearing aids and cochlear implants). I find the methods and statistical approach to be tangible and easily understood. Though the authors address the concern in the manuscript, I am still concerned that the sample size is too small to be confident in the results. I would like to see this study replicated with a larger sample size in the future.
