The study is well structured and well executed. Methods are appropriately framed and signal processing is well defined. Literature indicate that ITD is drastically reduces from 1000-1500, so authors may consider filtering the signal 1500 than 2000 Hz (in case if it gives significant difference). Subject size is small, however it is discussed and justified. However, in future it can be done on larger population, so the head size differences would not lead to a large SD as seen in the current study. Overall well designed, with appropriate statistical analysis and well discussed.
