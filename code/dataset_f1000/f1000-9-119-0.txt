The article brings to light a very important issue with RA involving the upper airway. Here the description of involvement of cricoarytenoid arthritis and swelling secondary to RA is aptly done. I had written a paper indicating how RA involvement of the cervical vertebrae led to worsening of Sleep apnea. Unfortunately my patient did not have an endoscopy done to see if there was any swelling involved as described here. The obstruction here was severe enough leading to tracheostomy tube placement, which indicates a severe obstruction possibility which primary care physicians, ER and Rheumatologists should be aware of. Although the incidence is very rare, such complications do happen. The paper also brings out an interest fact that RA inflicted patients are at increased risk of Ventilator associated pneumonia secondary to their immunocomprised state from the medications. I concur that physicians taking care of patients with RA should be aware of any such complications that can arise and are potentially life threatening.
