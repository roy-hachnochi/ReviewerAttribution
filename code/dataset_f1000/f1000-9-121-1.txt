Dong et al. examined the available sequences of coronaviruses to depict the origin and the pathogenicity of 2019-nCoV that caused the current global pandemic. While the data presented in the manuscript could be of interest, several concerns need to be addressed. These concerns presented below. Major: Main findings in this study suggest that the new virus should theoretically not be able to cause very serious human disease as compared to other coronaviruses. The mechanism(s) of lowering the pathogenicity, increase human adaptation, or increase incubation times as compared to other strains are not explained, addressed, or cited. The epidemiological data are not explained, addressed, or cited. The reference for accession # MN908947, the very main isolate obtained from Wuhan, is repeatedly not cited. The center that obtained the isolate is not mentioned or cited. What is the exact sequence of the whole genome? Where is it referenced? Clear English writing/editing is needed throughout the paper. The limited human transmission potential needs to be explained and cited. The intermediate transmission vehicle for other coronaviruses, if exists, needs to be explained and cited. The relationship between sequence information and lower pathogenicity needs to be explained and cited. The relationship between sequence information, receptor binding, human adaptation, and mutations needs to be explained and cited.
