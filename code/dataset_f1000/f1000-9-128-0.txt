 Summary of the content: It should be mentioned that Kotroczo and co-workers present novel research findings considering that currently there is no iron concentration-related study published in the literature in the sampling area that examines differences in soil iron ion concentrations at different altitudional levels. As mentioned in the manuscript, this is especially useful for orchard-growers. The sampling area was well selected because of its specific location, as it is an inherit area, that is close to cultivated lands. The presented results may serve as control results for further agri- and/or horticultural studies. Also unexpected findings about the iron decrease may awaken researchers attention, and/or inspire a more complex research (i.e. genomic studies) in the examination area. Abstract: abstract is well written and informative. Keywords: I agree with Reviewer 1 Dr. Zsolt Kotroczo that Keywords should not include those words that also could be found in the title. Please consider to replace the following keywords: Iron, total iron, Ecuador , providing higher possibility for search engines to find the article. Introduction: One of the most challenged part of the evaluation process in case of Brief Report or Short Communications is the Introduction. Despite it is short, I believe that it consists relevant, and up-to-date research findings of the topic (mainly 2019-2020 content). Methods: Methods are well written, well referenced. I agree with Reviewer 1 about it would be more fortunate to provide detailed information about the sampling area. However, it is required to clarify soil/water ratio for pH measurement was 1:25 or 1:2.5? Please check first line of determination of soil properties in the methods section. Results and Discussion: Brief and straightforward. Consists of statistical results, supporting data is available as well. Conclusions: Summarizes and concludes from research findings correctly.
