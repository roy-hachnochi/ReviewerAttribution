Yu Wai Chen and co-workers presented a molecular modeling and docking study of the 3CL protease in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The manuscript started with comparing polyprotein PP1AB sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, based on which the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro protein was constructed. The authors then performed virtual screening against SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro using a library of 7173 purchasable drugs. Considering both binding affinities and known side effects, the authors recommend velpatasvir and ledipasvir, and further suggest combining them with another HCV RdRp inhibitor sofosbuvir, aka repurposing the Epclusa and Harvoni for treating the coronavirus. This is a concise and timely report, and has proposed new therapeutic possibilities for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The manuscript could be further improved by addressing the following comments. More details of the docking should be provided. What's the binding energy cutoff used? How is the hits (reported in Table 3) used? 3CLpro is catalytically active as a dimer. How is this considered in the virtual screening? What does the "(B Top scorers)" mean? In the extended data of virtual screening, one compound could have multiple entries with different ZINC numbers. For example hesperidin corresponds to at least 20 different compounds. What are the difference? And how are different results assembled? Table 1 is not clear. Please do a column-by-column comparison between different sites of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Also please add one-letter amino acid codes for the residues. The constructed protein structure is very similar to the recently solved crystal structure (6LU7), as "... confirms that the predicted model is good within experimental errors", but the docking results seem to differ significantly. Could the authors explain?
