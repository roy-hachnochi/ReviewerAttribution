The correspondence ‘Detection of compound heterozygous variants in LPIN1 does not necessarily imply pathogenicity in a patient with rhabdomyolysis’ by Josef Finsterer and Rahim Aliyev well argue against the conclusion of original submission ‘Case Report: The first probable Hong Kong Chinese case of LPIN1-related acute recurrent rhabdomyolysis in a boy with two novel variants’ by SW Yim and colleagues. In this submission, the authors are not sure which drug was administered to the patient prior to admission and Dr. Finisterer and Dr. Aliyev rightly point out that Rhabdomyolysis should not have necessarily be triggered by the LPIN1 mutations but might have been due to the effect of the compounds in the injection. SW Yim and colleagues should find out the composition of the injection and prove that rhabdomyolysis was not triggered by any of the compounds in the injection. On the other hand, it is very likely that the conclusion of SW Yim might be correct. Although the pathogenicity of the reported mutations is not clear, the compound heterozygosity might be the cause of rhabdomyolysis and the mutations are, in fact, pathogenic. This is strongly supported by the fact that the child suffered from the second attack of rhabdomyolysis. However, the report on detailed family history, as pointed out by Dr. Finisterer and Dr. Aliyev, will be helpful in arguments about the pathogenicity of the mutations. Despite autosomal recessive inheritance of LPIN1 mutations, the parent(s) with only one mutation might also suffer from attack(s) of rhabdomyolysis with very mild to severe intensity. Symptomatic heterozygous cases are sporadically reported in other autosomal recessive disorders such as CPT II deficiency, also contributing to rhabdomyolysis. Overall, the original submission is interesting but needs to address the points raised by Dr. Finisterer and Dr. Aliyev to draw the conclusion that rhabdomyolysis is triggered by novel LPIN1 mutations.
