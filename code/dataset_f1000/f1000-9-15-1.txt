I note the comments from Finsterer and Aliyev. I agree that it would be worth learning more about the first episode of rhabdomyolysis in this child who was confirmed to be compound heterozygous for two mutations causing LIPIN1. A causal relationship between this episode and the administered injection needs to be considered, and detail is given on what the injection was including dose, route, number of doses, indication, etc. This is a fundamental point that has not been addressed in the case report. Drug-induced rhabdomyolysis is relatively common. Although 40% of heterozygous carriers for LPIN1 missense mutations may be symptomatic, myopathy has been reported in these individuals in response to statin drug treatment (Zhang et al. 2014) 1 . The authors listed several factors that may trigger rhabdomyolysis in LIPIN1. The fact that in humans episodes of myoglobinuria in LIPIN1 are mostly precipitated by febrile illnesses (Michot et al. 2014) 2 emphasizes a critical role of the inflammatory stress response as a potential triggering factor of rhabdomyolysis. I agree with the authors that there are some limitations of the case report by Yim et al. 2019. Firstly, a CK of 127,000 U/L may have detrimental consequences in a toddler. Dexamethasone was shown to decrease the number of lipid droplets in lipin‚Äê1 deficient patients' myoblasts with a decrease in peak CK concentration during acute rhabdomyolysis. This therapy may prove to be beneficial for severe decompensation (Maijer et al. 2015) 3 . Was it considered during the acute illness? What about renal function and fluid management?
