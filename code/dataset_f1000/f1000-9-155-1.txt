It's a well written manuscript, but I have some suggestions: In abstract and introduction, it's better write " one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB)" instead of " one-anastomosis laparoscopic gastric bypass (OAGB)" In case presentation, you mentioned that the patient underwent sleeve gastrectomy! Sleeve or OAGB? Please clarify the surgical technique. There is not any strong evidence about rapid weight loss related nephropathy. How do you result in? Please clarify. How do you justify the relation between nephropathy and OAGB? Rapid weight loss if imaginary has a relation with rapid weight loss, it could happen in any type of weight loss therapies.
