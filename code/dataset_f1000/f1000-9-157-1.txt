To evaluate the user experience, I first downloaded and used the Omics Visualizer, following the on-line tutorial. The interface is intuitive (like how Cytoscape itself works), exposing just the right amount of information and options to the user. It is also clear to the user what the app does. The manuscript partially overlaps with but complements the on-line tutorial with background and some technical detail how the app integrates in Cytoscape. The Omics Visualizer fills a clear niche in the Cytoscape appverse, allowing tables to be imported surjectively (mapping multiple rows in the input to the same network node) as opposed to bijectively (with a one-to-one correspondence between the rows in the input table and nodes in the network). I suppose this could be achieved by manipulating tables (connecting row information in the data to columns in a node table) in R or Python, pushing the necessary data to Cytoscape through RCy3 or py2cytoscape (Omics Visualizer commands are also exposed via the Cytoscape REST API). But the Omics Visualizer is completely interactive and requires no scripting or formulae to be entered in the Cytoscape tables. The menus are clear and self-explanatory. The visualizer provides pie and donut visualizations for displaying multiple node attributes, such as post-translational modification sites and occupancy onto the same node. As would be expected from this team, Omics Visualizers also works well with the Cytoscape STRING app. I find this manuscript a very valuable companion to the app and on-line tutorial. The manuscript is very clearly written, and the length appropriate for the subject matter. I only have two minor comments: "3 o’clock angle" should be "3 o’clock position" (in the "Outer" and "Inner visualization" paragraphs)? The "Filter table rows" option referred to in the on-line tutorial is called "Filter table" in Cytoscape.
