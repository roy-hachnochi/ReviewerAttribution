The article presents new findings that support the existence of MIR828 in the pineapple genome and that this microRNA may be involved in regulating MYB target RNAs for silencing to affect fruit coloration differences between various pineapple species. The study is well described and provides some intriguing new insights that other plant scientists are likely to be interested in reading. The conclusions are well supported and these preliminary findings definitely hint that the hypothesis suggested by Dr. Rock that this microRNA – target interaction may affect fruit color in pineapple is definitely plausible. I only have minor suggestions for changes to the article which I list below: The phrase “MYB expressions” should be changed to “ MYB abundance” throughout the manuscript. The phrase “phasiRNA accumulations” should be changed to “phasiRNA accumulation”. The phrase “phylogenomics approaches” should be changed to “phylogenomic approaches”.
