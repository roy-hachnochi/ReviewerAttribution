This is a cross sectional study of the prevalence obesity and overweight amongst the lower 40% of a Malaysian population living in an urban government housing scheme. The methodology used was very appropriate a properly calculated sample size for the population, and using systemic sampling procedure with face to face interviews etc. The criteria used for overweight and obesity was also appropriate for the Asian/Malaysian population The data obtained included socio demographic data including income There was no data about the diet or food calorie intake nor of energy expenditure ie physical work, exercise etc The data obtained was interesting and novel in that it showed increased prevalence of obesity/overweight in the lower income group but the prevalence is less in this group if the income is higher. The prevalence is then compared to a recent nationwide prevalence survey by Aris et al. and showed higher prevalence compared to national average. The findings would have been improved if they had looked at the racial group involved compared to the national data, and to include the nutritional and dietary habits Overall a short interesting paper.
