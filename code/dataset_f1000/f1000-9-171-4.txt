It is a well executed review. There are a few suggestions which could improve the overall impact of the review: Adding a schematic summarizing the de-mineralization and re-mineralization of dental enamel would improve the overall impact of the article. Was this a systematic review? If not mention that it is a narrative review based on published literature. A table summarizing the various recent techniques in re-mineralization along with each of their advantages and limitations would be vital for the article. The article seems to end abruptly. Kindly add a couple of sentences on prospects of further research as the concluding sentence. The above-mentioned corrections are just suggestions to improve the overall quality of the article. I recommend the authors consider implementing the recommendations.
