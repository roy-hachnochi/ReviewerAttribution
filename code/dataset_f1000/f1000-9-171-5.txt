I have the following comments and suggestions for the authors: What is the reason for choosing 35 years and two databases Google Scholar and PubMed? As some of the studies that may be some important papers published in journals indexed in other databases will be missing. Present complete article search and selection process in a flow chart outlining the exclusion of articles at each stage. In methodology give a brief account how it was decided to include or exclude an article. Kindly rephrase the sentence on Page 2. " Only after the advent of modern techniques using transmission and scanning electron microscopy, was the more complex structure of enamel revealed". Kindly rephrase the students on Page 3 "The breakdown of proteins by bacterial originated urease to urea and ammonia aids plays a role in maintaining a neutral pH in oral cavity"
