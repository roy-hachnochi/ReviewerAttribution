This study by Dr. Kimchi-Sarfaty examines ribosome profiling to follow the translational kinetics of factor IX (F9) and is a follow up of a previous study of theirs (DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-51984-2 ) 1 . They compare two HEK293T cell lines with one expressing a WT F9 gene and another with a codon-optimized F9 gene. In their previous study, they demonstrated the importance of this type of analysis by illustrating that these two cell lines had different translational kinetics and furthermore, different effects on protein conformation. In this study, they compared 3 replicates of the RNA-seq and Ribo-seq of the two cell lines. The correlations between the pairs of experiments seemed quite good and we believe this is an important type of study, however, we do have two concerns. First of all, the housekeeping control genes they utilize are GAPDH and ACTB, both of which are translated on free ribosomes in the cytosol. F9, however, is a secreted protein that is translated on ER ribosomes. Therefore, a rationale for the appropriateness of the two controls needs to be discussed. Secondly, they used a Box-Cox variance-stabilizing transformation for raw data followed by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test which tests for probability distribution functions but is a less selective normality test in our view. Why not utilize Saphiro-Wilk ( https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/52.3-4.591 )[ ref-2] or Arednson-Darling tests ( doi : 10.2307/2281537 ) 3 ? Some more detail here about the rationale for the statistical analyses is therefore warranted and whether additional controls and samples would have any effect on the outcomes of the studies should be discussed.
