The report is certainly interesting and the possibility to access data relatively nice. However, in the present form there is not much advantage compared to a paper supplementary section and accession number. In the current pipeline one should install - as per explicit requirements - Python 2.7, Bowtie, Tophat, Samtools, which still requires bioinformatician work. Some programs are not used anymore. Python 2 has been disconnected since January. Tophat as mapping resource is not suggested even by the developers, since now there are better ones. In the present form the pipeline can clearly work. In order to facilitate the use of the pipeline the authors could have wrapped everything in a folder that could have been run by the readers more easily. The biological data seem very nice to me (Stefano Biffo with the help of a bioinformatician).
