This study aimed to investigate one of the green analytical chemistry tools for quantitative determination of Diclofenac sodium (DS) in tablet dosage forms by using ATR-FTIR technique. The novelty of this work arises from excluding the need for sample preparation like the using of KBr discs. I find the work interesting, informative, and worthy to be indexed. However I have some concerns/suggestions after carefully reading the report. 2 nd column in Table 2 needs consistency in the expression of concentration of DS because sample B is expressed in terms of %, while samples AC were expressed as quantities. I would rather suggest expressing the standard deviation (SD)and relative standard deviation (RSD) in a table as follows: Sample name SD RSD Sample A 0.0083 1.26% Sample B Sample C Would the authors be able to state whether this method suits coated tablet forms of DS?
