Pirosca and colleagues have examined the 'Implications for research' section of 205 Cochrane reviews published between 2009 to 2019 from two editorial groups. The five most used categories were the same for both editorial groups: better choice of outcomes; better choice of intervention/comparator; longer follow-up; larger sample size; use of validated scales. Better choice of outcomes and/or better choice of intervention/comparator was recommended in over half of reviews; longer follow-up and larger sample size were recommended in over a third; and use of validated scales being suggested in around a fifth of reviews. I think the authors should also discus their interesting findings from the point of view: how good are the Cochrane authors? E.g. we know from numerous studies (e.g., Rebecca M Turner et al .) that 80% to 90% of all Cochrane reviews do not reach a fair meta-analytic sample size providing the necessary power to assess medium large and small (but still clinically relevant) intervention effects. How come then that almost 66% of reviews do not mention larger sample sizes?
