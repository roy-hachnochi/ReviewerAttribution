This study studies knowledge, attitude and prevention behavior related to HIV/AIDS among college students in Lao and there are a number of misunderstandings by respondents. I have the following recommendations: Under the methods, the authors need to explain how they got a 95% CI of the population. There must be a measurement outcome. 750 is one quarter of 2734, how did the authors get 95% CI? The authors need to explain more. The authors should compare their findings with other ASEAN countries. Please add the following statement at the end of the first paragraph: “.... more than 50% of the students. In this study, only 22.8% respondents correctly indicated that using condoms while having sex. This figure is lower than in other ASEAN countries. In contrast, 48.1% of young Vietnamese used condoms at their latest sexual intercourse (Ngoc et al. , 2020 1 ).” The authors should mention education strategies in other ASEAN countries. Please add the following statement: “Other ASEAN countries adopted mobile health apps or interventions for disease prevention (Do et al. , 2018 2 ). This strategy could be feasible to proliferate the benefits of HIV prevention in youths and adolescents in Laos.” Please add one additional limitation: “.... other provinces with different contexts. This study did not explore other knowledge on HIV which was assessed in other ASEAN countries. For example, 98.2% of Vietnamese believed that HIV could be transmitted from mother to child (Hoang et al. , 2019 3 ) but it would be important to assess the knowledge of young people in Lao.”
