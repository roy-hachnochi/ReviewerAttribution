In this paper entitled “Correlation between salivary estrogen levels and oral epithelial cytokeratin 5 expression”, Handajani et al. , mainly examined the relationship salivary estrogen levels and cytokeratin 5 expression in oral epithelial cells. Salivary estrogen levels in adult group was higher than that of children group, and decreased in aging. In parallel, the number of cytokeratin 5-positive oral epithelial cells was higher in adult group compared with other groups. By using statistical analysis, the authors concluded that there is a positive correlation between the levels of salivary estrogen and the number of cytokeratin 5-positive oral epithelial cells, which may be age-dependent phenomenon. The following points should be addressed for considering indexing in the journal “ F1000Research". Major comments; In fig. 1, they showed two pictures (A) and (B) with same magnification (x400). However, there are about 10 cells can be observed in (A), whereas only single cell in (B). Why? To prove the reliability of experiment (Cytokeratin 5 staining), please show the picture, in which at least 2-3 cells can be observed. Are there any differences in cytokeratin 5 expression between basal cells and intermediate and superficial cells? In this study, the authors examined salivary estrogen levels and cytokeratin 5 expression in only female group. Why did the authors exclude male participants? Are there any reasons? Even in the highest group (adult) of cytokeratin 5, about 2 cells were positive. Other cells are all negative? How about the expressions of other types of cytokeratin?
