Generally, this article provides novelty information in the field of natural antioxidant sources from the tropics. The method used is good and detailed. The results have been explained well, as well as the discussion. However, the abstract did not convey a compelling reason to underlie this study, so the impression of this study was flat. I suggest writing three sentences that show the reasons for the importance of this research in the abstract and in the introduction. Then, explain fluently the strong relationship between the elements of the title, background, objectives, methods, results, and conclusions. For example abstract : Vitex pinnata is one of the many plants known for its ethnomedicinal properties (choose the strong sentence for the first to give a strong reason in choosing this research). In the same case in the introduction, make sure the word chosen is a strong word to underlie this research and is described logically and fluently.
