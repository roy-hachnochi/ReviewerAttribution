Thank you to the authors for their detailed response. The manuscript has improved and my comments have all been adequately addressed. The only minor point is the request to change the second last sentence of the discussion "Validating the use of CCA repair..." does not seem to have changed, and this sentence still reads as an incomplete sentence. However, this is very minor and should not prevent acceptance.
