            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of key maternal morbidities during pregnancy globally. It is one of the neglected threats during pregnancy that constitutes pregnancy-related complications. Moreover, a significant number of GDM positive women later develop type 2 diabetes after delivery following an interval of 5-10 years. However, the real magnitude of GDM in Bangladesh is still undetermined. The objective of this study was to explore the perceptions, practices and challenges of GDM detection and management among health care providers (HCPs) in the Tangail district of Bangladesh. 
 Methods: A mixed method study was conducted between&amp;nbsp;November 2017 and&amp;nbsp;January 2018. Quantitative data was collected through a survey of providers, whereas qualitative data collection included in-depth interviews with providers and direct observation of 41 health care facilities. Descriptive analysis was performed for quantitative data and qualitative data analysis was performed thematically. 
 Results: The study revealed that 66.6% of HCPs did not know about GDM related complications for affected mothers and their babies, 81.2% did not know about the risk factors of GDM, 95.8% were not aware about the management and/or treatment of GDM, 79.1% never conducted GDM screening of pregnant women and almost none of the interviewees received any special training on GDM. We observed that only 31.3% of women were tested for blood sugar in antenatal care and of those, 12.5% were identified as having elevated blood sugar levels. GDM related information was collected in 4.2% of cases. 
 Conclusions: There is limited knowledge and skills among the HCPs to detect and manage GDM at the community level. More programmatic emphasis is required to strengthen the capacity of community health care workers in detecting and treating GDM.">

  "description": "Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of key maternal morbidities during pregnancy globally. It is one of the neglected threats during pregnancy that constitutes pregnancy-related complications. Moreover, a significant number of GDM positive women later develop type 2 diabetes after delivery following an interval of 5-10 years. However, the real magnitude of GDM in Bangladesh is still undetermined. The objective of this study was to explore the perceptions, practices and challenges of GDM detection and management among health care providers (HCPs) in the Tangail district of Bangladesh.
Methods: A mixed method study was conducted between November 2017 and January 2018. Quantitative data was collected through a survey of providers, whereas qualitative data collection included in-depth interviews with providers and direct observation of 41 health care facilities. Descriptive analysis was performed for quantitative data and qualitative data analysis was performed thematically.
Results: The study revealed that 66.6% of HCPs did not know about GDM related complications for affected mothers and their babies, 81.2% did not know about the risk factors of GDM, 95.8% were not aware about the management and/or treatment of GDM, 79.1% never conducted GDM screening of pregnant women and almost none of the interviewees received any special training on GDM. We observed that only 31.3% of women were tested for blood sugar in antenatal care and of those, 12.5% were identified as having elevated blood sugar levels. GDM related information was collected in 4.2% of cases.
Conclusions: There is limited knowledge and skills among the HCPs to detect and manage GDM at the community level. More programmatic emphasis is required to strengthen the capacity of community health care workers in detecting and treating GDM."

It is one of the neglected threats during pregnancy that constitutes pregnancy-related complications. Moreover, a significant number of GDM positive women later develop type 2 diabetes after delivery following an interval of 5-10 years. However, the real magnitude of GDM in Bangladesh is still undetermined. The objective of this study was to explore the perceptions, practices and challenges of GDM detection and management among health care providers (HCPs) in the Tangail district of Bangladesh.<br/> <b>Methods:</b> A mixed method study was conducted between&nbsp;November 2017 and&nbsp;January 2018. Quantitative data was collected through a survey of providers, whereas qualitative data collection included in-depth interviews with providers and direct observation of 41 health care facilities. Descriptive analysis was performed for quantitative data and qualitative data analysis was performed thematically.<br/> <b>Results:</b> The study revealed that 66.6% of HCPs did not know about GDM related complications for affected mothers and their babies, 81.2% did not know about the risk factors of GDM, 95.8% were not aware about the management and/or treatment of GDM, 79.1% never conducted GDM screening of pregnant women and almost none of the interviewees received any special training on GDM. We observed that only 31.3% of women were tested for blood sugar in antenatal care and of those, 12.5% were identified as having elevated blood sugar levels. GDM related information was collected in 4.2% of cases.<br/> <b>Conclusions:</b> There is limited knowledge and skills among the HCPs to detect and manage GDM at the community level. More programmatic emphasis is required to strengthen the capacity of community health care workers in detecting and treating GDM. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Gestational diabetes mellitus, community, perception, practice, challenges, Bangladesh </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Abdul Halim (<a href="mailto:halim.ogsb@gmail.com">halim.ogsb@gmail.com</a>) <br> Animesh Biswas (<a href="mailto:ani72001@gmail.com">ani72001@gmail.com</a>) </div> </div> <div class="margin-top margin-bottom float-left"> <button id=close-popup-window class=general-white-orange-button>Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-corresponding-author> <b>Corresponding authors:</b> Abdul Halim, Animesh Biswas </span> <div class=clearfix></div> </span> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom competing-interests-display"> <span class=competing-interests-title>Competing interests:</span> No competing interests were disclosed. </span> <div class="info-separation padding-bottom grant-information-display"> <span class=grant-information-title>Grant information:</span> The study is a part of the Community-based detection and surveillance of Gestational Diabetes in Bangladesh project at CIPRB, which is funded by the World Diabetes Foundation. <br/> </div> <span class="f1r-article-desk info-separation padding-bottom"> <span class="copywrite-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-100_open_access"></span> </span> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-copyright-text> <b>Copyright:</b>&nbsp; © 2020 Halim A <em>et al</em>.

Around 88% of cases of GDM are found in low- and middle-income countries<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. Prevalence of GDM varies from 1% to 28% depending on population characteristics, diagnostic measurement and screening methods, with the South East Asian region indicated to have a high prevalence (24.2%)<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. Bangladesh is one of the top ten contributors to diabetes cases globally and this number is expected to double in the next 20 years<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. It is estimated that in Bangladesh alone, more than two million people suffer from diabetes but are as of yet undiagnosed<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The current prevalence of diabetes is 5.5% and the expected rise to 8.2% by 2030 renders diabetes in Bangladesh a major public health problem that has to be addressed by the national health system in the near future<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Diabetes is associated with transitions in lifestyle and industrialization, which is more common in urban areas but increasingly extends to rural settings<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d9937e236>Findings in Bangladesh have shown that 23% of patients with diabetes mellitus are treated at outpatient departments of upazila health complexes (primary health care centers) and 23% in district hospitals (secondary health care centers)<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. In the past five years, there has been an increased focus in Bangladesh on improving service delivery at the primary level and at referral centers, including union health and family welfare centers (the lowest level of primary health care centers), as well as at the community level through community clinics and community health workers<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Nevertheless, most of the programme still focuses on the provision of emergency obstetric and newborn care, with poor focus on other maternal and newborn health related areas that are on the incline, such as the impact of non-communicable diseases on maternal and newborn health<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. A new operational plan provides a structure for improving care with regards to preconception, pregnancy, childbirth and the immediate postpartum period<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Areas prioritized for the provision of quality maternal and neonatal health services include populations with a high maternal mortality ratio and those living in impoverished areas and facing geographical and social disadvantages<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Bangladesh has developed the 2013–2020 Action Plan for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, a national strategy for maternal health that highlights the importance of GDM<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d9937e264>The prevalence of GDM ranges from 8.2% in rural Bangladesh<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> to 12.9%<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>, with estimates dependent on the diagnostic criteria used<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Undiagnosed women with diabetes in pregnancy are a key concern in Bangladesh due to the low social status of women, which results in inequalities in healthcare access and nutrition<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Women often do not receive treatment for sickness and therefore often resort to self-medication or seek care from unqualified practitioners<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Women with GDM have an increased risk of developing obstetric complications like prolonged labor and are prone to develop type-2 diabetes in the future. Their babies might be born overweight and develop childhood obesity or type-2 diabetes later in life<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. As there is already an existing community network, this can be used to refer all pregnancies that have been identified at the community level for antenatal care (ANC) and GDM screening facilities<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d9937e296>The aim of this study is to determine the perceptions and practices of GDM detection and management in a selected sub-district of Bangladesh and explore existing barriers to adequate detection and management of GDM.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d9937e302>Methods</h2><div class=section><a name=d9937e305 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Study design</h3><p class="" id=d9937e310>A total of 47 face-to-face surveys and 10 in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with health care providers (HCPs) and with health managers.

It was conducted from November 2017 to January 2018 in the Mirzapur sub-district of Tangail district, Bangladesh. The sub-district has a population of 274,088, with 65 facilities including 53 community clinics, 10 union health and family welfare centres, one upazila health complex and one medical college hospital (tertiary facility). Out of 63 primary health care facilities (community clinics and union health and family welfare centers), 30 community clinics and nine union health and family welfare centers were randomly selected by simple randomization, achieved via the random number generator in Microsoft Excel 2010. The study also included the upazila health complex and medical college hospital for data collection.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d9937e450 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Provider survey</h3><p class="" id=d9937e455>A structured questionnaire was developed by the research team of the study, available as <i>Extended data</i><sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. This questionnaire was pretested outside the study area to finalize the questionnaire. Pretesting was carried out among HCPs at one community clinic and one union health and family welfare centre in a different upazila within the district of Tangail. No changes were made to the questionnaire after pre-testing and no validity testing was performed. Then, the structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data from selected HCPs, which include grassroots level health workers, such as health assistants (HAs), family welfare assistants (FWAs), health inspectors (HIs), family planning inspectors (FPIs), and community health care providers (CHCPs), and also health workers from the lowest level primary health care centers such as family welfare visitors (FWVs) and sub-assistant community medical officers (SACMOs) (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>). The questionnaire included general information, health workers’ perspectives on GDM and availability of equipment and logistics to provide services for GDM patients in the primary health care centers. An official letter from the Mirzapur Upazila Health Complex was circulated among the health workers (n=52) in the 41 facilities, which explained the objectives and invited them to participate in the study. A copy of this letter is available as <i>Extended data</i><sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. Four trained field data collectors were responsible for collecting data. Health workers were invited and those who willingly wanted to participate in the study were enrolled purposively. Five of the invited participants were not willing to participate as they were busy at that time with their own work.

A pretested interview guide was used for the interviews, available as <i>Extended data</i><sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. Pretesting was carried out among HCPs at one community clinic and one union health and family welfare centre in a different upazila within the district of Tangail. Minor changes were made to the interview guide after pre-testing. No validity testing was performed. HCPs were chosen purposively and written consent was sought before participation in the face-to-face interviews. Out of 13 respondents, three participants weren’t able to participate in the IDIs due to their other engagements. The research assistant described the objectives of the study before data collection. Each of the interviews took approximately 20–25 minutes and were conducted at the facilities. Interviews were audio recorded upon permission and the research assistant took some key notes.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d9937e490 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Observation</h3><p class="" id=d9937e495>A total 30 ANC checkups were observed at different facility levels.

Among the 41 facilities assessed, 95.1% (n=39) provided outpatient services. All facilities provided ANC and postnatal care (PNC) but limited equipment for essential tests like glucose tests, urine tests and hemoglobin tests for ANC. Only two (4.8%) facilities had a separate breast-feeding corner, ANC corner and PNC corner and equipment for ultrasonography and hemoglobin testing. The referral facility (Kumudini Hospital) had a consultant trained on GDM. Nine (21.9%) of the facilities provided 24/7services.</p><p class="" id=d9937e1385><b><i>Record keeping</i></b>. During September to November 2017, a total of 6805 pregnant women received ANC from 41 selected facilities. Only six GDM women were detected in the referral hospital, whereas other facilities didn’t identify any women. Among the 41 facilities, 78% (n=32) did not perform any deliveries in last three months. A total of 31 preeclampsia/eclampsia cases, 125 premature babies, 215 cases of premature membrane rupture, 45 still births and four maternal deaths were reported in Kumudini hospital but such records about obstetric and newborn complications were not available in the other facilities (<a href="#T3">Table 3</a>).</p><a name=T3 class=n-a></a><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><div class=caption><h3>Table 3.

The primary health care facilities are not well equipped for GDM screening. The perception of, knowledge of and practices regarding GDM among the HCPs were found to be very poor. The majority of the findings show that HCPs do not know about GDM. There is a serious gap between the knowledge of diabetes (any type) and diabetes during pregnancy. The capacity of HCPs and resources for GDM detection and management were not available in the facilities.</p><p class="" id=d9937e2129>An assessment of the primary health care facilities in Bangladesh found limitations regarding resources and equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The maternal health care services were also found to be poor, especially essential tests like glucose, hemoglobin and urine protein ANC tests.
