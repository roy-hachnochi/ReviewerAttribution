The authors investigated an important topic “preeclampsia”. I have some points that need to be addressed. Abstract: No need to have details of statistic methods in the abstract. Methods: It is not clear if these cases were mild or severe cases or if these were early or late preeclampsia. More elaborations are needed because the risk factors are different in the different types of preeclampsia. There many factors that were not investigated e.g. anemia, malaria, body mass index, blood groups. I think all this information could be added to your work and you might have different results. Sample size: It is advisable to consider the difference between the two groups using the least prevalent one e.g. smoking or alcohol such as 3. 0 vs 2. % and not using the high one as you used antenatal care. Statistics: I do not think you used mix model I think you used logistic regression models. In the methods, you mentioned that variables with p ≤ 0.2 were entered in the model. Then later on you contradict yourself and you mentioned that variables that were shown to be associated with preeclampsia were entered in the model regardless of their P value. Results: All your tables can be summarized in two tables only: Table 1 all comparing all variables between preeclampsia and controls Table 2 logistic regression with non -adjusted and adjusted values
