This manuscript is well written with clear explanation of the methodology used. Data collected were analysed using appropriate statistical tests. Interpretations of the data were correctly displayed and discussed. Study findings highlight the determinants of contraceptive use among married women in Indonesia which can help in formulating relevant policy and strategies in improving contraceptive use in Indonesia. I have no recommendation for any revision to the manuscript in its current format and have no objection for it to be indexed with no revision.
