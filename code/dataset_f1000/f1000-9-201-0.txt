The study protocol describes a very interesting study in order to investigate the effects of legal access to cannabis using a quasi-experimental design. The authors describe the study design, sample, data assessment statistical analyses, data protection issues and the importance of their research object very clearly and detailed. Minor remark: The study protocol states: “THC levels per average use occasion will be determined through analyses of usual consumption samples provided at both baseline and after one year (T12). Second, questionnaire data will be used to determine the number of use occasions within the past 30 days. Third, and only for the intervention group, sales data will be used to determine THC exposure levels of legally acquired cannabis over a 12-month period.” (S. 5f). The study protocol does not mention if study participants in the intervention group are being asked about their occasions buying cannabis legally and illegally in the questionnaire. I think it would be interesting to have the number of both occasions since the THC exposure of THC bought illegally might be different.
