The motivation for the treatment group is to get "legal" cannabis. This is very different from the control situation, where subjects only are awarded 25 Euro for filling in a questionnaire. The protocol does not explain exactly which control variables are used to compensate for this possible bias. One idea of the study is to sell cannabis with a limited THC/CBD ratio to the experimental group and to see if the total THC consumption can be reduced that way. This requires knowing the amount and purity of illegally consumed cannabis in both groups though. The amount of cannabis can be measured (provided the subjects give correct answers) - but there is no plan to systematically assess the THC content of the illegally acquired cannabis consumed by both groups, as far as the protocol states.
