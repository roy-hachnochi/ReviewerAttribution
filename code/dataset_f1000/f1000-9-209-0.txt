Thanks for this interesting, fully described, detailed, well written case.The manuscript needs minor revisions. Some points need to be declared. Title Title need to be summarized and "assessed by cone beam CT" could be removed from the title. CT nowadays used routinely to diagnose the midface lesions for its difficult interpretation on plan panoramic films. Case reports are usually describing a very rare condition however dentigerous cyst in the maxillary sinus is not uncommon. Figure 3 is an intraoperative photo not perioperative image. Usually dentigerous cyst is diagnosed mainly by association with impacted tooth so the conclusion of the paper needs to be more accurate as this case is not ectopic eruption. The following paragraph is more accurately describing the present case: In the present paper, we report a case of infected dentigerous cyst associated with an ectopic molar within the maxillary sinus. Surgical removal for both was performed, and the entire pathologic antral tissue was removed completely and assessed histologically. There were no post-surgical complications, and the patientâ€™s postoperative healing was satisfactory. Introduction Ectopic eruption definition needs more justification as the present tooth is ectopic but associated with large maxillary cyst and pushed superiorly as result of cyst enlargement. Authors did not report any prevalence rate of the dentigerous cyst (which usually associated with impacted wisdom) in the maxillary sinus and also the rate for ectopic impacted teeth in the sinus. Operation The cystic lesion had discharge and was diagnosed as infected cyst, does the surgeon treat infection before opening the sinus especially as the cyst was communicate with the oral cavity and possibility of recurrent fistula is high? (Preoperative management of infected sinus is not mentioned). Why is nasal anticongestant not prescribed as routine post sinus surgery (note that the sinus membrane appears still edematous in the CBCT)?
