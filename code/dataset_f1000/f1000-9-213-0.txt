Overall there is a need for Javascript based alignment viewers which can handle large numbers of sequences. So this software is rather timely. However, I think the current implementation seems to still contain significant bugs and the web page requires a round of user experience testing to make it easier to use and interpret the results. Once these improvements are made then I think this has the potential to be a very useful tool. Manuscript changes: Please fix capitalisation of PFAM to Pfam Software/Website changes: The computing conservation box is annoyingly placed. It does not go away and covers the UMAP view significantly. I really need an estimate of how long it will take for the pairwise identity to load. Some time passes…I didn’t realise I had to click on calculate to get the pairwise identity to show. Please UX test this page to make it easier/clearer for the user to understand what to do. For the top graph on the stats view the three colours used for max/average and min identity are hard to distinguish. Please use a broader colour palette. Please add axis legends for this graph and make it clearer what the title of this graph is. The title is very clear for the bottom plot. Please add alternative colouring schemes for viewing the alignments. It makes a surprisingly big difference for experienced users ability to interpret an alignment. I personally like the ClustalX colouring scheme that is widely adopted, but there are other popular schemes it would be nice to incorporate as options. “Based on this and other small tests we can safely state that any computer that is able to run any modern web browser will be able to run any alignment that requires visualization”. This is overstating the case. Needs to be toned down. Try testing the software on the ABC transporter family (PF00005) alignment in Pfam. The NCBI alignment contains 2.6 million sequences. If it works seamlessly for that then you can safely state. I tried to hook the viewer up to a Pfam alignment which is not very large (840 sequences). I got a box that said Fetching file…and no response beyond that. https://alignmentviewer.org/?url=http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF00571/alignment/seed/format?format=fastadownload=0 also tried Stockholm format with no luck. https://alignmentviewer.org/?url=http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF00571/alignment/seed/format?format=stockholmdownload=0 I also tried with a Pfam family with just 3 sequences. Still with no luck. I got the viewer to work by uploading a Pfam alignment in fasta format with 3 sequences. Then I tried uploading the seed alignment for the CBS domain downloaded from Pfam in fasta format. I then got the following error: Parsing error: sequence #3 has different length. The first few lines of the alignment are included below and the third sequence appears to be the same length as all the others.
