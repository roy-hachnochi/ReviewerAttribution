The role of the ephrin-A1/EphA2 signaling axis in tumor cells has been studied extensively. However, many cell types in the tumor microenvironment also express ephrin/Eph molecules, the functions of which are not completely understood. This report investigates the EphA2/ephrin-A1 axis-mediated host-tumor interaction. By implanting tumors in wild-type or ephrin-A1 knockout hosts, the authors showed that loss of ephrin-A1 in tumor microenvironment significantly reduced tumor metastasis, both in the spontaneous allograft model and in experimental metastasis assays via tail vein injection. Overall, the studies are well designed and the manuscript is well written. Using both spontaneous metastasis and tail vein injection models increases the rigor and reproducibility of the studies. Experiments are also well controlled by using littermates and scoring blindly. The authors showed negative findings in tumor-infiltrating immune populations and tumor vascularity between ephrin-A1 knockout and wild-type control littermates. Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanism of ephrin-A1 in tumor metastasis has not been determined. For example, decreased lung metastatic lesions could be due to reduced survival of tumor cells in circulation, extravasation into lung, or growth in the lung microenvironment, as ephrin-A1 is expressed in the lung epithelium, vascular endothelial cells, and some of immune cells. Because this is a global knockout, dissecting specific roles of ephrin-A1 in each cell population in the tumor microenvironment are challenging. After all, the fact that ephrin-A1 plays a critical role in metastasis should be of interest to the general audience in the field of cancer research.
