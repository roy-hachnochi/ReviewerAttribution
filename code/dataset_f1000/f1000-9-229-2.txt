 In etiology section: it has been mentioned that there is a various etiological factors that cause OSCC, most of the articles that have been cited are based on epidemiological statistics. So I think it is better to specify that these are based on epidemiological statistics. It has been mentioned that early detection of cancer using certain techniques like salivary bio markers will lead to successful prognosis and treatment, are there any studies showing that there is improved prognosis after early detection? If not then this would be a good way to mention this as a suggestion and future trend to establish studies to show the essential role of early diagnosis. Suggestions to add diagnostic criteria for early detection of OSCC.
