The authors need to be congratulated for this effort. They produced a comprehensive review on supine versus prone position in PCNL. This former method has been around for now almost 15 years, and still surgeons remain unsure whether there is a benefit in adopting the supine position over the established and older prone position. In that sense, this article may be a good decision tool. The authors systematically reviewed the relevant literature. The reviewer misses some evidence but the authors used stringent selection criteria which may have led to their exclusion but in turn make the data more robust. An example would be: Kachrilas S, Papatsoris A, Bach C, Kontos S, Faruquz Z, Goyal A, Masood J,BUCHHOLZ N. Colon perforation during percutaneous renal surgery: a 10-year experience in a single endourology centre. Urol Res. 2012 Jun;40(3):263-8 1 . This article shows on a large number of patients that there is no difference in complications in the right hands. Although in most experienced hands, the differences between the two methods are minimal in all aspects, and the advantages of supine are evident to most surgeons who use it, somewhat surprisingly to me the analysed data show better safety in supine, and better stone-free rate in prone PCNL. Since there seems to be no flaw in their analysis, we will have to believe this data. That makes it even more important to index.
