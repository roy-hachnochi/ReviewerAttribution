In this work, the authors predict the ongoing spread of the disease including hospital and ventilator capacity for the next months in the city of Heidelberg and consider the possible impact of currently imposed countermeasures. This is an interesting contribution to the existing literature, but the paper suffers from several shortcomings listed in the following comments: The paper should be checked by a native. A Conclusion section should be added. The novelty and contribution should be clearly bolded. The introduction should be updated by recent researches. The authors should consider some works about statistical methods (including time series models or regression models) that can be applied to model and predict medical datasets. Comparative Analysis should be given in more details. Itâ€™s better to suggest some subjects for future works.
