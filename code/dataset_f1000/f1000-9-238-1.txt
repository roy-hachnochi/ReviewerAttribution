I think the authors have addressed the observations I raised. However, as I mentioned, I am not an expert in the construction of the "Burden of Disease" metrics. It would be important to have the opinion of Prof. Theo Vos on the revised version of the manuscript. If these matters have been appropriately addressed, I think the manuscript can be indexed.
