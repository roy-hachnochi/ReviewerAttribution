This manuscript covers an important topic, that has not been explored much in Peru. Due to its relevance and the population included in the study (all those insured by EsSalud, that provides insurance to a significant fraction -about 1/3- of the Peruvian population), I consider it is worth publishing. However, it is necessary to review some important points. I think the main aspect to review would be the construction of the 'burden of disease' variables. I am not an expert in these metrics. I highly recommend reading and considering the detailed suggestions of reviewer Prof. Theo Vos, who is a world expert in the field. Minor revisions: Sample size: The authors state that they were trying to detect differences between subgroups? Which subgroups? Knee and hip osteoarthritis? Males and females? Age groups? There are no hypothesis tests reported throughout the manuscript. Please clarify that. It would be interesting to see some potential explanations for the regional differences between the burden of disease. Is it due to the timing of diagnosis? Is it due to the characteristics of these populations? The manuscript might benefit from an English-language edit.
