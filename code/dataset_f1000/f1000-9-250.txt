            <meta name="dc.description" content="During nearly 100 years of research on cancer cachexia (CC), science has been reciting the same mantra: it is a multifactorial syndrome. The aim of this paper is to show that the symptoms are many, but they have a single cause: anoxia. 
CC is a complex and devastating condition that affects a high proportion of advanced cancer patients. Unfortunately, it cannot be reversed by traditional nutritional support and it generally reduces survival time. It is characterized by significant weight loss, mainly from fat deposits and skeletal muscles. The occurrence of cachexia in cancer patients is usually a late phenomenon. The conundrum is why do similar patients with similar tumors, develop cachexia and others do not? Even if cachexia is mainly a metabolic dysfunction, there are other issues involved such as the activation of inflammatory responses and crosstalk between different cell types.&amp;nbsp; The exact mechanism leading to a wasting syndrome is not known, however there are some factors that are surely involved, such as anorexia with lower calorie intake, increased glycolytic flux, gluconeogenesis, increased lipolysis and severe tumor hypoxia. Based on this incomplete knowledge we put together a scheme explaining the molecular mechanisms behind cancer cachexia, and surprisingly, there is one cause that explains all of its characteristics: anoxia. &amp;nbsp;With this different view of CC we propose a treatment based on the physiopathology that leads from anoxia to the symptoms of CC.&amp;nbsp; The fundamentals of this hypothesis are based on the idea that CC is the result of anoxia causing intracellular lactic acidosis. This is a dangerous situation for cell survival which can be solved by activating energy consuming gluconeogenesis. The process is conducted by the hypoxia inducible factor-1&alpha;. This hypothesis was built by putting together pieces of evidence produced by authors working on related topics.">

  "description": "During nearly 100 years of research on cancer cachexia (CC), science has been reciting the same mantra: it is a multifactorial syndrome. The aim of this paper is to show that the symptoms are many, but they have a single cause: anoxia.
CC is a complex and devastating condition that affects a high proportion of advanced cancer patients. Unfortunately, it cannot be reversed by traditional nutritional support and it generally reduces survival time. It is characterized by significant weight loss, mainly from fat deposits and skeletal muscles. The occurrence of cachexia in cancer patients is usually a late phenomenon. The conundrum is why do similar patients with similar tumors, develop cachexia and others do not? Even if cachexia is mainly a metabolic dysfunction, there are other issues involved such as the activation of inflammatory responses and crosstalk between different cell types.  The exact mechanism leading to a wasting syndrome is not known, however there are some factors that are surely involved, such as anorexia with lower calorie intake, increased glycolytic flux, gluconeogenesis, increased lipolysis and severe tumor hypoxia. Based on this incomplete knowledge we put together a scheme explaining the molecular mechanisms behind cancer cachexia, and surprisingly, there is one cause that explains all of its characteristics: anoxia.  With this different view of CC we propose a treatment based on the physiopathology that leads from anoxia to the symptoms of CC.  The fundamentals of this hypothesis are based on the idea that CC is the result of anoxia causing intracellular lactic acidosis. This is a dangerous situation for cell survival which can be solved by activating energy consuming gluconeogenesis. The process is conducted by the hypoxia inducible factor-1&alpha;. This hypothesis was built by putting together pieces of evidence produced by authors working on related topics."

The aim of this paper is to show that the symptoms are many, but they have a single cause: anoxia.<br/> CC is a complex and devastating condition that affects a high proportion of advanced cancer patients. Unfortunately, it cannot be reversed by traditional nutritional support and it generally reduces survival time. It is characterized by significant weight loss, mainly from fat deposits and skeletal muscles. The occurrence of cachexia in cancer patients is usually a late phenomenon. The conundrum is why do similar patients with similar tumors, develop cachexia and others do not? Even if cachexia is mainly a metabolic dysfunction, there are other issues involved such as the activation of inflammatory responses and crosstalk between different cell types.&nbsp; The exact mechanism leading to a wasting syndrome is not known, however there are some factors that are surely involved, such as anorexia with lower calorie intake, increased glycolytic flux, gluconeogenesis, increased lipolysis and severe tumor hypoxia. Based on this incomplete knowledge we put together a scheme explaining the molecular mechanisms behind cancer cachexia, and surprisingly, there is one cause that explains all of its characteristics: anoxia. &nbsp;With this different view of CC we propose a treatment based on the physiopathology that leads from anoxia to the symptoms of CC.&nbsp; The fundamentals of this hypothesis are based on the idea that CC is the result of anoxia causing intracellular lactic acidosis. This is a dangerous situation for cell survival which can be solved by activating energy consuming gluconeogenesis. The process is conducted by the hypoxia inducible factor-1α. This hypothesis was built by putting together pieces of evidence produced by authors working on related topics. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Cancer cachexia, anoxia, intracellular lactic acidosis, weight loss, nutritional supplements, quality of life, Cori cycle, dichoroacetate, emodin, pentoxifylline </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Tomas Koltai (<a href="mailto:tkoltai@hotmail.com">tkoltai@hotmail.com</a>) </div> </div> <div class="margin-top margin-bottom float-left"> <button id=close-popup-window class=general-white-orange-button>Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-corresponding-author> <b>Corresponding author:</b> Tomas Koltai </span> <div class=clearfix></div> </span> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom competing-interests-display"> <span class=competing-interests-title>Competing interests:</span> No competing interests were disclosed. </span> <div class="info-separation padding-bottom grant-information-display"> <span class=grant-information-title>Grant information:</span> The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work. </div> <span class="f1r-article-desk info-separation padding-bottom"> <span class="copywrite-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-100_open_access"></span> </span> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-copyright-text> <b>Copyright:</b>&nbsp; © 2020 Koltai T.

Complex associations between cancer, host, nutrition, psychological, systemic and environmental factors were thoroughly studied as part of the problem. However, a unified and physiopathological explanation is lacking. This led to consideration of CC as a multifactorial consequence of cancer. Based on the thousands of publications and findings on CC, it is the objective of this work to arrange the multiple pieces of evidence published in the world medical literature and to build a comprehensive and unified picture of the syndrome. Understanding how anoxia, rather than hypoxia, is the main culprit of CC will allow for a different approach to treatment on a rational basis. A certain amount of speculation is involved in the proposed solution of the puzzle; however, this speculation has been kept to a minimum. Only laboratory work and clinical trials can ultimately confirm the validity of the hypothesis developed here.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d30735e267>Known mechanisms of cancer cachexia</h2><p class="" id=d30735e270>As already mentioned, CC is described as the consequence of cancer-induced loss of appetite (reduced food intake-starvation) and metabolic alterations. It is found frequently in advanced tumors and many authors consider it a paraneoplastic syndrome<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Many mechanisms contribute to unleashing cancer cachexia. Some are known, others are not. However, a superficial look may be misleading because the problem is far more complex than it may seem. There are well known factors that play a role, which are summarized below.</p><div class=section><a name=d30735e277 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Lack of appetite: reduced food intake</h3><p class="" id=d30735e282>Although this may seem to be the main cause, it is not. Pharmacologically improving the appetite or increasing food intake does not solve the problem. Usually, it does not stop progressive weight loss. Anorexia is frequent, but there are many patients who lose weight without a manifest loss of appetite. Important contributory factors to anorexia are depression<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>, and cancer treatments themselves, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. However, this treatment-related weight loss does not seem directly associated with cancer cachexia.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d30735e300 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Inflammatory and catabolic mediators</h3><p class="" id=d30735e305>These mediators were found increased in cachexia, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>–<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>, ZAG (Zinc-α2-glycoprotein also known as lipid mobilizing factor)<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>, interleukin (IL)-1<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>, IL-6<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>, IL-15<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>, proteolysis inducing factor (PIF)<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>, myostatin<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>, among others. Levels of glucocorticoids are also increased. These mediators seem to be part of the problem but not the cause. For example, TNFα and IL-6 produce loss of appetite by interacting with hypothalamic receptors that regulate food intake<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. However, steep elevation of IL-6 is found mainly in very advanced stages of CC<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. IL-6 is also involved in an autophagy inducing activity found in serum of patients with CC. Blocking IL-6, this activity disappears<sup><a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d30735e360 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Increased energy expenditure (higher basal metabolic rate)</h3><p class="" id=d30735e365>A previous study showed that 143 out of 297 (48%) unselected cancer patients exhibited increased resting energy expenditure<sup><a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. Several authors have confirmed increased energy expenditure as a cause of weight loss in cancer patients<sup><a href="#ref-28">28</a>–<a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup>. This probably is the consequence of increased uncoupling at the electron transport chain and increased Cori cycle activity. In the liver, the excess lactic acid produced by the tumor can be converted into glucose (Cori cycle) consuming ATP. The Cori cycle is considered an important culprit in cachexia. The Cori cycle (also known as the lactic acid cycle), converts lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis in muscles to glucose in the liver. In cancer, instead of muscle, the tumor is the provider of lactic acid. While glycolysis produces a positive balance of two molecules of ATPs, the Cori cycle uses up six molecules of ATPs. Each turn of the cycle represents a net loss of four ATP molecules<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup>. The Cori cycle has been held responsible for energy loss in cancer by many authors<sup><a href="#ref-35">35</a>–<a href="#ref-43">43</a></sup>. An intracellular Cori cycle cannot be ruled out as the main cause of energy loss (<a href="#f1">Figure 1</a>).</p><a name=f1 class=n-a></a><div class="fig panel clearfix"><a target=_blank href="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/24977/be8cf3a5-12d6-4d53-89b4-a9b2ab721a8f_figure1.gif"><img alt="be8cf3a5-12d6-4d53-89b4-a9b2ab721a8f_figure1.gif" src="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/24977/be8cf3a5-12d6-4d53-89b4-a9b2ab721a8f_figure1.gif"></a><div class=caption><h3>Figure 1. The Cori cycle and glycolysis.</h3><p id=d30735e403>The figure shows that six ATP molecules are necessary to convert two molecules of lactate into glucose (left panel). On the other hand, the glycolytic pathway (right panel) produces two ATP molecules by degrading glucose to lactate. If two molecules of lactate produced through glycolysis are reconverted into glucose, there is a net loss of four ATP molecules. If this is established as a permanent circuit glucose-lactate-glucose circuit, each turn in the circuit loses four ATP molecules.</p></div></div><p class="" id=d30735e410>Interestingly, the Cori cycle is activated during fasting<sup><a href="#ref-44">44</a></sup> where it contributes to generating glucose. Patients with advanced metastatic cancer show an increased Cori cycle, particularly those patients with high glycolytic flux<sup><a href="#ref-35">35</a>,<a href="#ref-36">36</a>,<a href="#ref-45">45</a>,<a href="#ref-46">46</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d30735e430>According to our criteria, the Cori cycle by itself, is the main responsible actor in CC, but not the originating cause. <a href="#f2">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#f3">Figure 3</a> show a proposed mechanism of how the Cori cycle develops in cancer and the energy imbalance it drives. For each molecule of glucose produced through the Cori cycle, six molecules of ATP are used. For each molecule of glucose degraded to lactic acid only two molecules of ATP are produced. Therefore, if a cycle is established in which one molecule of glucose produces two ATP molecules, and the lactic acid thus formed is used to regenerate glucose, four molecules of ATP are lost in each complete cycle.</p><a name=f2 class=n-a></a><div class="fig panel clearfix"><a target=_blank href="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/24977/be8cf3a5-12d6-4d53-89b4-a9b2ab721a8f_figure2.gif"><img alt="be8cf3a5-12d6-4d53-89b4-a9b2ab721a8f_figure2.gif" src="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/24977/be8cf3a5-12d6-4d53-89b4-a9b2ab721a8f_figure2.gif"></a><div class=caption><h3>Figure 2.

The causes of cancer cachexia.</h3><p id=d30735e634>These causes are showed separately. However, there is a close interaction among them. The only factor that interacts causatively with all of them is anoxia. Anoxia induces the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators in macrophages. Anoxia also induces insulin resistance and through HIF-1α activates the Cori cycle. This cycle produces higher energy expenditure. Inflammatory mediators induce decreased nutritional intake through loss of appetite and induce skeletal muscle degradation, lipid deposit loss and finally loss of weight. All the roads lead to anoxia as the coordinator of this syndrome.</p></div></div><div class=section><a name=d30735e641 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Condition 1</h3><p class="" id=d30735e646>This condition is characterized by a pO<sub>2</sub> higher than 0.5%. In this situation the oxidative phosphorylation would remain active and 30% or more glucose would be metabolized by mitochondria (Krebs cycle and electron transport chain) to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. The rest, 70% of glucose would undergo glycolysis to lactic acid. (Warburg effect: preferential glycolytic metabolism in aerobiosis). The 140 molecules of lactate thus formed are expelled to the extracellular space by the monocarboxylate transporters. Oxidative phosphorylation remains operative during the Warburg effect. In a famous debate with Warburg<sup><a href="#ref-64">64</a></sup> in 1956, Sidney Weinhouse stated that Warburg’s concept about tumor cells being unable to oxidize glucose was wrong. Furthermore, Weinhouse showed that glucose can be oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub> in cancer at a rate similar to normal cells<sup><a href="#ref-65">65</a></sup>. This concept has since been validated by many authors<sup><a href="#ref-66">66</a>–<a href="#ref-73">73</a></sup>. The amount of oxidative phosphorylation that continues working after the metabolic shift varies considerably among different tumors and duration of hypoxia<sup><a href="#ref-74">74</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d30735e681>What must be kept in mind is that the Warburg effect is not the shutdown of the oxidative metabolism. It is the predominance of glycolytic metabolism over oxidative metabolism, but oxidative metabolism continues working. Oxidative metabolism may be decreased, equal to or greater than in normal counterparts. The presence of oxygen increases oxidative metabolism in normal and cancer cells; however, this increase is much lower in the latter. Oxidative metabolism is present even in highly glycolytic cells but operating at a lower capacity<sup><a href="#ref-75">75</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d30735e688>As a conclusion, the Warburg effect is not about mitochondrial metabolism impairment (as Warburg thought) but about increased glucose uptake and glycolytic flux as postulated by Weinhouse. There is high metabolic variability among cancer types and also inside a tumor. This means that glycolytic cells may conserve variable degrees of mitochondrial metabolism.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d30735e692 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Condition 2</h3><p class="" id=d30735e697>In this condition, the pO<sub>2</sub> has decreased below 0.2%. Mitochondrial activity is practically downregulated by such a low level of oxygen. Therefore, nearly 100% of glucose is degraded to lactic acid, generating 200 molecules of lactate. Such a high lactate load can easily surpass monocarboxylate extruding capacity and a certain amount of lactate would remain inside the cell creating intracellular lactic acidosis that would endanger cancer cell survival. Activation of the Cori cycle comes to solve this situation by reconverting part of the lactate to glucose. This creates a vicious cycle in which the more glucose is degraded, the more the Cori cycle “works”, consuming four ATPs in each turn of the cycle. Each turn of the cycle increases the glycolytic flux by the generation of more glucose. This creates a vicious cycle. <a href="#f2">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#f3">Figure 3</a>.</p><p class="" id=d30735e709><a href="#f2">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#f3">Figure 3</a> are not based on real calculations.

Why does the cancer cell need the Cori cycle? The need stems from the fact that the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) system is saturable. The complete or almost complete abrogation of the mitochondrial metabolism plus the increased glycolytic flux represent such a burden that the MCT capacity is surpassed. In muscle, the half-maximal rate of lactate transport is achieved with a lactate concentration between 13 and 40 mM<sup><a href="#ref-81">81</a></sup>. If the maximal rate is achieved (about 20 nmol/min per μl of intracellular volume at 25°C)<sup><a href="#ref-82">82</a></sup>, the excess would remain inside the cell. Therefore, by transforming lactate into glucose or pyruvate The Cori cycle prevents intracellular lactic acidosis which would induce acidic stress and kill the cell. The velocity of lactate extrusion by MCTs is also dependent on intracellular and extracellular pH<sup><a href="#ref-60">60</a></sup>. Decreased intracellular pH increases extrusion velocity, while it is lowered by extracellular acidity<sup><a href="#ref-59">59</a></sup>.

They maintained that a phenotypic switch from white adipose tissue to brown adipose tissue metabolism was the main culprit of CC. The main characteristic of browning would be the increased expression of uncoupling protein-1 in white adipose tissue, with consequent high energy expenditure. They also found that inflammatory intermediaries (mainly IL-6) were the cause of the browning process and proposed the anti-inflammatory sulindac for CC treatment. Considering that the findings of Petruzzelli <i>et al.</i> are correct, one question remains unanswered: why do advanced tumors produce significant inflammatory mediators? And this takes as back to the anoxia problem: it is anoxia that induces the production of inflammatory mediators.</p><p class="" id=d30735e2468>The steps between anoxia and CC can be those proposed by Petruzzelli <i>et al.</i> (browning of white adipose tissue) or those hypothesized in this paper (increased Cori cycle). The increased Cori cycle can occur in the tumor, in the liver or in both. However, the <i>primum movens</i> remains anoxia. Treating the intermediate steps (TNFα, IL-6 or other chemokines), or the symptoms (loss of weight, lipolysis, muscle loss) are valid approaches. However, the only significant result would be achieved by simultaneously targeting fermentative glycolysis and anoxia alongside to the other treatments.</p><p class="" id=d30735e2477>A unified explanation of the causes of CC has not been achieved yet<sup><a href="#ref-337">337</a></sup>. Therefore, anoxia as the unifying cause behind CC deserves more research.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d30735e2487>Conclusions</h2><p class="" id=d30735e2490>A unitary explanation of the cause of CC is presented here. The main culprit of this wasting syndrome is anoxia. The molecular mechanisms leading from anoxia to the full blown syndrome are also presented. A therapeutic approach, based on this hypothesis is proposed.</p><p class="" id=d30735e2493>Anoxia in large areas of the tumor mass is the main cause of CC. This occurs through a sequence of events where oxidative phosphorylation is almost totally shut down leading to full glycolytic behavior (100% of the glucose is degraded through fermentation and none through oxidation). Vascular supply and cell metabolism are highly heterogeneous throughout the tumor. Anoxic anaerobic metabolism is also present in parts of the tumoral mass. When an important portion of the tumor is “pushed” to fully anaerobic metabolism by lack of oxygen, CC develops. Even the most recent publications on CC miss the central issue: anoxia. Therefore, there is no place for anti-anoxic treatments in the therapeutic protocols being used routinely. Anoxia produces such a high level of intracellular lactate that it surpasses monocarboxylate transporters extruder capacities. Thus, the Cori cycle is triggered to prevent intracellular lactic acidosis creating an energetic imbalance due to the cycle’s high energy requirements. Increased inflammatory mediators, that cause many of the symptoms of CC, are not produced by the tumor itself but by hypoxia resistant macrophages associated to the malignant stroma.</p><p class="" id=d30735e2496>All the treatments employed up to now have failed because they addressed the symptoms of CC instead of the causes. Here we propose targeting anoxia, HIF-1α, and the glycolytic pathway as the logical treatment for CC using a combination of drugs such as pentoxifylline, dichloroacetate, metformin and emodin associated with anabolic steroids and nutritional supplements. The drugs can be changed for others with a similar effect. What is important is to center the treatment on tumoral anoxia, the glycolytic pathway and TNF. It is probably useless to address only one of these issues or expect real improvements with nutritional supplements and appetite improvers. The usually late onset of CC in a prolonged disease and the frequent therapeutic failures have paved the way for a nihilistic attitude that has prevailed up to the present. Targeting the strongly anaerobic cells in the tumor will not only improve CC but at the same time slow down the disease and eventually prolong survival. DCA and the association of DCA with metformin, vasodilators, and HIF-1α inhibitors deserve well planed experimental and clinical research for CC’s therapy.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d30735e2502>Data availability</h2><p class="" id=d30735e2505>No data are associated with this article.</p></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d30735e2512 class=n-a></a><span class="research-layout prime-recommended-wrapper reference-heading is-hidden"><span class="f1r-icon icon-79_faculty_recommended_badge red vmiddle default-cursor"></span><span class="prime-red big">F1000 recommended</span></span><h2 class=main-title id=d32804>References</h2><div class="section ref-list"><a name=d30735e2512 class=n-a></a><ul><li><a name=ref-1 class=n-a></a><span class=label>1. </span>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d30735e2519 class=n-a></a>Bennani-Baiti N, Walsh D: What is cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome?
