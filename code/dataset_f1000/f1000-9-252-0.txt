This study performed a meta-analysis for an association study of NOS3 and klotho polymorphisms with CKD and age-related cognitive impairment (ACI). Several NOS3 and klotho polymorphic nucleotide sites were analyzed in 48 selected papers. The correlation was found only in NOS3 G894T with ACI. On the other hand, the correlation was found in NOS 4b4a, NOS3 G894T, and KL G395A with CKD. The authors conclude that NOS3 G894T has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of both CKD and ACI. I have a major concern as follows. The purpose of this paper is not clear. Which is to reveal common polymorphisms in ACI and CKD to associate these two pathologies, to find polymorphisms correlated in CKD and aging, by using ACI as a marker of aging, or other purposes? However, ACI is not a good marker of aging in a meta-analysis because ACI has pathological complexity. According to the purpose, the parameter selection of polymorphic genes should be different. NOS3 functions in the cardiovascular system and the NOS3 polymorphisms are susceptible to diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, stroke, and other complications. Klotho functions in the endocrine FGF-mediated metabolic processes, such as regulating insulin secretion, feeding, and renal reabsorption of calcium and phosphate; therefore, it is associated with diabetes, CKD, and other metabolic disorders. In this regard, a meta-analysis to reveal the correlation between NOS3 and ACI should be performed separately to the meta-analysis to reveal the correlation between Klotho with CKD. Without a clear purpose, correlation studies of NOS3 and Klotho in both ACI and CKD are not clinically important. Please clarify your purpose of the study and revise your introduction and conclusions with appropriate references. You may be required additional meta-analysis on other gene polymorphisms related to ACI and CKD.
