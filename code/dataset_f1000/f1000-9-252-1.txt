The authors performed a meta-analysis to assess the role of NOS and klotho single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pathogenesis of CKD and age-related cognitive impairment. They identified SNPs potentially involved in the pathogenesis of age-related cognitive impairment and CKD. They concluded that NOS3 G894T gene polymorphism has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of both CKD and age-related cognitive impairment. Overall, the study is well designed and conducted. The PRISMA checklist was well implemented. Major concern: A hypothesis is missing and validation is lacking. Association does not necessarily mean a causal relationship. Confounding factors, mediators, and compensatory factors can be implicated in the role of NOS and klotho single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pathogenesis of CKD and age-related cognitive impairment. The definition and diagnostic criteria seem lacking for age-related cognitive impairment. Of note is that age-related cognitive impairment is not a disease. Ref 13 fails to give a definition. Minor points: " and being of low-quality (two)." in the paper selection should be specified. "a candle in the darkness" is kind of exaggerated. It is simply a meta-analysis. The data should not be over-interpreted. The language should be polished. "frightening" appears frightening in scientific writings. " 13 papers were also excluded because of review(s)" should be rephrased. Please use "we found that...... " instead of "our results found that...... ". "For age-related cognitive impairment, we identified three SNPs available for meta-analysis calculation, such as: NOS3 G894T, NOS3 T786C, and KL G-395A." can be rephrased to "For age-related cognitive impairment, we identified three SNPs available for meta-analysis calculation, including NOS3 G894T, NOS3 T786C, and KL G-395A."
