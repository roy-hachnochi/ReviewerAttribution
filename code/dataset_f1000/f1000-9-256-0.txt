This manuscript is much improved! Here are just a few additional points, mostly minor: Introduction: "Although how MGN influences moral growth among people HAS been examined..." (replace 'have' with "has"). "we found some point that could be improved IN THE MEASURE..." (replace "in them" with "in the measure" as this sentence was a little bit confusing. I might suggest changing this sentence overall for clarity/brevity, something like: "Although how MGM influences moral growth has been examined in several previous studies with a quantitative measure, the current MGM measure is not psychometrically sound and a new measure is needed. Specifically, MGM was previously included..." I'd suggest mentioning here that the theory measures include the "implicit theory" (not just "theory measures") so that that term feels familiar when we read the methods. Study 1 I can see why you might have the section "translation of the MGM measure to English" in the measure section, but I actually think this belongs in the literature review section, after the introduction. This is an important part of your argument for the items in your scale and their construction and makes the most sense before the study's description. Additional concern/limitation: The last concern I have involves the negative wording of the items. I know this can't be helped at this stage, but negatively worded items can often be confusing for participants and reduce the reliability of a scale. I suggest adding this potential limitation to your discussion. See: Swain, S. D., Weathers, D., Niedrich, R. W. (2008). Assessing three sources of misresponse to reversed Likert items. Journal of Marketing Research , 45 (1), 116-131 1 . Thank you to the authors for giving such careful attention to our previous comments - I believe this manuscript is much stronger now! Though this study has limitations, Moral Growth Mindset is a wonderful addition to the literature and it is very exciting to see such bright scholars tackling new measures that make it possible to measure important concepts such as MGM. I'll be excited to see how the measurement items are used and developed further over time! References 1.
