The authors carefully designed two studies to test the reliability and validity of the English version of MGM, moral growth mindset. The literature review was relevant and coherent. The method section was well articulated. The results were clearly presented. The discussion was well-organized. One recommendation for future study: given for both studies, majorities of the participants are Caucasian. A future study may want to investigate whether the MGM is consistent across various ethnicities.
