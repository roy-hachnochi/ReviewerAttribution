This is a timely, informative, and well written article providing clinicians with practical advice about how to best advise and support patients with tics during these challenging times. The authors navigate through the many uncertainties of the unfolding circumstances using the best available evidence as well as their own invaluable experience, according to the ancient motto ‘scientia et conscientia’. I have little to say in terms of further improving this useful article. As the authors rightly point out, anxiety is a common comorbidity that needs to be addressed with particular care, in consideration of its recognized role as tic-exacerbating factor. A recent review article on telemedicine for hyperkinetic movement disorders covers tic disorders, and states that “the extent to which telemedicine facilitates multidisciplinary treatment needs to be further studied” (Srinivasan et al. 2020) 1 . It is hoped that the current circumstances and the unprecedented measures (including social distancing) are also seen as an opportunity to improve our understanding of patients’ needs. The authors might want to add their suggestions about gathering high quality information on remotely delivered clinical input.
