This study aimed to evaluate dental arches by analyzing dental arch asymmetry and form in orthodontic patients with CH in a North Sumatra subpopulation. Retrospective study design in 34 patients, 10-30 years old. Abstract: Adequate. Introduction: Adequate. Methods: Participants Inclusion: CH suspected subjects fulfilled the following characteristics: facial asymmetry based on photography, posterior cross bite and midline deviation in plaster casts analysis, and positive temporomandibular joint disorder in functional analysis. It is unclear if patients needed to have all of these? The reason for asking, a fair amount of patients with CH do not have any functional issues with the TMJ joint. At what time points were the records taken and studied? The same protocol for all patients? And at what ages? Results: Age of inclusion? Would the authors expect a difference in the still active versus the non-active growth patients? If so please show the actual ages at inclusion and follow-up. And add a paragraph to the results about this. I do not see the patients classified as being either left or right side CH? Were they grouped? That does not make a lot of sense to me, especially when looking at the deviation of midline. Please elaborate. Discussion: Adequate Tables: The legend should include explanation of the abbreviations used in the table.
