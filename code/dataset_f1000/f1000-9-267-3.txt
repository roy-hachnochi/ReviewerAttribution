This work reports bioelectrospray of human neural stem cells and examines the survival, growth, and differentiation after bioelectrospray. This is an interesting work as bioelectrospray could be used to deposit human neural stem cells to form patterns for forming and studying complex neural tissue constructs. Overall, this work is satisfactory. However, authors should provide details of the bioelectrospray process. For example, how long for the process? In addition, the flow rate 250 ml/h seems too high. Please double check.
