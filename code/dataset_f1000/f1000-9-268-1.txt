In this article, the authors investigated the repurposing of anti-malarial drugs for the treatment of Ebola virus disease. The presented study of anti-malarial quinolines showed that these compounds effectively inhibit Ebola virus replication in vitro. These results point out anti-parasitic quinoline compounds as a template for the development of novel safe and cheap drugs for the treatment of the Ebola disease. This clearly presented and experimentally well-supported manuscript is suitable for indexing in F1000Research.
