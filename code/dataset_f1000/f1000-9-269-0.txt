A well designed study on an important topic. The correct title of the one of the hospital settings is Colombo South Teaching Hospital and not Kalubowila General Hospital (KGH). The authors need to attend to the correction. It would have been worthwhile if the researchers could have substantiated the findings with a few qualitative inquiries among the users. The conclusions and the recommendations are relevant to improve the services.
