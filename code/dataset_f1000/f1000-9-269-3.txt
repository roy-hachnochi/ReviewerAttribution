The article “Gender-based violence: Experience from two tertiary care settings in Sri Lanka” is based on the retrospective analysis of well recorded data of 488 women who attended special clinics in one women’s hospital and one general hospital in the capital city of Colombo, Sri Lanka. The analysis consists of socio-demographic factors, details of care seekers, how they ended in the clinic and the types of violence i.e. economic, emotional, physical or sexual. The tendency for suicide was notable with 20% respondents admitting that they had encountered these thoughts. In 92% of cases, the husband, partner or lover were the perpetrators. Married women and those not in a stable relationship experienced more physical violence. Emotional and economic violence were the commonest form of GBV. This study highlights the important issues of economic and emotional GBV. This may be linked to the fact that these women may be no or low wage earners. The low follow up visit rates indicates that either the women are busy or they feel that the advice/services they receive may not be adequate. The conclusion suggests that there is a need to increase public awareness. One wonders whether this could be achieved by incorporating the GBV issue in schools and religious events. This paper is an important contribution to highlight the problem. Future studies are needed to focus on effective interventions and outcomes. The work is clearly and adequately presented with citation to recent references. It is a detailed analysis of well recorded retrospective data. Sufficient details on methods and analysis is provided for others to produce similar work. I am not a qualified statistician to verify the accuracy of the analysis. Availability of the source data and how to access the data is provided by the authors. Conclusions are supported by the data and analysis provided.
