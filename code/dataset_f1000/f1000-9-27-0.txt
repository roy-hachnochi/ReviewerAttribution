There are several public databases that provide orthologous groups, which rely on different approaches for orthology prediction. For most researchers is often difficult to keep up with all the algorithms and methods used in these databases in order to make good use of the available data. This software tool article is guiding the reader through the usage of the OMA browser, a web-based interface for orthology prediction. The article is clear and well written. It provides an excellent guide for prospective users of the OMA browser. I have just a few comments that I believe will improve the first submitted version: General comment: Why should a researcher prefer the OMA browser for finding orthologs for his/her gene of interest instead of other platforms like KEGG (KO) or EggNOG etc? What are the biggest advantages of the OMA browser from the user perspective? Specific comments: In the Introduction: Page 3: The authors should clearly explain the differences between ortholog, co-ortholog, paralog, in/out-paralog, xenolog etc either by adding a new a box or a schematized figure. Page 3: “and described the OMA browser” – should be rephrased. Page 3: Figure 1 – how is the third genome selected? In the Methods: Page 7: “ OMA will choose one to be in the OMA Group (Box 4)”. Should be Box 5 instead of Box 4? Page 7: Table 1 – I suggest including a row with the candidate false positives and false negatives for each of the algorithms. Page 8: typo – S1000P_HUMAN. S100P_HUMAN is the correct ID.
