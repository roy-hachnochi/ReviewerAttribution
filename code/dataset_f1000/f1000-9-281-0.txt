In this review, Baker Hayden describe the field of gene editing for the treatment of dermatologic conditions. This is a very well-written and interesting review. I only have minor suggestions prior to publication. Minor: In your discussion of NHEJ and HDR, could you provide specifics about the efficiency of HDR (as a freq, etc)? Under "Genodermatoses" you have a few sentences that seem redundant, please consider streamlining your intro paragraph before going into specific disease areas. Last paragraph under EB: any comment/concern about electroporating a mouse tail? Feasibility in humans? Side effects? In the melanoma section, any thoughts about "kill switch" T cells? Maybe include a brief discussion about the skin microbiome, either in the bacteria section or future directions section? Could focus on the impact of gene editing on microbiome dynamics, or therapeutic potential for correcting dysbioses.
