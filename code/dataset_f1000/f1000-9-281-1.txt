In this review article, Baker and Hayden discuss the role of CRISPR technology in genome editing for dermatological diseases. Overall, the manuscript is well-written with clear and unambiguous language. The article highlights the studies that use CRISPR-Cas 9 approach for gene editing in various cutaneous diseases and provides a balanced assessment by noting both advantages and limitations of using this technology. However, it could improved with the following suggestions: Page 4 - Since EB can be caused by mutation in several genes and multiple mutations can be observed within the same patient, strategies correcting a single mutation may not reverse the disease completely. How would some of these studies, which correct a single mutation, translate clinically? Are there any efforts to correct multiple mutations at once using CRISPR? Page 7 - iPSCs are an attractive tool for cell therapy in some ways because of their low immunogenicity. However, there are several safety concerns with these cells. They could acquire mutations while being expanded in culture and develop into teratomas (Dinella 2014 1 ). What methods are used to overcome these concerns? Page 7 - Challenges of therapeutic application should be discussed in more detail. Low efficiency of gene editing is also one of the drawbacks. What are the new techniques being applied to overcome this? (For example, one of the ways to improve the efficiency of HDR is the use of NHEJ inhibitors) Page 7 - In your discussion of strategies to improve the specificity of Cas9, include the possibility of using several modifications of Cas9 like high-fidelity Cas9 (eSpCas9), evolved Cas9 (evoCas9) in addition to the ones you have mentioned.
