The work presented by Pais Taveira is entitled Predicting the evolution and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal and it aims to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first 21 days. The authors used a simple mathematical model assuming 14 days infection period. According to the authors, the model 'predicts the impact of isolation measures towards the expected peak of infection'. I am not convinced this is accurate. I believed the authors used the model to estimate the strength of the measures (i.e. percentage lockdown) and not to estimate the impact of the measures on the spread of SARS-Cov-2. This would imply a more elaborated study (e.g. case-control study). Indeed the consistently wrote 'transmission dynamics of COVID-19' and not the correct form 'transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2'. The authors predicted 2 million cases, which I find surprisingly high. Using the optimal isolation percentage (70-75%), the model still predicted over 150,000 cases which are approximately 5-fold higher than the current number of cases in Portugal (~35,000). I would like to see the model's prediction using even higher percentages of isolation. This should be also discussed.
