The authors, through this short descriptive paper, present MetaboMaps, a new tool for uploading pathways and overlaying data from multiple omics. The pathways are visualised clearly with multiple options for the type of overlays available. The program is open source and publicly available, making it easy for others to access and examine as needed. This paper would be strengthened by including a better review of other platforms/tools which do similar or related tasks. In particular, the authors should look at wikipathways, and the combination of wikipathways with pathvisio or cytoscape, and explore how their approach differs from what is currently available through these tools. By highlighting the differences and similarities between approaches it will make it easier for potential users to evaluate the platform and select the best tool for their datasets.
