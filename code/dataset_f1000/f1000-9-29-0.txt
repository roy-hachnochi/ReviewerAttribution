This is a simple straightforward report on the serum levels of tau protein, measured by ELISA, in two different settings of the impact-acceleration model of diffuse traumatic brain injury (presumably causing two degrees of severity of diffuse axonal injury [DAI]). The advantage of having such data available is to show that we may have (emphasis is on may ) a peripheral reporter of the severity of diffuse TBI and, potentially, DAI, using a model that is very appropriate for the task. However, as the authors would be the first to acknowledge, this experiment uses only two degrees of severity of impact acceleration (IA) based on mechanical inputs without testing for severity of traumatic brain injury and certainly not severity of DAI by any of the available applicable measures, also without a time course for the observed changes that is essential for characterizing DAI. Therefore, the neuropathology of DAI has not been tested here and it would appear that the only part of the report where something like this could be mentioned is the Discussion—certainly not the title, where a more neutral term such as “severity of impact acceleration” would be more appropriate. Also, with only two degrees of IA tested, the conditional “may” should be used throughout. We need more work before we can look at a definitive study linking peripheral tau protein levels to severity of diffuse traumatic brain injury and quite a bit more if we want to explore peripheral markers of DAI.
