This study is an interesting study looking at the correlation between transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) and serum bilirubin and the predictive value of subsequent clinically significant hyperbilirubinemia in neonates. However, there are some problems with the study that need to be addressed. They authors state that TcB has not been used in premature infants with the exception of late preterms. However, in a systematic review by Nager et al. most of the 22 articles they mention include very preterm infants. Perhaps the authors need to mean to say in their population but this needs to be clarified. Each country does indeed need to develop their own criteria for diagnosis and treatment levels of hyperbilirubinemia based on risk in their environment, treatments available and other specifics related to their own country. However, authors do need to tell us where there cutoffs for each group came from---are the in country normal, standard cutoffs for their hospital or region or how were they selected. Numbers too small to extrapolate widely to Indonesia or beyond. Rhesus of mothers and infants missing; G6PD status missing if not done state that. Although not a major problem or limitation this article could be improved by having a native English speaker read and make minor edits throughout.
