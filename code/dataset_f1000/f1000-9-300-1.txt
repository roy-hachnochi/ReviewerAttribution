This is an interesting study investigating in preterm neonates (PTNs) the predictive value of the bilirubin level assessed by transcutaneous technique (TcB) for hyperbilirubinemia (HB). 90 PTNs were and divided into two groups according to the weight (1500 g as diving value). Bilirubin was prospectively measured at different time points (12, 24, 48, and 72 h). Bilirubin level was confirmed by serum bilirubin measurement (TSB) if the TcB was “increased”. ROC curves were used to assess a 24 h TcB value predicting 48 and 72 h HB. Although the data may be of interest, the study suffers several intrinsic weaknesses what must be addressed before being considered further. Major Critiques: The indication when TSB was measured is unclear and confusing. In the abstract it is stated that TSB was assessed before 72 h if TcB showed “abnormal results”. What does this mean? Detailed numerical values must be provided to allow to understand why TSB was performed. On what basis the TSB value of ≥ 7 mg/dL in group 1 and 10 mg/dL HB in group 2 was selected? This needs to be scientifically substantiated. At what time this level was measured? How TSB was measured? Were the lab values confirmed by internal calibration? This must be clarified. Fig 1 shows that the time course of HB is different in the 2 groups being the bilirubin peak reached 24 h later in group 2. This difference accounts for the different TcB cutoff values. This needs to be considered and addressed in the discussion. How was the correlation between TcB and TSB at 72h? This information is important to assess the reliability of the two techniques (see also point #3). The abstract is inaccurate as data reported are different from those indicated in the text (see for example the lack of 48H values).
