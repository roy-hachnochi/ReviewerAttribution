This software tool article motivates and describes the use of GffRead and GffCompare, two utility programs for manipulating GFF and GTF files, including a comparison of one set of transcripts to a reference. The article is well written and clearly describes the use cases for the software. I have downloaded the two programs onto a laptop running OS X and have used the precompiled Mac binaries as well as building the tools from source. I ran GffRead to change a Gencode GTF file to GFF, and to extract spliced transcript sequences from a genome FASTA. I ran GffCompare to compare two Gencode releases of a GTF file. The programs were easy to run, took at most a few minutes on a laptop (for comparison), and are both well documented. I have only minor comments (spelling/formatting): RNA-Seq is used twice, while RNA-seq is used once. Table 1 has "(strand )" with a space (angle brackets not allowed in the report, so I use parens). Table 2 row two, column two has a line break. Transfrags are defined in this article but not in the online documentation. Under "Use Cases", there is a "fasta" not capitalized. Under "Transcript accuracy estimation with GffCompare", perhaps "with respect to a known reference annotation". Under "Annotating transcripts with GffCompare", should be "this reference transcript". Under "Tracking transcripts with GffCompare", "(input_file)" is italicized.
