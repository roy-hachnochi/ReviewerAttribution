Overall, this is a clear, well-written manuscript. Adequate information especially on patient's presentation as well as approach was described. The introduction is relevant. Adequate information on previous study findings on viral laryngotracheitis is mentioned for readers to follow. Also, it is interesting that step-by-step airway assessment was provided for readers which is especially prudent during this period. However, the authors need to mention on why biopsy was not performed in this case. This manuscript definitely adds value to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
