A very good attempt to present the Indian COVID-19 scenario by the authors. I congratulate them on their work. However a few queries: The data analysis has been performed on 1161 patients. To project it for such a large population has limited scope. The range of the projection of 1.10 lakh to 2.20 lakh is quite wide. How do we interpret it? In COVID, most of the patients recover in due course. If possible, the SEIR model could have been used for a better picture. The discussion section contains a comparison with the descriptive data of different countries. It could have been compared with the modeling data of different studies of other countries to highlight the similarity/difference of the Indian scenario. The authors in the discussion state that "we observed that the highest number of patients is in the 60â€“79 years age group category. The exact percentage projected needs to be mentioned. The assumptions that the authors took for the modeling approach needs to be clearly stated in the methodology apart from birth and death rate.
