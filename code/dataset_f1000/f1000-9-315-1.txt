 The mathematical model used is "SIR", standing for "Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered/dead". This needs modification throughout the manuscript. In COVID-19, re-infection is being seen in a few patients. This can be explained in limitation as to why "SIRS" model was not considered over "SIR". And also, not all susceptible individuals are infected. Why was the "SEIR" model not considered by authors? Although, the model mentions that the birth rate and death rate were not taken into account, its effect on outcome estimation has not been explicitly mentioned. The reason that the duration of infection is much lesser than the lifetime of an individual can be explanatory for non-inclusion of birth and death rate. Clear mention of the force of infection with proper notation is required. Reasons for the younger age group being affected more can be explained in greater detail. Various studies have been published to date with different modelling techniques for the estimation of COVID-19 cases. They can be used for comparison in the discussion section.
