 The review is well written. Addition of review on gene expression work would be beneficial and the last part regarding Omegas is not that strong as there is no work to date that shows any relationship to WB. I would suggest deleting that portion or strengthen it. Please use "Pectoralis major" (or minor) italicized throughout. Please use another term other than "varieties" such as "breeds" Varieties is not commonly used for poultry (more so for plants). Please provide a reference for "First identified roughly 15 years ago...". WB characteristics have also been observed in thigh meat so please reword statement about WB localizing in the breast only (ie, maybe change to primarily in the breast) ("A critical trait of WB.....). Omega-6 and Omega-3 review is weak in terms of showing no direct relationship to WB. Tie these together more, condense significantly, or delete.
