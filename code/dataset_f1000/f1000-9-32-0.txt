This is an interesting article on a relevant topic. It is well written and important points are clearly presented. Gabapentinoids, gabapentin and pregabalin, are being increasingly dispensed for indications outside US FDA labelling, particularly as part of multimodal analgesia in the perioperative setting. Emerging evidence from pre-clinical, human volunteer, inpatient, and outpatient studies suggests that their use in combination with opioids may increase the risk of respiratory depression. In our recent studies, use of gabapentinoids on the day of surgery was associated with increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients who underwent colorectal surgery 1 . We also found that in-hospital use of both gabapentin and pregabalin had dose dependent associations with pulmonary complications in the immediate postoperative period after total hip and knee arthroplasties 2 . The adverse effect of perioperative use of gabapentinoids can occur in all countries. While differences in risk across different populations are unclear (for example, the prevalence of pulmonary complications after concurrent use of opioids with gabapentinoids may differ among races), we suggest that a caution be warranted when these drugs are used in combination with opioids. Obviously, it is essential to establish effective safety reporting systems to detect signals of adverse events and disseminate the information to all relevant sections.
