This is a good written article, but there are little things I think to make it perfect if the author follows it. First: in Introduction: the author does not mention study hypotheses. Explain why the current research is important. What value does the paper add? What practical benefits will it provide? Second: Sample and sampling, it is important to add and mention the procedure of taking sampling for this huge sample size.
