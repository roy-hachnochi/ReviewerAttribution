The authors provide a dataset of the PVD scale from a Japanese sample in September 2018, which would serve as a baseline for comparison with the PVD in the current and post COVID-19 situations. The study will give not only a dataset but also an important message for future studies on the changes in human behavior during and after this COVID-19 period. I would like to give some minor comments. Introduction: To be precise, COVID-19 is an abbreviation for coronavirus disease 2019. “perceived infectability” and “germ aversion” may be capitalized, according to Duncan et al. (2009). It might be better to clarify that Goh (2020) was a cross-sectional study (i.e., no comparison with pre-COVID-19 data) to underscore the necessity of baseline. Participants, Exclusion: It would be better to report SD of participants’ age. Procedure: Please clarify whether the calculation problem was inserted between or after the PVD scale items.
