            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: Validated biomarkers are needed to identify patients at increased risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Antibodies directed against endogenous antigens can change after exposure to ICB. 
 Methods: Patients with different solid tumors stratified into cohorts received pembrolizumab every 3 weeks in a Phase II trial (INSPIRE study). Blood samples were collected prior to first pembrolizumab exposure (baseline) and approximately 7 weeks (pre-cycle 3) into treatment. In a discovery analysis, autoantibody target immuno-mass spectrometry was performed in baseline and pre-cycle 3 pooled sera of 24 INSPIRE patients based on clinical benefit (CBR) and irAEs. 
 Results: Thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) were identified as the candidate autoantibody targets. In the overall cohort of 78 patients, the frequency of CBR and irAEs from pembrolizumab was 31% and 24%, respectively. Patients with an anti-Tg titer increase &ge;1.5x from baseline to pre-cycle 3 were more likely to have irAEs relative to patients without this increase in unadjusted, cohort adjusted, and multivariable models (OR=17.4, 95% CI 1.8&ndash;173.8, p=0.015). Similarly, patients with an anti-TPO titer &ge; 1.5x from baseline to pre-cycle 3 were more likely to have irAEs relative to patients without the increase in unadjusted and cohort adjusted (OR=6.1, 95% CI 1.1&ndash;32.7, p=0.035) models. Further, the cohort adjusted analysis showed patients with anti-Tg titer greater than median (10.0 IU/mL) at pre-cycle 3 were more likely to have irAEs (OR=4.7, 95% CI 1.2&ndash;17.8, p=0.024). Patients with pre-cycle 3 anti-TPO titers greater than median (10.0 IU/mL) had a significant difference in overall survival (23.8 vs 11.5 months; HR=1.8, 95% CI 1.0&ndash;3.2, p=0.05). 
 Conclusions: Patient increase &ge;1.5x of anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers from baseline to pre-cycle 3 were associated with irAEs from pembrolizumab, and patients with elevated pre-cycle 3 anti-TPO titers had an improvement in overall survival.">

  "description": "Background: Validated biomarkers are needed to identify patients at increased risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Antibodies directed against endogenous antigens can change after exposure to ICB.
Methods: Patients with different solid tumors stratified into cohorts received pembrolizumab every 3 weeks in a Phase II trial (INSPIRE study). Blood samples were collected prior to first pembrolizumab exposure (baseline) and approximately 7 weeks (pre-cycle 3) into treatment. In a discovery analysis, autoantibody target immuno-mass spectrometry was performed in baseline and pre-cycle 3 pooled sera of 24 INSPIRE patients based on clinical benefit (CBR) and irAEs.
Results: Thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) were identified as the candidate autoantibody targets. In the overall cohort of 78 patients, the frequency of CBR and irAEs from pembrolizumab was 31% and 24%, respectively. Patients with an anti-Tg titer increase &ge;1.5x from baseline to pre-cycle 3 were more likely to have irAEs relative to patients without this increase in unadjusted, cohort adjusted, and multivariable models (OR=17.4, 95% CI 1.8&ndash;173.8, p=0.015). Similarly, patients with an anti-TPO titer &ge; 1.5x from baseline to pre-cycle 3 were more likely to have irAEs relative to patients without the increase in unadjusted and cohort adjusted (OR=6.1, 95% CI 1.1&ndash;32.7, p=0.035) models. Further, the cohort adjusted analysis showed patients with anti-Tg titer greater than median (10.0 IU/mL) at pre-cycle 3 were more likely to have irAEs (OR=4.7, 95% CI 1.2&ndash;17.8, p=0.024). Patients with pre-cycle 3 anti-TPO titers greater than median (10.0 IU/mL) had a significant difference in overall survival (23.8 vs 11.5 months; HR=1.8, 95% CI 1.0&ndash;3.2, p=0.05).
Conclusions: Patient increase &ge;1.5x of anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers from baseline to pre-cycle 3 were associated with irAEs from pembrolizumab, and patients with elevated pre-cycle 3 anti-TPO titers had an improvement in overall survival."

Antibodies directed against endogenous antigens can change after exposure to ICB.<br/> <b>Methods:</b> Patients with different solid tumors stratified into cohorts received pembrolizumab every 3 weeks in a Phase II trial (INSPIRE study). Blood samples were collected prior to first pembrolizumab exposure (baseline) and approximately 7 weeks (pre-cycle 3) into treatment. In a discovery analysis, autoantibody target immuno-mass spectrometry was performed in baseline and pre-cycle 3 pooled sera of 24 INSPIRE patients based on clinical benefit (CBR) and irAEs.<br/> <b>Results:</b> Thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) were identified as the candidate autoantibody targets. In the overall cohort of 78 patients, the frequency of CBR and irAEs from pembrolizumab was 31% and 24%, respectively. Patients with an anti-Tg titer increase ≥1.5x from baseline to pre-cycle 3 were more likely to have irAEs relative to patients without this increase in unadjusted, cohort adjusted, and multivariable models (OR=17.4, 95% CI 1.8–173.8, p=0.015). Similarly, patients with an anti-TPO titer ≥ 1.5x from baseline to pre-cycle 3 were more likely to have irAEs relative to patients without the increase in unadjusted and cohort adjusted (OR=6.1, 95% CI 1.1–32.7, p=0.035) models. Further, the cohort adjusted analysis showed patients with anti-Tg titer greater than median (10.0 IU/mL) at pre-cycle 3 were more likely to have irAEs (OR=4.7, 95% CI 1.2–17.8, p=0.024). Patients with pre-cycle 3 anti-TPO titers greater than median (10.0 IU/mL) had a significant difference in overall survival (23.8 vs 11.5 months; HR=1.8, 95% CI 1.0–3.2, p=0.05).<br/> <b>Conclusions: </b>Patient increase ≥1.5x of anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers from baseline to pre-cycle 3 were associated with irAEs from pembrolizumab, and patients with elevated pre-cycle 3 anti-TPO titers had an improvement in overall survival. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> programmed cell death protein 1, immune checkpoint blockade, pembrolizumab, response, predictive biomarkers, autoantibodies, anti-thyroglobulin antibody, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody, hypothyroidism, immune-related adverse events </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Eleftherios P.

Monotherapy response rates for inhibitors of programmed cell death protein-1 or its ligand (anti-PD-1/L1) across solid tumors are generally modest at approximately 20–30%, and much lower in some tumor types<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. All-grade and high-grade toxicities with PD-1/L1 approach 40% and 12%, respectively<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>–<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Hence, there is an unmet need for predictive biomarkers to enable patient selection. Although numerous markers have already been tested for their ability to predict response to ICB<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>, many require molecular and immune profiling from either invasive biopsy or archival tumor specimen<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Similarly, validated biomarkers that can identify patients who develop immune-related adverse events (irAEs) to ICB are lacking.</p><p class="" id=d4051e422>Antigen spreading is the phenomenon of <i>in situ</i> damaged cancer cells releasing intracellular antigens into the surrounding environment<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Although tumorigenesis distorts the native structure of these antigens<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>, which in turn elicit a humoral immune response that produces tumor associated antigen autoantibodies<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>–<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>, several studies have investigated the biomarker potential of autoantibodies targeting wild-type proteins using large human proteome arrays in patients treated with ICB. For instance, castrate resistant prostate cancer patients responding to ipilimumab demonstrate an increase in autoantibodies targeting intracellular proteins (such as MPG, PAK6 and DLX1) relative to non-responders<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Melanoma patients who developed severe irAEs from the combination of intralesional <i>bacillus Calmette-Guérin</i> injection and ipilimumab were found to have a significant increase in autoantibodies directed against self-antigens that preceded the clinical diagnosis of toxicity<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Pre-treatment autoantibody profiles in melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4 or a combination of both agents were unique to those who developed severe irAEs<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. Humoral immunity may be increased via PD-1 inhibition through direct interaction with PD-1 receptors on B-cells<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup> and/or non-cytotoxic T-cell dependent processes<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d4051e470>Current attempts to characterize serum autoantibodies are limited by analytic constraints inherent to complex biological samples, such as blood or lysate, that are fraught with low sensitivity<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. This study attempts to overcome this analytic limitation by typifying the serum autoantibodies using a modified version of the established Serologic Proteome Analysis assay<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a>–<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup> that incorporates protein G purification of serum autoantibodies and tandem mass spectrometric identification of the antibody targets.</p><p class="" id=d4051e487>We hypothesize that the magnitude of autoantibody production is a measure of response and/or toxicity to ICB.

The Cobas e 411 analyzer has an approximate 10% coefficient of variation for both anti-Tg<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup> and anti-TPO<sup><a href="#ref-35">35</a></sup> titers. Further, the coefficient of biological variation of these antibodies is also approximately 10%<sup><a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup>. To be conservative, a minimum 50% increase in titers from baseline to pre-cycle 3 was used to define a significant increase. Based upon instrument limitations, the measurable range of anti-TPO and anti-Tg antibodies were 5.00–600 IU/mL and 10.0–4000 IU/mL, respectively. Patients with anti-TPO titers &lt;5.00 IU/mL and anti-Tg titers &lt; 10.0 IU/mL were arbitrarily assigned 5.00 IU/mL and 10.0 IU/mL, respectively. One patient in the mixed solid tumor cohort had an anti-Tg titer &gt;4000 IU/mL both at baseline and cycle 3; the value of 4000 UI/mL was used for both time points.

These groups were analyzed as predictors of CBR and toxicity. Due to the possible influence of toxicity on autoantibody production, patients who developed toxicity before the pre-cycle 3 blood draw were removed from both the CBR and toxicity pre-cycle 3 and Δ analysis. Statistical significance among the categorical variables was evaluated using Fisher’s exact test. Further, the individual patient titers at baseline, pre-cycle 3, and difference in titer (defined as pre-cycle 3 titer minus baseline titer) were explored as continuous variables using the Mann-Whitney test.

study and clinical outcomes of each cohort. Last clinical outcome update was May 3, 2019; at that time the median follow-up was 2.35 years from date of first pembrolizumab infusion (range: 0.79–2.95 years), two patients (2.6%) were lost to follow up and 49 deaths (63%) occurred. Of the two patients lost to follow up, both developed disease progression as best response and one developed a significant toxicity event; both patients were included in the analysis. The median number of pembrolizumab infusions before coming off trial was five (range: 2–35 infusions). All patients were evaluable. CBR was achieved in 24 patients (31%): CR, PR and SD ≥6 cycles of pembrolizumab occurred in 3 patients (3.9%), 13 patients (17%) and 8 patients (10%), respectively. In total, three patients (3.9%) remained on treatment at time of analysis. RECIST disease progression (n=48, 62%) was the major reason for stopping treatment; five patients (6.4%) completed all 35 pembrolizumab cycles specified in the trial. Toxicity occurred in 19 patients (24%); hypothyroidism (n=8, 10%) was the most common toxicity, and nine patients (12%) developed more than one toxicity. Median number of days from first dose of pembrolizumab to toxicity onset was 105 (range: 1–482) and five patients (6.4%) developed toxicity before pre-cycle 3 blood draw. Toxicity necessitated stopping treatment in five patients (6.4%); of these, Grade 3 colitis (n=2, 2.6%) and Grade 3 pneumonitis (n=2, 2.6%) were the most common events. In total, seven patients (9.0%) developed Grade 3 toxicity, two patients (2.6%) developed more than one Grade 3 event and all remaining toxicity events were Grade 2; there were no Grade 4 or 5 events.</p><a name=f1 class=n-a></a><div class="fig panel clearfix"><a target=_blank href="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/25082/f219cacb-28a0-4ae1-bd5d-6cad2d5ae7fb_figure1.gif"><img alt="f219cacb-28a0-4ae1-bd5d-6cad2d5ae7fb_figure1.gif" src="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/25082/f219cacb-28a0-4ae1-bd5d-6cad2d5ae7fb_figure1.gif"></a><div class=caption><h3>Figure 1.

The analysis of the dichotomized values suggested some associations between anti-Tg and toxicity: Δ was significant in unadjusted (p=0.0024), cohort adjusted (OR=23.8, 95% CI 2.6–221.5, p=0.0053), and multivariable models (OR=17.4, 95% CI 1.8–173.8, p=0.015), suggesting an increased risk for toxicity for patients with a pre- anti-Tg cycle 3 titer ≥ 1.5x from baseline. Higher levels of anti-Tg pre-cycle 3 also predicted for higher rate of toxicity when adjusting for cohort (OR=4.7, 95% CI 1.2–17.8, p=0.024). Similarly, anti-TPO Δ was significant for predicting toxicity in patients with ≥1.5x increase in anti-TPO titers from baseline to pre-cycle 3 in unadjusted (p=0.039) and cohort adjusted (OR=6.1, 95% CI 1.1–32.7, p=0.035) models, although significance was lost in multivariable analysis (p=0.078). Anti-Tg titers at baseline and pre-cycle 3 were not significant for predicting toxicity in multivariate analysis, and anti-TPO baseline and pre-cycle 3 titers were not significant for predicting toxicity in any of the analyses. Further, anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers were not associated with CBR at any time point regardless of statistical approach.</p><a name=T2 class=n-a></a><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><div class=caption><h3>Table 2.

Hypothyroidism development during trial (n=8) was more common among: patients with elevated anti-Tg titers at baseline (75% vs 24%, p=0.007), pre-cycle 3 (86% vs 27%, p=0.0044) and increase in titers between these two time points (71% vs 7%, p=0.00026); and in patients with an increase in anti-TPO titer between baseline and pre-cycle 3 (57% vs 7%, p=0.0029). Of the eight patients who developed hypothyroidism, six (75%) had both elevated anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies at baseline and pre-cycle 3, one patient (12.5%) developed elevated anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers at pre-cycle 3, and the last patient had non-elevated titers at both time points. Conversely, of the 70 patients who did not develop hypothyroidism, 42 (60%) had elevated anti-Tg and/or anti-TPO titers at baseline and/or pre-cycle 3. There was no statistically significant association of anti-Tg or anti-TPO with the development of non-thyroid toxicities.

White ethnicity was associated with higher anti-Tg titers at baseline (continuous: p=0.048) and pre-cycle 3 (categorical: p=0.05; continuous: p=0.031) (see <i>Extended data</i><sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>). The remaining covariates did not exhibit any association with the autoantibodies (see <i>Extended data</i><sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>). The Spearman correlation coefficients calculated between the autoantibodies with age and PD-L1 as continuous variables were very small ranging between -0.167 and 0.14, suggesting lack of association between these variables (see <i>Extended data</i><sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>).<i></i></p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d4051e2084>Discussion</h2><p class="" id=d4051e2087>To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform an extensive autoantibody analysis in the pre- and post-pembrolizumab sera of patients with mixed solid tumors, and then determine the association of candidate autoantibodies with clinical benefit and toxicity. Our study suggested that patients with an increase in anti-Tg or anti-TPO titers from baseline to pre-cycle 3 are associated with significant toxicity in unadjusted and cohort-adjusted models, and the anti-Tg increase is also significant for toxicity in multivariable models. Hypothyroidism was observed in 10% in our cohort, which is consistent with the 6.5–7.9% incidence reported in an ICB meta-analysis<sup><a href="#ref-38">38</a></sup>, and accounted for 42% of all our toxicity events. Nearly half of our patients with non-thyroid toxicity had elevated anti-Tg and/or anti-TPO titers; however, we were unable to demonstrate an association of these antibodies with non-thyroid toxicity. A recent retrospective analysis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy demonstrated similar results: pre-treatment anti-Tg and/or anti-TPO antibodies were associated with the development of immune-related hypothyroidism, but not other irAEs<sup><a href="#ref-39">39</a></sup>. While antibodies for multiple autoimmune illnesses can develop simultaneously<sup><a href="#ref-40">40</a>–<a href="#ref-42">42</a></sup>, our analysis only chose the candidate with the largest number of identified peptides and a related candidate, and thus any non-thyroidal autoantibodies that may have been present were not analyzed. Future work assessing a larger spectrum of autoantibodies to create a biomarker signature will aid in addressing this issue.</p><p class="" id=d4051e2105>Herein we found an association between elevated pre-cycle 3 anti-TPO antibodies with OS. This is in keeping with the NSCLC study that showed baseline autoantibodies (including anti-Tg and anti-TPO) were associated with improved PFS and disease control rate during treatment with anti-PD-1 monotherapy<sup><a href="#ref-39">39</a></sup>. However, given our lack of association between anti-TPO with CBR and PFS, and baseline and Δ anti-TPO with OS, caution must be used in interpreting this result. Future trials enriching for specific disease sites will help elucidate the role autoantibodies may play as a prognostic and predictive biomarker to ICB.</p><p class="" id=d4051e2112>The association of irAEs with increased survival or response to ICB has been found in melanoma<sup><a href="#ref-43">43</a></sup> and NSCLC<sup><a href="#ref-44">44</a></sup> studies using statistical methods to prevent bias from the time-dependence of both predictor and outcome variables<sup><a href="#ref-45">45</a>,<a href="#ref-46">46</a></sup>. The analysis of toxicity as a time-dependent covariate did not corroborate this principle in our prospective trial of multiple histologies. If benefit is most likely procured from patients with toxicity events, then astute monitoring and early recognition of irAEs is paramount to control these toxicity events and prevent early treatment discontinuation.</p><p class="" id=d4051e2130>Not surprisingly, our association of baseline and on treatment anti-Tg or anti-TPO antibodies with the development of hypothyroidism is supported by other anti-PD-1 studies<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-39">39</a>,<a href="#ref-47">47</a></sup>. Interestingly, it appears cancer patients harbor higher rates of pre-existent autoantibodies: our pre-treatment combined anti-Tg and anti-TPO rate of 54%, and published rates of NSCLC patient pre-treatment rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody rates of 28% and 35%, respectively<sup><a href="#ref-39">39</a></sup>, are higher than the general population rates of anti-Tg (11%), anti-TPO (13%), rheumatoid factor (5–25%) and antinuclear antibodies (27%)<sup><a href="#ref-48">48</a>–<a href="#ref-50">50</a></sup>. While the development of tumor-associated autoantibodies to aberrant protein structures<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup> has undergone considerable biomarker investigation<sup><a href="#ref-51">51</a>–<a href="#ref-55">55</a></sup>, the mechanism of cancer patients developing autoantibodies to endogenous proteins and their biomarker potential is less clear.</p><p class="" id=d4051e2169>The increase in anti-thyroid antibody titers shortly after treatment initiation, or the development of new anti-thyroid antibodies following treatment, points to a possible unmasking of latent autoimmunity by pembrolizumab. Patients with pre-existing latent autoimmunity characterized by increased autoantibody titers may be at higher risk of developing toxicity from ICB. We suggest future prospective studies of other autoimmune markers at baseline are evaluated in patients treated with ICB to further elucidate a mechanism for this effect.</p><p class="" id=d4051e2172>Our study showed that patients can still develop hypothyroidism without the presence of anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies. Our reported rate on study of elevated anti-Tg and/or anti-TPO antibodies among those who developed hypothyroidism was 88%, which is comparable to the rates of elevated anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis within the general population (70–80% and 90–95%, respectively<sup><a href="#ref-56">56</a></sup>). The paucity of anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies in those who develop autoimmune primary hypothyroidism implies a non-humoral pathway. As observed in chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, these hypothyroidism events may be secondary to: reduced number and/or function of immune regulatory suppressor cells (e.g. CD4+CD25+)<sup><a href="#ref-57">57</a>,<a href="#ref-58">58</a></sup>; the large diversity of the third complementarity-determining region of T-cell surface antigen receptors creating increased propensity of attacking thyroid tissue<sup><a href="#ref-59">59</a></sup>; from Th1 cytotoxic T-cell apoptotic destruction of thyroid tissue<sup><a href="#ref-60">60</a></sup>; or loss of self-tolerance<sup><a href="#ref-61">61</a></sup> by direct interaction of anti-PD1-/L1 agents with PD-L1/L2 expressed on normal thyroid tissue<sup><a href="#ref-62">62</a></sup>. Since Th1 lymphocytes secrete interleukin-2, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-beta<sup><a href="#ref-63">63</a></sup>, evaluation of these cytokines may help elucidate the role of these cells in anti-PD-1-induced non-humoral hypothyroidism.</p><p class="" id=d4051e2207>This study has several limitations. This was a proof-of-concept study designed to screen for candidate autoantibody targets in a mixed solid tumor cohort. Our proteome was not comprehensive and may have missed potential targets during autoantibody candidate selection. During the candidate selection, the status of two patients changed due to the late development of significant toxicity events and four patients developed a toxicity event before the pre-cycle 3 blood draw, possibly skewing these preliminary results. Since the change in peptide quantity was used to select the candidates, the act of pooling serum samples among the four different patient groups may have diluted autoantibody targets present in low titers. Further, the candidates were selected based on peptide number increases from pre- to post-pembrolizumab, thus excluding possible candidates from baseline titers alone. Our study with mixed histologies, each in small numbers, creates a challenge in interpreting the CBR results. In total, 26 patients came off trial prior to pre-cycle 3 blood processing and were removed from the autoantibody analysis. This incomplete patient representation may bias event outcomes and distort the predictive/prognostic potential of the candidate autoantibodies. Since new irAEs from PD1 inhibition can occur many months after starting treatment<sup><a href="#ref-43">43</a></sup>, and onset of hypothyroidism post-PD-1 initiation can range from 0.7 weeks to 19 months<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>, there is the possibility that ongoing patient follow up will yield new toxicity events. This is especially pertinent to the patients who developed non-thyroidal toxicity who have anti-thyroid antibodies present. The small number patients analyzed and limited number of response and toxicity events yields low statistical power and may give spurious results. Ultimately, our findings require further validation in an independent prospective dataset, with adequate sample size to detect histology-specific effects on survival.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d4051e2222>Conclusions</h2><p class="" id=d4051e2225>We have shown an association of an increase in anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers between baseline at pre-cycle 3 pembrolizumab with toxicity, elevated pre-cycle 3 anti-Tg with toxicity, and elevated pre-cycle 3 anti-TPO with OS. However, anti-Tg and anti-TPO were unable to predict for non-thyroid toxicity. Future prospective trials evaluating these antibodies, ideally at a time point earlier than pre-cycle 3 of pembrolizumab or with other ICB agents, are needed to validate this finding. Enriching for patients with a single disease site will aid in determining their association with CBR. If successful, this will yield the first data for a minimally invasive, blood-based predictive biomarker to identify which patients derive benefit and/or toxicity from pembrolizumab, sparing unnecessary financial burden and delays to more appropriate care.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d4051e2231>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d4051e2234 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d4051e2239>Figshare: Autoantibody dataset.xlsx. <a target=xrefwindow href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12149598" id=d4051e2241>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12149598</a><sup><a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d4051e2248>This file contains the autoantibody dataset generated and assessed during this study, including patient outcomes, autoantibody titers and mass spectrometry data.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d4051e2252 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Extended data</h3><p class="" id=d4051e2257>Figshare: Extended data.docx. <a target=xrefwindow href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12149601.v1" id=d4051e2259>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12149601.v1</a><sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d4051e2266>This extended data file contains the following information: </p><div class=list><a name=d4051e2269 class=n-a></a><ul><li><p id=d4051e2273>Concentration of protein in various tissue lysates used for autoantibody binding.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2279>Autoantibody immuno-mass spectrometry methods.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2285>Immunohistochemistry methods and MPS calculation.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2291>Beeswarm plots showing anti-Tg antibody titers in those with or without toxicity from pembrolizumab.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2297>Statistics of anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibody as continuous variables and their association with CBR and toxicity.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2304>Beeswarm plots showing anti-TPO antibody titers in patients with and without toxicity to pembrolizumab.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2310>Beeswarm plots showing anti-Tg antibody titers in those with or without CBR from pembrolizumab.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2316>Beeswarm plots showing anti-TPO antibody titers in those with or without CBR from pembrolizumab.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2322>Kaplan-Meier PFS analysis using baseline and pre-cycle 3 anti-Tg.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2328>Kaplan-Meier PFS analysis using baseline and pre-cycle 3 anti-TPO.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2334>Kaplan-Meier analysis using Δ anti-Tg.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2341>Kaplan-Meier analysis using Δ anti-TPO.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2347>Analysis of covariate ethnicity with anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers as a categorical variable.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2353>Analysis of covariate ethnicity with anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers as continuous variables.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2359>Analysis of covariate gender with anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers as categorical variables.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2365>Analysis of covariate gender with anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers as continuous variables.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2371>Analysis of covariate PD-L1 MPS percentage as a categorical variable with anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers as categorical variables.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2378>Analysis of covariate PD-L1 MPS percentage as a continuous variable with anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers as categorical variables.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2384>Analysis of covariate PD-L1 MPS as a categorical variable and anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers as continuous variables.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2390>Analysis of covariate age as a continuous variable with anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers as categorical variables.</p></li><li><p id=d4051e2396>Analysis of standard prognostic variables age and PD-L1 MPS with anti-Tg and anti-TPO titers, all as continuous variables.</p></li></ul></div><p class="" id=d4051e2401>Data are available under the terms of the <a target=xrefwindow href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" id=d4051e2403>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a> (CC-BY 4.0).</p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d4051e1 class=n-a></a><h2 class=main-title id=d4323>Author contributions</h2><p class=metadata-entry><a name=d4051e304 class=n-a></a><p id=d4051e305> MI, MM, LLS and EPD wrote the paper.
