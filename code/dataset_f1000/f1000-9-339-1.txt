This is an interesting manuscript addressing the methodological issues with the continued trend of using mitochondrial DNA sequence data to infer genetic variation and population structure. The results are based on a very limited data set, however, they are only intended to further illustrate the issues highlighted by the authors . Apart from that, the study does not require much improvement. It is well written and structured and the results support the conclusions and therefore suggest indexing the article once the following issues have been considered and adequately resolved; The authors claim that this is the first study to use 28S ribosomal RNA at this taxonomic level. Do they mean in snails, as this gene has been used extensively for phylogenetics and some population level analysis? More info is needed. Could the authors include a reference when stating that there is an order of magnitude of difference between the mutation rates of the two markers used in the study? Reference 29 is cited as an example of the continued use of mtDNA for exploring demography, however, that study uses the mitochondrial control region rather than sequence data Protein Coding Genes (PCGs). Is there evidence that the mutation rates of this mitochondrial locus is under the same kind of diversifying selection as PCGs? If not, then the authors should consider changing or removing this reference. In the discussion the authors refer to the different thermal environments of the two snail species used in the study. It would be useful if the authors could elaborate on this as very little background about the species being studied is provided. The authors state that they are assuming 28S evolves in a clock-like manner. Can they provide a references/evidence for this as it is quite a bold statement, which has implications on some of the conclusions being drawn.
