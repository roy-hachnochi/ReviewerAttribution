The work showed an interesting result that is contrary to the common practice in Arabidopsis floral dip transformation. The authors demonstrated that the use of an unusually low concentration of Agrobacterium inoculum (OD600=0.002) could achieve the same transformation rate as a much higher concentration (OD600=1) does. They also discover a practical implication by using a small amount of Agrobacterium culture. The manuscript is well-written and results are convincing with a sound conclusion. The statistical method was appropriate as well. Minor revisions will be needed, though: Please indicate the Agrobacterium cell density (OD600 value (values)) at the time of harvest before the Agrobacterium cells were resuspended to OD600=0.001-1.0. This is an important growth parameter for Agrobacterium . If other users would harvest Agrobacterium cells at a too early stage, say, well before the log growth phase, with the same cell density of OD600=0.002, they may not obtain the same transformation rate. In other words, the description of the Agrobacterium growth phase (lag, log, stationary, etc.) to be harvested will be important. " Agrobacteria " should be " Agrobacterium " when it is used as an adjective such as Agrobacterium concentration. Please make corrections throughout the paper. The other reviewer has pointed out all the written and grammatical issues that I agree with, so no need for me to raise them again.
