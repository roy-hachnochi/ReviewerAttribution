The floral dip method for the transformation of Arabidopsis plants has been a revolutionary tool in plant biology. Several refinements to the popular protocol of Clough and Bent (1998) have been published. This report shows that Agrobacterium cultures diluted to as low as OD600=0.002 yielded a transformation rate similar to infection with regular-density suspensions (OD600=1). Down-scaling in this way can save time, space, and expense -- especially important for high-throughput transformation experiments. The article is well-written and the data convincing. Other steps of the transformation process such as plant preparation and downstream selection remain labor intensive, so follow-up experiments are important. The Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype used in this study is relatively easy to transform. It will be interesting to see if low Agro concentrations are equally suitable for other ecotypes / mutant genetic backgrounds or if the method can be combined with other efficiencies like making the Agrobacterium solution directly from plates to further avoid culturing and sub-culturing steps. Minor comments: Please see attached PDF for small corrections in grammar. Floral dip transformation is feasible in quite a few other species besides the ones listed (e.g. Bastaki and Cullis, 2014, references therein). Clarify the figure legend of Figure 1. Was this one representative experiment of six pots of plants? Or an average of the three independent trials mentioned in the materials and methods.
