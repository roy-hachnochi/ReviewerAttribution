The brief report titled "Access to treatment in prison: an inventory of medication preparation and dispensing approaches" is an important note for further dialogue among public health experts in this field. The study team appropriately started their inquiry with the health care providers and analyzed/documented important qualitative insight from the initial respondents. It is important that the qualitative interviews and discussion to continue engaging the beneficiaries, inmates so to understand their perspectives and finding a practical arrangement for proper health service provision while ensuring respect to their rights. I would suggest this great and primary interviews to be continued among inmates and non-health staff of the prison. Great work and thanks for all efforts and sharing the insight.
