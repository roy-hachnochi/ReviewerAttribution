 Despite the presence of several reports about the antiviral activity of remdesivir and merimepodib, the manuscript can provide useful information in the fight against SARS CoV2. Despite the provided piece of experiments and results of this manuscript, we still unable to precisely know the potency of these two drugs. The description of results was using the two concentrations of the two drugs without further important details. The potency of the drugs must be presented in terms of IC50. In this regard, several compounds were proved to be effective on SARS CoV-2 replication in the low nanomolar range and could be at least several folds more potent than REM and MMPD. In this case, the potency of REM and MMPD can be related to other anti-SARS CoV-2 drugs. The relation of the two drugs combination must be discussed in terms of additive effect, synergism or antagonism. For this purpose software as CompuSyn or similar can be used to calculate the combination index, which will scientifically assess the nature of these two drugs combination effect. “Oral administration of 50mg MMPD achieves a plasma concentration of around 2500ng/mL (5.5 μM) which makes it highly attractive for antiviral therapy” recheck this sentence For assay reproducibility, another cell type is required e,g, Calu-3 cells The raw data of crystal violet stain pictures and plaques count could be provided as supplementary file. The two drugs seems to act on late stages of virus replication, at least not in the attachment and fusion steps, the 4-hr pretreatment needs clarification. The time of addition experiment must be provided during different hours before and after infection.
