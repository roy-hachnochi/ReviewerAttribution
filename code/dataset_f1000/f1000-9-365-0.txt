The authors are trying to find out important residues of spike protein interacting with ACE2 using the ISM method. The application of the methods have not been validated with wide range of proteins comparing with experimental data. Therefore, it is not easy to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. Experimental data is available in the following paper: Chan, K.K., et al., Engineering human ACE2 to optimize binding to the spike protein of SARS coronavirus 2. Science, 2020: p. eabc0870. 1 I would like to see if how ISM in agreement with the data. Secondly, the ISM method is attempting to identify the residue impacting interactions with ACE2. However, for vaccines, neutralizing antibodies attached to spike protein to inhibit interaction or other process. Therefore, direct interaction with ACE2 does not necessarily mean key residue for vaccine. Rather, antibodies from B-cell must bind to the residues and the residues identified by the authors are not necessarily in the B-cell epitopes. Therefore, those residues are irrelevant to vaccines.
