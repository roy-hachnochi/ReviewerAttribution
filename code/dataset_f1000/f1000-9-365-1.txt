 This work highlights an interesting aspect of the COVID spike protein that may be useful for vaccine developers. Sequences of spike protein mutants are compared with the information spectrum method developed by the authors and it is found that the clustering of spike protein mutants allows one to draw conclusions on the expected effectiveness of the vaccines.
