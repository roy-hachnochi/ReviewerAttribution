Begum et al. submitted the manuscript ‘Analyses of spike protein from first deposited sequences of SARS-CoV2 from West Bengal, India’ where COVID19 virus sequences retrieved from GISAID database have been studied for possible mutations. Authors report three mutations out of which two are unique (T723I and G1124V) and one shared (D614G) with other geographical locations. This is a timely study, unrevealing two unique mutations that can be useful for further studies on the behavior of COVID19. However, the authors did not clarify why they characterized only one mutant but not the other. 1) The two mutations (T723I and G1124V) discussed in the manuscript should be similarly presented. Authors have described detailed analysis of G1124V mutation while T723I mutation is not discussed in detail. Therefore entropy calculations, interatomic interactions, deformation energy, and atomic fluctuation studies should also be done for mutation T723I. What is the effect of T723I mutation on the secondary structure? This analysis should also be done and included in Figure 3. This will further improve the quality of the manuscript. Authors claim that the two mutations (T723I and G1124V) are unique in the West Bengal region of India. Are they prevalent elsewhere in the World as well? Authors should expand their analysis and include more COVID19 isolates from different continents/countries. Minor comments: The accession number of Gujarat isolate in method and figure 1 do not match. Correction needed. Accession number EPI_ISL_430465 in Table 1 is duplicated. One should be EPI_ISL_430466. Parameters for calculation of vibrational entropy, atomic fluctuations, and deformation energies should be described in more detail.
