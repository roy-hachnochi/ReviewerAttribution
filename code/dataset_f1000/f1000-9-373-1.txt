This brief report is a survey of the current COVID-19 clinical research landscape. The number of clinical studies on COVID-19 is rapidly growing and it is important the investigation of whether these studies are incorporating features that are desirable for generating high-quality evidence. This survey performed this investigation and found that too many of the ongoing interventional studies have a small expected sample size. This might lead to delayed recognition of effective therapies and a waste of time and resources. This important evidence should guide the design of any future clinical study on COVID-19 and the decision of any funding body as well as the approval of any bioethics committee. For this reason, I consider this brief report important for the scientific community. There are a few minor suggestions for the authors: Table 1: The presentation of the studies' characteristics will be improved if they are presented separately for interventional and observational studies (particularly for the intervention type and expected study size). In this way, the table will provide more information about the studies' characteristics for each study type (interventional and observational). Table 1: It will be useful to report the type of randomization (such as blocking and block size).
