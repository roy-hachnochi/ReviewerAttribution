The authors perform bibliometric analysis of the COVID-19 literature at a relatively early stage of the pandemic. There are some interesting observations, but I have the following reservations: Basically, most research is expected to originate from areas where the case load is highest. Most of the bibliometric analysis was performed at a relatively early stage of the pandemic at which time the bulk of COVID-19 case load was in China. Africa, for example, had negligible case loads in February/ March 2020. In fact, COVID-19 spread to high-income countries in Europe first. This would explain why the majority of research was conducted in China and Europe rather than other regions. The author's point about less research from low-income countries is valid in general, but I would like to point out that this disparity is probably not well illustrated by this study. Such a conclusion can only be reached from bibliometric analysis of several year's data, which is not possible at this stage. A large volume of early work on COVID-19 was published in Chinese. Not including works in other languages has probably skewed the data. Also many many pre-prints, which are still not published due to heavy backlog of journals. Not sure what the value of including individual researcher's names is. The other author has pointed out another publication on a similar topic. Please address additional value provided by this study.
