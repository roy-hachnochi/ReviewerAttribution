Bernstein et al. provides two Jupyter notebook-based tools to facilitate re-analysis of human RNA-seq data deposited to SRA. The tools were built on top of annotated metadata of RNA-seq samples from the MetaRNA, and provided some visualizations of the summary statistics of the query results. I have the following suggestions and comments: The authors should indicate how to access the Jupyter notebooks in the abstract. It would require less overhead for users if the authors make their Jupyter notebook tools available to execute on Binder or Google Colab. Since MetaSRA mapped RNA-seq samples to biomedical ontologies, it would be useful to have the Jupyter tools also enable query using ontology terms in addition to free texts. For instance, a researcher may want to focus on samples from non-small cell lung carcinoma (DOID:3908) rather than any types of lung cancers. Currently, both notebooks load the metadata of the SRA samples from a preprocessed file in the Git repository. It would be useful to make it interoperable with MetaSRA through API to be able to query against the most updated version of SRA, which may include many more samples. As the volume of public RNA-seq data are drastically increasing. Please provide available options for the structured query, including "target_property" and "UNIT", in the "Series Finder" notebook. Please provide assessment of the precision and recall of the tools in terms of retrieving the correct samples given queries. Can the authors please comment on the applicability of the tools on bulk vs. single-cell samples? Please add discussion about how to perform secondary analysis on the SRA samples after obtaining the structured data from the Jupyter notebooks.
