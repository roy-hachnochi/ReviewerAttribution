Introduction: I don’t really understand what the rationale is for the current study? The authors do not build an appropriate case for pursuing this line of study. I would like to see some extensive review of previous literature. The authors also need to mention how would the current study contribute to the empirical body of knowledge. Methods: I would like to see a detailed explanation of how the test was administered. The authors mentioned it was presented using a laptop but I would like to see specific information on how long each of the stimuli appeared on the screen. How long were the participants allowed to wait before providing a response? Was there a penalty if the participants waited for an extended period of time before they provided a response? Discussion The authors make a case that words such as “gold coins” and “cupboard” were recalled by more number of participants. I wonder is it because the participants are exposed to these stimuli items more than the other items that were presented to them? I wish the authors had performed a familiarity rating on each of the stimuli items. Currently, it is unknown what played a role in better identification of specific words over others? This is a major confound of the current study,
