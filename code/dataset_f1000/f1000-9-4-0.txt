This is a prospective study to assess efficacy of dose dense carboplatin and gemcitabine regimen in HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients. Patient population is not clearly defined. Locally advanced is not clearly defined in eligibility. ER/PR status is not clearly mentioned. It is unclear from Table 1 if the patient population was triple negative since PR status is not mentioned. Also the time to metastatic disease from their adjuvant/neoadj chemo is not clear. Resistance to anthracycline/taxane is not defined. If TNBC, PD-L1 status is not mentioned. It is unfortunate that the trial was closed due to poor accrual. The likely reason of difficulty in accrual was the mandated prior anthracycline use in metastatic population where anthracycline is not routinely used as first line therapy. Given the very small sample size, we cannot draw any statistically significant conclusions and stats analysis is not applicable. The authors have correctly given descriptive results given n=5. Please consider submitting this as a brief report instead.
