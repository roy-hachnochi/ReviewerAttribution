This is a well-written article describing a large, well done SWAT. I only have a few comments, which are listed below. Study aims The authors might want to add a sentence (and possibly a reference) that explains in brief what a SWAT is. Methods Design – linked to the host trial ‘cohort multiple randomised controlled trial design’. This design is sometimes called a ‘Trials Within Cohort (TwiCs)' design. The authors might want to mention this name too, just in case readers are more familiar with it. User testing – the authors mention users were asked to locate and demonstrate understanding of 18 items of information within the participant information leaflet. I wasn’t sure what the 18 items were. Would it be possible to list them? Apologies if I have missed them within the article or extended data. Randomisation – could the authors give a little more information on how the randomisation sequence was generated? Discussion The authors mention that their results are consistent with previous research, which is my understanding of the literature too. Do the authors think further evaluation of this SWAT evaluation is required, and if so, could they give some pointers to what sorts of evaluations would add most value to the evidence base?
