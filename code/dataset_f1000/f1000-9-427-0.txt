This is a well-designed, large randomised trial investigating the use of iron supplementation or home fortification with multiple micronutrient powders, on cognitive development outcome in 8-month old children. The study is set in Bangaldesh and will be conducted over 3 sites. 3,300 children will be recruited and randomised to one of 3 arms, one of which is a placebo. The study is blinded, so that both family and assessor is unaware of group allocation. The study is designed to assess superiority. Secondary outcomes will assess motor and language ability on the Bayley scale as well as prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency, growth, and infection risks. The investigators plan to stratify the randomisation by union and sex, which seems sensible and I wonder if they should also consider weight for age as a stratifying factor. An area that may need clarification is around the superiority aspect of the trial, this is mentioned several times, although it is not clear whether the power calculation and planned analyses are considering this design feature. There is a possibility that a comparison will be made between the 2 treatments groups, groups 1 2, and the plan for this is described well. It is not so clear how these results will be interpreted, is the same effect size of 2 units on the Cognitive Bayley scale appropriate here?
