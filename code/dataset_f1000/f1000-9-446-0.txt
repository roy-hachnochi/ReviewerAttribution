The work is devoted to the actual problem of reflection of evoked potentials in the parameters of the process of evaluating visual scenes as causing positive, negative or neutral emotions in respondents. The analysis was carried out taking into account the representation of different genotypes in the study participants for the COMT, BDNF and HTR2A genes. Comments: Describe in detail the characteristics of the study sample (average age, gender distribution). It is desirable to describe the database of stimulus images (visual scenes) that was used in the work â€“ what types of visual images were used. The work is characterized by novelty, relevance and from a scientific point of view is quite interesting. I recommend indexing it.
