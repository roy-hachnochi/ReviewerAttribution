This is an interesting SWAT, which despite its small size is of interest. A few suggestions to improve the reporting: Have you registered the SWAT with the Northern Ireland Hub for Trials Methodology Research ( https://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/TheNorthernIrelandNetworkforTrialsMethodologyResearch/SWATSWARInformation/Repositories/SWATStore/ ) this will allow others to replicate the study as this is obviously required. The reporting of the means should also include the differences and 95% confidence intervals of the differences. You used block randomisation - what block sizes were used? With a tiny sample size, I think some qualitative outcomes, if collected, would enhance the findings of the study.
