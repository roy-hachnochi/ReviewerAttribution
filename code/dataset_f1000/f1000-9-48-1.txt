This is an important and timely systematic review of the efficacy and safety of microbiota transfer therapy (MTT) use for autism spectrum disorder in children. MTT is a current subject of interest and controversy among researchers and clinicians. Thorough and unbiased, this systematic review’s findings provide a very limited evidence base of one study; with early outcomes and a small sample size warranting cautious interpretation of the findings. Moreover, the authors note that MTT is still considered an experimental treatment with the FDA warning of unknown risk factors and specifying safety guidelines for donor recruitment and assessments of treatments. This paper would have benefited from a more detailed discussion and critique of the one study identified. In particular, clarification of the low bias stated in the study’s results required greater discussion. For example, an explanation of the ‘open label’ methodology, which does not include a blinded comparison group and has been demonstrated to result in a potentially high placebo effect seems to contradict the low risk of bias reported. A greater critique of the study would have strengthened and supported the authors concluding statements for the need for randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded control trial. Additionally, while the authors accurately state that causality and correlation of the intervention and outcomes cannot be assumed based on current evidence, a more detailed discussion of confounding factors in this study may have raised further evidence-based limitations. This procedurally detailed, well written systematic review appropriately concludes that more specific and controlled research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of MTT as an intervention modality for autistic children with moderate to severe gastrointestinal problems. Furthermore, it provides an opportune contribution to this subject matter.
