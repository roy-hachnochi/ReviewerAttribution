The authors have embarked on an important project. They will evaluate the issues related to translation of preclinical data into clinical practice. I have several comments. The authors should clearly state the narrow focus of their work, largely in the drug development arena. They seem to exclude other research areas such as devices and blood products. Please inform the reader what focus areas are included and excluded. The authors have included only several journals to review. Given the ability to use electronic databases, I would suggest they broaden their search. Lastly, the definition of clinical translation is not completion of phase 2 studies, but rather regulatory approval and adoption into clinical practice. Defining adoption itself is difficult, and should be discussed.
