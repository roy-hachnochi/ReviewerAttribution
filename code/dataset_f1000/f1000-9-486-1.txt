In this article the researchers conducted a meta analysis on the effects of essential oils on production parameters of small ruminants. This is a well written article. The objective and methods employed are suitable and clearly defined within the text. The authors could have included the experimental design in the selection criteria as well s the type of rations used in the various studies. The researchers could have broadened the criteria to include more studies in the Meta analysis. Less than 20 studies were included but the authors did discuss this and the need for further research in their discussion. The quality of the article is acceptable for indexing.
