This is an uncommon case presentation of two apparently unrelated hematopoietic malignancies. Association of Multiple myeloma following CLL or other low grade B cell lymphoma may be related to terminal changes of B cell to Plasma cells (Jaffe et al. , NIH) We had published a similar case in 2014 in a patient of CML with t9:22) along with JAK2 mutation and Myeloma (Maerki et al. , 2014 1 ). We suggested another potential theory of multiple simultaneous malignancies includes the sharing of a common malignant pluripotent progenitor stem cell which may allow further transformation of both lymphoid and myeloid differentiations. It has been proposed that plasma cell myeloma and CML may evolve from the same hematopoietic stem cell [1, 8, 12]. There have been multiple accounts in which plasma cell neoplasms, including plasma cell leukemia and multiple myeloma, have been seen in coexistence with or arising in the background of CML [37â€“39]. It is suggested that the simultaneous occurrence of CML and multiple myeloma is analogous to acute lymphoblastic leukemia arising in the blastic phase of CML [5, 6, 8, 12, 15]. This reveals the capability of CML in differentiating into either myeloid lineage or lymphoid lineage. Furthermore, the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) has been linked to increased cell survival, proliferation, and malignant transformation [1, 40] and has been found in all hematopoietic cell lineages including erythropoietic cells, megakaryocytes, macrophages, and B-lymphocytes [1,12, 41].
