The manuscript addressed interesting questions and came up with valuable findings. However, I think that the authors need to address a number of points mentioned below: Overall: In the introduction, they should mention the rationale of taking the 4 weeds from the same origin. They should justify why they used aqueous and 70% ethanolic media for extraction rather than using any non-polar medium. What difference did they expect from aqueous and 70% ethanolic media? Abstract: Although the authors described in methods and results they did not mention anything about In vitro antimicrobial activity, anti-diabetic activity, anti-arthritic activity, anti-lithiatic activity findings. Methods: Please mention the time and duration of the plant collection. In addition, the authors did not mention how they dried the filtrate after clarification by filtration. Collection of microbial strains - Check the last line West 'Bengal and India' where nd' to be deleted. In PPO test , no comparison shown between two types of extracts. Result: Why did the authors carried out HPLC-DAD analysis for only 70% ethanolic extracts, not for aqueous extract. Number of Figures in the study is too high. We suggest the authors combine Figures 8-11 under one heading In vitro antioxidant activity. Conclusions : Should be more precise and short. It should contain only their own findings not the findings of others which should be discussed under Discussion.
