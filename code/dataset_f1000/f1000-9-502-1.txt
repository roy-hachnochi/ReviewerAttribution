The paper is of interest under the current cov2 pandemic. Simulation of the strength of the bonds between molecules can identify inhibitors without human subjects' need to test. This paper did not focus on finding new compounds but in examining those present in existing medicine. This approach expedites the process of finding a cure, and the suggestions done are well-founded. Overall, the materials and methods section is exhaustive and asserts reproducibility. There are some wordy paragraphs with redundancies. Please take a look at the following one and the replacement that I suggest. Original The transmission of this coronavirus occurs due to the binding of the CoV spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on the cell surface of the human host. SuggestionThe transmission of this coronavirus occurs due to the binding of the CoV spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on the human host's cell surface. I might suggest the authors remark the differences between their approach and the one presented by: Suyash Pant, Peptide-like and small-molecule inhibitors against Covid-19 1 It could be included in the discussion.
