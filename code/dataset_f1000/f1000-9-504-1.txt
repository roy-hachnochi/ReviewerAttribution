The submission by Dr. Hameed et al. reviews results of a questionnaire completed by 130 physicians in Iraq, about neonatal bilirubin management. The authors are to be congratulated on this study, analysis, and report. Perhaps they would consider the following somewhat minor issues, all aimed at improving the clarity of the report. Title: Consider deleting the phrase “adherence level for”. It suggests that there are different levels. The title is clearer without that phrase. Abstract: It is not until the last line of the Abstract Conclusion that we read the guidelines of interest are those of the WHO, AAP, and NICE. Placing this near the beginning of the abstract would be helpful. Also, under Abstract Methods, consider changing …”physicians, who were divided into…” to, “physicians self-identified as either…”. Also, under Abstract Conclusions, delete “adherence levels”, because various levels of adherence was not part of the analysis. Introduction: Second line. Instead of, “…to hospital, it requires urgent”, consider, “to hospital, severe cases require…”. Last paragraph before Case Scenario, change “exports” to “experts”. Results: In Table 3, it is not clear what the “negative” and “positive” indicates. Thus, I can not understand what is being conveyed by this table.
