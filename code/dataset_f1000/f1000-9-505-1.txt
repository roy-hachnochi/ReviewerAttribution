Kevin Black’s case report highlights a possible hole in the current classification scheme for tic disorders. The author describes the clinical presentation of a 9-year-old boy who has a fairly typical history for mild Tourette syndrome, except that he has only one motor tic. Since he does not have an impairment or marked distress, he does not meet current diagnostic criteria for any DSM-5 tic disorder diagnosis. This interesting report is useful, as it hints at two possible solutions, not mutually exclusive. Firstly, it would be appropriate to consider relaxing the current criteria for the categories “Other Specified Tic Disorder” and “Unspecified Tic Disorder”, by reviewing the persisting criterion of “clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning”. Secondly, on a more general level, this case report calls into question the rationale for the distinction between motor and vocal/phonic tics. It is hoped that future classification systems will be increasingly more informed by advances in research that would allow them to “carve nature at its joints”.
