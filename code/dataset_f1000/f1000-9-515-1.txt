It is a very interesting and novel manuscript. HIV positive patients are often marginalised and a geagraphic information system would enable them to reach such a system. However, the references are not sufficient in number when such a subject is being examined. To my way of thinking, more sources have to be found out in order to support the novelty of a geagraphic information system.
