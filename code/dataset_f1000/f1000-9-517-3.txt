 The article outlines clear research questions and methods and provides a very useful summary of findings from a structured review of research capacity strengthening indicators for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Terminology is overall quite clearly defined. Some greater precision relate to the use of the terminology: context for indicator's application; knowledge transfer vs. knowledge translation are used. The definition of knowledge translation provided seems limiting and perhaps the authors meant only transfer. It would have been helpful to have some descriptive data on the sources of the publications/reports from which the indicators were derived (i.e. were they all published by academics vs. any from research funders). For example, it's unclear if any indicators developed by funders such as the International Development Research Centre and others that support LMIC research are included. The limitations section is clear. It would have been helpful to have the authors elaborate a bit more on the dearth of qualitative indicators, appreciating the fact that they would have 'scored poorly by default' because of the methodology used. Could the authors comment in the conclusion on areas for indicator development (like qualitative indicators; equity-related indicators - for e.g. I note that perception of equity in a specific partnership was part of the definition for collaboration and in the 'other' category, but to my knowledge, equity didn't really appear elsewhere)?
