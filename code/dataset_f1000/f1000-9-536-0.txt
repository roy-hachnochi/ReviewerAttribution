The manuscript described the process and successful experiences of forming an international research community, namely the international Wheat Information System (WheatIS) Expert working group. The focus of this article is on the higher level identifying the key factors to build a sustainable and successful community, such as establishing an urgent and shared vision, drawing in broad areas of deep and dedicated expertise, setting up an umbrella group with broad appeal and equal footing for partners, etc. Some technical aspects were also touched on such as keeping the data distributed and setting up a core with access to globally distributed nodes. Although technical issues are not the focus of the paper, here are a few comments regarding to wheatIS.org: On its official webpage, a few tabs on the wheatIS.org, such as "submit data" and "tools" are still under construction and not available for use. One of the aims of the EWG is to allow people to share their data. What is the procedures in place to check the quality of the data? How does the system prevent false info from getting into the system? Currently there is very limited funding available for this initiative. Most of the work is done on a volunteer basis. For the long term sustainability, the values created for end-user of the wheatis.org and impact it could make should be considered. A route for funding should be established through charity, governmental funding or industry to fund the initiative directly considering the full economic cost.
