This is a multicentre retrospective cross-sectional study on NAFLD (2012-17) with 215 patients undergoing liver histology (NASH-fibrosis). Group F0-F2 fibrosis and Group F3-F4 were compare by logistic regression analysis. T2DM, systemic arterial hypertension, cholesterol and triglycerides were the main predictor of advanced liver fibrosis The paper is well presented and simple in the take-home message. The authors conclude that T2DM, serum triglycerides and cholesterol were the main factors associated with advanced fibrosis stages and cirrhosis. A general point is to discuss the limited n. of patients with fibrosis (N=37) and how this number could affect the overall results of the study. This aspect is only briefly touched at the end of discussion. Also, can the authors provide any information about pre-T2DM, i.e. the presence of insulin resistance? Abstract: please better describe the terms “cholesterol” and “triglycerides” (serum chol, TG) Intro: the authors should also mention the recent consensus paper in gastro re-classifying the metabolic NAFLD Eslam M, Sanyal AJ, George J, International Consensus Panel. MAFLD: A Consensus-Driven Proposed Nomenclature for Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease 1 . When mentioning PNPLA3, please refer to a previous paper Krawczyk M, Portincasa P, Lammert F. PNPLA3-associated steatohepatitis: toward a gene-based classification of fatty liver disease 2 . Table 1: The table should bring the total number of enrolled patients at the top. I would suggest to simplify by mentioning at the bottom: data are mean (SD) Discussion: The study is only observational and not longitudinal (till 2017). Can the authors provide info about the follow-up of some of these patients with advanced fibrosis? I also would spend few words about the role of therapeutic agents (hypolipidemic drugs) on limiting the progression of NASH
