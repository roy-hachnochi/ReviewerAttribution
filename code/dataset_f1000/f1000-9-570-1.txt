This paper presents a proposal for a COVID-19 Dashboard to manage significant and relevant information in relation to the pandemic that is currently attacking the whole world. From a methodological point of view, the solution is developed with solidity and technologies adapted to the technological problem posed. The resulting product is tested with valid data even though it is not developed and analyzed in all countries in detail due to the extension of the work. It would be interesting if they could update and validate if the data obtained by the board match the real data and see if they could take into account second outbreaks of the disease. The solution is validated correctly.
