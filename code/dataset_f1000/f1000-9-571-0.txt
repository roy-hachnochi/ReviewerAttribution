The authors have conducted a safety study to measure the Carbon Dioxide concentration that could be inhaled by staff in the operating room during laparoscopic surgery. They chose three different locations, each of which have different ventilation and air volume turnover methodologies. They conducted serial assessments over time for multiple surgeries. They also conducted a brief experiment where they ran CO 2 freely into the operating room. They found that there is little variance between each of the operating locations or types of surgery. Importantly, all will well below the acceptable limits (level limit value of 5000 PPM). It was interesting, that even the range of CO 2 was relatively small, with the maximum amount being around 1100 PPM. When CO 2 is freely introduced into the air, the values were higher-approximating 2000 PPM, which was still well below the level limit value that is mandated in Europe. This paper adds to our literature of occupational safety. The use of different theatre locations (old and new) with different air volume turnover rates allows this knowledge to be transferred to other locations and hospitals. It is highly unlikely, even with old theatres, that laparoscopic surgery will produce high levels of carbon dioxide, sufficient to affect health care workers. The conclusion is consistent with the data, and supports that even an accidental user error, where carbon dioxide is freely running into the theatre, is still unlikely to cause a health issue for workers-this is very encouraging data.
