A conceptual framework for reopening our society during the Covid-19 pandemic is a well written insight for a new approach to systematically re-opening our society in the midst of the Covid-19 (CV19). Authors propose tools to rationally triage the risk to be compared across different scenarios. The risk should be builded based on two components: 1) the risk of an individual becoming infected due to action ‘X’; and 2) the likely probability of death (or serious harm) if that individual develops CV19. As this is a theorical approach and I considered correct and interesting.
