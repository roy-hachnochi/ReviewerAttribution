The study manuscript “ Potential chimeric peptides to block the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain ” by Barh et al. , focuses on chimeric peptides to potentially block the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain; the work is interesting and well designed and written. I have few minor comments and suggestions if they could be considered by the authors for improvement and clarification. As mentioned “SARS-CoV binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor through its Spike protein (S) to enter into the host cell 6 , and it is now reported that SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 to transmit its genetic material to human cells 7 – 9 ” In these lines the authors stated that SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2, I think the authors intended to write hACE2 (as stated earlier). The abbreviation is inconsistent in the whole manuscript. Please have a look. Comment: The authors stated that AVP are a better choice in catering viral infection, but as they are peptides, they are prone to be attacked by proteases. How to overcome this issue? Comment: Do these AVPs have a role in generating memory response? If the AVPs directly evoke innate immune response there is a possibility the PAMPs present on these can be recognized by PRRs which may lead to degradation. Comment: A study similar to Strategy 1 has been conducted by Ibrahim et al. ( 2020 1 ) to predict binding residues between RBD and hACE2. Does your study validate those findings? Are there any differences? Comment: Which tool or database was used to design AVPs in strategy 1? Comment: As the authors discussed the hemolytic potential of chimeric peptides, were peptides designed using Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 also fulfilling the criteria of therapeutic potential? Also, among the ten peptides mentioned in the conclusion which of them are best? Is it possible to give a brief comparison of these 10 peptides?
