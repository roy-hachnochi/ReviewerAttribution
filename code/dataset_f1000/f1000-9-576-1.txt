The overall article is well written and has properly compiled the report on "Potential chimeric peptides to block the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain" which is oriented on the present pandemic of COVID-19. The authors have screened and designed many peptides that can potentially block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and hACE2. Thus, the authors concluded that ten peptides (AC20, AC23, DBP6, and cnCoVP-1- cnCoVP-7) have a very high potential of interaction, indicating that these peptides could be attractive therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. The authors have used proper methodologies to conclude the report, so it can be accepted for indexing.
