The paper reports that fluoroquinolone based prophylaxis is most commonly used in transrectal prostate biopsies in Sweden and that extended prophylaxis is often used if the patient has risk factors for infective complications. The main message is that practice is consistent with Swedish guidelines which is of course evidence based. Although the study is well performed and the paper is well written, there are significant concerns. The paper does not address that transrectal biopsy is a severely contaminated procedure. All contaminated procedures should be replaced by clean procedures whenever possible. Prostate biopsy can now be performed via the transperineal route through disinfected skin in local anesthesia as an outpatient procedure. The paper does also not address the new regulations by EMA which states that fuoroquinolones should not be used for prophylaxis. Extended prophylaxis will reduce the rates of infective complications but violates the principles of antimicrobial stewardship. Finally, urology departments should have been asked about the local resistance rates to fluoroquinolones. Our clinical practice should always be based on established surgical principles of hygiene. If we do that we will also comply with the principles of antimicrobial stewardship. These principles outweigh evidence from studies comparing one antibiotic with another. Having said this, there is increasing evidence that transperineal targeted as well as systematic biopsies can be performed safely without antibiotic prophylaxis. Swedish guidelines as well as international guidelines on prostate biopsies need to be updated.
