Excellent study, but regarding a topic you mentioned in the research "The TFS test was present by Moore and Sek 2009 to discriminate harmonic complex tone from inharmonic tone. In this study we used TFS-LF test but later due to difficulty of TFS-LF in some listeners TFS-LF was modified to TFS-AF test 15 ." "due to difficulty of TFS-LF in some listeners".....what difficulties and will the TFS-AF test be applied to all participants? If both TFS-AF and TFS-LF tests will be applied, what will be the number of participants? How will this be decided? wish you good work.
