Thanks for the opportunity to review this brief report which provides interesting and novel data, well written and presented. Some limitations of interpretation of the data could be highlighted in a short paragraph in the discussion, such as: There is no group for comparison that represents the numbers (%) of those not trained who are involved in some way in the COVID response. Could responders represent a biased sample, by nature of actively participating in this evaluation? The total numbers of past trainees involved may not be as high as “seven-in-ten”. The extent and quality of contribution to the COVID response is not clearly defined Suggest in Introduction, the second sentence to delete “which” or “and”. Is this pandemic unprecedented in scale? Over 1.5 billion people infected (asymptomatic) with M.tb, around 10 million TB cases and 1.5 million TB-related deaths annually? What about the global death toll associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic?
