Comments on the revised manuscript: As this study was aimed at estimation of awareness level and vaccination coverage level, the power of the study may not be adequate to consider the additional analyses using multiple logistic regressions and reporting of odds ratios. Therefore, authors may consider the power calculation retrospectively and report the same if appropriate based on power calculation. The revised version also retained aim to describe awareness and coverage only. Authors may either change aim if the study has enough power to undertake associations and comparisons for identifying associated variables and risk factors by using multivariate analysis. Otherwise, the analytical component may be dropped from the results, if not appropriate and not enough power. In Table 3 and 4, it would be important to provide the actual numbers along with percentages so as to verify the findings by the readers. First chi square (Ï‡2) association may be reported for table 3 and 4, if significant, then odds ratios may be indicated if the study power is adequate for the same. High and low education has neither been defined in methods nor in foot note in table 3. It is also not clearly categorised in supplemental file associated with the manuscript. References 1.
