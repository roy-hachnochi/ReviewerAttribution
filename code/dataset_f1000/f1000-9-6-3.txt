The authors here conducted a set of survey data to reflect the public awareness on JEV in community. A great deal of data collection was presented. These contribute to show the significant progresses of the JE campaign in Yangon. However, there are several questions to be answered. Some Comments: The whole article was simple as a scientific research. More in-depth analysis of data is recommended. More comparison should be conducted to reflect the details in multi-aspects. For example, "parents/guardians had poor knowledge of JE" is sentenced. Since the details of the guardians were investigated, the correlation should be conducted, like with age? or occupations? or else? or none. Besides, are there any differences in awareness between urban and rural places?... To fully reflect the effect of public awareness in Yangon, authors should not choose nine townships randomly. Especially the locations are concentrated. The choices need to be more meaningful, like the widest vector distribution ones, the most severely suffered ones. OR, at least, the details of these nine townships should be presented, like incidence cases. The complex relationship between JEV and congeneric members, like DENV and ZIKV, is widely proposed. Since dengue is prevalent locally, the vaccination against Flavivirus members or infections should be also considered in the questionnaire. In table 1, (1) is single parent family excluded? (2) what does "Do not know family members suffered JE" exactly mean? do not know the symptoms or do not know the children's conditions? "23% did not know the symptoms of JE" is sentenced. So, how will these parents know their kids are not suffered from JE? Is the "0" morbidity presented by parents credible?
