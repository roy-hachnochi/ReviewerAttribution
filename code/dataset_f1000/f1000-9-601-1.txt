The manuscript by Justin Wagner et al . presents an infrastructure that integrates Metaviz, an interactive microbiome data analysis and visualization tool that was previously published by the same authors, with the iHMP Data Coordination Center web portal and the HMP2Data R/Bioconductor package. The authors give an overall overview of the infrastructure in addition to a couple of use cases. This is a nice and timely contribution that helps in using the large and complex set of available HMP data. The manuscript is already well structured, I have just few comments: Please check all the links reported in the text. For example, the link to the data repository and web portal (https://ihmpdcc.org) doesn't seem to work. How will the proposed infrastructure deal with likely updates (in terms of new data) of the HMP web portal? Which are the options available to save/export the results generated in the proposed infrastructure? Please comment more about this in the text.
