Kamran et al. presented a case report and literature review of gastric cancer with concurrent diagnosis of PA. My comments are below: Based on my assessment of this report, one could easily argue that this could be someone with history of GERD due to hiatal hernia leading to Barrett's esophagus leading to GE junction adenocarcinoma. The authors should focus on differential diagnosis of conditions leading to GE junction/gastric adenocarcinoma. Prior history of GERD? (Especially with barret esophagus findings, hiatal hernia), eating habits? Occupational and family history? All to be known in patients with gastric cancer to look for possible etiology for cancer diagnosis. Could it be a GE junction tumor, extending to stomach? What is sensitivity and specificity of the IF antibody assay? Why was FLOT chemotherapy used, why not upfront Sx for Stage 1b disease and adjuvant therapy based on surgical pathology? This should be explained in more detail. Figure 5 is good, I suggest to mention the timeline in weeks/days/months from presentation -- diagnosis -- treatment -- transition to hospice. Introduction, paragraph 3, the third sentence needs better structuring. The references need to be better formatted, especially 5, 13 and 19.
