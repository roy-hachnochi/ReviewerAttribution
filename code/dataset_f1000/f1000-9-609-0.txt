He et al. implemented a computational framework of drug repositioning to identify drug candidates for COVID-19 lung injury treatment. The authors first proved feasibility of drug repositioning pipeline in H1N1 infection data. They extracted genes that showed differential expression in ACE2 inhibitor-treated cell line and COVID-19 patients. The authors next screened drugs that could reverse expression of these differential genes, wherein COL-3 and CGP-60474 showed the most potent to treat lung injury in COVID-19. In the moexipril-treated HCC515 cell line, the effects of narciclasine and geldanamycin disappeared at 24 hours post treatment, which could significantly reverse the gene expression changes at six hours after treatment. Please provide more discussion on this. How many genes (key genes) were deregulated in the same direction in both ACE2 inhibition-treated HCC515 cell line and COVID-19 patient lung tissue? For referring drug candidates, did you use all the differentially expressed genes in COVID-19 lung tissues vs. normal lungs, or only part of differential genes? In Table 1, column "SARS-CoV-2 infection Human lung tissue", the P values of effective drugs are the same, please provide more details to explain.
