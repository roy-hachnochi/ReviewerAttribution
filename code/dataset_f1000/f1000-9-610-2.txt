Authors have done a commendable job in writing a detailed case report depicting Increased thrombogenicity and a low blood flow state in HIV a infected patient as primary mechanisms of the virchow triad causing biventricular thrombosis. The tables, figures provide great deal of detailed information regarding the location of thrombus. I would like to highlight certain important points and would encourage the inclusion of those in the case report The low flow state due to cardiomyopathy seems to have been a primary mechanism here causing biventricular thrombosis. If patient had a transesophageal echocardiography to exclude a patent foramen ovale which can result in paradoxical embolism or deep vein assessment with a venous doppler, inclusion of that information would be critical to exclude any possibility of venous thromboembolism Patient seems to have a decent CD4 count of 815 cells/microliter despite being non-compliant with Antiretroviral therapy. Inclusion of HIV viral load would give more information as there is evidence regarding high viral loads and low CD4 counts being related to increased thrombogenicity. In addition, presence of a reasonable CD4 cell count argues against the possibility of HIV associated nephropathy which can cause significant proteinuria causing loss of anticoagulant proteins causing a thrombogenic state. Information regarding protein: creatinine ratio would have evaluated that possibility. One would always make an argument of low protein C, protein S levels being low in the setting of acute thrombosis. Following them after a period of at least 6 months would reveal the true levels and differentiate between true deficiency vs due to consumption due to thrombosis.
