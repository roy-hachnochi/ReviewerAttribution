This work is entitled "Frequency and clinical significance of prostatic involvement in men with febrile urinary tract infection: a prospective observational study" and was written by Arjunlal et al. The authors studied chances of having acute bacterial prostatitis in male admitted with urinary tract infection. The manuscript was written appropriately and relevantly. However, I have a few major concerns for this work. First in the Results, though, 64 patients were enrolled and their baseline results were available, 14 of them were not followed up and were excluded after that. Consequently, the baseline results of these 14 patients should be excluded from this work (Table 3, Figure 3). The baseline results should come from 50 patients similar to the results in the next one and 3 months. Another concern is why they used hs-CRP in cases whose inflammation were obviously indicated. They should use CRP level. This point needs an explanation.My minor concern is the use of old references. If possible, they should be replaced by newer ones.
