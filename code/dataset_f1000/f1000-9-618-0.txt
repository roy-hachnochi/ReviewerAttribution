The paper present an model Automatic migraine classification using artificial neural. the article presents a topic of great investigative interest, it is easy to read and its common thread is easy to follow, it is also well structured. To continue with its indexing process, the following considerations are recommended: Improve image quality 2. What hyperparameters were taken into account for the SVM model? What was the value of the K neighbors that obtained the best results? To better understand the results, make a graph with the data from each model.
