I have carefully read and thoroughly considered your manuscript, "Automatic migraine classification using artificial neural networks". Our comments: This is a meaningful idea to study the migraine classification by artificial neural networks. There are several significant problems with the description of the study and interpretation of the results. First, the preface of the article is too wordy. We need not to describe the details of migraine as a reviews, including the epidemiology, diagnosis,differential diagnosis and treatment. In the preface, we should include the brief introduction of migraine and artificial neural networks,the current status of research on this subject, the problem in this field, why we do this study. Second, the methods of study should include the Inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. the reviews of classification progression of migraine should not included in this part,you can put it partial to the discussion. Third, the discussion is too simple, we advice to discuss the present methods that using in the migraine classification and where is our comparative advantage, potential mechanism of the artificial neural networks using in the migraine classification. By the way, you can points out the direction of future research.
