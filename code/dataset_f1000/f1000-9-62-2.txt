The authors have addressed several, but not all of the reviewers’ comments. The description of the state-of-the-art could be stronger. For example, the authors should discuss the status quo in machine learning for malaria drug-resistance detection, and the status/results of the DREAM Competition in particular, including the context of the data used. Some questions remain regarding the computation of averages in the ROC and precision-recall curves in Figures 4 and 5, see for example the bump in the latter (blue curve). The authors have not explained Figure 6, as reviewers asked them to do (labeling and legend fonts are too small). The authors also don’t explain how they do the testing (size of test set, evaluation scheme etc.) I am not sure about the usefulness of Figure 2 - Sensitivity and specificity are more intuitive measures than squared errors.
