I appreciate Cohen's and Marron's response to my review of this paper. The major issues that I raised have been addressed, in the least, by siting the appropriate literature. We still do not see eye to eye with regard to 'survival of the fitted' vs 'survival of the fittest', where I fail to recognize a substantial distinction. However, the authors are entitled to their position.
