Cohen and Marron offer a highly original concept of evolution, a subject fundamental to biology and philosophy. They begin by providing a clear and well-written description of neo-Darwinism, recent extended theories of evolution, which take into account epigenetics and microbiomes, and entropy. They then posit their main point- that the evolution of complexity is driven by cooperation, which is a mechanism to avoid entropic destruction. They argue that this cooperation is required at all biological levels, from molecules to ecosystems. For example, they point out the cooperation of individual strands of DNA to form double-stranded DNA helps avoid entropic destruction. Like most revolutionary ideas in science, the evolution of universal adaptations of life driven by the properties of matter: energy, entropy, and interactions, will be difficult for evolutionary biologists to accept. However, this article should be read and seriously considered by biologists. The authors end the article by suggesting some interesting experiments to test their concept of evolution.
