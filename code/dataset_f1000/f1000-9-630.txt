            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: &amp;nbsp; Modelling disease risk from e-cigarette use requires knowing how much e-cigarette uptake affects a smoker&rsquo;s cigarette consumption.&amp;nbsp; From Waves 1-3 of the US PATH study and other evidence, we sought answers to three questions: (Q1) Does consumption differ between dual users and exclusive smokers?&amp;nbsp; (Q2) Does initiating e-cigarettes affect cigarette consumption?&amp;nbsp; (Q3) Is baseline consumption related to later initiation of e-cigarettes? 
 Methods: &amp;nbsp; Consumption data from PATH were corrected for clear recording errors, with e-cigarette use classified as established or every day, and adjustment made for demographics, use of alcohol, drugs and other tobacco products, and age of starting smoking.&amp;nbsp; Searches identified other studies published since 2008, with Q1 answered from cross-sectional studies, and Q2 and Q3 also from prospective studies.&amp;nbsp; 
 Results: (Q1) In PATH, consumption in current every day e-cigarette users was 2-3 cigarettes per day lower in dual users, with no difference seen in established users.&amp;nbsp; From 31 published studies, consumption was no lower in dual users for current or ever e-cigarette users.&amp;nbsp; (Q2) In PATH study consistent decreases in consumption occurred in those becoming every day dual users with increases seen in those reverting to exclusive smoking.&amp;nbsp; Thirteen published studies consistently showed reduced consumption in those becoming dual users. &amp;nbsp;(Q3) Three studies consistently showed greater consumption in smokers subsequently initiating e-cigarettes, but no significant difference was seen for PATH.&amp;nbsp; 
 Con c lusions: &amp;nbsp; Assessment is complicated by the few every day e-cigarette users in PATH, and between-study variability in quantifying e-cigarette use and presentation of results. As taking up e-cigarettes is associated with reducing consumption, finding no clear cross-sectional difference between dual users and exclusive smokers suggests smokers taking up e-cigarettes had higher consumption initially, limited evidence supporting this.&amp;nbsp; Given the much lower disease risk of e-cigarettes vs. cigarettes, smokers becoming dual users should somewhat reduce their disease risk.">

  "description": "Background:  Modelling disease risk from e-cigarette use requires knowing how much e-cigarette uptake affects a smoker&rsquo;s cigarette consumption.  From Waves 1-3 of the US PATH study and other evidence, we sought answers to three questions: (Q1) Does consumption differ between dual users and exclusive smokers?  (Q2) Does initiating e-cigarettes affect cigarette consumption?  (Q3) Is baseline consumption related to later initiation of e-cigarettes?
Methods:  Consumption data from PATH were corrected for clear recording errors, with e-cigarette use classified as established or every day, and adjustment made for demographics, use of alcohol, drugs and other tobacco products, and age of starting smoking.  Searches identified other studies published since 2008, with Q1 answered from cross-sectional studies, and Q2 and Q3 also from prospective studies. 
Results: (Q1) In PATH, consumption in current every day e-cigarette users was 2-3 cigarettes per day lower in dual users, with no difference seen in established users.  From 31 published studies, consumption was no lower in dual users for current or ever e-cigarette users.  (Q2) In PATH study consistent decreases in consumption occurred in those becoming every day dual users with increases seen in those reverting to exclusive smoking.  Thirteen published studies consistently showed reduced consumption in those becoming dual users.  (Q3) Three studies consistently showed greater consumption in smokers subsequently initiating e-cigarettes, but no significant difference was seen for PATH. 
Conclusions:  Assessment is complicated by the few every day e-cigarette users in PATH, and between-study variability in quantifying e-cigarette use and presentation of results. As taking up e-cigarettes is associated with reducing consumption, finding no clear cross-sectional difference between dual users and exclusive smokers suggests smokers taking up e-cigarettes had higher consumption initially, limited evidence supporting this.  Given the much lower disease risk of e-cigarettes vs. cigarettes, smokers becoming dual users should somewhat reduce their disease risk."

As taking up e-cigarettes is associated with reducing consumption, finding no clear cross-sectional difference between dual users and exclusive smokers suggests smokers taking up e-cigarettes had higher consumption initially, limited evidence supporting this.&nbsp; Given the much lower disease risk of e-cigarettes vs. cigarettes, smokers becoming dual users should somewhat reduce their disease risk. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Smoking, E-cigarettes, Dual use, Cigarette consumption </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Peter N.

In many applications of one approach (<a href="#ref-42">Lee <i>et al.</i>, 2017</a>) it is assumed that adult dual users of cigarettes and RRTPs have a mean cigarette consumption (CC) per day that is half that of cigarette smokers who do not use RRTPs. A substantial reduction in CC in dual users is also assumed in another similar modelling exercise (<a href="#ref-58">Poland &amp; Teischinger, 2017</a>). However, other approaches (e.g. (<a href="#ref-5">Bachand <i>et al.</i>, 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-31">Hill &amp; Camacho, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-73">Vugrin <i>et al.</i>, 2015</a>)) have assumed that dual users and cigarette-only smokers have the same or a very similar CC. While conclusions regarding CC in dual users may depend on the specific type of RRTP, there is very little evidence available on very recently introduced types, such as heated tobacco products. However, as we demonstrate, a considerable number of papers have published evidence relating to e-cigarettes.</p><p class="" id=d2774e262>The objective of the work described here is to review and summarize evidence in adults comparing CC by dual users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes with CC by cigarette-only smokers. More specifically, this study attempts to answer three interrelated questions.</p><p class="" id=d2774e265>Q1. Does CC differ between dual users and exclusive smokers?</p><p class="" id=d2774e268>Q2. Does take-up of e-cigarettes change CC?</p><p class="" id=d2774e272>Q3. Does baseline CC differ by subsequent take-up of e-cigarettes?</p><p class="" id=d2774e275>Answers to Q1 may be obtained from cross-sectional studies carried out at one point in time, or from prospective studies at separate follow-ups. Answers to Q2 and Q3 will usually require information from prospective studies, though cross-sectional studies asking questions on the history of tobacco use might also provide relevant results.</p><p class="" id=d2774e278>We derive answers to the three questions from Waves 1, 2 and 3 of the publicly available adult data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study (<a href="#ref-33">Hyland <i>et al.</i>, 2017</a>), a longitudinal cohort study in the U.S. supported by Federal funds, some previous publications (<a href="#ref-10">Berry <i>et al.</i>, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-15">Buu <i>et al.</i>, 2018</a>) having only considered data from Waves 1 and 2. We also derive results from a detailed review of other published literature. We restrict attention to adults as they are most relevant to the estimation of the impact on mortality of RRTP introduction, and as the level of CC in cigarette smoking youths is less firmly established.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d2774e302>Methods</h2><div class=section><a name=d2774e305 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Analysis of adult data from waves 1, 2 and 3 of the PATH study</h3><p class="" id=d2774e310>To be included in the analyses, individuals had to satisfy four criteria:</p><p class="" id=d2774e313>1. Be aged 18 to 54 years at Wave 1 (as e-cigarette use proved to be very uncommon in those aged 55+ years).</p><p class="" id=d2774e316>2. Be current every day cigarette smokers at each Wave with data available on CC.</p><p class="" id=d2774e319>3. Have data available on current and former established e-cigarette use at each Wave.</p><p class="" id=d2774e323>4. Have data available at Wave 1 on nine variables considered as potential predictors of CC (referred to subsequently simply as “predictors” – sex (male, female), age range (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54 years), highest grade of schooling (less than High School, GED, High School graduate, some college (no degree) or associates degree, bachelor’s degree, advanced degree), Hispanic origin (yes, no), race (white alone, black alone, other), age range when first started smoking cigarettes every day (&lt;18, 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55+ years), ever used alcohol (yes, no) ever used cocaine or crack (yes, no), ever use of other tobacco products (yes, no) – based on separate variables for traditional cigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars, pipes, hookah, smokeless tobacco, snus and dissolvable tobacco.</p><p class="" id=d2774e326>In the PATH dataset, the data on CC were recorded by two variables, a number and a unit (cigarettes per day or packs per day), the intention being to derive daily consumption directly from the number variable if the unit was cigarettes per day and by multiplying the number by 20 if the unit was packs per day. However, for some individuals the consumption data recorded in this way was highly implausible. For example, one individual had a recorded CC of 15 packs per day at Wave 1, 10 cigarettes per day at Wave 2 and 15 cigarettes per day at Wave 3. Here the implied consumption of 300 cigarettes per day is highly implausible and it seems much more likely that the Wave 1 consumption was actually 15 cigarettes per day. Accordingly, as described more fully in <i>Extended data</i>, Additional File 1 (<a href="#ref-41">Lee, 2020</a>), a detailed investigation of the CC data at each Wave was carried out, and corrections were made for 84 individuals. There were 75 corrections relating to individuals where the consumption at one Wave was seven or more times the average consumption at the other two Waves. However, there were nine individuals where corrections were applied for other reasons, as described in the Additional File (see <i>Extended data</i>; <a href="#ref-41">Lee, 2020</a>). All the analyses reported are based on the corrected CC data.</p><p class="" id=d2774e341>Analyses were carried out relating to current and ever established e-cigarette use, based on data for a current established e-cigarette user (one who has ever used, has used fairly regularly, and uses every day or some days) and a former established e-cigarette user (one who has ever used, has used fairly regularly, and currently does not use at all), with ever users being those who were either current or former users. Analyses were also carried out relating to current every day e-cigarette use.

As previously, unless the abstract made clear that the study population was ineligible, the full paper was obtained, regardless of whether dual use or amount smoked were mentioned in the abstract.

For Q1, the data extracted (separately for current and ever e-cigarette use) included the numbers of dual users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and of exclusive cigarette smokers, the CC for each group and the difference, with its statistical significance, where possible. Where distributions were given by grouped amount smoked, the estimates of CC were derived using assumed midpoints. For studies where differences could be estimated, comparisons were made, again separately for current and ever e-cigarette use, of the number showing positive and negative differences, with unweighted means and standard errors estimated overall, and separately for US and European studies. For Q2, data were extracted for studies comparing changes in CC in those becoming or not becoming current e-cigarette users, with the number showing significant differences in each direction summarized. Data were also extracted for studies reporting changes in CC only in those becoming current dual users, with the numbers showing reductions or increases summarized. For Q3, evidence was summarised comparing CC in exclusive cigarette smokers according to whether they later used e-cigarettes, there being too few studies to allow more than a description of the results.</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d2774e477>Results</h2><div class=section><a name=d2774e480 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Results from the PATH study</h3><p class="" id=d2774e485>A total of 3,543 adults were eligible for the analysis. <a href="#T1">Table 1</a> summarizes the results relating to Q1.

Of the 46 studies, 22 were conducted in the US, five in multiple countries, three in the United Kingdom, three in Italy, two in France and one in each of 11 other countries. Of these, 16 studies involved an element of follow-up, the remaining 30 being of cross-sectional design, with three of these involving multiple cross-sectional studies. The studies mainly covered the whole adult population though some were restricted to younger adults. The number of smokers included varied considerably between studies with 10 involving more than 4,000 and seven less than 250. As will become evident, the studies varied in how e-cigarette use was defined and the questions they could answer. All the papers described the product as e-cigarettes, and it has been assumed that all the products contained nicotine, no study stating otherwise, though many did not give details.</p><a name=T4 class=n-a></a><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><div class=caption><h3>Table 4.

In the other studies, estimates of the difference in CC between dual users and exclusive e-cigarette use could be derived, with two being from study 38 at two different time points. The evidence was conflicting, with 11 estimates showing a lower CC in dual users and 18 a higher CC. Omitting the estimate from study 29 (<a href="#ref-56">Pearson <i>et al.</i>, 2015</a>) (as it only related to e-cigarette use as a cessation aid) and the earlier estimate from study 37 (<a href="#ref-28">Grana <i>et al.</i>, 2014</a>) to avoid double-counting, the unweighted mean difference was estimated as +0.03 cigarettes per day reduction (Standard error [SE] 0.36). While there was some evidence of a reduction in the 11 estimates from Europe (1.04) cigarettes per day reduction, standard error [SE] 0.72), the 14 estimates from the USA did not confirm this (0.56 increase, SE 0.29).</p><p class="" id=d2774e5944>The 14 studies providing estimates relating to ever e-cigarette use were equally inconsistent, with four of the ten estimated differences showing a reduction, and six an increase.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d2774e5948 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Results related to Q2</h3><p class="" id=d2774e5953>Our searches revealed 17 studies that presented evidence on whether cigarette-only smokers who become dual users change their CC. The top half of <a href="#T6">Table 6</a> summarizes results for five studies, all of prospective design, where dual use refers to current use and where changes are compared in those who remain exclusive cigarette smokers (“No No”) and those who become dual users (“No Yes”). All these studies present evidence that reductions in CC are significantly greater in dual users. The bottom half of <a href="#T6">Table 6</a> also presented evidence from a further eight studies (one prospective and seven cross-sectional), where changes were only recorded in those who became dual users. Of these, seven showed large reductions, which seem likely to be substantially greater than in those remaining exclusive cigarette smokers, although lack of the relevant data prevents this from being tested, while the other (study 41 (<a href="#ref-64">Seto <i>et al.</i>, 2016</a>)) showed a smaller reduction.

Study 22 (<a href="#ref-18">Choi &amp; Forster, 2014a</a>) reported that changes in CC were almost identical between those who had never used e-cigarettes and those who had used e-cigarettes for at least one day in the past 30 days at baseline, after adjustment for demographics and baseline CC. These results neither relate to a proper definition of current e-cigarette use, nor to taking up e-cigarettes between baseline and follow-up. Study 27 (<a href="#ref-67">Shi <i>et al.</i>, 2016</a>) concluded that “among early adopters, ever-use of first generation e-cigarettes to aid quitting cigarette smoking was not associated with improved cessation or with reduced CC, even among heavier smokers” but the basis for this conclusion is most unclear, with no formal statistical analysis described and it being unclear when the e-cigarette use occurred, and whether those who quit during follow-up were excluded. Study 37 (<a href="#ref-28">Grana <i>et al.</i>, 2014</a>) reported that “e-cigarette use at baseline was not associated with a change in cigarette consumption, controlled for baseline cigarette consumption”. In study 43 (<a href="#ref-77">Wu <i>et al.</i>, 2015</a>), no difference was seen between exclusive cigarette smokers and dual users at six months follow-up in individuals who continued to smoke. These analyses related to ever rather than current use of e-cigarettes.</p><p class="" id=d2774e6430>It can also be noted that, as studies restricted to dual users were excluded (see <i>Literature searches</i>, rejection reason 7), the results shown in the bottom half of <a href="#T6">Table 6</a> may not be comprehensive.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d2774e6441 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Results related to Q3</h3><p class="" id=d2774e6446>Our searches revealed only three published studies that presented evidence relevant to whether CC in exclusive cigarette smokers differed according to whether they later used e-cigarettes. Study 5 (<a href="#ref-3">Andler <i>et al.</i>, 2016</a>), a cross-sectional study which involved 4,752 current smokers of whom 759 also currently used e-cigarettes, noted that, before they started to vape, these individuals smoked 21 cigarettes per day as compared to 11.3 in those who continued to smoke. Though the results presented did not allow precise estimation of the difference in CC between smokers according to whether they later used e-cigarettes, the results clearly suggested that heavier smokers were more likely to start vaping. Study 35 (<a href="#ref-22">English <i>et al.</i>, 2018</a>), a cross-sectional study involving 245 current smokers, of whom 103 also currently used e-cigarettes, reported that, for each additional cigarette smoked per day prior to using e-cigarettes, individuals were 4.0% (p = 0.001) more likely to use e-cigarettes. Study 45 (<a href="#ref-16">Chan <i>et al.</i>, 2019</a>), a prospective study, presented results from a logistic regression predicting uptake of vaping in 3,797 smokers. After adjustment for a range of smoking-related and demographic variables, they reported an increasing likelihood of uptake with increasing cigarette consumption, with ORs of 1.13 (95% 0.95-1.35), 1.41 (1.12-1.78) and 1.69 (1.19-2.39) for smokers of 11-20, 21-30 and 31+ cigarettes per day, as compared to 0-10 cigarettes per day.</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d2774e6472>Discussion</h2><p class="" id=d2774e6475>Based on the analyses of the PATH study, there was no evidence from the analysis of Q1 (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>) that cigarette smokers who were also current or ever established e-cigarette users had a lower CC than exclusive cigarette smokers. However, cigarette smokers who were also current every day e-cigarette users did have a lower CC by about two to three cigarettes per day. This is consistent with CC in dual users being more likely to be affected in adults who use e-cigarettes more often, occasional e-cigarette use being less likely to affect cigarette smoking habits. These results, based on cross-sectional analysis, are less relevant to the effect that e-cigarette use might have on CC than those based on changes over time (Q2). Here again the results for every day e-cigarette use (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>) showed more evidence of an effect, with those becoming dual users consistently decreasing CC and those switching from dual use to exclusive smoking consistently increasing their CC, although only the second result was statistically significant. It is possible that those who decided to take up e-cigarettes might have had a different baseline CC than those who continued to smoke cigarettes exclusively (Q3), but our analyses (<a href="#T3">Table 3</a>) showed no evidence of this.</p><p class="" id=d2774e6487>Two limitations of our analyses should be noted. One is the small number of cigarette smokers who were also current every day e-cigarette users, ranging from about 50 to 70 in the relevant analyses. The other is the weakness of the CC data itself. While we have made our best attempt to correct obvious errors in the data, some doubts must remain about the validity of our correction.</p><p class="" id=d2774e6490>Two previous publications (<a href="#ref-10">Berry <i>et al.</i>, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-15">Buu <i>et al.</i>, 2018</a>) have presented results from the PATH study using data from Waves 1 and 2, neither making any mention of correcting the clearly erroneous CC data. <a href="#ref-15">Buu <i>et al.</i> (2018)</a> restricted attention to those who, at Wave 1, had in the past 12 months smoked cigarettes and not used e-cigarettes, and who at Waves 1 and 2 had not used tobacco products other than cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Comparisons were made between those who had or had not used e-cigarettes some day or every day in the past 30 days. The authors reported that a higher frequency of e-cigarette use was associated with a lower CC after controlling for baseline CC and other confounding variables. This finding, though based on different statistical procedures, seems consistent with our finding for Q2.</p><p class="" id=d2774e6511>Based on current cigarette smokers aged 25+ years who were not current e-cigarette users at Wave 1, <a href="#ref-10">Berry <i>et al.</i> (2019)</a> presented odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for 12 potential confounding variables, relating at least a 50% reduction in CC between Waves 1 and 2 to new e-cigarette use at Wave 2. While no material difference was noted for experimental e-cigarette use (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.48) or for some day e-cigarette use (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.74), a highly significant (p&lt;0.001) effect was noted for every day e-cigarette use (OR 5.70, 95% CI 3.47 to 9.35). Their analyses defined current smokers as smoking every day or some days, whereas ours restricted attention to every day smokers. Nevertheless, though differently expressed, their analyses support our findings for Q2, with those switching to every day e-cigarette use reducing their cigarette consumption.</p><p class="" id=d2774e6521>As regards Q1, the other published studies identified by the literature search (see <a href="#T5">Table 5</a>) provide no clear evidence of a relationship of current or ever e-cigarette use to CC. The lack of consistent association seen in the literature aligns with the findings from the PATH study shown in <a href="#T1">Table 1</a> for current and ever established e-cigarette use, but not with the results for current every day use. A problem is that very few of the reviewed studies provided results for current regular e-cigarette use, which may be considered comparable to the results for every day e-cigarette use from the PATH study. Also many of the studies only presented results for grouped cigarette consumption, making it difficult to accurately quantify CC.</p><p class="" id=d2774e6530>The results from the other published studies regarding Q2 shown in <a href="#T6">Table 6</a> clearly demonstrate that becoming a current e-cigarette user is associated with a reduction in CC. While this conclusion is consistent with that from the PATH study, the actual decrease in CC associated with uptake of e-cigarettes cannot be directly compared, as few of the 13 studies actually presented estimates of the mean reduction, with others simply giving the numbers reducing (or increasing) consumption, or presenting odds ratios for the probability of reducing cigarette consumption by 50% or more, and only five allowing the reduction to be tested against a suitable control group of continuing exclusive smokers.</p><p class="" id=d2774e6536>As noted above, only three of the other published studies provided evidence relating to Q3. While these results are all consistent with those who choose to start using e-cigarettes being heavier smokers than those who do not choose to do so, our analyses of the PATH study data found no clear relationship. Given the limited number of studies, more evidence is clearly needed to answer Q3.</p><p class="" id=d2774e6539>Assessment of the overall evidence is unclear, partly due to the between-study differences in how e-cigarette use is quantified, and how the results are presented. Given the quite clear evidence from the analyses addressing Q2 that those taking up e-cigarettes and becoming dual users do reduce their CC, the failure to find any very clear difference in CC between current dual users and exclusive cigarette smokers from the analyses of Q1 would suggest that smokers who subsequently take up e-cigarettes had somewhat higher CC to start with. While the analyses at Q3 are rather limited they do tend to support this view.</p><p class="" id=d2774e6542>Although the overall evidence is somewhat difficult to interpret, it appears that exclusive cigarette smokers who become dual users tend to decrease their CC, especially if they use e-cigarettes regularly. The level of reduction in CC is generally fairly modest, and seemingly inconsistent with the assumption that those becoming dual users replace half their cigarettes with e-cigarettes. However, given the much lower claimed disease risks of e-cigarettes relative to cigarettes (<a href="#ref-51">Nutt <i>et al.</i>, 2014</a>), it seems quite possible that smokers who become dual users will reduce their disease risk to some extent.</p><p class="" id=d2774e6551>Overall, it can be concluded that there is clear evidence that exclusive cigarette smokers who become dual users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes reduce their daily CC. The reduction seen is quite modest in most studies (e.g. two or three cigarettes per day), though some studies show greater reductions. The fact that cross-sectional analyses show little difference in CC between dual users and exclusive cigarette smokers may be due to those who take up e-cigarettes tending to be somewhat heavier cigarette smokers to start with, though more evidence is needed to confirm this. Obtaining accurate overall estimates is made difficult by the different way that studies present their results.
