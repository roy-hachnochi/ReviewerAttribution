This is a well designed study that evaluated the effect of sodium hypochlorite as an irrigant solution and gel over one Gram-positive bacterium and another Gram-negative one, as well over their endotoxins with and without passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI). This study may be the first study that evaluated the effect of sodium hypochlorite gel over the endotoxins of endodontic pathogens and this has a great clinical relevance. The introduction: It presented briefly the current literature and a historic background about the use of sodium hypochlorite. As a suggestion for the researchers in their future projects, I think that it is more appropriate to test another Gram-negative bacterium than e.coli. Even e.coli was found in the root canal system, however, I think that there are a variety of microorganisms that may be tested and have more relevance in the literature as example: Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) as in the study of Wang et al (2019) 1 and others in the study of Lukic et al (2020) 2 . The methods: The study design was carefully planned, I think that the study in its current version is accepted to be indexed, all the cited articles in the methodology section have more details about the execution of this study. I am just wondering why the researchers did not use the sodium hypochlorite in the same concentration in both solution and gel forms? It is not a big deal here as the concentration is almost the same (2.5 and 3 %), however, I think this should be explained in the discussion section, or at least mentioning a previous study that used different concentrations. The discussion: Why did the authors not take advantage of the positive results obtained from using PUI in this study to be discussed furtherly in the discussion section or even in the introduction section? I think another paragraph will improve the discussion section. The conclusions of this paper drawn adequately supported by the results.
