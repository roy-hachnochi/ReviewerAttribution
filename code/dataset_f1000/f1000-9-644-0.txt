This paper presents a protocol for a living systematic review on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on self-harm and suicidal behaviour. This is an important and timely review. Suicidal and self-harm behaviours have increased during previous epidemics and pandemics and there are good theoretical reasons to believe that a similar patter will occur during the COVID-19 pandemic. The review aims to rapidly provide real-time evidence of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on suicide deaths, suicidal behaviours, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts, and to assess the effectiveness of strategies that aim to reduce these. The review is a mixed-method in design and will include both quantitative and qualitative (except single case studies in either method). The protocol is well described and presented in line with PRISMA guidelines. PsychInfo is not included as one of the listed search engines, which appears to be an omission. The link to medRxiv is broken. Factors for the authors to consider are as follows. How the authors will assess bias in quantitative research is clearly described. However, it is unclear how the authors will review the quality of qualitative studies. It is also unclear how the qualitative data will be synthesised with the quantitative data and inform the review of effectiveness study. The living systematic-review design lends itself to a greater integration of both quantitative and qualitative data as they are published. The transition of the review to a static state and the dissemination strategy is well described.
