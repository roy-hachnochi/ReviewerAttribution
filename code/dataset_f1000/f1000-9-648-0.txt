 In the present paper Sformo and Raymond present data on an ice binding and recrystallisation inhibiting protein from the Alaskan grass Leymus mollis, which lives in areas where it is exposed to several kinds of stresses including low temperatures. The authors have observed ice structuring, recrystallisation inhibition activity in aqueous homogenates of the rhizome tissue. They have sequenced DNA from similar homogenates using primers based upon the conserved sequences from other IBP containing grasses. The obtained DNA sequences were translated into the amino acid sequences presumably involved in the ice recrystallisation inhibition and ice structuring. The amino acid sequence of the IRI domain of L. mollis was closely matched to the Triticum aestivum IRI domain. The 3D structure of the ice binding domain was predicted using the obtained sequence and the structure of the IRI domain in Lolium perenne . It appears that the tree dimensional structure of the ice binding domain of L. mollis IBP quite resembles that of L. perenne . The paper is an interesting comparative account of the ice related properties of a grass found at high latitudes - again indicating that ice structuring and recrystallisation inhibition is very important in plants adapted to cold climates. I miss an extension of the discussion of the comparative aspects of cold tolerance and adaptive aspects of the findings in the paper. Figure 1 could be explained a bit better as some readers may not understand the differences between the A and the B panel very well. Figure 2 is not very clear and also this figure would benefit from a bit more explanation in the text.
