The manuscript by Mitra et al lays out a very interesting case for a connection between a novel bacterial strain ( Acidovorax sp.) that was isolated from a contaminated TAP medium plate of Chlamydomonas and that can utilize common environmental pollutants as a carbon source. I also agree that the identification and characterization of Acidovorax sp., is absolutely required to reduce prevalence and prevent the further spread of contamination on TAP medium. The work is well performed and easy to follow. I think that this adds to the body of knowledge and recommend for acceptance with minor comments addressed below: Please see below for individual points: Figure 2 could be eliminated or improve the quality of the figure. I suggest changing the figure 8 for a graphic or table. In page. 17, first line change LMG for LMJ.
