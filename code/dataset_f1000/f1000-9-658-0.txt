The concept of the benefits of high altitude and the Ultra-Violet sterilizing effects were mentioned in an article on Longevity at high altitude in 2017 https://zuniv.net/pub/Longevity.pdf 2 . At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemia, several interviews, website publications and articles on the subject were published.
