The authors present the quality management system they have implemented in their lab and lay out specifics and improvements to their previous processes. The reader would benefit from more elaboration of the motivation that initiated the change, a better structure in before/after comparisons, and a primer in quantifying compliance and satisfaction of the users. Specific points: “ However, it is shown, that a lack of quality management and transparency are two reasons for the ongoing reproducibility crisis 2 – 4 . “ While I fully agree with this statement, I think the reader would benefit from some elaboration on this topic: why and how do QS and in particularly organised documentation, increase reproducibility? eLabFTW: it would be interesting to lead the reader through your decision process, as I assume other labs will consider similar options as you did. Why did you choose this one over the others? The central element of this manuscript – the reporting on some bits on the motivation of the researchers to finally approach this step would be interesting, which could also allow for a better before/after comparison. Which processes have improved by the introduction of the new system, where do the users experience early benefit, where are the users rather reluctant? I appreciate that some information on the before is given in the results section, but think that a separate, earlier header on “before” would improve the structure. Similarly, the reporting of enthusiasm within the group is relatively vague – maybe you could even add a small anonymous survey within the group which bits are most and least liked. This can quantify the impact of the system at least a bit. Minor point: I am always at risk of doing this myself, but I would recommend refraining from using terms like “significant influence” as the word “significance” is so strongly tied to p-values in research papers.
