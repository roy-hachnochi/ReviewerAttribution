The manuscript entitled “ In silico screening of known small molecules to bind ACE2 specific RBD on Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 for repurposing against COVID-19” addresses the repurposability of known drugs against COVID-19. Spike glycoprotein is the most popular drug target for SARS-CoV-2 having a significant role in host entry. With this basic understanding, the manuscript is reviewed and the observations are listed below. Abstract: Conclusion: The statement “Hence, the molecules screened for inhibitory properties against SARS-CoV-2-S can be clinically used to treat COVID-19 since the safety profile is already known.” can be rewritten as “The GA of plant origin shown superior interaction with SARS-CoV-2-S compared to rest other molecules, hence, GA can be clinically investigated to confirm its efficacy to treat COVID-19.” Methods: Homology modelling of SARS-CoV-2-S protein The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-S and ACE2 complex (PDB ID: 6ACD) is used as a template for homology modelling. It is expected to discuss the identity, query coverage between the query and template. Discuss the criteria for template selection. In the figure legend for Figures 8c, 9c, 10c, 11c, and 12c glycyrrhizic acid can be replaced by GA. The manuscript can be accepted for indexing with above-mentioned changes.
