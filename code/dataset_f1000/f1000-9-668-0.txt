The authors presented an interesting case of chilblains-like lesions in a 48-year-old woman. The case report is well-organized and written in a clear fashion. Furthermore, it includes dermoscopic and confocal findings of chilblains-like lesions. However, I have several comments and suggestions: the abstract could be longer and should include more details regarding the presented case and findings if available, please include lab findings (antinuclear antibodies? serology for Mycoplasma/Chlamydia infection? C-reactive protein?) I'm not a big supporter of the acronym introduced by the authors just to separate the name of the dermatological lesions from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The dermoscopic and confocal findings presented by the authors may be of some value for future diagnostic process of COVID-19-related lesions, but it should be taken into consideration that the infection was not confirmed in the presented patient and the authors only hypothesize that there may be a delayed immune-mediated reaction. Undoubtedly, further studies, comparing the dermoscopic and confocal features of COVID-19 toes and chilblains-like lesions resulting from other conditions are needed.
