This is a report of a case of chilblains-like lesions on a COVID-19+ patient. Even if the case could be potentially interesting (several cases have been already reported in the literature) and it has been well presented, the use of confocal microscopy in this specific case does not add any new information with no distinctive features. Few points: Dermal features (important for diagnosis) cannot be seen on confocal microscopy. Why the authors underline the absence of pagetoid cells in a non suspected melanocytic lesion? How the authors define activated Langerhans cells based on confocal microscopy observation alone? In my view, this case report does not merit to be considered for indexing as it is presented.
