            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: Complex health and social care interventions impact on a multitude of outcomes. One such intervention is the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) programme, which was introduced to support young, first-time mothers. Our study quantified the relative values that the general public place on the outcomes of FNP, as they were identified and measured in the relevant randomized trial, Building Blocks trial (BBs). 
 Methods: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was employed. Respondents chose between two scenarios describing hypothetical sets of trial outcomes. BBs compared FNP care for teenagers expecting their first child with standard NHS care. 14 attributes covered three areas: pregnancy and birth, child development and maternal life course. Due to large number of attributes, a &ldquo;blocked attributes&rdquo; approach was adopted: the attributes were split across four designs which contained two common attributes. Data were analysed separately for each design as well as pooled across four designs. Random effects probit model was employed for the analysis. 
 Results: Over 1000 participants completed four designs. The analyses on the separate designs and those on pooled data yielded broadly similar results. Respondents valued higher the outcomes related to child development and their needs, followed by the outcomes related to maternal life course. Preferences varied by the age of the respondents but not by their guardianship/parentship status.&amp;nbsp; 
 Conclusions: Individual preferences were consistent with a priori expectations and were intuitive.&amp;nbsp; The DCE results can be used to incorporate the general public preferences into the decision making process for which public health and social care policies should be adopted.">

  "description": "Background: Complex health and social care interventions impact on a multitude of outcomes. One such intervention is the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) programme, which was introduced to support young, first-time mothers. Our study quantified the relative values that the general public place on the outcomes of FNP, as they were identified and measured in the relevant randomized trial, Building Blocks trial (BBs).
Methods: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was employed. Respondents chose between two scenarios describing hypothetical sets of trial outcomes. BBs compared FNP care for teenagers expecting their first child with standard NHS care. 14 attributes covered three areas: pregnancy and birth, child development and maternal life course. Due to large number of attributes, a &ldquo;blocked attributes&rdquo; approach was adopted: the attributes were split across four designs which contained two common attributes. Data were analysed separately for each design as well as pooled across four designs. Random effects probit model was employed for the analysis.
Results: Over 1000 participants completed four designs. The analyses on the separate designs and those on pooled data yielded broadly similar results. Respondents valued higher the outcomes related to child development and their needs, followed by the outcomes related to maternal life course. Preferences varied by the age of the respondents but not by their guardianship/parentship status. 
Conclusions: Individual preferences were consistent with a priori expectations and were intuitive.  The DCE results can be used to incorporate the general public preferences into the decision making process for which public health and social care policies should be adopted."

One such intervention is the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) programme, which was introduced to support young, first-time mothers. Our study quantified the relative values that the general public place on the outcomes of FNP, as they were identified and measured in the relevant randomized trial, Building Blocks trial (BBs).<br/> <b>Methods:</b> A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was employed. Respondents chose between two scenarios describing hypothetical sets of trial outcomes. BBs compared FNP care for teenagers expecting their first child with standard NHS care. 14 attributes covered three areas: pregnancy and birth, child development and maternal life course. Due to large number of attributes, a “blocked attributes” approach was adopted: the attributes were split across four designs which contained two common attributes. Data were analysed separately for each design as well as pooled across four designs. Random effects probit model was employed for the analysis.<br/> <b>Results:</b> Over 1000 participants completed four designs. The analyses on the separate designs and those on pooled data yielded broadly similar results. Respondents valued higher the outcomes related to child development and their needs, followed by the outcomes related to maternal life course. Preferences varied by the age of the respondents but not by their guardianship/parentship status.&nbsp;<br/> <b>Conclusions:</b> Individual preferences were consistent with <i>a priori </i>expectations and were intuitive.&nbsp; The DCE results can be used to incorporate the general public preferences into the decision making process for which public health and social care policies should be adopted. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Family Nurse Partnership, Building Blocks trial, maternal and child outcomes, discrete choice experiment, random effects probit </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Eugena Stamuli (<a href="mailto:eugena.stamuli@york.ac.uk">eugena.stamuli@york.ac.uk</a>) </div> </div> <div class="margin-top margin-bottom float-left"> <button id=close-popup-window class=general-white-orange-button>Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-corresponding-author> <b>Corresponding author:</b> Eugena Stamuli </span> <div class=clearfix></div> </span> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom competing-interests-display"> <span class=competing-interests-title>Competing interests:</span> No competing interests were disclosed. </span> <div class="info-separation padding-bottom grant-information-display"> <span class=grant-information-title>Grant information:</span> This is an original and independent piece of research commissioned and funded by the Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health (reference 006/0060).

The spectrum of possible disadvantage includes poorer birth and developmental outcomes for children<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>–<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup> to reduced life chances in terms of education and employment opportunities for younger mothers<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d6796e314>The Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) is an intervention designed to improve outcomes for young mothers and their children by supporting families on issues related to health during pregnancy and parenting skills, and on life skills including how to become self-sufficient. The programme has been supported by the Department of Health in many sites in England since 2006<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> and was evaluated via a randomized controlled trial<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The Building Blocks (BBs) trial evaluated four primary outcomes which were birth weight, tobacco use in pregnancy, emergency attendances (A&amp;E) and/or admissions of children within two years of their birth, and the occurrence of subsequent pregnancy within two years of first birth. There was also a range of secondary outcomes, both health and non-health related, which are fully described in the trial protocol<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> and report<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The medium-term impact of the intervention is being evaluated through routine data linkage study<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d6796e340>The level of success of this intervention, as measured by the outcomes of this trial and the economic evaluation, helps inform commissioners’ decisions on the future of the programme. The nature of the outcomes (health and non-health related), as well as the subject of interest (mother or child related outcomes), add new dimensions to the economic evaluation of such a trial. A cost-utility analysis will present, for example, the cost per mother’s Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) but will fail to include the other outcomes<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. A cost-consequences analysis approach reflects the fact that a complex intervention is associated with an array of health and non-health benefits that cannot be measured in a common unit<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Given the disparate nature of relevant outcomes, and the fact that outcomes moved in different directions, it was deemed necessary to establish some relative value (or trade-off) between these outcomes. In addition, given that the public involvement in health-care decision making is an objective of the health care policy makers in the UK<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>, it is important to elicit the preferences of the general public over the different outcomes of the trial, i.e. how the general public weighs up these outcomes. The findings of the randomized trial together with the valuation of the outcomes, as measured in this exercise, provides decision makers with useful knowledge that may inform the judgment about whether the intervention should be adopted or extended on a larger scale.</p><p class="" id=d6796e358>The aim of this study was to quantify the relative values that the general public place on outcomes/domains examined in the BBs trial using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The DCE approach is a well-established method to explore preferences in health services research<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. The approach is based on asking respondents to state their preferred option between two or more hypothetical scenarios which describe a service or a set of outcomes. The hypothetical scenarios include the descriptors (or attributes) the levels of which can be altered in each choice task. With a sufficient number of scenarios and respondents, it is possible to model the impact of specific descriptors on the choice of the respondents. As the individual considers simultaneously a number of attributes, DCEs are thought to overcome some of the problems that other choice methods, such as ranking, rating or standard gamble, pose<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d6796e378>Methods</h2><p class="" id=d6796e381>The DCE was designed as a web based survey, following the general guidelines and steps for conducting a DCE<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>.</p><div class=section><a name=d6796e394 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Selection of outcomes and experimental design</h3><p class="" id=d6796e399>The selection of the DCE attributes and levels drew on the outcomes that were measured in the BBs trial. The trial focused on three areas of research: pregnancy and birth, child health and development, maternal life course and self-efficacy. There were four primary outcomes: tobacco use at late pregnancy (34–36 weeks’ gestation), birth weight, emergency attendances and hospital admissions for the infant within 24 months of birth, and the proportion of women with a second pregnancy within 24 months post-partum. In addition, a large number of secondary outcomes (over 60) were measured across the three aforementioned domains. All four primary outcomes and ten secondary outcomes were included as DCE attributes. The secondary outcomes were selected via a voting process by the team that designed the study protocol of the randomised trial, based on what they perceived as most important efficacy measures.</p><p class="" id=d6796e402>All the attributes, with the exception of mother’s health, had two levels (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>) describing whether one outcome was positive or negative. This binary format was chosen with the aim to keep the task simple and manageable for the respondents. Mother’s health was described as a four-level attribute, corresponding to the following 3-level EQ-5D health states: 11111, 11112, 11211 and 11212. The focus was only on two of the five domains of the EQ-5D questionnaire<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>: usual activities and anxiety &amp; depression, as these were considered most likely to be affected in this group of an otherwise healthy population. Further, the attribute was transformed into a continuous variable<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup> by applying the relevant utility scores i.e. 1, 0.848, 0.883 and 0.812 respectively, based on the UK tariff<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>.</p><a name=T1 class=n-a></a><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><div class=caption><h3>Table 1.

The method allows for a large number of attributes to be allocated across more than one design with overlap: some attributes are treated as “common attributes” and appear in all the designs, while the non-common attributes will appear in separately in each design. The fundamental assumption is that the respondents will have the same preferences over the whole set of attributes if they are presented together compared with if they are presented in blocks<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. The analysis is based on the “pooled” data from all the designs.

id=d6796e3124>The results of the model on the pooled data, without including the design dummies are discussed here. Given the coding of the binary attributes (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>), the negative signs of the coefficients would suggest that respondents’ utility decreases as the level of the attribute increases, or becomes a negative outcome (0= positive outcome, 1=negative outcome). Positive signs would indicate the contrary i.e. respondents derive higher utility as the level of the attribute decreases (i.e. becomes a “positive outcome”). All the regression coefficients have the expected signs and are statistically significant, indicating that the respondents prefer a programme that would improve the outcomes described in this exercise. The results are in line with the <i>a priori</i> expectation that positive outcomes related to vulnerable, pregnant women and their children are preferable to negative outcomes.</p><p class="" id=d6796e3133>The highest ranked coefficients for the separate designs are the five top highly ranked attributes in pooled data model, showing a consistency of results across models. The relative ranking of the two common attributes (second pregnancy and A&amp;E attendances) is the same in all the models: A&amp;E has a larger coefficient than occurrence of second pregnancy, showing that it is always considered a more important outcome than the occurrence of second pregnancy. In the pooled model, the largest coefficients are mainly related to outcomes that affect children directly: whether the mother fulfils the child’s needs, whether there is a bond between mother and child, A&amp;E attendances for the child and the language development. Therefore, one could conclude that the outcomes related to the child are valued higher than the outcomes that are related to the mother.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d6796e3137 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Subgroup analyses</h3><p class="" id=d6796e3142>The models based on interaction effects with demographic characteristics (<a href="#T5">Table 5</a>) demonstrate that preference for the occurrence of child’s A&amp;E attendances, education and employment of the mother and whether the child’s needs are met, varied by gender. The preferences between genders change in terms of their magnitude rather than the nature of the outcome. Women have higher disutility than men if the above attributes take the “negative outcome” value, i.e. the child attends A&amp;E, the mother does not return to education or employment, and the child’s needs are not met.</p><a name=T5 class=n-a></a><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><div class=caption><h3>Table 5.

Over 1000 responses were collected from a sample that was broadly representative of the UK general public on key variables. The large sample is one of the strengths of this study as it enhances the statistical efficiency. The guidelines on conducting DCEs suggest that sample sizes in the range of 1000 to 2000 respondents will produce small confidence intervals, even if the experimental design is not particularly efficient<sup><a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup>. This is particularly important in our study where the data were pooled from four designs and the statistical efficiency might have been compromised. Respondents were randomly allocated to complete one or all four designs to minimize the selection bias.</p><p class="" id=d6796e4298>The study shows that the general public value more highly outcomes that affect children directly: whether the mother fulfils the child’s needs and the bond she develops with the child, child’s A&amp;E visits, and their language development. Mother’s smoking behaviour during pregnancy and the relationship she has with her partner are also ranked high in the preference of the general public. Outcomes directly related to the mother, such as employment, education or her confidence in achieving goals or solving problems, are ranked much lower. In general, the results are intuitive, even more so when gender is taken into account. Women value the outcomes related to the mother higher than men. Although the direction of the preferences for both age and guardianship status appear counterintuitive, there are possible explanations for this. For example, parents may be more acceptant of variability and less rigid about what is considered “normal”.</p><p class="" id=d6796e4301>The data from the four designs were pooled by the use of two common attributes based on the assumption that the respondents’ preferences for the 14 attributes would be the same regardless of whether they are presented all together or in separate designs<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. This assumption would have led to the same coefficients for the common attributes in all designs. Quantitatively, this was not the case as the beta coefficients for the common attributes were different. Still, the ranking of the common attributes was the same across the four designs. This was confirmed in the pooled data: respondents value the attribute “A&amp;E attendances for children” as being more important than the occurrence of second pregnancy. Also, the top five ranked attributes in the pooled model are the top ranked attributes in the separate designs. This provides reassurance that pooling the data would not produce misleading results.</p><p class="" id=d6796e4308>This DCE included a broad range of outcomes, related to both the mother and the child. The advantage of including a large number of attributes lies on the fact that, by mirroring the outcomes measured in the BBs trial, one broadens the decision making context, where outcomes for different subjects (mother and child, in this case), and both health and non-health outcomes can be incorporated in the trading-off process. The probability of the uptake of the FNP can be estimated by combining the information on the effectiveness of the trial (i.e. which of the outcomes are improved by this intervention) with the preference weights for these outcomes.</p><p class="" id=d6796e4312>However, there are a number of caveats. The choice task given to the respondents was somewhat simplified to make the task more approachable to lay persons. The attributes were presented in a binary format and no attempt was made to assign levels other than describing the attribute as a ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ outcome. This approach has led to the preference values being calculated for fairly broad attributes, which could be argued, do not reflect the nuanced outcome differences seen in the trial. An ideal scenario would have been to assign more levels, reflecting the outcomes observed in the trial. However, there were two reasons for adopting this approach: firstly, the nature of the research question might have been too specific for a proportion of the respondents. For example, people without children might have found it more difficult (e.g. the task is more abstract) to value the importance of certain child-related outcomes. Secondly, the large number of attributes called for a simple approach to keep the task manageable and avoid cognitive burn-out of respondents. As an additional limitation, while respondents were able to trade-off attributes, it is not clear whether there are interactions between attributes that have been omitted from the analysis. Omission of important interactions may lead to biased parameter estimates, i.e. an under or overestimation of the relative value of an attribute.</p><p class="" id=d6796e4315>Importantly, in order to be consistent with decision making bodies, such as NICE, the DCE responders were members of the general public. However, there is also an argument for considering the preferences of individuals who have experience in the condition of interest. Brazier <i>et al</i>. (2005)<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup> call for greater debate on the subject of patients’ valuation of health states. DCEs based on, for example, recent teenage mothers may yield differing estimates of the relative importance of attributes.</p><p class="" id=d6796e4325>Despite these limitations, this DCE can be used to place the results of the BBs trial in a decision-making context, while taking into account the views of the general public for the preferred benefits or outcomes of FNP. An illustrative example for such an approach included two extreme scenarios where the BBs trial results were compared with a best and a worst-case trial output. The BBs trial demonstrated that the FNP results in small improvements in three of the secondary outcomes that were included in the DCE. No improvements were observed in the primary outcomes. This in turn, is translated into an extremely small probability of the FNP being accepted as a public health policy programme by the general public compared to the best-case scenario, where all the outcomes included in this DCE are improved by the intervention. Naturally, the probabilities of acceptance would change depending on what outcomes are being improved by the intervention but also on how highly these have been valued by the general public. Hence, a scenario where, for example, the trial demonstrates improvements in all the primary outcomes (therefore, the intervention is considered a successful one) but these are not valued highly by the general public resulting in a low probability of acceptance, would be entirely plausible. Nevertheless, the DCE provides a decision-making tool when the contribution of the general public or any other specific group of respondents is considered important.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d6796e4331>Conclusion</h2><p class="" id=d6796e4334>Where complex public health interventions are expected to impact upon a range of potential beneficial outcomes, understanding how to use evidence to inform policy becomes even more important. Home visiting programmes, such as the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP), have been evaluated against a wide range of outcomes (clinical and non-clinical) both in the short-term, such as in the Building Blocks trial, and also in the much longer-term (such as in the US trials of NFP<sup><a href="#ref-35">35</a>–<a href="#ref-37">37</a></sup>). There has also been some academic and policy debate<sup><a href="#ref-38">38</a>–<a href="#ref-40">40</a></sup> following publication of the main trial results of FNP in England<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> about the relative importance of the primary and secondary outcomes selected when commissioning the trial, which itself was only ever able to report on short-term benefit. For example, the two maternal primary trial outcomes were smoking in pregnancy and a second pregnancy within two years following the first child’s birth. The former but not the latter were rated as of high value to respondents in the DCE and both are subject to further development work by the FNP programme itself post trial publication<sup><a href="#ref-41">41</a></sup>. A greater understanding of the importance of a short inter-pregnancy interval in the relevant English context and how policy should respond remains an important task.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d6796e4362>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d6796e4365 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d6796e4370>Harvard Dataverse: FNP Discrete Choice experiment, <a target=xrefwindow href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DUL9KT" id=d6796e4372>https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DUL9KT</a><sup><a href="#ref-42">42</a></sup>.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d6796e4380 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Extended data</h3><p class="" id=d6796e4385>Harvard Dataverse: Designs A-D, <a target=xrefwindow href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GK4TPV" id=d6796e4387>https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GK4TPV</a><sup><a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d6796e4394>Harvard Dataverse: Patient information sheet <a target=xrefwindow href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JBVRTZ" id=d6796e4396>https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JBVRTZ</a><sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d6796e4403>Harvard Dataverse: Variables key <a target=xrefwindow href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/L8QOKC" id=d6796e4405>https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/L8QOKC</a><sup><a href="#ref-43">43</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d6796e4412>Data are available under the terms of the <a target=xrefwindow href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode" id=d6796e4414>Creative Commons Zero “No rights reserved” data waiver</a> (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).</p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d6796e4423 class=n-a></a><h2 class=main-title id=d6796e4425>Acknowledgments</h2><p class="" id=d6796e4428>We thank Julia Witt, Assistant Professor at University of Manitoba, for the email communication which helped to clarify methodological points.</p><p class="" id=d6796e4431>This study was presented as an abstract at the Fifteenth Annual International Conference on Health Economics, Management &amp; Policy 20–23 June 2016, Athens, Greece (<a target=xrefwindow href="https://www.atiner.gr/abstracts/2016ABST-HEA.pdf" id=d6796e4433>abstract 25</a>, pg 50).</p></div><div class=back-section><a name=d6796e4438 class=n-a></a><span class="research-layout prime-recommended-wrapper reference-heading is-hidden"><span class=faculty-opinion-icon></span><span class="prime-red big">Faculty Opinions recommended</span></span><h2 class=main-title id=d7075>References</h2><div class="section ref-list"><a name=d6796e4438 class=n-a></a><ul><li><a name=ref-1 class=n-a></a><span class=label>1. </span>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d6796e4445 class=n-a></a>Bonell C: Why is teenage pregnancy conceptualized as a social problem?
