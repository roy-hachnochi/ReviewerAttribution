 Need more anatomical description. Was this a division through the glans and distal corpora - urethral vessels were, therefore, supplying the glans? What about the dorsal neuromuscular bundle - please comment? Use the correct anatomy for each vessel, nerve, vein etc. Need a more subjective assessment of sensation and erectile function.
