 This is an interesting paper and adds to the current literature in penile injuries. I would recommend for publication; however, major revisions need to be added first. Need to delineate and describe anatomical injury and orientation: ventral and dorsal? What is preop trauma/injury assessment and how it was managed at the emergency room level? I understand microscopy was not available but it remains gold standard in penile injury repair and reconstruction especially when anatomizing penile vasculature and corporal tissues and urethral. However, surgical loops were used? Correct? How was urethral managed? Did you do preop UA, intra op cysto? Passing catheter? Any resistance? Did you repair urethra? Describe in detail penile vascular injury? Was dorsal penile arteries, veins, and nerves all injures? Did you use intrap doppler to assess for arterial signals? Why it was not repaired? You also mentioned deep penile artery was not repaired? What is post op follow up? How many days? Months since the injury? Do you have SHIM or AUA SS assessed? Did he retain any erectile or ejaculatory function? Make clear in the paper? Were other specialities like plastics present to assist or only urology? What is the management of foley cath post op and wound care? Describe reconstruction sutures used and what fashion interrupted vs continuous? In your conclusion, you mentioned that microscopic repair remains gold standard; however, if there are limited resources, then non micro repair is possible. Thatâ€™s ok. However you used surgical loops? Correct? Happy to write a short editorial to accompany this paper after revision is made.
