The authors describe the setting up of a consortium and network for doing observational studies and RCTs in the future, as such the study does not describe any specific method. It relies more on the aims and objectives of the network and the process followed. The opportunities and challenges are also listed and potential solution in the real world outlined. The network is essential for amplifying the work in maternal and new-born health and can serve as a valuable resource for providing evidence and conducting epidemiological studies in these backwards states in India. The description could have touched on some of the areas to make it more robust. The process of engagement with partners, the MOUs signed and the IPR shared, the shared value systems, the larger universe of health systems and how they plan for risk communication to audiences as well as decision makers including the obstetricians in the network. The incentives and the academic partnerships could have been better described. Often in the north south partnerships, the hospitals and intervention centres are left our to be nothing more than data collectors. Critical questions like how they will benefit, how the population will benefit, do they envisage community panels patient panels and how do they plan to engage them as part of the network. What academic institutes are involved in the global south, what resources do they bring? How does the platform plan for long term sustainability and scalability? The ethics part is well described but does not give clarity of was the ethics for setting up the platform or for carrying out the observational studies.
