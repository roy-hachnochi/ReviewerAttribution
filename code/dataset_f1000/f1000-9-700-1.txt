This is an excellent and important article reflecting on a very high level professional piece of research. Overall, the one critique I have is that it is too short for the type of research - a multivariate study. A few specific points to make: The authors are encouraged to spend a little more time developing "neighborhood" as an aspect of social cohesion. For instance the males in the study have greater social cohesion- is this due to work outside the home?. For instance perhaps the females spend more of their day as home makers in the community and would have more opportunity for neighborhood social cohesion? The authors found 19% of the sample had a disability- is this what the data would expect for Kerala, India? Clearly gender matters- more discussion on this including in promoting social cohesion with those with a disability- it would seem that efforts for males and females may be best if they are gender focused. Again this is a very high quality research design. A lot of the strong evidence is in figure two- please expand discussion on that figure. In the discussion section, please return to the neighborhood discussion. This paper most certainly should be accepted for indexing with these expansions
