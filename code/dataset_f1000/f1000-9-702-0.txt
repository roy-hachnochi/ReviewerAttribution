The article “ Misjudging early embryo mortality in natural human reproduction” considers the evidence presented in a 2002 court case [ R (on the application of Smeaton) v Secretary of State for Health ], involving the use of Levonelle (the ‘morning after pill’; MAP) as a form of birth control. In this case, it was ruled that MAP does not act to terminate a pregnancy, a conclusion that relied heavily on the assertion that only 25% of successfully fertilized eggs survive to implantation. Here, the scientific and medical evidence in support of this assertion is examined, based on the published literature and the testimony of the four expert witnesses who provided numerical estimates of embryo mortality. In particular, the figures relied on in the Judicial opinion are derived from studies of embryo survival during IVF, and are therefore irrelevant to the use of MAP as birth control. The argument is clearly written and provides ample evidence in support of the author’s conclusion that the case was decided, based in part, on a misinterpretation of the scientific evidence. The author points out the need for a legal analysis to clarify the impact of this error, yet (appropriately) does not offer an opinion on this matter. Over all, this is a helpful and clear critique of a seminal case involving human embryo mortality.
