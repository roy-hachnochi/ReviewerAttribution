This review provide an authoritative review on 2019-nCoV infection therapeutic options. After briefly covered several treatment strategies, the author focused on options to block virus from entering cells. Figure 1 is terrific. I suggest that the authors provide a table contrasting the four strategies mentioned at the beginning. In the treatment involving neutralizing antibodies, the author should discuss potential side effect such as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). So many therapeutic options have been mentioned in China including Chinese herbs and chlorquine. It will be great if the author can briefly review and comment on this.
