The authors present the whole genome sequence of Sweetleaf, the plant where the sweetener, Stevia, is derived. I am surprised someone has not already sequenced this genome - it is certainly timely. The data are well presented and publicly available through NCBI. It is well-written and worthy of indexing. I only have minor comments below: Should the keywords repeat words found in the title? Can more be said in the Results about the genome?
