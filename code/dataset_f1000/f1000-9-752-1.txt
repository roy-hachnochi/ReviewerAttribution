The present article by Bassant et al. is well written and the results are well presented in the manuscript. The methods were clearly described and thorough details were provided which adds to the scientific value of the manuscript. Power analysis details are provided for the sample size calculation. Light microscopic and electron microscopic photos are clear and described sufficiently. However, I have some remarks that might add to the manuscript: The authors could add the use of an immunohistochemical marker for oxidative stress to confirm histological findings. Grouping could be renamed I, II and III instead of the current namings. In the first group, normal saline is 0.9% not 9. I believe this manuscript is suitable for publication.
