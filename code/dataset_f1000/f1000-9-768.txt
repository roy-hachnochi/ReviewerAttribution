            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: Disability brings challenges and demands in the family and society which last for a long time.&amp;nbsp; Children that are affected by disability are often kept at home, without access to opportunities other children might have, and education is one of the most effective ways to break the cycle of discrimination and poverty. Malaysia is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and teacher quality issues are among the Ministry of Education's focuses to ensure a successful journey for pupils with disabilities. In this study, we evaluated the competency, knowledge and implementation practices of teachers serving government schools in West Malaysia regarding teaching children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
 Methods: 832 primary teachers from different states of West Malaysia participated in a web-based survey that assessed self-reported competency, knowledge and implementation practices with regards to managing children with autism spectrum disorder.&amp;nbsp; 
 Results: Respondents rated themselves as quite competent, and believed that they were knowledgeable regarding ASD and could implement ASD tasks.&amp;nbsp; Frequency of training was a consistent predictor of competency. Respondents who had never attended a training course had significantly lower self-competency, lower level of knowledge, and lower implementation ratings than those who had attended even one course. 
 Conclusions: Investments in training teachers on ASD are highly recommended to ensure these students are provided with quality of education they deserve.">

  "description": "Background: Disability brings challenges and demands in the family and society which last for a long time.  Children that are affected by disability are often kept at home, without access to opportunities other children might have, and education is one of the most effective ways to break the cycle of discrimination and poverty. Malaysia is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and teacher quality issues are among the Ministry of Education's focuses to ensure a successful journey for pupils with disabilities. In this study, we evaluated the competency, knowledge and implementation practices of teachers serving government schools in West Malaysia regarding teaching children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Methods: 832 primary teachers from different states of West Malaysia participated in a web-based survey that assessed self-reported competency, knowledge and implementation practices with regards to managing children with autism spectrum disorder. 
Results: Respondents rated themselves as quite competent, and believed that they were knowledgeable regarding ASD and could implement ASD tasks.  Frequency of training was a consistent predictor of competency. Respondents who had never attended a training course had significantly lower self-competency, lower level of knowledge, and lower implementation ratings than those who had attended even one course.
Conclusions: Investments in training teachers on ASD are highly recommended to ensure these students are provided with quality of education they deserve."

cycle of discrimination and poverty. Malaysia is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and teacher quality issues are among the Ministry of Education's focuses to ensure a successful journey for pupils with disabilities. In this study, we evaluated the competency, knowledge and implementation practices of teachers serving government schools in West Malaysia regarding teaching children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).<br/> <b>Methods: </b>832 primary teachers from different states of West Malaysia participated in a web-based survey that assessed self-reported competency, knowledge and implementation practices with regards to managing children with autism spectrum disorder.&nbsp;<br/> <b>Results: </b>Respondents rated themselves as quite competent, and believed that they were knowledgeable regarding ASD and could implement ASD tasks.&nbsp; Frequency of training was a consistent predictor of competency. Respondents who had never attended a training course had significantly lower self-competency, lower level of knowledge, and lower implementation ratings than those who had attended even one course.<br/> <b>Conclusions: </b>Investments in training teachers on ASD are highly recommended to ensure these students are provided with quality of education they deserve. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> competency, knowledge, implementation, autism, teachers, Malaysia, government schools </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Jo Ann Andoy-Galvan (<a href="mailto:JoAnnAndoy.Galvan@taylors.edu.my">JoAnnAndoy.Galvan@taylors.edu.my</a>) </div> </div> <div class="margin-top margin-bottom float-left"> <button id=close-popup-window class=general-white-orange-button>Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-corresponding-author> <b>Corresponding author:</b> Jo Ann Andoy-Galvan </span> <div class=clearfix></div> </span> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom competing-interests-display"> <span class=competing-interests-title>Competing interests:</span> No competing interests were disclosed. </span> <div class="info-separation padding-bottom grant-information-display"> <span class=grant-information-title>Grant information:</span> This project is funded by the Taylor’s Research Grant Scheme, Taylor’s University, Malaysia (Project code: TRGS/ERFS/1/2016/SOM/005; Budget Code: 320201-SR96-429-C31). <br/> <i>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</i> </div> <span class="f1r-article-desk info-separation padding-bottom"> <span class="copywrite-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-100_open_access"></span> </span> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-copyright-text> <b>Copyright:</b>&nbsp; © 2020 Andoy-Galvan JA <em>et al</em>.

The financial burden associated with accessing health, education and social services is responsible for the cycle of poverty in society. Education is one of the most effective ways to break the cycle of discrimination and poverty that children with disabilities and their families often face by allowing them a greater degree of independence and better quality of life<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. Disabled citizens are often underestimated for their sufficient capabilities to contribute to society resulting in not being prioritized. Education for All (EFA), a global movement, which aims to ensure that every child and adult receives basic education of good quality, has realized failure in its objectives because disabled children are not given proper attention. These children are often kept at home, without access to opportunities other children might have<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. Universal primary education is one of the eight international Millennium Developmental Goals (MDGs). MDGs had been established following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. It is a commitment made by 191 United Nation States to be achieved by the year 2015<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. According to the MDGs report in 2015, there has been a significant improvement in terms of universal primary education. The primary school net enrolment rate in the developing regions reached 91% in 2015, up from 83% in 2000. The number of out-of-school children of primary school age worldwide has fallen by almost half, to an estimated 57 million in 2015, down from 100 million in 2000. The literacy rate among youth aged 15 to 24 has increased globally from 83% to 91 % between 1990 and 2015<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. But despite impressive strides, there are more people being left behind, especially the poorest and those disadvantaged because of their sex, age, disability, ethnicity or geographic location<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. Targeted efforts are required to reach the most vulnerable people. ‘Children with disabilities’ is one of these groups identified in the report as holding back progress towards education for all. Children with disabilities demand increased attention and often require an education adapted to their needs. Ensuring that all people have an equal chance of education must be at the heart of new goals post 2015.</p><p class="" id=d23921e286>The Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs) were developed to accomplish the unmet MDGs which ended in 2015<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. One SDG is to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. This inclusive education is aimed at providing special education to students for them to be more successful in social interactions leading to further success in life. However, children with autism require specialized instructions and behaviour support to learn critical skills and improve long term outcomes<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The competency of teachers is important in the development of these special children. They should be well competent to ensure the quality of education that these children deserve.</p><p class="" id=d23921e301>Consequently, this research evaluates the characteristics of teachers teaching children with autism in primary government schools in West Malaysia and their self-reported competency, level of knowledge and teaching practices implemented. The implications of this study are important as the results can impact the qualifications of teachers and guide professional development that will ensure potential development of children with ASD.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d23921e307>Methods</h2><div class=section><a name=d23921e310 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Study design and setting</h3><p class="" id=d23921e315>This cross-sectional study, conducted in West Malaysia between June 2017 and January 2018, utilized a web-based survey to determine the level of competency, knowledge and implementation practices of primary government schoolteachers registered under the Program Pendidikan Khas Integrasi (PPKI) and Sekolah Kebangsaan Pendidikan Khas (SKPK). PPKI is a special education program for primary school children with disabilities, which was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 1962<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. It provides a separate class for disabled individuals organized under mainstream primary schools within integrated setting so they can interact and play with other children of their age. SKPK is a special education school provided by the same ministry, which provides education for primary school children with special needs. At present, there are 22 SKPK all over the country, which offer special education for different groups of disabilities; some exclusively provide education to deaf and mute children, while 12 offer programs for autism enrollees. Due to the scarcity of the available enrollees from SKPK (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>), regular government schools offering PPKI programs were also targeted (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>) in the present study.</p><a name=T1 class=n-a></a><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><div class=caption><h3>Table 1.

Prior to conducting the regressions, several variables were recoded. First, level of education was recoded into a three-category variable: diploma, Bachelor’s, and graduate degree. Second, class size was recoded into a three-category variable: 1 to 5, 6 to 10, and 11 or more. Lastly, frequency of training was recoded into a four-category variable: never, once, once a year, and more than once a year. Indicator (or dummy) variables were then created, where the first category (i.e., diploma, 1 to 5, and never) served as the reference group. In addition, because the variable, number of ASD students taught, was severely skewed, this variable was transformed using natural log function. Skewness dropped to acceptable limits (i.e., skewness index fell below three, per Kline, 2011)<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>; thus, this transformed variable was used in subsequent regression procedures.</p><p class="" id=d23921e2137>Assumptions of multivariate normality (assessed through a normal probability plot), linearity, and homoscedasticity (both assessed through a plot of the studentized deleted residuals by the standardized predicted values) were checked; all assumptions were met. The problem of multi-collinearity was also verified via the variables’ tolerance values; multi-collinearity was not a problem as all tolerance values were above .20<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup></p></div><div class=section><a name=d23921e2144 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Predictors of self-competence</h3><p class="" id=d23921e2149>The findings in <a href="#T6">Table 6</a> reveal that the number of ASD students taught positively predicted self-competence ratings (β = .11, <i>p</i> = .003); the more ASD students the respondents had taught, the higher their self-competence ratings.

teachers who can confidently implement efficacious strategies to bring the best possible outcomes. It is crucial to understand the aptitudes of special education teachers as their understanding of autism and its spectrum, strategies to design individual teaching plans and assessment will help the students achieve their potential. This study highlights the self-reported competency, knowledge and implementation practices and its predictors among special education teachers in primary government schools in West Malaysia. Additionally, the findings can serve as a guide to realigning the content of teachers’ preparation programs.</p><p class="" id=d23921e3206>In our study, the majority of the participants had a Bachelor’s degree (83.3%) and another 8.2% had a Master’s degree. The average number of years of experience of teaching was 8.25 years, with an average of around 13 students with ASD, and majority of the teachers were experienced in handling a class size of 1 to 5. A similar profile was reported in studies conducted by Toran <i>et al.</i> and Wei <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>). The teachers demonstrated intermediate to moderate levels of knowledge of autism and implementation practices. A study conducted in the city of Amman by AL Jabery <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> reported a similar result. However, our finding contrasted with finding of low to intermediate autism knowledge among special education teachers from the Virginia state of the United States of America as reported by Hendricks. A study conducted by Mavropoulou and Padeliadu among Greek educators reported and another by Toran <i>et al.</i> among teachers in Malaysia highlighted the low level of knowledge of autism among the special education teachers<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d23921e3241>A moderate level of self-reported competency in determining appropriate intervention goals for the autistic children was reported by respondents in our study. Hendricks , Toran <i>et al.</i> and Wei <i>et al.</i> noted similar findings in their studies<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d23921e3260>Our study revealed that the frequency of training strongly predicted self-reported competency and knowledge, as well as the implementation practices. Toran <i>et al.</i> emphasized the need to improve special education teacher training in order to increase the level of knowledge in autism and effective use of evidence-based teaching strategies by offering hands-on activities. Hendricks also highlighted the need for increased content related to autism and evidence-based practices during pre-service training<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-14">15</a></sup> Scheuermann <i>et al.</i> recommended the use of specialized skills training and provision of technical assistance and support to teachers in the training programs in the United States. Similarly, Litton <i>et al.</i> recommended a one-year induction program in conjunction with the local school districts’ programs with the express purpose of retaining highly qualified teaching personnel<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d23921e3287>In this study, we also found that the level of education also significantly predicted knowledge of ASD competencies and implementation practices. Respondents with a graduate degree had significantly higher ratings as compared to those with a teaching diploma. This finding highlights the importance of recruiting teachers with a higher level of education in this setting.</p><p class="" id=d23921e3290>The number of students with ASD taught by the respondents was found to be a significant predictor of self-competence and knowledge, as well as the implementation practices. This is of particular interest given the challenges educators face due to the multidimensional nature of the disability. As documented by Hendricks<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>, the wide range of cognitive abilities and verbal skills of learners affect the knowledge and competencies required. Dealing with students with varying capabilities warrant special practices that address communication and social needs and help the learners achieve academic success.</p><p class="" id=d23921e3297>However, in our study the number of years of teaching experience did not predict self-competence or knowledge, which concurs with the finding reported by Alharbi <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. In contrast, AL Jabery <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> reported statistically significant differences in the level of knowledge among teachers with a teaching experience of five years and more as compared to those with a teaching experience of less than three years</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d23921e3315>Conclusion</h2><p class="" id=d23921e3318>From our results, we conclude that teachers rated themselves as considerably competent. They also believed that they were knowledgeable regarding ASD and could implement ASD tasks. Frequency of training is a consistent predictor of this competency; respondents who had never attended a training course had significantly lower self-competency, lower level of knowledge and lower implementation ratings than those who had attended even one course. Investments in training of these teachers is highly recommended to ensure these students are provided with the quality of education they deserve.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d23921e3325>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d23921e3328 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d23921e3333>Harvard Dataverse: Self reported competency, knowledge and practices of teachers teaching primary children with autism in government schools of West Malaysia, <a target=xrefwindow href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TP5VJI" id=d23921e3335>https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TP5VJI</a><sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d23921e3342>This project contains the following underlying data:</p><p class="" id=d23921e3345> <div class=list><a name=d23921e3347 class=n-a></a><ul style="list-style-type: none"><li><p id=d23921e3353><span class=label></span> - Raw data: ASD TEACHERS.tab</p></li></ul></div> </p></div><div class=section><a name=d23921e3360 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Extended data</h3><p class="" id=d23921e3365>Harvard Dataverse: Self reported competency, knowledge and practices of teachers teaching primary children with autism in government schools of West Malaysia, <a target=xrefwindow href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TP5VJI" id=d23921e3367>https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TP5VJI</a><sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d23921e3374>This project contains the following extended data:</p><div class=list><a name=d23921e3377 class=n-a></a><ul style="list-style-type: none"><li><p id=d23921e3384><span class=label>- </span> Questionnaire in English and Malay language (competency developed by Virginia Autism Council)</p></li></ul></div><p class="" id=d23921e3389>Data are available under the terms of the Creative <a target=xrefwindow href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" id=d23921e3391>Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver</a> (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).</p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d23921e3400 class=n-a></a><h2 class=main-title id=d23921e3402>Acknowledgments</h2><p class="" id=d23921e3405>The authors would like to thank the following people from the Ministry of Education for their support to this research project: Shazali Bin Ahmad, Rosli Bin Ismail, Mohd Helmy Bin Mahat, Fatimahtul Zaharah binti Ithnin; and all the state Education Offices for their assistance in the data collection particularly the following officers: Mohamad Faizal bin Mohamad Roselee, Nawi Awang Senik, Hj Mohd Nazri Bin Jj Abdul Latip, Wan Shariza Binti Ahmad, Shafruddin Ali Hussin, Huzaimah binti Muain, Yahaya Ali, Letchumy A/P Sinnan and Fakhrul Nizam Pakhruddin.
