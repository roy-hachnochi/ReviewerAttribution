The manuscript entitled ‘Anti- c-myc cholesterol based lipoplexes as onco-nanotherapeutic agents in vitro ’ describes an analysis of non-viral lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of anti-c-myc siRNAs to cultured breast cells. The formulations comprising a cholesterol derivative termed MS09 in combination with DOPE or cholesterol performed significantly better than a commercially available transfection reagent. Useful properties of the complexes are described and extensive characterization is provided. The manuscript is written well, the study is neat and should be of interest to researchers in the field. Two points that should be addressed before indexing are the following: Emphasis is placed on targeting cancer cells for delivery of an oncogene-disabling siRNA. The authors should provide information on how the vectors will/could be targeted to malignant cells specifically. Ultimate utility of the vectors will be dependent on efficient action in vivo . Considerations for clinical translation of the technology should be provided.
