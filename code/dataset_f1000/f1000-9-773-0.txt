This study conducted a methodological survey to assess the extent to which the contents of PROSPERO records meet the systematic review protocol reporting items in PRISMA-P. This paper addresses an important research question, and the findings may have implications for the reporting of systematic review protocols. However, there are a few issues for authors to consider: One aim of PRISMA-P is to aid authors in transitioning their systematic review protocols prepared in accordance with PRISMA-P into full text, while the authors used records from PROSPERO (i.e., not full-text) to assess the compliance to PRISMA-P reporting items, which may be a limitation that should be discussed in this paper. In the methods part, it could be desirable that the authors could clearly report how the 17 numbered items of PRISMA-P were broken down into 63 elements. The author should clearly report whether the subgroup analyses reported in table 3 were pre-planned. The use of a scoring scheme for PRISMA-P and the 63 elements may not be optimal, given the potential difference in item importance, which should be added to the discussion part as a limitation. In table 2, values in parentheses are percentages, which should be indicated in the table.
