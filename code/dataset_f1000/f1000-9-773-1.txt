This article is an analysis of how PROSPERO records adhere to the PRISMA-P guideline. The Analysis is based on a random sample of 439 PROSPERO records published in 2018. The authors conclude that reporting in PROSPERO should be improved given the fact that the PROSPERO record is often the only available source of a priori reporting. The manuscript is methodologically sound and well written. What I think can be improved is the discussion. I wonder what is the implication of this study. Do the authors want to make the point that PROSPERO records should follow PRISMA-P? To the best of my knowledge PRISMA-P is even not mentioned in the PROSPERO guidance. If this would be the intention then wy not allign PROSPERO with the PRISMA-P items. I admit that PRISMA-P has been primarily designed for SRs of healthcare interventions, but most items are General and would be applicable to other review types as well. I do not want to make the point that this is a great idea, but it is somehow a logical question resulting from your manuscript and this should be mentioned in the discussion. Registries and protocols should be seen as different entities, and thus I think that a perfect result of all PROSPERO records meeting all PRISMA-P items cannot be what we aiming for. If this would be the case, this would probably dilute the difference between a PROSPERO record and a protocol.
