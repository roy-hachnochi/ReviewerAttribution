A 49 yr old lady, non-smoker with apparently no significant medical problems presented to emergency room with acute left lower limb ischemia. She was normotensive, tachycardic, and hypoxic but with normal respiratory rate on presentation. She was anemic with leucocytosis (no lymphopenia), normal renal function (? creatinine) and elevated D-dimer. Rest of coagulation panel not available. PCR for COVID-19 positive. CT chest suggestive of COVID-19. On day 2, patient is intubated and day 4, patient dies. Venous thromboembolism is well described now in COVID 19 and high intensity DVT (deep vein thrombosis) prophylaxis is often recommended but arterial thromboembolism is not that common and effective prophylaxis has not been described. This make this a valuable case report and the authors do a good job of presenting an important and devastating manifestation of this important disease. Here are some additional areas that if clarified will help readers. Please clarify what is “clear dyspnea” on physical exam. Was there any history of oral contraceptive usage? Was her blood group known? Recent genome wide association studies reveal this may be important What test (? Platform) was employed to confirm SARS-CoV2 What was the date of presentation for patient- Was steroid, Plaquenil, tocilizumab or convalescent plasma treatment option offered? This is a disease with rapidly evolving treatment strategies. Did echocardiogram or did CT chest report any concern for LV thrombus. Was CT angiogram lower extremity performed? Was the patient also screened for DVT and Pulmonary embolism?
