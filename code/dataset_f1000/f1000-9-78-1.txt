This is an interesting study describing the Staphylococcus aureus carrying state among medical students in Colombia. The prevalence of MRSA strains was investigated and the association of the S. aureus carrying state with microbiome composition investigated in a minor number of individuals. It was observed that bacterial and fungal diversity was higher in individuals colonized by S. aureus than in non-carriers although the differences were non-significant. These results contributed with epidemiological information on S. aureus carrier state in Colombian medical students. Maybe, microbiome analysis in a greater number of individuals could reveal a more robust association with S. aureus carrier state. However, the data presented suggest some interesting associations that deserve publication. My only suggestion to the authors is the inclusion of a paragraph in the discussion section about microbiome composition and ethnic groups. Are there differences among Hispanic and other ethnic groups regarding microbiome composition and diversity?
