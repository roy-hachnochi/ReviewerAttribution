The paper sheds light on the causes of fertility transition in selected Eastern African countries. The authors rely on a decomposition method I proposed in 1993 which estimates the roles of three factors in fertility decline: 1) decline in wanted fertility, 2) increase in preference implementation and 3) change in natural fertility. Results show that the rise in the implementation index is the main driver of fertility decline. Although the study does not directly assess the impact of family planning programs, the authors note that these programs aim to help women in implementing their reproductive preferences and disseminate information about the benefits of contraception and smaller families. The text is clearly written and the analysis is technically competent. Two minor edits: The total fertility rate is represented by three different abbreviations: TFR, F, and Fo. This is confusing and should be fixed. The first paragraph of the results section makes reference to Figure 2. This should be Table 2.
