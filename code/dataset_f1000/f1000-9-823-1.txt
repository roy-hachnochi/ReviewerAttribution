This is an important study describing clinical trials addressing COVID-19. It provides important data on activities undertaken to address the pandemic and it would be interesting to see the update of the study if that is possible in the next version. The study concluded with May 15, and I am sure that the situation with the registration and results changed. For example, there are now 2 studies with results and a total of 2890 registered studies on August 5, 2020 (using Covid19 as a search term). The authors describe the problem well in the Introduction and address well the methodological approach, which is sound and appropriate. Agreement between two assessors should be presented (e.g. kappa). Results are clearly presented and discussed. The discussion section mentions that half of the registered trials were from China, but the data on the geographical locations of the study was not presented. This needs to be corrected. Also, this issue needs to be addressed better in the Limitation section, as it is a pity that the authors did not search WHO's ICTRP portal, which includes CT.gov and many oSuch a search would give a better view of the global effort to combat CVOD-19 pandemic.
