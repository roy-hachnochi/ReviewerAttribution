 English grammar is very poor. It impedes adequate understanding of the content. I suggest that the authors use a professional editing service. In the title the term "America" is ambiguous. I suggest changing it by North America, Latin America and the Caribbean. The manuscript is pertinent. However, the discussion needs more depth, contrasting to other authors' views. Please refrain from making value judgements. The manuscript needs major changes before being considered for indexing.
