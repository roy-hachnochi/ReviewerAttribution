Overall, this is a very well written commentary with some important implications. I do think there could be a few additional considerations incorporated in order to broaden the applicability of the perspective and recommendations. For example, in some parts of the world (e.g. US) correctional facilities contract medical services to a third-party vendor. As such, there needs to be additional coordination between corrections-based staff and non-corrections based medical staff, especially with respect to facilitating medical appointments and medication receipt. With respect to the recommendations for best practice, while the best-case scenario the authors outline is one that all facilities should strive to achieve, it would be nice to see some gradation of compliance with this best-practice in order to make it a bit more practical and/or feasible. For example, if facilities do not have the resources, especially in terms of medical staff to adequately supervise medication, what can be done to mitigate concerns re breaches in confidentiality? It would be good to see recommendations for facilities across a “spectrum” of compliance such that those facilities in poor resourced settings do not feel as though they must undertake an all or nothing approach. Again, if facilities can take measured steps toward achieving the stated best-case scenario, they should be strongly encouraged to do so.
