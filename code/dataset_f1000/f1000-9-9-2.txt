This manuscript for a case report presents the well-documented case of a 12-year-old girl with PXE. In addition, the discussion section of the paper also includes a short review on PXE, highlighting systemic manifestations, histopathologic alterations, and management. However, there are some minor issues to be clarified by the authors: A more informative title could be useful, e.g. one that implies that an interesting aspect of this case is that early skin lesions in a young patient are documented. It would raise the quality of the manuscript if, in addition to the description of the skin biopsy findings, histopathologic images could also be included. Also, for the histology, it should be mentioned, which stainings were performed. The necessity of genetic testing should be decided by a clinical geneticist and not a pathologist, as implied in the Case description of the manuscript. In the Discussion section, it can be debated if the patientsâ€™ general practitioner should be responsible for the early detection of systemic manifestation. PXE should be managed by a multidisciplinary team at specialized rare disease centers with sufficient expertise and experience. Certain papers cited by the manuscript are outdated or are not available in English. These should be replaced by citing more recent, high-quality publications.
