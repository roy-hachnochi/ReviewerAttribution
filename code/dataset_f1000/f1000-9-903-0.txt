Short communication focuses on antibiotic resistance caused by efflux pump overexpression and the use of cryo electron microscopy for protein protein or protein ligand interaction. It also describes the limitations of x ray crystallography. The author also extends the cryo EM use in interparticle motions of the ribosome in different tRNA bound states, its visualization in various conformations upon the introduction of ribosomal-specific substrates and several bacterial membrane proteins to near atomic resolution. Author successfully explain the utility of structural dynamics in drug designing by identifying important residues through solved structures. However, references are missing from the introduction and targeting efflux pumps to mitigate antibiotic resistance section. May be accepted after minor revision.
