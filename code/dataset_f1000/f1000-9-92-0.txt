 Abstract: Background: Should read: the antibiotic resistance patterns of Results: antibiotic concentrations, not the amount, need to be used. This applies to the entire manuscript. Introduction: "It was not until recently that Campylobacter spp. was shown to exhibit multidrug resistance (MDR). Before that, the bacteria were considered to be susceptible" it may be difficult to say like this as the MDR was reported more than two decades ago. Quinolone resistance determination region (QRDR). Campylobacter does not have parC. Mutations in parC cause FQ resistance in E. coli and Salmonella; but this is not applied to Campylobacter. Method: Antibiotic concentrations, not the amount, are to be made known in the supplement. Campylobacter is microaerophilic. 'Anaerobic conditions' -- 'Microaerobic conditions'. Did the authors include a quality control strain to the antibiotic susceptibility test? Results: Figure 1: There is no positive control for C. lari Others: Did the asymptomatic children carrying Campylobacter have any previous experience of diarrhea? It may be an important point to discuss whether Campylobacter-positive children are completely asymptomatic carriers or were recovering from Campylobacter exposure without manifesting clinical symptoms. Overall, it reads well, but there are some minor English issues in some parts.
