The manuscript entitled “Multidrug-resistant Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter lari isolated from asymptomatic school-going children in Kibera slum, Kenya” investigated the occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter spp. among school-going children in a populous slum of Kenya. The study is well executed but will need wordsmithing to improve its readability. A weakness of this manuscript is the lack of recent citations in the reference list. I suggest the authors update the reference list by including at least more than 60% of references that have been published in the last 10 years or less. The conclusion will also have to focus on the topic of the research (Campylobacter prevalence and antimicrobial resistance in young children). I have inserted in the manuscript my corrections and suggestions to improve its clarity and style. This can be found here .
