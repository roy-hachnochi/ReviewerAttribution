The possibility that lithium may be useful for corona virus infections remains hypothetical. This is now acknowledged and the article presents the limitations of this approach. A possible supporting study would be to compare disease severity in lithium treated vs non-lithium treated subjects in patients receiving these drugs in the context of the Covid 19 epidemic. Since several psychoactive drugs (e.g. antipsychotic) also affect putative molecular targets of lithium (e.g.GSK3alpha and beta) 1 , 2 , groups treated with these drugs would be interesting to compare to lithium. However, several other factors affecting people with psychiatric illness therapies may also affect the impact of Covid19 or other corona viruses on these populations. This is obviously beyond the scope of this review/hypothesis article. â€‹ References 1.

This is obviously a very timely question. All studies point toward beneficial effects of lithium and thus underscore the possible beneficial effect ... Continue reading READ ALL
