The authors identified five previous studies reporting an effect of lithium (mostly LiCl) in corona virus in cellular systems. This is obviously a very timely question. All studies point toward beneficial effects of lithium and thus underscore the possible beneficial effect of targeting lithium sensitive biochemical pathways, namely GSK3 mediated signaling for corona virus treatment or prophylaxis. As a technical issue lithium not only targets GSK3b but also GSK3-alpha and inositol monophosphatases. So the emphasis on GSK3-beta may be a bit premature. A more important issue is that none of the studies shown an effect of lithium at a 1-1.5mM concentrations. Effects are reported at Li+ concentrations that are 5mM or higher. These concentrations are not toxic for cells in culture. However, in humans, serum lithium concentration above 1.5-2.0mM (or mEq, which stands for the mM concentration of the lithium ion) are considered toxic (Haussmann et al. , 2015 1 ). The prescription of lithium in the context of the current epidemic thus appears not to be supportable by the findings. The cure may kill the patients. More detailed studies using lithium in animal models at tolerable concentrations would thus be needed. Unfortunately these limitations are not addressed in the manuscript.
