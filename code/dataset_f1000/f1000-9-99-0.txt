This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the risk of major bleeding between clopidogrel and ticagrelor in ACS patients treated with CABG. It is a meaningful clinical topic that needs more support from evidence-based medicine. According to the results of this study, ticagrelor should be used more confidently in ACS patients treated with CABG. However, there are disadvantages in some issues: The characteristic summary of the 13 included trials was not shown in the manuscript. It is an important part of a meta-analysis, which should contain the data of age, gender, race, doses of medication, and bleeding risk scores. Because only 2 of them are RCTs, most of them are case-control trails, the methodological bias of the included studies should be analyzed. There are many methods that can estimate the qualities of the included studies, at least one of them should be used in this study to remind the readers interpreting the results with caution. Although this study has analyzed the main observation, the risk of major bleeding, and did subgroup analysis for pre-surgery and post-surgery patients, other factors should be considered using subgroup analysis, for example, race, region, dose and time, bleeding risk scores if possible. The logic of the discussion is not very clear. The structure of this part should be modified, some points should be simplified, and some duplicate expressions should be removed to make readers understand quicker and easier.
