This paper proposed a bayesian optimization framework for Neural Architecture Search (NAS). The key contribution is the definition of OTMANN distance. This formulation is general to many neural network architectures, is intuitive and can be solved efficiently using OT algorithms. Then the paper proposes to use EA to optimize the acquisition function and outperforms baselines on a variety of datasets.  The paper is clearly written and could have big impact on NAS because the proposed method is not tailored for a specific search space and BO is a widely-used black-box optimization framework.  I have two suggestions: 1) Since I do not have a good intuitive how expensive it is to optimize equation (3), it would be great to summarize the computation time (by percentage) of each component (distance calculation, GP regression, EA for acquisition function, etc.) in a table.  2) Unfortunately, this paper did not achieve state-of-the-art result for CIFAR 10. Actually, its accuracy is far from impressive. Although the paper argues that it uses less computational resources and a more general search space, I am still wondering whether it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and how much computation is needed to achieve that.
