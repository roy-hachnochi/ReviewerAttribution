This paper employs one-class SVM to generalize several overlapping clustering models. I like such unifying framework very much, which builds connection among the existing mature knowledge. Here are my detailed comments. 1. The authors might want to change the title so that this paper can be easily searched. 2. The sizes of Figure 1 are not inconsistent. 3. The presentation should be polished. (1) The second and third paragraphs in the introduction part are disconnected. (2) Some notations are not clearly illustrated, such as E in Lemma 2.1 (3) The authors should summarize several key points for the generalization. And a table along these points to generalize network and topic model should be provided 4. Do you try fuzzy c-means? 5. The experimental part is relatively week. (1) Why choose RC as the evaluation metric? Some widely used ones, such as NMI, Rn are encouraged. (2) The authors might want to demonstrate the performance difference of their proposed SVM-core and the traditional model. (3) The time complexity and execution time of SVM-core should be reported.
