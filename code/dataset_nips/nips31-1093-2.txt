The paper is about building covariance functions such that the samples satisfy some differential equations. This can be seen as building more informative priors where some physical knowledge about the system is encoded in the covariance. Let A be a linear given differential operator that takes as input a vector of function and returns a vector of linear combinations of the input partial derivatives. The authors are interested in building a GP f satisfying Af=0. Their approach consists in using Grobner basis for finding an operator B such that ABg=0 for all g in a given space, and then to define f as f=Bg. Some care is provided to ensure that all the elements that are solution of Af=0 can actually be written as f=Bg.  This is a very technical paper and I can not vouch for the correctness of the derivations but the authors did a great job at conveying the important ideas of the paper without burying them behind the technicality. For example, I really appreciated the discussion on the Existence of parametrization (sec 3.1).   The overall idea to build more informative prior is particularly relevant to the community and I see this paper as an interesting, and general way to do so. There are already some kernel such that the samples satisfy differential equations in the literature but I guess the proposed method is the first one that guaranties that all possible solutions of the equations can be generated with the obtained kernel.  In a nutshell, this appear to me as a good paper with a good attention to clarity and possibly a high significance. I guess the method used are classical in some communities but that they will be new to most of the Machine Learning community. I however do not have the background to check the correctness of the derivations and I hope one of the reviewer will be able to do that.   I would have appreciated more details on the Grobner basis and on how to test if an operator B parameterize the set of solutions.  Finally, I have identified the following typos:   - "geomathematic" is missing an "e" (two occurences)   - line 7: missing space   - l. 165 echolon -> echelon   - sentence line 173 is repeated line 178.  ################### After rebuttal: The author's feedback is helpful to understand why they chose to present their paper this way. The minor changes that have been made should result in an improvement of the clarity of the manuscript, but overall the paper seems to remain the same. I thus choose to keep my initial recommendation.
