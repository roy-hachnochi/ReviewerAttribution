The paper proposes a deep network for image super-resolution using res-clique blocks, already existing in the literature. It is a fairly direct application of the original clique architecture, but seems like a good choice of architecture. The clique blocks are used in two different roles: feature extraction and upsampling.  The quantitative and qualitative results show good performance compared with existing baselines.
