The paper considers an interesting problem that generalizes both subspace clustering and matrix completion, and provides some sufficient conditions for recoverability. The setting is the following: we are given a matrix A that is a "mixture" of K low-rank matrices, and the goal is to recover them. By a mixture, we mean that every non-zero entry of A is equal to the entry of one of the low-rank matrices.  The paper presents a (somewhat strong) sufficient condition under which the original matrix can be recovered in an information theoretic sense. The problem turns out to be fairly difficult, so some such assumptions are necessary for unique recovery. The condition has the feel of Hall's condition for matching; it is also shown to hold w.h.p. in a natural probabilistic model (akin to the one used in "regular" matrix completion, K=1).  Overall I find the result interesting. The condition is one that is combinatorial, and it seems unlikely that one can verify if a set of matrices \Omega satisfy the condition in polynomial time.   Also, the paper presents some heuristics for the problem, which resembles the K-SVD algorithm for sparse coding, and at an even higher level, Lloyd's algorithm. It's a natural heuristic, and authors show that it works fairly well in applications.   Overall, the paper has some interesting ideas about proving unique recovery for a pretty difficult matrix problem. I recommend acceptance.
