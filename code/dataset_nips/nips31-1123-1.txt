The paper asks an important question about need for explicitly exploration of validity of attractive greedy algorithm for linear contextual multi-armed bandit settings. While it is clear that greedy algorithm can have linear regret in worst-case, it is observed to be attractive in practice. To characterize this observation theoretically, the authors use smoothed analysis framework, and show that the greedy algorithm indeed as near-optimal regret (depending inversely on variance of Gaussian perturbation, as is common in smoothed analysis).  I think the result is extremely powerful. There have been some attempts to prove results in this direction, but the assumptions made here are substantially more general and elegant through use of smoothed analysis framework. Further an accompanied lower provides complete understanding of greedy algorithm in this setting. The results for multi-parameter setting are not as clean as the single parameter but still very strong.  Post-rebuttal: I did not have any pressing concerns to be addressed by author feedback. After reading the author feedback, my score remains the same.
