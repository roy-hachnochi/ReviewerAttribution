The paper presents new and improves existing algorithms for decomposable submodular function minimization (DSFM) by exploiting certain structures known as incidence relations between the ground set and the component submodular functions.   After making this key observation about subsets of variables that are relevant and directly affect the value of any given component function, the paper theoretically and experimentally shows that known algorithms like  alternating projections in [14] can be improved to achieve faster convergence rates. The authors further show that though the complexity of sequential coordinate descent (CD) methods cannot be improved using incidence relations, these methods can be parallelized and the convergence rates of parallel algorithms depends on these incidence relations.  The paper is very well written and I advocate for acceptance of this submission to NIPS.  Typo: 1. The conditions in line 108 of page 3 should be to verify whether an element i is NOT incident to F. Consider a trivial example where F(S) = 0 for every set S. The conditions in line 108 are satisfied but none of the elements i are incident as per the condition in line 106.   Minor concerns: 1. The authors should discuss the computational complexity for determining the set S_r as it directly determines the quantity ||\mu||_1 critical to their analysis. 2. The conditions stated in line 108 needs more explanation.
