This paper focuses on non-monotone submodular maximization problem. In this problem we are given a normalized non-negative submodular function ‘f’ and the goal is to find a subset of size at most k maximizing the value of ‘f’. Submodular maximization problem is a well-known and well-studied problem in different settings, e.g., offline, streaming, online, map reduce,… . It has been also studied under different assumption, monotone, cardinality constraint, matroid constraint, normalized, non-negative,… . The greedy algorithm achieves a 1/e-approximate solution in O(k) adaptive rounds of accessing the data.  This work presents a 1/2e-approximation algorithm that need poly(log n) adaptive rounds, which makes it more suitable for massive data sets. In my point of view the paper is well-written and authors have explained the key ideas of the algorithm and the analysis nicely. Both the problem that they consider and the algorithm that they propose are interesting.  The author claim that they achieve “Exponentially fewer Iterations”, which is not fully correct. An exponential improvement results in a poly(log k) iterations and not poly(log n). For some cases these two are equivalent, both not for all the cases. Therefore, I think its better to change the title.  They also propose a subroutine called SIEVE, which is very similar to the name of a very famous algorithm for monotone submodular maximization in streaming setting. At first, I thought the authors are using that algorithm. I suggest to change the name to avoid confusions. Also in case they have enough space, it might be better to explain the sampling process more.   In general I think the paper is in a good shape and the result is nice.
