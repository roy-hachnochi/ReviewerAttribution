POST-REBUTTAL UPDATE: The rebuttal addresses most of the issues addressed in the reviews, assuming that all promised changes will actually be incorporated in the camera-ready version. -----------------------------------------  The submission develops a meta-framework for few-shot learning that, building upon an approach/classifier of choice, uses a GAN approach to perform a kind of data augmentation. The classifier (discriminator) in this framework now has to not only distinguish the task classes, but also whether a sample was generated or not (similar to Dai et al.). Optimizing the overall objective yields improved results on both sample and task-based few shot learning problems.  The overall idea and approach is quite sound, and the evaluation, demonstrating that the proposed meta-algorithm is applicable to various discriminator designs, is fairly convincing. The addition of the task-level semi-supervised setting is appreciated. However, it would be great to see slightly more extensive experiments on the other settings: compared to Ren et al., there is no evaluation on the distractor classes setting (l.39, cf. Ren et al.), nor on the tieredImageNet data set.  Other remarks: - The submission is generally reasonably clear. - Section 2.1 is a bit to terse to read well. Several parts of the notation remain undefined. (X x Y, S_T^S, S_T^U, Q_T^S, Q_T_U, ...). - l.59-60: A word seems to be missing here. - l.123, l.127, l.141, and possible other places: Please refer to equations by "Eq. 5 and Eq. 6", etc., and not just writing the number. - Supplemental material, Sec. 3.2: I assume the table on the following page should either be embedded or referenced here.
