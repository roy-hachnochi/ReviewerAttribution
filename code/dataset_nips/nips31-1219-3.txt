This paper proposes meta-learning the hyperparameters associated with policy gradients, using the fact that such hyperparameters interact with the learner in a differentiable way.  This work’s motivation is clear (illustrated with examples section 2). The derivations are clear (a straightforward application of “backprop through learning”) and experiments are impressive.  I am, however, not completely up-to-date with research in meta reinforcement learning and thus not absolutely certain how novel this method is.  Overall, I think this is a solid work that addresses the problems associated with policy gradient methods using ideas from meta-learning.
