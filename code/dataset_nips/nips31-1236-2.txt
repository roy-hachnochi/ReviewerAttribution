- Summary & Strength  The paper studies a sequential learning with binary feedback with a privacy concern where the learning objective is to locate a latent value with some confidence while hiding it from a spying adversary who observes all the queries but not the responses. The authors obtain a tight fundamental limit of the query complexity using Fano’s inequality, which is a standard tool for the lower bound analysis. The fundamental limit matches the query complexity of an upper bound algorithm (Replicated Bisection strategy) in the asymptotic order which is originally proposed in [11, 15]. The query complexity analysis shows a privacy-efficiency trade-off. The proof seems sound, and the paper is easy to follow.   - Weakness & Comment  The proposed model is somewhat artificial. In particular, all the responses are assumed to be correct, whereas noisy response is common in practice. Hence, it limits to connect the considering problem to a motivating example in practice. In addition, there is a line of works e.g., [BA 2008, 13], that study the query complexity even under noisy responses (which lead to interesting applications) although there is no privacy concern. However, there is no justification or motivation on the noiseless response.   - Minor comments  I’m not sure that the notion of the random seed Y is necessary.
