Summary: The paper studies a class of functions which admit no spurious minima. First, the authors explore various closure-related properties such as post-composition of monotonically increasing functions, uniform convergence and 'decreasing-paths', to name a few. Next, mainly motivated by the absence of closure property under uniform convergence, the authors generalize the notion of extremality for sets which allows taking uniform limits (over compact sets). Lastly, this result is applied for tensor-related optimization problems and is used to prove the absence of generalized (strict) local minima.   Evaluation: Existence results of optimization manifolds without spurious minima is now a very active research area. The paper mainly contributes to this area by showing that global functions (as defined in the paper) do not exhibit the 'decreasing-paths' property, and finding a relaxed notion of minima under which one can show closure property of taking uniform limits of global functions. This provides a nice way of expanding a known set of global functions in a relatively systematic way (but seems to be less effective in establishing 'globality' of a given function). The paper is well-written and very nice and easy to follow.  Comments: Consider providing a more explicit definitions for: 'fully observed' (L41), 'uniform neighborhood' and 'Clarke derivative' L93 - 'cosinus' -> cosine? L98 - figure 4a shoud be 4b Paragraph in the end of page 3 - 'strictly strictly' L104 - To me, the fact that f(x_1,x_2) admit no strictly decreasing path from (0,0.5) wasn't entirely clear from figure 6a. Can you provide a somewhat more analytic proof for this?
