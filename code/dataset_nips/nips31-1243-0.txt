Ridge regression is an alternative for linear regression on low-rank matrix inputs, and provides a regularization for ill-posed problems. Ridge leverage scores and rank-k subspace leverage scores (display equations 1 and 2 in the paper) have been at the core of many algorithms for matrix sketching and row/column subset selection.  The authors extend an deterministic algorithm by Papailiopoulos et al. (2014) on rank-k subspace scores sampling and make it work for ridge leverage scores. The motivation is that rank-k subspace scores ignore the small principal components, whereas regularization given by ridge leverage scores is a better, natural, stable alternative. The authors use this to get deterministic algorithms for column subset selection, projection-cost preservation etc. They show this under an assumption of power-law decay of ridge leverage scores, along the lines of a similar assumption used in Papailiopoulos et al.  Overall, most of the key ideas have already been there in previous work by Cohen et al., Papailiopoulos et al. etc. I find this work incremental and borderline for NIPS.
