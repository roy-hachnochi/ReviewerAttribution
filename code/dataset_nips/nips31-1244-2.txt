The paper presents a variant of Wasserstein distance between two probability distributions p and q called c-Wasserstein divergence which is defined with a functional C^{p,q} of p and q. The idea of incorporating two distributions into the cost function looks exciting. However, it is not clear how the newly defined divergence is related to Wasserstein distance. There is no analysis between these two divergences such as inequality, bound, or asymptotics.   For example, Theorem 3 presents the property of Wasserstein estimator but what is the implication of this Theorem for c-Wasserstein divergence.   The experimental section does not prove any benefit of c-Wasserstein divergence in compared with Wasserstein distance used with VAE  as in [31].
