The paper explores a connection between volume sampling and linear regression. Having an input matrix A and a response vector b, it wants to solve linear regression of (A,b) by sampling few rows of A, and yet get a good estimation to optimal least square linear regression weight vector w*.  They proposed a leverage score based volume sampling method (called determinantal rejection sampling in the paper) that samples O(dlog d + d/eps) rows of the input matrix and gives a 1+eps multiplicative gaurantee on weight vector. First off, they showed a rescaled version of volume sampling that gives an unbiased estimate to w*. Afterwards, they specifically mention a volume sampling method that is using probabilities proportional to leverage scores. The paper is written clearly, the idea and the algorithms are novel and original. I did not verify all proofs, but the ones I checked seemed correct.
