I have read reviewers feedback and will keep my original comments.  This paper studies active learning for non-parametric regression for random trees. The proposed algorithm can suggest the number of new samples to acquire in each branch of the tree. The considered problem seems to be timely and important, since indeed, as the author commented, actively learning has been heavily focused on binary classification.  The paper is generally well-written.   The paper derived the prediction error for tree regression (which entails the classic bais-variance tradeoff). Then the *number of samples* needed to take for each branch to minimize the average prediction error is derived in closed-form by solving a simple optimization problem. An active learning algorithm is proposed based on this. It seems to me that the main result is this optimal *number of samples* for each leaf node, subject to a total sample constraint, such that the overall prediction error is minimized.   Theorem 5.1 seems to the main theoretical result, which derives the consistency of the sampling. This gives a specific performance guarantee.   Simulations are provided to verify the results. There is no real-data example - it could significantly enhance the paper.   As a theory paper, it contains some interesting formulation and results (which are moderately significantly and challenging). Thus I would like to suggest a marginal acceptance.
