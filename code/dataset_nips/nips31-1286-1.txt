The paper discusses the multi arm bandit problem to identify the best action in sequential decision making. It focuses on models in which there are non-trivial dependencies between the reward distribution of the arms. The approach formulates the problem with causal graphs and do-calculus. The key contribution is the proposal of an algorithm to find a set of variables called POMIS (possibly-optimal minimal intervention set). POMIS consists of a subset of all variables which can be intervened on to obtain the optimal strategy and the algorithm exploits graphical criteria.  The paper provides useful results as the strategy of removing redundant arms is shown in the experiments to improve the cumulative regret relative to others that ignore the structure of relationships. It achieves this by essentially reducing the space to search for optimal actions and avoids pulling unnecessary arms. As described in section 5, there are potential cases where alternative approaches would assess a smaller number of arms.
