The paper was too technical for a conference review (with 34 pages of supplement!), that too within a short period of time. I glanced over the high level contributions and if the proofs are correct, would definitely fit into the theoretical niche areas of NIPS. I would defer to the opinion of other reviewers who might have been able to provide more time to the paper for a thorough review.
