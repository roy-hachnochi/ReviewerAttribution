This paper addresses the estimation of causal relationships or causal effects of interventions on outcomes but at an individual level from observational data. This problem is quite hard as it requires the estimation of counterfactuals that are by definition never observed at the individual level. It has received some attention recently (e.g., [17], [28]) and this paper does extend the state of the art in my opinion. The main contribution is to leverage and preserve local similarity information in the deep learning representation process to estimate individual treatment effect. The approach is also able to balance the distributions of the control and treatment groups effectively.  The approach proposed by the authors is sound although the presentation of the methodology can be improved in my opinion. There are concepts introduced early on in the paper that only make sense a few page after (e.g., PDDM and MPDM). The paper could benefit from a more intuitive presentation of these concepts early on so that it does not let the reader hanging. Also, in section 2.3.3 line 170, I would recommend explaining further the structure of the loss function \cal{L}_{PDDM}.   The results presented by the authors are convincing. They have compared their approach against the state of the art and experiments are showing that that there SITE techniques does better than the current state of the art to estimate individual treatment effects.
