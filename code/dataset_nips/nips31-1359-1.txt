In this manuscript, the authors propose to infer causal relations from categorical observational data by assuming a two-stage causal discover process and finding a hidden compact representation of the cause. The manuscript also provides an effective solution to recover the compact representation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified in both synthetic and real-world data.  Overall, I highly appreciate the manuscript because of following strengths: 1. Causal discovery on categorical data is an important yet challenging problem to be addressed in the literature. 2. The approach is well motivated with an illustrating example. The writing and logic is clear. 3. The manuscript also shows that using the model, the causal direction is identifiable in the general case. 4. The experimental results are promising.  I have only several minor comments: 1. The manuscript should make it clear what the space of Y^{\prime} is. Is it also a categorial variable? I can not tell this when reading the first three pages. 2. Itâ€™s better to use some examples to help illustrate the identifiability part. 3. A brief introduction to the benchmarks is needed. What kind of data setting are they focusing on?
