The authors propose a procedure for identifying causal relationships between bivariate categorical data. In particular, they assume that the causal relationship can be explained by an intermediate lower dimensional representation.   Major Comments: 1) For the HCR to be identifiable, must |Y'| < |X|? If |Y'| = |X| = |Y| it seems that the model would be invertible, but the assumption that |Y'| must be strictly less than |X| is never given.  2) Perhaps I am missing something, but is Theorem 2 a direct implication of Theorem 1? There does not seem to be a proof provided. 3) For the Real-world data sets, it would be interesting to see if an exhaustive search over the |X|! partitions for f results in a different result than the greedy search.  Minor comments: Line 174: Strikethrough Line 177: "... and are 2000 samples for each pair" presumably refers to Figure 2(a) only as Figure 2(b) shows varying sample sizes  UPDATE: Thanks for the responses. Would be nice to see if the greedy vs exhaustive search differs in simulation study (not simply on a single data set), but not necessary and more of a "nice-to-have."  Interesting work and would like to see this at NIPS
