The paper discusses a faster algorithm for finding local minima in  non-convex problems. The authors provide   theoretical guarantees. They argue that as a byproduct thier rigorous results  could help in desiging novel algorithmic schemes.  This is a solid paper, incremental but still worth accepting (in my opinion). Other manuscripts provide almost equivalent results.
