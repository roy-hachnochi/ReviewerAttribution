Wasserstein distance is used to measure the difference between two probability measures and provides efficient tools for solving many problems in machine learning. In this paper, the authors propose a novel minimax framework for statistical learning with ambiguity sets given by balls in Wasserstein space and offer an interesting point of view for the domain adaptation problem [6]. The relation between the proposed method and the ordinary empirical risk minimization is discussed and the generalization bounds are derived in terms of covering number. The result is interesting and gives some insight in distributionally robust learning.
