The paper investigates a minimax framework for statistical learning where the goal is to minimize the worst-case population risk over a family of distributions that are within a prescribed Wasserstein distance from the unknown data-generating distribution. The authors develop data-dependent generalization bound and data-independent excess risk bounds (using smoothness assumptions) in the setting where the classical empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm is replaced by a robust procedure that minimizes the worst-case empirical risk with respect to distributions contained in a Wasserstein ball centered around the data-generating empirical distribution. The statistical minimax framework investigated by the authors resembles in spirit the one introduced in [9], where the ambiguity set is defined via moment constraints instead of the Wasserstein distance.  The paper is well-written, with accurate references to previous literature and an extensive use of remarks to guide the development of the theory. The contributions are clearly emphasized, and the math is solid. The need for a new statistical framework that replaces the goal to minimize the population risk with a worst-case population risk is well motivated in Section 2.1, and the example on domain adaptation with optimal transport motivates the use of the Wasserstein distance to define the ambiguity set.  The only remark I have is that there is a misalignment in terms of the theory developed by the authors, where the goal is to minimize the worst-case population risk, and the example provided on optimal transport, where the goal is to derive improved excess risk bounds with respect to the ordinary (i.e., not worst-case) population risk. I would encourage the authors to comment more explicitly in the main text on how the theory that they have developed in the previous sections (see Appendix E) is used to prove the ordinary excess bounds. In line 234 the authors write that the risk inequalities of Section 2 are used to prove the results of Theorem 4, which is not the case.
