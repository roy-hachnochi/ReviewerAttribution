This article provides a theoretical study of statistical inference over some discrete optimization models, namely the maximization of submodular problems with a cardinality constraints, encompassing a class of discrete probabilistic models. The paper is sound, well written and pleasant to read. The supplementary material is minimal but useful.  The authors claim their class is new and "rich" but fail to make a convincing case of the latter statement, instead revisiting fairly classical problems in their experimental section. Their first studied problem is monotone submodular, and so is relatively simple to optimize, and their second is a partition matroid, also simple.   I'm also wondering if NIPS is the correct venue for such an article. The connection to machine learning is somewhat tenuous, I believe the authors could have made a better effort for relevance in their experimental section.
