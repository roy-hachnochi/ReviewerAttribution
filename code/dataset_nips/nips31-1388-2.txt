In this paper, the authors study the problem of constrained log-submodular models and propose new variational inference algorithms. Overall, this is a good paper. Here are some detailed comments 1. I notice that this paper focus on facility location and weighted coverage functions and uses gradient methods, which is very similar to the analyses in [39] Karimi and Lucic 2017. Both papers get the same bound of e/(e-1). The authors have cited [39] but did not give enough comparison or discussion. Also, if the bound holds for weighted coverage functions, it is not necessary to discuss facility locations since the latter is a subclass of the former.  2. Is the theoretical upper bound e/(e-1) tight?  3. line 122- 125, in the definition of matroids, one statement is missing, i.e. \emptyset in I. 4. Line 63 has double “that”
