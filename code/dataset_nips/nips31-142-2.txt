The paper considers the interesting question of sparse lifting and shows that in some settings, given the same computational resources, the sparse lifting method outperforms dimensionality reduction methods.  The authors build on the ideas of [8] and show that in contrast to [8] which used random matrices, the "optimal" embedding based on even Frank-Wolfe procedure provides a better algorithm. The paper is well written and interesting.  One comment (for which the review was not more positive than its current rating) is the issue of error correcting codes. Is it the case that paper is showing that random codes (from random lifting) are not as good as designed codes (and in fact Frank-Wolfe would suggest some form of Linear program decodable codes). This need not be the case, but that discussion is warranted. At the same time, if error correcting codes were outperforming dimensionality reduction based embeddings, then that is still a valuable fact for researchers to know (and hence the positive rating).
