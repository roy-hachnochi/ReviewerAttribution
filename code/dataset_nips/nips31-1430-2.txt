The authors introduce a new NN layer capable of processing missing data. At the core of the new layer lies a generalized neuron activation function that operates over probability densities. To estimate the densities the authors consider other points in an input dataset that lie in the subspace of known coordinates of an example and apply a mixture of Gaussians model. What I find most interesting in this framework is the generalized activation function. Given the assumptions presented in the paper the analysis seems straightforward. The authors evaluate their method against a diverse array of baselines and demonstrate that it performs favorably compared to those.
