This paper introduces a a new, Gaussian-Process-based, model for Time-Series Modelling which takes safety regiouns into account. After an in-depth theoretical study, the bounds and "rule-of-thumbs" for setting the safety threshold are discussed. Finally, experiments on synthetic data and a Surrogate Model of the High-Pressure Fluid System are performed. Impressively, the method is better than random choice and the impact of the safety threshold is rather big.  However, the paper has several flaws. The approach is interesting and sounds novel to me, but it is not compared with other active learning algorithms. Especially in the experiments typical methods could have been taken into account. You could, e.g., have compared to [3] in the limited environment. Unfortunately, the paper suffers from many linguistic mistakes (word choice and grammar). It is wise to proof-read it if it gets accepted.
