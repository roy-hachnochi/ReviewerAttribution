The paper considers the question of optimizing the average of local non-smooth convex functions in a distributed network of computers. The study of distributed optimization algorithms is a relevant problem,  and the importance of this work consists in proposing the first optimal algorithm for decentralized distributed non-smooth convex optimization under a local regularity assumption. To achieve this goal, the authors combine an accelerated gossip step and a primal-dual algorithm. Moreover, the authors propose an almost optimal algorithm under a weaker global regularity assumption, which is based in a randomized smoothing step. The authors establish lower and upper bounds in complexity of both problems, which match for the local regularity assumption.   This paper is an important contribution as they are the first in establishing optimality in non-smooth distributed optimization, which is an important setting in modern applications. The result is achieved by combining existing tools in a clever manner. The paper is well written and easy to follow. I found the theoretical results well motivated and explained.
