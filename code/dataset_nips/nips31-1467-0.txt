I think this is a very well written paper. The approach presented aim at using an approximation in the case of Bayesian lasso and elastic net, so to speed up the standard Gibbs sampling. These two cases are difficult to be managed with other approximations, e.g. the Laplace approximation, because the likelihood is not double differentiable. The authors propose to use a stationary phase approximation such that the intractable normalising constant is expressed in terms of Fourier transform. This approximation reduce the computational costs of a standard Gibbs sampling, in particular in the presence of a large number of predictors.   The approach is well described within the available literature and the results, including advantages and disadvantages, are clearly presented. The approach is interesting, even if a set of saddle point equations have to be solved, and a balance exists between goodness of the approximation and computational speed.   I have few comments.   There is a focus on comparing the results with the maximum-likelihood coefficients: I do not understand completely this choice, since a Bayesian approach may be different in the context of variable selection.   I may have missed this part, but the setting of Figure 3 is not totally clear: how the true drug sensitivity is computed?  In the last part of Section 3, an insight on how to perform prediction is presented. However I do not agree that the focus of prediction is often an expected value. Is there a way to produce an evaluation of the uncertainty within this approach?
