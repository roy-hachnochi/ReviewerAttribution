In eq.(18) of Theorem 1, the author derives the formula by which the generalized partition function can be analytically approximated. However, in this theorem, the assumption C>0 has no meaning in machine learning and statistics, because, in the Bayesian LASSO and and similar methods, C contains many zero and almost zero eigenvalues. This is the central point in the research of LASSO. Even in such a case, several statistical methods for calculating the partition function have already be constructed. Neither the conventional Laplace approximation, Gaussian integral, nor saddle point approximation can be employed, however, the new algebraic and geometrical method gives us the answers.
