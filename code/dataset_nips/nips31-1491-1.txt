This paper considers factored bandits, where the actions can be decomposed into a cartesian product of atomic arms. The paper is clear and well-written.  The authors criticize the uniform playing of arms in rank-1 bandits. However, in TEA, the phase lengths are chosen to be equal to the size of the largest active set, and the arms are chosen uniformly at random from the active set in each dimension, so in expectation the arms along each dimension are played uniformly. Hence I wouldn't expect the sample complexity of TEA to be different from that of Rank1Elim for the rank-1 problem. In fact the authors comment that the sample complexity of TEA is higher than that of Rank1Elim, and argue that this is because TEA makes fewer assumptions. I would be interested in knowing if TEA can be modified to make the same strong assumptions as rank-1 bandits, and then compare it with rank1Elim.  Other minor comments: 1) T in line 5 of Algorithm 1 should be t; similarly for Algorithm 2.  *** After rebuttal *** My verdict is unchanged, and I understand that the main focus is finding the minimal assumptions under which learning is possible in the factored setup. However, I would like to see an analysis of TEA for the rank-1 case, that achieves similar or better regret bounds than the rank-1 paper.
