This paper introduces a new metric for quantifying the distance or difference between two dynamical systems.  The metric is a generalization of the principle angle metric, Martin's metric, and the Binet-Cauchy metric.  The primary innovation and fundamental insight of this paper is to formulate the metric as a ratio of reproducing kernels calculated on the orbits of two dynamical systems.   The idea is innovative indeed.    My suggestions to this paper are minor.  First, the authors ought to prove that the so-called ratio reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) metric satisfies the properties of a classical metric function, namely positivity (I believe Proposition 3.1 addresses this), symmetry, and the triangle inequality.  This is a minor clarification that would be easy to add.    Second, I would encourage the authors to improve the readability of the paper.  The overall flow of the paper is stymied by halting exposition and long strings of  unannotated mathematical displays.   I struggled to find the definition of the metric (the main point of the paper) on lines 89-93.  There were three distinct mathematical objects defined in that short span of space, but none of them are formally named or introduced.    The authors ought to emphasize the utility of their findings.  They clearly show their ratio "metric" generalizes prior metrics, but beyond that, it should be clarified what the practical utility is for this generalized metric.     Overall, the technical content of this paper is interesting and should be accepted eventually.
