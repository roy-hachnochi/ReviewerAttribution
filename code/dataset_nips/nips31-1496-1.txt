This submission proposes a High Fidelity Pose Invariant Model (HF-PIM) that combines the advantages of 3D and GAN based methods to frontalize profile faces.  Pros: -- A novel High Fidelity Pose Invariant Model (HF-PIM) is proposed to produce more realistic and identity-preserving frontalized face images with a higher resolution.  -- A method named ARDL is proposed to supervise the process of facial texture map recovering without using any 3D information.  Cons: -- Section 3.2 is a little hard to follow. If possible, please make this section more clear and easier to understood in the modified submission.  -- The authors claimed that "Exhaustive experiments on both controlled and uncontrolled environments demonstrate that the proposed method not only boosts the performance of pose-invariant face recognition but also dramatically improves high-resolution frontalization appearances." But in Table I, the mean accuracy of HF-PIM(Ours) seems much lower than the one of PIM.   -- The results (generated faces) of proposed method in Fig. 3 seems not symmetric. Is it possible to solve this problem?
