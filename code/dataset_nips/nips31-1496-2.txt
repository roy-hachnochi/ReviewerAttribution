This paper presents a method to produce realistic and identity-preserving frontalized face images with a high resolution. The proposed method combines the advantages of 3D and GAN based methods and frontalizes profile images via a novel facial texture fusion warping procedure. Through leveraging a novel dense correspondence field, the prerequisite of warping is decomposed into correspondence field estimation and facial texture recovering, which are well addressed by a unified deep network in an end-to-end manner. The authors also introduced Adversarial Residual Dictionary Learning to supervise facial texture map recovering without the need of 3D data. Thorough experimental results on Multi-PIE, LFW, IJB-A, and CelebA-HQ demonstrate that the proposed method not only boosts pose-invariant face recognition in the wild, but also dramatically improves the visual quality of high-resolution images. I believe this paper shows a promising approach to solve the face frontalization issue for pose-invariant face recognition that I have not seen elsewhere so far.   The paper is written clearly, the math is well laid out and the English is fine. I think it makes a clear contribution to the field and can promote more innovative ideas, and should be accepted.
