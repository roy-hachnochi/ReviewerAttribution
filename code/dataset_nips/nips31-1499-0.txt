The paper proposes to sample from constrained distributions by first mapping the original space into an unconstrained space and then using a Langevin sampler. When the potential in the new space is strongly convex, this approach gives a convergence speed for constrained spaces similar to that of unconstrained spaces.  The method is illustrated in Dirichlet and LDA models.   The paper is nicely written and the results interesting. A concern I have is that it is not clear which other constrained distributions admit a mirror map with an explicit strongly convex function W(y). For example, the important case of truncated (multivariate) Gaussians is not mentioned.
