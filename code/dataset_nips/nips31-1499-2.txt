This paper deals with the simulation of a distribution whose support is constrained to a set. This is an important problem that had not received a really satisfactory answer (the best known "generic" algorithms having dimensional dependencies making them quite unsuitable for large-dimensional model inference). This contribution uses the so-called mirror maps. The mirror maps may be used to transform a constrained problem into an unconstrained one, for which the standard sampling algorithm may be used. The graal is to find a transformation of the variables which is such that the resulting sampling problem is both unconstrained and convex or strongly convex. This will not, in general, be the case, but in the case where such property is satisfied, then the resulting algorithm directly inherits the nice mixing property of (strongly) convex optimization over the unconstrained domain (allowing to apply the SGLD or other variants). This might lead to an algorithm whose mixing rate scales linearly in the dimension. This is in particularly true for sampling the posterior distribution over the probability simplex. This is a very important example, with many potential applications. On the LDA, the proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the art  Minor comments: - Clearly, the paper was written very quickly and contains a very large number of typos, in some cases several in the same line  "theif rates are significantly worse than the unconstrained scenaria under the same assumtions"  - Theorem 1: the results are already stated (without a proof) in Section 2.2 (I have perhaps missed something)
