This paper studies the problem of achieving a regret scaled with the effective range of the losses in the bandit setting. Although it has been shown that it is impossible in the standard bandit setting, this paper proposes the second order difference adjustments algorithm (SODA) which achieves the goal when one random extra observation is available for each round in the bandit setting. Such result improves the previous one by Cesa-Bianchi and Shamir which requires the availability of the smallest loss for each round. More desirable, SODA is also proved to achieve constant expected regret in the stochastic setting, thus it automatically adapts between two regimes.  Other comments: 1. On line 210, equation numbers are missing. 2. In the proof of Theorem 1, line 192. The analysis about the 3rd term is missing: the expectation of this term is 0. 3. The ‘a’ In Equation (10) and ‘a’ in Equation (11) collide. Same on line 329.  4. There is still a gap between dependencies on K in the lower bound and in the upper bound. Any comment on it?
