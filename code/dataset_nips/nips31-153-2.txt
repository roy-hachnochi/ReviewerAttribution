This article considers a coupling approach to MC estimation, based upon the so-called K-optimality criterion to minimise the MSE over a class generated by a GP of kernel K. This is in slightly flawed from the beginning because obviously one doesn't want to sacrifice reductions in MSE for massive increases in costs. However, accepting this is a sensible way to go forward, a variety of possibly interesting theorems are presented about the idea and simulations given. Basically, this paper could be really quite interesting, if it were a long journal article where each aspect is clearly explained and considered. As it stands, to me, it feels like an unfocussed mess.
