The paper shows a new reduction from the Maximum Inner Produce Search problem to the Nearest Neighbor Search problem (NIPS). Basically, the idea is to group dataset points based on the length, and then within each bucket building an LSH data structure with separate parameters.  I like that this simple idea works decently in practice, however I have a few (somewhat serious) reservations about the paper.  1. First, this idea was known and used before, see, e.g., ProjectBall procedure in Figure 3 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01062.pdf . Definitely, this paper must be cited. On a related note, it's unacceptable not to cite any LSH paper beyond the usual Indyk Motwani reference (in particular, for multi-probe indexing scheme, one should cite https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02897 ).  2. The paper claims "We prove that NORM - RANGING LSH has lower query time complexity than SIMPLE - LSH", and then "We acknowledge that RANGE - LSH and SIMPLE - LSH are equivalent when all items have the same 2-norm. " I think this is extremely poor taste, and unacceptable scholarly standard.  3. The experiments can be done better. The authors just test optimized linear scan based on compact sketches instead of proper sub-linear time retrieval that is analyzed before. I think it's a bit weird to analyze one algorithm and then test another one.
