This paper focuses on learning Granger causality in Wold processes. Accordingly, a fast estimation approach based on MCMC is proposed.  Quality: This paper extends learning Granger causality in Hawkes point process to Wold processes, for the reason that Wold process has the Markovian structure. The simulation results are not complete. The authors claim that they compare with other three methods, but in Table 1 only the results from the proposed method are showed. Table 2 only shows the results compared with Hawkes-Cumulants, but not with the other two. Clarity: Overall, the presentation is ok.  Originality: The novelty of this paper is limited. It is an application of Granger causality to Wold process.
