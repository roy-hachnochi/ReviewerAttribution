Summary: This paper seeks to develop a computationally inexpensive method for a two-hypothesis test of networks.  Two tests are proposed, one for a large number of network replicates and one for a small number.  In these tests, theoretical asymptotic distributions for the test statistic are derived, providing an alternative to the myriad bootstrapped network comparison tests out there.  The referee recommends a weak acceptance. The derivation of asymptotic distributions is useful, although there are plenty of seemingly adequate comparison tests for networks of fixed size (see reference below).  The author does not adequately motivate his particular test.  For example, the IER model assumption, particularly given the motivation of brain networks, seems dubious.  Nonetheless, the results are theoretically interesting.  -Hypothesis testing for networks with theoretically known H0-distributions for the test statistic have been developed:   Minh Tang, Avanti Athreya, Daniel L. Sussman, Vince Lyzinski, and Carey E.  Priebe. A nonparametric two sample hypothesis testing problem for random dot  product graphs. E-print, arxiv.org, 2014. URL http: //arxiv.org/abs/   1409.2344.    -What about the problem of networks varying in size? The problem of comparing networks of fixed size, and even of fixed vertex set, seems well worn.  Spectral norms have known theoretical distributions and are also computationally cheap.  - What is the Tracy-Widom law?  As this is used in the statement of a main result, the author needs to at least sketch this.
