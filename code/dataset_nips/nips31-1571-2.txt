This paper presents NAIS-NET, a model of deep networks constructed from non-autonomous differential equations. The model is a cascade of blocks, each defined by a dynamic state system that is similar to the extended Kalman filter whose state is directly observed. The key differences from ResNet include the control variables u and the re-use of (A, B) parameters within a block. A major advantage of NAIS-NET is that control theory can be applied to enforce stability of each block so that a cascade of blocks can be trained efficiently without batch normalization.   Experimental results show that the NAIS-NET has improved generalization gap compared to ResNet.   The paper lacks a description of how the NAIS-NET is trained. The presentation can be improved.
