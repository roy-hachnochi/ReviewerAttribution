This paper proposed a graph structure based on the generative model for post inference of the latent variables. The proposed structure keeps the dependence and independence among latent variables, and tries to use connections as less as possible. The work is meaningful in inference of graphical model and the results are promising. I tend to accept this paper. Still some concerns are listed: 1. Definition 3 is confusing. 2.  In the experiments of section 3.1, What is the difference between the standard VAE inference (simply invert the edges of the graph) and the minimally faithful inverse of the VAE? The proposed method is only compared with the mean-field case, how about comparing with the standard VAE inference case (simply invert the edges of the graph)? 3. What is the dimension of the data used in section 3.2?  4. The proof for the correctness of the method is confusing.
