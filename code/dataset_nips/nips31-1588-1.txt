Targeting the problem of automatic amortized variational inference, the authors proposed a new graph inversion method named NaMI. Given a generative model, NaMI is proved to be capable of constructing a faithful, minimal, and natural inverse graph. Accordingly, NaMI is directly applicable to automatically provide the structure of the reference model in variational inference.  The proposed method could be of great use in complicated practical variational inference applications. The quality and clarity is fine. As far as I know, the proposed method is original.  Therefore, I vote for acceptance.
