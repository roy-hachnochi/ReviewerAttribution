The authors proposed an interesting approach, where a planning method, SOGBOFA, is used for solving general Marginal MAP (MMAP) problems over a graphical model. The MMAP problem can be NP-hard even on trees, thus relaxations are required in most cases. Then main contribution of the paper is to build a connection between belief propagation and SOGBOFA. Particularly it proves the equivalence between AROLLOUT (a module of SOGBOFA) and belief propagation over bayes networks. The authors show that for particular class of MMAP problem, SOGBOFA can be applied directly, while for general MMAP problem, the authors proposed a reduction algorithm to convert MMAP to maximum expected utility (MEU) problem,  and then solve the the problem via SOGBOFA.  The paper is mostly well-written, and the theory seems sound and convincing. I only have a bit concern about the technical detail.  Comparing to another variational inference based MMAP method, Mixed Product BP (MPBP), the proposed algorithm is based on belief propagation over Bayes networks, while MPBP is based on belief propagation over conditional random fields. In Bayes networks, we need not worry about the partition function since all factors are conditional distributions. However, for conditional random fields (CRF) when doing belief propagating we need take care of the partition function. Thus in BP over CRF we need some normalization factors. In Eq. (1) and (5), there is a normalization factor for Bayes networks, why do we need such a factor? I also would like to know what kind of graphs are used in the experiments, bayes network or CRF?  Minor suggestion: Draw Figure 2 with log-scaled time may results in a better look.
