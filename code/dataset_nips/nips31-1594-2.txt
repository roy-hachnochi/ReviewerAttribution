This article deals with the computation of dichotomies when the focus is on generalization performance in extreme regions (regions where the norm of the descriptions is large). The authors endow this topic with a theoretical framework. They introduce a variant of the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) inductive principle designed to select functions optimal in the extremes. An upper bound on their risks in the extremes is established for the case of function classes with finite VC dimension. This gives birth to a meta-algorithm of function selection (Algorithm 1). This algorithm is then applied to two classification methods: the random forest and the k-nearest neighbors. Two data sets are used: a synthetic one and a real-world one. Although limited, the experimental results appear promising.  The authors motivate clearly their contribution. The paper is well written and seems technically sound. A weakness is the choice of the VC dimension as capacity measure. With this restriction in mind, the choice of the two classifiers involved in the illustrative experiments is strange, since they can be seen as margin classifiers. A significant improvement would be to provide the reader with hints on the difficulties raised by the multi-class extension.
