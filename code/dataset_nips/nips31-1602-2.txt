This works considers the problem of importance sampling (IS), which is an important topic in multi-integration and Bayesian learning. I am not an expert on the area of importance sampling, but like to provide my comments based on my understanding of the paper:  1. The CLT established in Section 2 seems to be based on generating a sample point at a time. I think such a strategy would be the theoretical study more feasible, but seems to be not that practical in real use of IS.  2. Although the authors claim verifying the condition in Theorem, it is still not clear how to check this condition in the practical use of the proposed method.   3. The notation of this paper is not very clear. For example, the notation of m_{\theta} in eq (6) is not well defined.   4. The simulation study only considers the Gaussian case, which is not convincing since the Gaussian case is quite straight in IS.  5. There is no real data example to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.   6. The figures contains too many curves, which makes readers difficult to get the message from the figures.
