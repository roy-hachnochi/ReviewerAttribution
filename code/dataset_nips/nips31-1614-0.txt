This paper studies the nearest neighbor information estimator, aka the Kozachenko-Leonenko (KL) estimator for the differential entropy. Matching upper and lower bounds (up to log factor) are proven under a H\"older ball condition.  The paper is of high quality and clarity. The introductory and the technical parts are smoothly written, although I could not verify all the details of the proofs. References to the literature look great. Intuitions are given along the way of the presentation.  There are two significant theoretical contributions. First, estimating the entropy becomes significantly harder when the density is allowed to be close to zero. A previous work I am aware of that handles this situation is [Han, Jiao, Weissman, Wu 2017] that uses sophisticated kernel and polynomial approximation techniques, while this works shows that the simple KL estimator achieves similar effect (albeit under other different assumptions). Second, the KL estimator does not use the smoothness parameter $s$, so it is naturally adaptive and achieves bounds depending on $s$.  A couple of minor comments are in the sequel. When introducing the quantity $R_{i,k}$, it should be clearly stated what ``distance between $X_i$ and its $k$-nearest neighbor" means here. This might be too much beyond the scope of the paper, but do you have results for the KL estimator under the more general Lipschitz ball condition [HJWW17]?
