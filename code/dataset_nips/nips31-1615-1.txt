In this paper deep reinforcement learning is developed for the purpose of controlling an event process governed by a marked point process.  The point process has 2 types of marks, a feature mark and a reward/feedback mark.  The neural network model for the intensity is a three layer recurrent neural network.  The paper is well written and the model outperforms several benchmarks on spaced repetition and smart broadcasting tasks.  There has been some past work on RNN models of point processes and reinforcement learning for parametric Hawkes processes, but no work to date that combines the two approaches.  It might have been good to compare to the parametric model in [7], but I'm not sure if that code is open sourced.  The authors have included their code (with the intent of open sourcing the code), so that is a plus.    The authors do indicate that they will add several baselines before the final version is due.  This will improve the paper.  If the reinforcement learning point process is not one, I would suggest this as future work.  Another weakness of the work is the assumption of the exponential form of the intensity.  The authors have also indicated they will investigate relaxing this assumption in future work.
