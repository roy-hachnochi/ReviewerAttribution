- Novelty is below the NIPS level. The claim of using the DST theory was stated in the beginning (L36) as: achieving a "richer" representation. I did not see through the rest of the paper why this is a "richer" representation.   - The experiments are rigorously performed and analysed. They well serve the cause of the paper.   - The text in the introduction is trying to be too verbose for a scientific paper at this level. There is no need for that in my opinion. An example is: "All these (no longer) futuristic ... Are they futuristic or are they not? I'd go in favour of a more rigorous and unequivocal (and still eye-catching) presentation style.   - L85: 13]. "Hence, it allows one to use the principles of evidential theory to quantify belief masses and uncertainty through a well-defined theoretical framework.": Ok, but why is using the principles of evidential theory preferred? A Dirichlet can be used without resorting to this theory, i.e. in a Bayesian setting. The motivation can be a bit clearer here too (in the beginning of Section 3, I mean).  - There are some grammar mistakes and typos. Examples include:   -- L64: "The consequence is then unreliability of ..."  -- L75: "our approach proposed in this paper ..."  - L22: Who said that the "saturation" is "fast approaching"? I mean are there citations demonstrating that? Or is that just a speculation?
