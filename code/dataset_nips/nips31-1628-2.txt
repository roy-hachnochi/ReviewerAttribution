The paper proposes a generic way to stack Bayesian nonparametric models for deep learning. The idea is to use a Gamma process to express necessary hyperplanes together with their weights. Thus one layer looks like a noisy-or model. To stack multiple layers, the author proposes a forward selection method. To add a layer, they pass the linear predictors for each hyperplane to the next layer and double the predictors by flipping the output. The result shows BNP method can autpmatically learn economic representation of neural networks. This paper is very well written and it does not seem formidable to look into the details of their model.  It is non-trivial to make deep generative models work at a level shown in the paper. Still I think Gibbs sampling can be slower than automatic differentiation methods. I wonder how Gibbs sampling works when your network depth become large?  A relative line of work on using mixture of experts are mixtures of generalized linear models (such as logistic regression), where the mixing distribution is modeled as a Dirichlet process. For example, there's a paper named "Dirichlet process mixtures of generalized linear models". How do you compare your noisy-or model with those methods, for one layer and the potential to stack multiple layers?  I like this paper. It has a solid contribution to (nonparametric) Bayesian deep learning. And it provides a novel way to do model compression for deep learning via Bayesian methods.
