The authors proposed a new unitary regularization approach for complex-weighted networks and demonstrate that it performs best in robustly inverting the fibres transmission matrix. In general, the problem statement is clear and appropriate for deep learning application.  - The authors show the model comparison with different regularization. However, it would be good to compare with the other existing models, i.e., machine learning model, deep learning (like GANs) or physics-based model before they claim world-leading performance.  - The proposed methods use two models, complex transformation, and autoencoder convnet. However, it is not clear to train autoencoder here. Denoising autoencoder is typically using raw images with adding noise and reconstruct the raw images. However, it is not clear how to train two models (i.e., complex transformation and autoencoder convnet) - Although the authors claim the proposed models fit well with the physical theory but it is not fully described. Further detailed information is required, for instance, complex-valued analogues, the relation between real and imaginary part in terms of training accuracy, etc.
