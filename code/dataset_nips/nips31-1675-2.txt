This paper proposes a method for a convolution sparse coding (CSC) for multi-variate signals. The problem is relaxed by imposing a rank-1 constraint on the dictionary and optimized by iterative steps to solve locally greedy coordinate descent. The method runs efficiently and is applied to characterize MEG signals from the brain which results in identifying different shaped signals in the same frequency bands.   The paper is quite well written and here are some of my concerns. 1. The intuition why rank-1 constraint is used and why this would yield a good result is not well explained.  2. Label for y-axis in Fig. 1 a) and c) are missing.  3. There needs to be more description on datasets in the experiment. E.g., what is MEG data and why is it measured? What is the sample size?  4. Does the findings in the experiment have any relationship with existing literature in neuroscience? Is there any clinical justification or interpretation?
