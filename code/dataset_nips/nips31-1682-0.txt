This paper presents a method to generate a route given its textual description. The idea is to use the standard sequence  to sequence model to learn a mapping between descriptions and corresponding routes. To handle the limited data problem with description and routes, authors train another model for mapping routes to description; and the generate synthetic data from sampled routes. This synthesized data along with the actual data is used to train the model.  While the paper addresses an interesting problem, the novelty of the method is limited. The paper uses standard sequence-to-sequence models with nothing specific to the domain or the task. Using the speaker model to generate synthetic data is straightforward. Despite the simplicity of the approach, I am actually impressed with results, especially by the ablation study. It is interesting to see the improvement by progressively adding new components.  My other comments are towards writing and explanation.  There is lot of redundancy in the paper and that space can be better used to explain implementation and experiments in detail. I believe that we are not "generating" routes, rather selecting them from a fixed dictionary. What does that dictionary made of? How is that dictionary able to generate routes for the environment that are unseen. If we are generating routes then it has to be made clear.  Furthermore, the evaluation method is not clear. How do we know whether we are within a certain range of the goal. Does the data come with geolocation annotations? This has to be made clear.  Overall the clarity of the paper can be improved. The paper lacks originality however the results are interesting. === I have read the authors' response and modified my reviews accordingly.
