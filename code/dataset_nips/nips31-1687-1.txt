SUMMARY: the paper argues that incorporating inequality aversion (dislike to be advantageous or dislike to be disadvantageous) into the Markov games improves the long-term outcome for social groups  STRENGTHS: -- The aversion concept is theoretically interesting and the authors show how it can be incorporated into Markov games -- The paper is well-written. It   WEAKNESSES: -- There are no theoretical results.  -- Experimental results do not convincingly show that inequality aversion will generally improve the outcome beyond selected games in selected settings. The results seem cherry-picking to me. -- When there are multiple players, the space of strategies become exponentially large. It is not clear that such a big space has been explored systematically yet.   ----------------------------------- After the author's rebuttal ----------------------------------- I'm sorry for a delayed response. I agree with R1 that the heuristics in this paper can be applied to a wide range of problems. I adjusted my score accordingly.  I read the author's rebuttal, and really like the new introduction, as the motivation of this paper is much clearer. I am a bit confused however why it makes sense to model the Schelling diagram as a linear function of the number of other cooperators.
