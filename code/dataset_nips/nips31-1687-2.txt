This paper propose a model for the behavior of agents facing inter temporal social dilemmas. They found that inequity aversion resolve the intertemporal social dilemmas, i.e., agents in social dilemmas are able to find cooperative solutions with inequity aversion.  This paper study an interesting and challenging problem in the field, and improves the prior works in different aspects as explained in the following. To model agents behavior it uses the multi-agent reinforcement learning in partially observable games presented in [40,41], and to learn the policies it uses the deep neural network introduced in A3C [42], but incorporate the subjective reward besides the regular rewards. This subjective reward is defined by their inequity aversion model, which is the generalization of the inequity aversion model [10] in static matrix games to the  sequential multi-agents games. They also formally defined the “sequential social delimma”, extending the definition of [17] which is for 2-player games and based on payoff matrix, but here it is defined based on Schelling diagram. Finally, in the experiments they show that inequity aversion improves agents cooperation in some example multi-person games with social dilemma (according to their conditions in sec 2.3).
