The authors develop a new way of accelerating the coordinate descent method by using the spectral decomposition of the gradient matrix and conjugate direction. I personally think that this approach is interesting and has potentials in solving large scaled problems. Apart from a linear rate, they show that this rate is independent of the condition number, which I find it very interesting.  However, from what I am seeing, the main results of this paper could only be applied for the smooth minimization problem. It would be nice if the authors could confirm about some of their extensions for non-smooth optimization.
