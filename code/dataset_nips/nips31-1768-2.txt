Short summary: In this paper, the authors consider the problem of estimating the derivative of a regression function based on difference quotients in random design - previous methods either assumed fixed design or did not use difference quotients. More specifically, based on the assumption that the $n$ design points are uniformly distributed, an estimator in the form of a weighted sum of difference quotients is proposed and analysed. The authors focus on the order of its bias and variance with respect to $n$ and an additional parameter $k\leq n/2$ of the method to understand its asymptotic behaviour. They also propose a strategy for choosing $k=k(n)$ such that the method's AMISE is small. Furthermore, it is explained that the natural extension to higher order derivatives (in a recursive manner) is not worthwile since it results in a non-consistent estimator. The authors describe how the method can be applied in the situation where the design points are not uniformly distributed (through the integral transform method) - in practice, estimating the derivative then requires the preliminary step of estimating this distribution. Finally, simulation results are provided - in the experiments, the performance of the new estimator is similar to the performance of two previously known techniques.  Comments: I enjoyed reading this paper since it is well-written, well-structured and the proofs are relatively easy to follow. The results appear technically sound and original. Moreover, the paper's contribution to the field is discussed in a very honest manner. However, I do have two minor remarks: (i) I would appreciate an intuitive interpretation of the weights from equation (6): At first sight, it is surprising that the weights are growing with $j$ since you expect "better information" the closer you are to $U_{(i)}$. (ii) For asymptotic statements, you typically require that $n,k\rightarrow\infty$ in a certain sense (which is of course reasonable); however, I feel that some clarification of the role of $i$ is warranted: since $k\leq i-1$, you also need $i\rightarrow\infty$. This could be important, for instance, in Corollary 1. Clearly, the main concern about the paper would be its significance: one could argue that the paper does not provide a new method which outperforms previous methods in a general sense and that no novel theoretical tools are introduced. However, I feel that it is worthwile investigating the performance of the natural quantity - difference quotients - in a random design setting and that the analysis is interesting in its own right. Hence, especially in light of the positive aspects mentioned above, I would like to see this paper published.
