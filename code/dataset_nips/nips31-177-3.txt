Report on "An Efficient Pruning Algorithm for Robust Isotonic Regression"  The paper deals with the problem of isotonic regression and proposes efficient strategies for solving the non convex optimisation problem efficiently, by applying dynamic programming on a sparse grid of x values, appropriately chosen. In practice the proposal boils down in being more efficient in computational time with respect to other methods. Theoretical results and examples are provided to support the idea of the paper. However, there is no comparison on real-life data. Overall the paper is well-written and the results seem sound.  My, perhaps obvious questions/comments are:  (a) I read this paper as "we propose a method for solving a problem that has practical applications", but the authors have shown us some theoretical results and a simulation study but no application on real-life data is provided. I believe that an application to data is needed in order to fully convince the reader that the method is practically useful.   (b) Could you say something about higher dimensions? Is it applicable to two-dimensional problems? Does it scale with the dimensionality of y?   Minor issues - in the Abstract, I found the sentence "A simple dynamic programming approach allows us to 4 solve this problem to within ?-accuracy (of the global minimum) in time linear 5 in 1/? and the dimension" difficult to read and understand at first read. - l. 35 "a equally-spaced" should read "an equally-spaced". - l. 53 "a interval efficiently" should read "an interval efficiently."
