The paper presents a method for joint source separation and localization based on probabilistic modelling of inter-microphone phase differences and Bayesian inference.   The probabilistic method presented for time-frequency mask estimation follows a very similar strategy in several well-known source separation algorithm such as DUET and MESSL. The garbage source idea was also used in MESSL. The novelty of the proposed method is very limited.   The results shown in Figure 3 does not show clear advantage as compared with the baseline methods.   The subplots in the second line of Figure 2 are not clearly explained. What do you mean by the positions of the sources, what are the horizontal and vertical axes, and how were the plots obtained?   There are commonly used performance index for source separation, such as SDR, SIR etc. Why not using these metrics?
