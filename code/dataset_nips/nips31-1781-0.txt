This paper introduces a new approach to active learning for pairwise preference aggregation. This new approach, Hybrid-MST, appears to be competitive with some existing approaches and superior to others.   Overall, the paper has two main weaknesses: - at times, it is fairly difficult to read - the interpretation of empirical results is not as clear-cut as it should  In terms of paper organization, the introduction offers a good example of how the paper could be improved. Instead of a 1.5 page intro that includes a 1-page of literature review, this reviewer suggests the following alternative organization: - a 4-paragraph introduction that presents in an intuitive manner the why/what/how/main-results (WHY is this paper important? WHAT are you trying to solve (including one real-world motivating domain)? HOW do you solve the problem? in a nutshell, what are your MAIN RESULTS?). This structure would help the reader to go in depth in the remainder of the paper - a second section consisting in a traditional Related Work section Last but not least, it would also help to polish a bit the quality of the prose.  In terms of the interpretation of the results, I would definitely like to see a discussion way beyond the paragraph between lines 247 and 253. When should one use Hybrid-MST and when Hodge-active? It would be great if the authors could provide more insights on this topic.    Similarly, in Figure 3, in the left-most graph (Kendall), we have Hybrid-MST underperform Hodge, while in the mid-graph (PLCC) it is the other  way around. What does this mean in terms of practical applicability? Why & when should we use one or the other?
