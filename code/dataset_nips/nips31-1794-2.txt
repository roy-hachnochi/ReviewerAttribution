The paper presents a new method, S2N, to detect segments of interest in a video sequence. The authors propose an RNN-based architecture to predict the segment boundary. The authors, borrowing the idea from the pointer network, design the SDU, which predicts the pointers to the start, end positions and a confidence score of the segment based on the hidden states. The earth moverâ€™s distance loss is proposed for training S2N. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on action proposal generation and video summarization.  Pros: + The paper presents two novel components: 1) using the SDU and 2) applying the EMD loss on segment detection.  + The method achieves state-of-the-art on two applications.   Cons: - No careful ablation study: especially what is the performance of the method using the proposed loss as opposed to some other loss functions such as cross entropy or l2 loss. How does the assignment strategy influence the performance? - No the computational time comparison with the baselines.  Minor: Repeated citation: [9] and [10]  I lean to accept the paper with the novel contributions and the good results, but I would like to see the above concerns being addressed in the rebuttal.  My main concerns are addressed in the author response. I recommend to accept the paper.
