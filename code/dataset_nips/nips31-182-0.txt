The paper studies the connection between sparsity of linear classifier as well as deep neural networks and their robustness against adversarial attacks. Based on the two new introduced metrics, the authors show that sparse deep neural network are more robust against l_2 and l_inf attacks compared to their dense counterparts. Interestingly, in the linear case the behavior is differently, where sparsity helps against l_inf attacks but it seems that dense models are more robust against l_2 attacks.  I think the paper offers some interesting new insights both theoretically and empirically into adversarial robustness of deep neural networks and how it is connected to sparsity. Even though it is maybe not surprising that sparsity helps to make models more robust, given Occam's razor, the paper sheds a new light in the case of adversarial attacks. I do not have any major comments, however, to allow for a better understanding of the paper, the authors could clarify the following points:  1) The author only consider pruning to make model sparse. How would the empirical insights translate to other methods for sparsity, such as l2 or l1 regularization?  2) How are the results connected to the bias-variance-tradeoff?  3) Do the insights also translate to regressions?
