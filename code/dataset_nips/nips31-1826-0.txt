This paper proposes a novel GAN formulation that allows a GAN to learn discriminative and compact binary codes for image patches. Using (hand designed) binary descriptors has quite some tradition in computer vision. Binary descriptors have several attractive properties, eg. compactness, fast implementation etc.   Using GANs for this purpose is not new (as nicely explained in the paper). The novelty of the method is that it employs two regularization terms that allow weighting of the importance of dimensions with the correlation and to propagate the distances between high and low dim. spaces. This leads to good results and compact codes. So overall this is minor but importnat contribution.   Overall the paper is well written and has a clear contribution. My main concerns are that the paper does not explain how to set the hyperparameters. In addition, the experiments are performed on moderately sized databases. An additional large-scale experiment on eg. one of the huge databases for city-scale reconstruction would show how the method scales.
