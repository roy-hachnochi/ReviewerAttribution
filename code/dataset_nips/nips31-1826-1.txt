This paper proposes to convert the intermediate layer of the GAN discriminator to low dimensional binary representation, which then can be used for retrieval. Direct quantization of the low dimensional layer is not very informative. In order to preserve the distance information between sample pairs, the author proposes to transfer the distance information from a higher dimensional layer.  Quality and clarity: The paper is well written and easy to follow. It is also easy to reimplement given the math expressions. The author explains the motivation of the regularization terms and the improvements over previous works. The experiments clearly shows that the proposed method is better than previous methods. (I'm not very familiar with relevant literature, i.e. how hard it is to beat sota in these tasks.)  Originality and Significance: This method is based on the GAN framework to do unsupervised training, the originality comes from the regularizations proposed in this paper. It is original in this sense. Despite the good performance shown, the regularizations proposed in this paper are combination of empirical losses. The fact that each of the terms needs a hyperparam makes it relatively unappealing. The theoretical value and possible extension is relatively weak.
