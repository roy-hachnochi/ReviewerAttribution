 My main concern is the novelty of the work if we look at it from an ensemble learning perspective. I understand the main point of the work is to examine a 'new' way of decomposing an existing DNN to understand why it works. Unfortunately I don't think the paper has really answered that question.   My point is (deep) neural network can be flexible enough to simulate most of the current ensembling strategies/topologies, so it can be designed to overfit or underfit on these small datasets based on what we want it to do. Random forests use bagging (as regularization) to find a reasonable good diversities between overfitted trees in order to get good prediction performance. Same, if DNN could somehow balance overfitted subnets and do a smart ensemble at the final layers, it will reduce the chance of overfitting of the whole network. It is still bias and variance reduction I think, so can we really claim DNN can generalise on small dataset? Probably not.    I believe this is a solid work to confirm that if proper DNN topologies are used, deep neural networks don't have to overfit small datasets.
