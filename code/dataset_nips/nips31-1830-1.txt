The paper proposes a method (based on Frank-Wolfe or projected gradient) that, using second-order information (Hessian), escapes saddle points of a smooth non-convex optimization problem subject to a convex set $\mathcal{C}$. The results rely on the feasibility of finding an approximate solution to a quadratic program in polynomial time. Under this requirement, and reasonable assumptions, the method is shown to converge to an approximate second-order stationary point. The results are also extended to a stochastic setting.  Convergence to a second-order stationary point of first order methods was previously studied in the unconstrained case. This paper is one of the first (or probably the first) to consider a convex constraint case, in the particular case where the minimization of a quadratic loss over such set is feasible.  The results of this paper are interesting and correct to the best of my knowledge. Thus, I recommend the paper for publication, provided the authors improve the manuscript as described below.  0. The results of this paper are only proved for projected gradient or Frank-Wolfe methods. Therefore, the authors should not claim that they provide a "general framework" for finding second order stationary points. I recommend that this should be corrected throughout the paper.  1. Overall, I suggest a thorough proof read of the text.  2. In the entire paper, replace "an SOSP" to "a SOSP".  3. line 43: Proposoed  4. line 44: "advances in constant-factor optimization for nonconvex quadratic programs": a citation is appropriate. Which advances? Based on which works? These are also not cited in related work.  5. line 92: arbitrary small -> arbitrarily small 6. Proposition 1 is well-known and trivial. The author should cite a reference in the statement, such as Bertsekas 1999, and call it a Theorem instead of Proposition.  7. Why stating the definition of strict saddle (Definition 1) if this is nowhere used? Maybe citing a reference is enough for the unconstrained case, and leave Definition 3 for clarity.  8. Definition 2. I suggest starting the statement as ... Let $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a twice continuously differentiable function, and let $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be closed and convex. Then, $x^*$ is called an ...  9. line 145: I.e. should be ", i.e." with a comma not a period after FOSP. This should also be corrected in several other parts of the manuscript.  10. line 154: why using OPT instead of simply $q(u^*)$ to denote the optimal objective value.  11. line 261: use Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP)  12. Replace Proposition 5 by Theorem 5  =====  I apologize in suggesting the authors to replace "an SOSP" to "a SOSP", which may be wrong. Please, keep the original "an SOSP" or double check which one is correct. It is kind of confusing because if you read the abbreviation how it sounds then you should use "an" because of the "S -> Ess", however, without abbreviation one would say "a Second Order Stationary Point". Thus, I'm still confused which way is correct. Maybe both?
