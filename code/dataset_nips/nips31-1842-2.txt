Main Idea:  This paper proposes a new subsampling algorithm for a wide range of models. The authors show that the optimal subsampling problem can be reduced to subsampling of univariate mean by utilizing influence functions. The authors show that the proposed method is asymptotically optimal in terms of variance. The authors show how the approach can be used to several popular models including linear regression, quantile regression and generalized linear model. Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrates the superiority compared to state-of-the-art baselines.  Strength: 1. The authors provide an interesting and important insight that optimal subsampling can be reduced to subsampling of mean by utilizing influence function. This finding is innovative. 2. The proposed method has wide applications to several popular models. 3. The authors provide both theoretical optimality guarantee and empirical evidence on the superiority of the proposed method.  Weakness: 1. The authors describe methods for accelerating influence function computation. It is better if the authors can include comparison of running time for the proposed method and the baselines in the experiments. 2. The proposed method requires a pilot estimation of the parameter. It is not clear how the pilot estimation is carried out in the experiments. Also, it is interesting to see how the pilot estimation accuracy impacts the performance of the subsampling algorithm.
