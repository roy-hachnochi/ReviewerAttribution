This paper studies an adaptive sampling algorithm for online FDR control. Sample complexity bounds for the same algorithm is provided, where the sample complexity is defined as the smallest time after which an FDR-\delta/FWER-\delta algorithm becomes TPR-\delta or FWPD-\delta. The algorithm is simulated on synthetic data-sets.   Overall review: I think the paper is well-written and the theoretical sections are relatively easy to follow. I vote for acceptance but I have some concerns about the experimental evaluation.   1. The second panel of the experiment has |H_1| = 2 << n which is an extreme instance. Then in the third panel |H_1| = O(n). It would be interesting to consider problem instances  between these two extremes where |H_1| = n^{\beta} for different values of \beta. The only experiment where \Delta_i's are non-uniform is the last panel and there |H_1| is O(n). I believe experimental results for different intermediate regimes (\beta) should to be provided in which the Delta_i's are non-uniformly (either randomly or deterministically generated).   2. The algorithm should not be denoted as UCB, as this creates confusion w.r.t to the UCB-1 algorithm for K-armed bandits.   3. The algorithm SE should be included in the main body of the paper, as it is not obvious what the successive elimination strategy is in this context. More over there are many algorithms for best arm identification in the fixed confidence setting (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04589, https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7308 etc). I would like to hear the author's thoughts on whether all of them can be adapted for the problem and if so should they be compared with (if implementation is available)?  4. It seems that [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05391.pdf] is very relevant and should be compared with.   5. lines 128-129: "Finally, as a direct consequence of the theoretical guarantees proven in this work .... an algorithm faithful to the theory was implemented and is in use in production at a leading A/B testing platform." It would be great if the authors include the results of these experiments (at least qualitatively) in the paper, rather than just stating that such an algorithm was implemented.
