This is a well-written, detailed paper on an important topic. The paper seeks to decompose sources of discrimination into spurious, direct and indirect effects. It strengthens connections between the causal literature on direct effects to the literature on discrimination in classification by connecting to the notion of Equalized Odds.  Specific comments:  (1) It is not clear what is the overall goal here. Other papers e.g. Nabi and Shpitser talk about trying to remove the effects of "unfair" pathways. Are there specific pathways that the authors think are "unfair"? Why does it make sense to condition on y?  This is done in the EO measure, but is that a good idea? Some contrast relating conditional vs. marginal measure would be useful.  (2) There is a close connection between what are called in this paper "conditional" counterfactual effects and papers on the effect of treatment on the treated. Also effects in strata defined by post-treatment outcomes. For example: Marshall M. Joffe (2002) Using information on realized effects to determine prospective causal effects. https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9868.00311  (3) The authors in some places suggest that the model in Figure 1(b) represents a canonical graph for this problem. This is inaccurate because the SCM here presumes that there are no unobserved variables (so that the U terms are independent). In general there could be unobserved latent variables giving rise to confounding between any pair of variables in X,Z,Y,M. (hat{Y} is not confounded since it is a function of predictors that are, by construction, observed.)  (4) Lines 122-124: The authors say that additional evidence (Y=y) mean that "the original causal diagram no longer captures in an explicit fashion all the underlying mechanisms that relate X and hat{Y}" This seems to be a category mistake: the presence of additional evidence can induce (probabilistic) independence or dependence but it does not change mechanisms!  To address this, the authors suggest modifying the causal diagram (line 126). It is not clear why one couldn't just condition on y and use d-separation/connection as usual. (As noted, it seems a conceptual error to think of information changing a causal process.)  (5) In the definition of conditional causal model why is M_e required. Note that in the subsequent definitions interventions are on x_0 and x_1, while the "evidence" is just x (which could be some other value that is not x_0 or x_1).  Related: why are the potential outcomes in (1), (2), (3) subscripted by "e" (or "y"). Why does it make sense to consider intervening on e or y (since this is a response (that doesn't directly affect hat{Y}. Could this be left out as a subscript / intervention here? (Obviously e or y need to be conditioned on.) I guess the text at lines 144-145 makes the point that these could be omitted - though it seems there is an error here (see below) - but this doesn't explain why they were included in the first place!  (6) Lines 233-236: The authors suggest that direct and indirect effects could be learned from a randomized experiment. Though true of "controlled direct effects", this is not true of "natural" direct and indirect effects  such as (1) and (2) that involve nested counterfactuals y_{x1,.. W_{x0}}.   J. Robins and T.S.

Causality and Psychopathology: Finding the Determinants of Disorders and their Cures, pp. 1-52.   http://www.csss.washington.edu/Papers/wp100.pdf  As noted by Robins & Richardson, the assumption of independent errors in an SCM is not empirically testable via randomized experiments (since it implies independence of cross-world counterfactuals such as W(x0) and Y(x1,w).  Minor comments: line 3 Hartz et al is not in the Bibliography. [Hardt et al??] line 43 functions => function lines 144-145. "Since Y is a non-descendant node of W, hat{Y}, it has no effect in the counterfactuals before the conditioning bar in the factors of Eq.1"  this should be: Since W, hat_{Y} are non-descendants of Y... no effect *on*...  it is also a bit hard to follow because Y doesn't show up in these terms, it seems implicitly e=Y here (?)  line 155: defender => defendant (?)

In the context of this real data example why would one believe that the conditions in Theorem 2 apply (i.e. ctf explainability). Is it reasonable to assume there are no unmeasured confounders?  ==================================================  The authors reply:  "3. Conditional Causal Models (R3) The conditional causal model does not modify the existing causal mechanisms, but only highlights the spurious and causal pathways that are not distinguishable by d-separation in the (standard) original causal model."  This sounds reasonable, but it is *not* in keeping with the text in the original paper. Specifically, lines 122-127 in the original paper say the following:  "This phenomenon exposes that, whenever an additional evidence is provided (Y = y), the original causal diagram no longer captures in an explicit fashion all the underlying mechanisms that relate X and hat{Y} We propose a simple modification of the causal diagram to account for the aforementioned extra mechanisms arising due to conditioning."   My guess is that the word "mechanism" here is the source of the problems. This suggests changing the "underlying" SCM. I think that if the authors replaced this with "active pathways" it would have caused much less confusion.
