This work provides novel analysis techniques to understand Asynchronous Momentum Stochastic Gradient Descent through the particular non-convex problem of streaming PCA. Their analysis technique is novel but the paper seems to be "nearly the same" as another submission (4980) to the degree that abstract, introduction, and several theorems are exactly same. 4980 solves the problem of Momentum Stochastic Gradient Descent while this paper adds asynchrony to it, but that only changes one step in the analysis and the rest is just the same. Given one of the two papers, the other one just follows with the same theorems and results. The asynchronous case might just have been a corollary to the paper 4980. The experiments of the two papers are different though. But the novelty of the paper is in theory and not in experiments, so I wouldn't place much weightage on them being different.   As it is that the space of non-convex problems is vast, this work (both 4980 and 1861) provides good intuition on the role of momentum for this particular non-convex optimization. It shows how momentum helps escape saddle points but slows down convergence near the global minima. They use an ODE approach to show that if not initialized at saddle points or minima, the algorithm converges to the global minima. Next, they use an SDE based approach to characterize the local behavior around the global minima. This paper uses some new analysis techniques and gives valuable insight into non-convex optimization, at least for this particular problem.   I would recommend, that if accepted, the authors merge the contributions of 4980 as a corollary. Also, there are several works that have pointed out the similarity of asynchronous SGD with momentum SGD (e.g. "Asynchrony begets momentum" Mitliagkas et al. 2016) and the subsequent citations on asynchronous SGD analysis. Authors are recommended to clarify the assumptions on asynchronous SGD analysis in relation to those works.
