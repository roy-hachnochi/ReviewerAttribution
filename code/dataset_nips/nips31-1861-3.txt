This is a note from the area chair handling submissions 1861 and 4980.  These two papers were flagged as a possible dual submission by our automatic checker. The reviewers who read them also noticed very high overlap between the submissions, including motivation, technical tools and results.  Given this very high overlap, the authors should have considered submitting a single version of the work, and not two papers which apparently violate NIPS dual submission policy, and are an ethical violation (see https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/PaperInformation/AuthorGuidelines). Note that the policy allows NIPS program chairs to reject all NIPS submissions by all authors of dual submissions, not just those deemed dual submissions.  If the authors can make a very convincing case as to why these two submissions are sufficiently different, they should do so in the rebuttal (e.g., why is 4980 not a special case of 1861 with tau=0). Note that differences in empirical evaluation, or minor differences in presentation or emphasis, will not be accepted as an explanation.    Note that the papers may of course be also rejected on grounds of their content, and you should address all other comments by the reviewers.   *** After the author response. I still think these two submissions are ethically dubious, but willing to accept 1861 which is more general than the other one. The authors should merge the results into a single paper.
