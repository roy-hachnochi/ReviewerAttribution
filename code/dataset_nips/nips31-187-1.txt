Summary: The authors propose a new VQA model that combines gated object features provided by bottom-up attention. The object features are gated using the question feature and combined multiple times forming compound object features. It achieves the state of the art performance on multiple VQA benchmarks.  Strength: 1. The biggest strength is the outstanding performance. It consistently outperforms previous approaches. 2. The idea of the interaction between objects is interesting. Applying such technique multiple times is also well-motivated.  Weakness and questions: 1. It seems like the model is not capable of handling the interaction between compound objects since the model only merges the compound objects with the initial objects in Eq. (7). Does the model somehow handle such cases? 2. I am not convinced to call the procedure of computing R^{(t)} as relational reasoning because the model only elementwise-sums the gated object features. The resulting feature R^{(t)} can only contain the element-wise linear combination of the initial object features for any time t.  3. Reusing the gating networks for multiple time steps is not intuitive. Since both gating networks for computing R^{(t)} using the weights W_{l_1}, W_{l_2}, W_{r_1}, W_{r_2} takes the question as its only input, the same gating weights G_l and G_r would be obtained at every time step.  In authors' rebuttal, I would like to see the answers to the above points in weakness. Especially, I believe that clear answers to the second and third points are necessary for the technical novelty of the paper.  After the rebuttal phase: I thank the authors for the rebuttal answering all my questions. The rebuttal mainly presents empirical results to show that the proposed method performs better than the methods in the questions. However, I am still not fully convinced by their arguments as there are many possible ways to incorporate such concepts (eg., we can adopt a recurrent architecture to avoid the linearly increasing number of parameters while maintaining different gating values at different time steps.). I believe that these can be good directions to improve the method in their future work.  Despite some of my concerns, I still think it is worth to accept this paper considering the contributions (written in the strength section of this review) with the reasonable empirical supports.
