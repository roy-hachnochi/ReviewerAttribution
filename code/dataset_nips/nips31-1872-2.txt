The focus of the paper is on the reconstruction of graphs from (noisy) estimates of the effective resistances between nodes. The main contribution is a gradient descent algorithm on the vector of edge weights (Proposition 1). The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated on both synthetic and real data (small Facebook ego networks).  The paper is topical and well written. However, the proposed approach is not very original and applies to small graphs only as it requires a memory of order n^2. The motivation for Problem 1.2 (reconstruction from partial data) is unclear as the proposed solution requires a memory of n^2 in any case. Besides, Problem 1.2 is solved only in the specific case of trees.   Detailed comments: * The abstract suggests that the effective resistances can be "measured". What do you mean exactly? * The discussion on privacy should be clarified in the introduction. In which practical case would a social network reveal effective resistances but not links?
