This paper proposed to increase the softmax capacity by multiplying the exponential term with sigmoid function, which does not require additional parameters. The authors have shown that in theory the proposed formulation can provide better representation capacity than the softmax function, and the results on Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 dataset also shown improvement. The improvement are also observed with mixture models. The authors also showed that the output matrix by their proposed function have higher rank than conventional function on both tasks.  The proposed approach is simple with good theoretical and empirical support. On the other hand, it would be more convincing if the authors could assess their approach on larger dataset like 1B Word dataset or on other domain. The paper is clearly written.
