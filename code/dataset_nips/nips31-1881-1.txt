This paper study the asymptotic convergence rate of cubic regularization algorithm under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KŁ) property. Comparing with existing works on convergence analysis for CR method --- a sublinear global convergence rate and a local quadratic rate under certain conditions, this paper provides a more fine-grained convergence rate over a broad spectrum of function local geometries characterized by the KŁ property. These results help better understand the local convergence behavior of CR methods.  It will be much better to show some concrete examples (even toy examples) for each  case of the different KL properties and verify the convergence behavior of CR method.
