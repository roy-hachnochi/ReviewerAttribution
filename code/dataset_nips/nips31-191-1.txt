In this paper, the author present a deep convolutional neural network to capture the inherent properties of image degradation. The proposed neural network is motivated by the low-rank property of pseudo-inverse kernels. The analysis shows that the estimated decomposed matrices contain the most essential information of the input kernel. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with noise and saturated pixels demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.  The paper is well-organized and written. The proposed model can handle different types of blur kernels. Also, the network is well validated by Discussion Section and insensitive to the parameters. In my opinion, the author introduce the off-the-shelf GLRA method to approximate a set of blur kernels to obtain the initializations of the network parameters. It's more like a improved variant of the previous work by Xu et.al. [22]. The novelty is somehow weak.
