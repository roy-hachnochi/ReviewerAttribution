This paper considers a bipartite Stochastic Block Model (SBM) that allows for overlapping right clusters and proposes a simple two step algorithm to estimate the left and right clusters with provable guarantees. The main selling point is that this algorithm, unlike previous ones, can detect small clusters (of size (n^eps), for any eps > 0, as opposed to Omega(n^0.5) in previous works). This is practically useful because in many real bipartite networks the right side can have tiny clusters. The authors analyze two real-world examples to illustrate this. Comparisons with other algorithms on synthetic networks are also given.  I found the paper interesting and believe that it is a good contribution to the literature.  Some comments/suggestions for the authors:  1. Theorem 1 concerns strong recovery, and so needs the graph to have unbounded average degree. A discussion about the sparse case would be welcome. Does the pcv algorithm (or Mitra's algorithm plus your second step) return clusters "correlated with" the ground truth in that case? 2. For estimating theta a naive approach would be to start with a pilot estimate (e.g., grid search) to get the clusters first and then estimate p and q by within (i.e. between U_i and V_i for all i) and between (i.e. between U_i and V_j for all i \ne j) block averages of edges, and finally re-estimate theta using these estimates of p and q, and run the second step of your algorithm. This may be repeated until "convergence" (when the estimate of theta essentially stops changing, which may or may not happen). 3. Page 7, line 248: "used the quality" should be "used the same quality"? 4. Page 8, line 301: "Like this" should be "With this". 5. Page 8, line 314: "(24 posts) is christian" should be "(24 posts) christian".
