The paper proposes a principled approach to motion synchronization by formulating it as a probabilistic inference problem and devising an original MCMC sampler to address it. The methods are presented in good detail, and theoretical justification for choices made by the authors is provided. The probabilistic approach allows for uncertainty estimation as well, which is a strong point of this work.  Overall I think this is a good paper, however I found that perhaps the experimental results could have been presented better and commented upon in greater detail.   For instance, in Table 1, where evaluation on the EPFL benchmark is done, the results on Castle-P19 show very similar performance for the proposed method, the Govindu method and the Torsello method. It would have been interesting to understand the reasons for such very close performance alignment, given this is not the case for the other three comparison methods.  Another comment is on the inclusion of the “Average” row, which does not seem to be necessary as this is a comparison amongst problems of different complexity.
