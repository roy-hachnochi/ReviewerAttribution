The paper proposes the training of CNNs for classification directly on the DCT coefficients from the JPEG codec.  The removal of the jpeg decoding and the work of CNN directly on DCT which allow for skipping first layers lead to speed advantages, reportedly 1.77x speed up of the modified net over the ResNet-50 baseline.  The paper reads mostly well and the derived CNNs and experimental results support the idea of faster CNNs straight from JPEG DCT coefficients.  The paper suffers, however, on a number of aspects. 1) Related work: I do not see a related work review of publications employing directly the compressed domain for higher level tasks. This work should be placed into the existing literature. 2) Novelty: This paper is not the first to propose working on the compressed domain of an image. Nor the first paper using CNN for classification on the compressed domain. 3) Generality: I am curious if the speed benefits obtained for the CNNs working for classification directly on the DCT coefficients are also achievable for other vision tasks such as (semantic) image segmentation, image translation..
