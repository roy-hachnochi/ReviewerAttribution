This paper proposes to train cnn directly from the second stage of JPEG decoding.  - One crucial factor for getting good performance of CNN is to apply data augmentations(crop, rotate). It is unclear how the augmentations can be applied to the new pipeline - It would be helpful to characterize the gains of GPU inference time without considering IO, as the FPS number can depend on implementation. - The comprehensive study of various choices of applying pre-transform pipeline on the intermediate is useful and can be interesting to a lot of audiences.  In summary, this paper presents interesting results that are relevant to NIPS audience. There are a few technicals points that can be improved to make the paper stronger.  UPDATE ---------- I have read the rebuttal and will keep my score as it is. I encourage the author is encouraged to include the discussion on the impact of IO and the implication of data augmentation.
