Summary of the paper:  A topological sort based algorithm named TopRank is proposed to deal with the online learning to rank problem, which does not rely on a factored value function model. TopRank maintains a graph of preference during learning, and chooses the ranking based on the topological ordering. The graph is updated by click results. Both regret bounds and empirical results on real data are provided to justify the effectiveness.  Comments:  This is a well written paper, which gives very clear exposition on modeling assumptions and the algorithm. The proposed TopRank algorithm is provable to have a weaker modeling assumption, which I believe is an important contribution. The theoretical guarantees and empirical justifications on real data are companioned which seem to be technically sound.   I think it is better to have a more detailed discussion on Assumption 4 since it is relative unnatural comparing with the other three assumptions. Explanations of its necessity from the algorithmic and theoretical aspects, and the potential way of relaxation are desirable.  My major concern is on the cost of storing the relational graph which records the preference of the users. The size of the corresponding matrix is L by L, which has a quadratic dependence on the number of items. This may limit the application of this approach on large-scale real-world ranking problems. Is there a possible way to have a relaxation on this requirement?  I suggest to use different line shapes for different approaches in experimental results.
