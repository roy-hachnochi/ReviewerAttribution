The proposed method proposed an online learning algorithm of rank based on topological sort. It is an interesting idea of using partition in the learning of rank. But I would suggest the authors provide more explanation on why there is a need to use partition and what is the pros and cons of adopting such a strategy.  In the current analysis, it lacks of analysis on computation complexity and effect on the number of blocks in the partition with respect to the performance on online learning.   Some details comments:  The current writing needs further improvement especially in the introduction section to make the key concept of the proposed method clearer such as the concept of “partial order” and “topological sort”.   I would be better to have some simulation example to comprehensively evaluate the pros and cons of the proposed method, including computation complexity, estimation efficiency and accuracy.
