  The paper provides an interesting view on interactive machine  learning, in which the machine elicits explanations to the  user and incrementally builds a logical model incorporating  these explanations. It proves that under certain rather  reasonable conditions on the behaviour of the user, the error  of the system can be bounded in terms of some intrinsic  clustering of the data. The experimental evaluation is only  for illustrative purposes.   My main concern with this work is that it seems to shift the  entire effort of producing a discriminative model to the user.  The system basically incrementally builds the model  incorporating rules generated by the user. I would expect a  learning system to provide some sort of proactiveness in  building the learning model, and rely on the user only  occasionally (the proposed system queries the user for each  prediction), possibly asking for explanations as proposed in  this paper.           AFTER REBUTTAL:          I still believe the role of the learning algorithm is too passive here, but I agree         with the authors that the type of feedback required is not too much harder than        labeling, and that in the restricted setting they are addressing they do have a         message.
