The paper presents a novel graph kernel, adapted to large undirected graphs, able to use nodes attributes. The idea is to use a "return probability feature" based on random walks, instead of classical bags of random walks for instance.  The idea is interesting and appears to be efficient. The paper is quite easy to read but some details can be improved (see below). To my knowledge,  the proposed approach is novel, and there are many potential problems that could benefit from this idea.   It is shown that the RPF has several nice properties, such as isomorphic invariance and multi-resolution. It also contains enough information on graph structure such that similar RPF is linked to similar spectral properties.
