The authors consider a non-parametric hypothesis testing procedure and derived optimal stopping rule for estimating regression function. Their proposed method ensures that their hypothesis testing procedure is minimax optimal and is sharp estimation accuracy. While the authors does not confirm the performance of their proopsed method through real data, the method would be novel and efficient for data science.  My concern is that, in general, tuning parameter in the kernel is sensitive for performing simulations. So, I am interested in how robust the proposed method with respect to it. In addition, it is important to choose kernel function or to reduce variables, in practice. Are there possible to extend the proposed method to such a scenario?
