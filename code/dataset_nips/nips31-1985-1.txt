The paper presents a way to generate a new image from another similar one conditioned on the unsupervised detected landmark points.  Although being an interesting way to do style transferring, the techniques used in the work is weakly motivated and did not have major architecture contribution at the level of NIPS. The highlighted distinction of the paper is the learning landmarks together with the generator, but the motivation for doing this is not clear in the text. This limitation involves the undefined meaning of these landmarks and how they represent the “structure” of the image. It would be clearer if the author used correspondence pairs of landmarks in the source and target images.   The presentation will need a lot of improvement for further clarity and grammatical correctness. Edit: At a second look at the paper and the rebuttal, I agreed that I have misunderstood the goal of the paper toward image generation. Toward the actual goal of unsupervised learning of landmark points I think the idea is rather neat and creative. I will raise my vote to weak accept hoping that the authors will make the main objective more obvious in their edits.
