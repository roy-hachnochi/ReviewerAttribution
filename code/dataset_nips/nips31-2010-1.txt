This paper looks at using neural networks on a family of differential equations (Poisson equations) to study the transferability of a layer of a neural network using SVCCA, a technique that can determine similarity between pairs of layers.  This paper had many interesting original definitions, and I liked the way that intrinsic dimensionality (which would be an interesting thing to compare to the ICLR paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08838), reproducibility and specificity were designed.  Comparing two different methods for transferability is also a good experimental validation of the method.   I did find some parts of the paper hard to follow, in particular, I was confused by the  "block diagonal" structure referred to in Figure 1. While I think I was able to follow Figure 2 (which was based off of Figure 1), I think both Figures could do with expanded captions.  I also think the definitions of reproducibility, specificity, etc on page 5 could sit in their own lines with the defining equation numbered. Having it written inline in free flowing text makes it hard to keep track of all the definitions.  My main concern with this paper is that it would have been very nice to see an implementation of at least the computationally more efficient method on a different task and/or dataset. E.g. after comparing to the transferability paper, one could try to transfer between e.g. MNIST and SVHN as an additional validation of the method.   While I like the motivation and the definitions, with only the differential equation application, it might not be enough for acceptance just yet.  UPDATE: Having read the author response (particularly the MNIST experiments and comparisons with Li et al) I am updating my score to accept.
