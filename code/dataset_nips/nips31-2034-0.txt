The paper studies an algorithm to study efficient projection onto perfect phylogeny model. The major contribution of the paper is to give a Moreau's decomposition for proximal operator, and a tree reduction scheme to solve the projection problem.   I find it hard to justify the novelty of the paper as the formulation is not too technical. The contribution of the paper should be from the application perspective. However, the paper did not provide sufficient numerical studies especially not using real data to provide real case studies. I thus do not suggest an acceptance.  After reading the rebuttal, I still do not see enough new contribution from this paper. I think this should be a rejection,
