This paper provides a very efficient algorithm to reconstruct phylogenetic models (trees).  They key insights are efficient ways to search the entire subspaces around a proposed model, so that a full search can be made overall efficiently.  The algorithm runs in O(q^2 p) steps for a genome of length q, and with p samples.  Experiments show that the algorithm runs significantly faster than other search algorithms they implemented, a x74 speed-up!    The paper is well-written, although fairly dense.      Re REBUTAL: Thank you for the time you took to provide a detailed rebuttal.  However, I wished you had ONLY addressed the main concerns from Reviewer #2.  I felt lost in the point of most of the comments.
