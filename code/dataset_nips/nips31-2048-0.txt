The authors propose in this manuscript a novel methodology for deep latent representation via joint constraints as an improvement on LDA-derived approaches, w/ applications to text classification. The paper is well written and w/ good scientific content: the idea of transferring the joint constraint structure to a ANN is indeed interesting and theoretically well supported by the mathematical framework. However, the proposed construction requires a number of complex ingredients, and here lies the major flaw of the contribution: the performance gain w.r.t. alternative methods is quite limited (especially in the "20 Newsgroup" dataset, where the difference appears to be statistically not significant). Overall, I would judge the shown experiments as not sufficient to consistently support any superiority claim, rating the method still immature, although promising and of good quality.  ### After reading the authors' rebuttal, I changed my rating to a weak accept - the motivations outlined in the rebuttal letter are reasonable and improve the overall shape of the manuscript.
