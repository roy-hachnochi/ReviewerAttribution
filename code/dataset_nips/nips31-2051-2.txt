The authors propose a differentially private algorithm for robust low-rank approximation that improves both the multiplicative approximation and the additive error significantly. They also adapt this algorithm to differentially private robust subspace learning where the additive error does not scale with the size of the dataset but the rank.  It is a well-written, clear paper. The topic is important and the results are significant.
