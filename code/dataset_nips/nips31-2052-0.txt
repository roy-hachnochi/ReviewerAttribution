An approach for learning proposal distributions in MCMC is proposed. The problem of learning high quality proposal distributions is challenging and therefore general purpose methods for obtaining such proposals is significant for probabilistic inference. The main idea is to learn the proposal distributions for block sampling in Gibbs using mixture density neural nets. Specifically, the neural net is trained assuming a specific structure for the block which is referred to as motifs. The training is performed by finding local graph structures in the input model that matches this motif, using the local parameters, and then instantiating the Markov blanket (or a subset of variables not in the block)  randomly to generate training data. The neural net then learns the proposal by minimizing the KL divergence between the proposal and the true distribution for all parameterizations of the block.  Overall the paper is well written. The idea seems reasonable, maybe not so novel since learning proposal distributions has been explored before (maybe not specific to neural nets). One possible drawback is that maybe we can use very simple motifs due to the difficulty in training more complex ones. Does that really help in complex graphical models. Also, the structure of the motifs are hand coded, is that a problem? Also it looks like we need to retrain the neural net for every graphical model even if they have same structure, is this correct?  The experiments seem reasonable, except there is no other state-of-the-art benchmark (not sure if some of the other techniques in related work could have been used) used in the comparison. The technique shows promise in UAI benchmarks, GMM sampling and also in a real-world problem of Named entity recognition.
