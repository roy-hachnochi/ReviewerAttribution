The paper addresses adaptive control for the LQR problem. A polynomial time algorithm is proposed and shown to give sublinear (O(T^{2/3}) regret. This is claimed to be the first such result. A lower bound on the regret is also provided in terms of the system excitation,  which is related to parameter estimation error.  I view this paper as a solid theoretical paper, which provides novel results. The proposed algorithm appears to include novel features, and the results meaningful. (Unfortunately, I am not knowledgeable enough in the recent literature to say that with confidence.)  The paper is generally well written. The interested reader who is not an expert will need to frequently consult the appendix, but this seems unavoidable.    While the proposed algorithm and results are of theoretical significance, it may be pointed out that their practical importance is limited, as few systems are fully linear and time invariant.
