This manuscript derived the uniformly most powerful (UMP) tests for simple and one-sided hypothesis testing on binomial data under general $(epsilon, delta)$ privacy constraints. Specifically, the authors proposed a new probability distribution called Truncated-Uniform-Laplace (Tulap) and showed that the UMP test can be reformulated as post-processing the Tulap random variable. Based on this idea, the authors can also obtain the exact p-values and verify the superiority via simulations.   I like this manuscript due to the following reasons:   1. The exact UMP test is obtained for binomial data under general $(epsilon, delta)$ privacy constraints for any parameters $\epsilon, \delta$;   2. The authors proposed the Tulap distribution, which is a generalization of the staircase and discrete Laplace distributions and could be of independent interest in the field of differential privacy.   However, there are also some weaknesses for this manuscript:   1. The resulting UMP test under privacy constraint is quite straightforward and did not really reflect new ideas. Consider the traditional case without privacy constraint; by Neyman--Pearson we know that $\phi_x = 0$ for $x$ below some threshold, and then $\phi_x$ jumps to one. Now adding the privacy constraint, we cannot make $\phi_x$ increase too sharply. Then the natural idea is to just have $\phi_x$ increase as quickly as possible, subject to the privacy constraints Eqn. (2) - (5), which turns out to be optimal and also easy to prove in theory. Hence, the resulting UMP is not surprising to me in terms of both the idea and the underlying theory.   2. The UMP test construction is quite ad-hoc for the binomial model. Could this idea be generalized to other statistical models with privacy constraint as well?   Overall speaking, I still like this manuscript mainly due to the introduction of the Tulap distribution and its potential usage in future works, and I would appreciate the authors' rebuttal on the weaknesses.   Edit: I have read the authors' rebuttal and feel they are quite satisfactory to me. I choose to raise my score from 6 to 7.
