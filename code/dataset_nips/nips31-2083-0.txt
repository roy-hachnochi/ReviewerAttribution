Summary: This paper proposes an inexact trust-region method for Riemannian optimization, for the purpose of finding an approximate second-order stationary point for large scale finite-sum optimization problems. The proposed algorithm and analysis are based on  existing work in vector space inexact trust-region as well as Riemannian trust-region methods. The authors also perform experiments in PCA and matrix completion as an empirically support for the proposed algorithm.  Pros: This work seems to be a solid addition to the Riemannian optimization repertoire. Both the analysis and the experiments show merits of the algorithm. The analysis is new but considering previous work, it is somewhat incremental.  Cons: 1) Some of the details of the experiments are missing. For example, in the PCA experiments, RSVRG seems to be competitive in terms of oracle calls but fall behind in terms of wall-clock time. Is there a particular reason for this difference? e.g. are efficient retractions/vector transports used? 2) In the analysis you made assumptions about the pullback functions (e.g. Lipschitz Hessian). It would be good to discuss how such assumptions hold in practice (e.g. bound on the Lipschitz constant, etc.) for problems of interest.
