This paper proposed the inexact TR optimization algorithm on manifold, in which the analysis largely follows from the euclidean case [27,28]. They also considered the subsampling variant of their method for finite-sum problems and the empirical performance on PCA and matrix completion problems.   1. It seems to me the convergence analysis follows exactly from the works [27,28] except for some different notation. At least this paper doesn't show what is the technical challenge for the Riemannian case.   2. For the experiments, both MC and PCA problems can be solved efficiently by Euclidean method like GD/SGD. What are the advantages of using Riemannian optimization method?   3. In appendix, line 410, C should not depend on \delta_g or \delta_H otherwise it will depend on \eps_g and \eps_H.  Overall, it is a good paper with very interesting results. The presentation can be further improved.  First, show some real motivation for doing inexact RTR method. Right now the intro is a little bit general and vague.  Second, show the technical challenges/difficulties of obtaining the iteration complexity results and the analysis should be elaborated a little bit. Third, show some background/examples on how to compute the gradient and Hessian on manifold, i.e. how you can do it efficiently in practice for certain problems.
