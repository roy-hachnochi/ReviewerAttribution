This paper studied orthogonality regularizations on training deep CNNs. The authors introduced three novel regularization forms for orthogonality, using double-sided Frobenius norm, Mutual Coherence (MC) and Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) tools, respectfully. Those orthogonality regularizations can plug-and-play with training many CNNs without hassle. They are evaluated on three state-of-the-art models on CIFAR10/100 Strength: - The paper is easy to follow in general. MC and RIP are exploited from compressive sensing literature, and both of their combinations with CNN regularization seem new to me. Particularly, the authors provide an explanation of SRIP’s relationship with the recently proposed spectral norm regularization/spectral normalization [33,34], and shows SRIP to be stricter.  - The proposed techniques are light-weight and easy to plug in. The extra complexities incurred seem to be small (using simplified methods auto-differentiation, power iteration, etc.). They could potentially be easily adopted by many models.  - Experiment advantages are mostly consistent, sometimes notable (2.47%in CIFAR-100). SRIP also outperformed latest competitive methods [15,33]; I like Section 4.5 comparison in particular, which seems to concur that SRIP is stricter.   Weakness: - The experiments are insufficient to validate the claim. Only CIFAR10/100 are used, but many of studied techniques that were effective on CIFAR10/100 and MNIST turned out ineffective on other larger datasets/tasks. I would be happy to raise my score if the authors could provide ImageNet improvement (at least for SO and SRIP).  - As the authors also implied, MC is not enforced in the “right way” (columns not normalized). I would like the authors to report their MC performance with column normalization for completeness.
