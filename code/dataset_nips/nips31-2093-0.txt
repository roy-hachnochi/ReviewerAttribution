The paper provides a new tensor factorization approach for knowledge graph completion. The problem is significant and an important one in AI. The main contribution is a new form of factorization that extends canonical polyadic factorization by accounting for dependence between the vectors representing the entities across relations. The proposed method seems simple to implement and also can be interpreted. Theoretical analysis is provided to establish expressivity in terms of a bound on vector size. Further, it is possible to add logical constraints to the model to represent real-world phenomena. Overall the paper is written very well and is quite easy to understand. In terms of novelty, there seems to be sufficient novelty even though it is an extension of a previous approach. The experiments are performed on two benchmarks. The only issue is the results do not show very significant improvements over state-of-the-art ComplEx. However, when background knowledge is needed the proposed approach seems better, for a modified dataset that explicitly encodes some constraints. Overall it would be nice to know the advantages of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art system. For example, are the expressiveness guarantees or ability to add logical constraints not present in Complex) . In summary though, this seems like a solid contribution for relational learning.
