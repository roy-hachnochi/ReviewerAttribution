The paper provides a very nice summary of the state-of-the-art and cites all the relevant publications. So, clearly the authors know the literature. They then provide a very nice and simple model that outperforms the other competing models or matches performance, while being simpler.   The only additional thing I would have liked to see is an analysis of where their model outperforms other competing models. And where they might not.
