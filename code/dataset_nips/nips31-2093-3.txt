This is a really nice presentation on relational learning with tensors. It has two major contributions:   - a very good area survey, which nicely explains & demythifies this subject.   - the simple alg, which basically adds inverse relations to improve tensor learning.  The contribution itself is a bit rushed, especially on the use of rules. I don think NIPS is in the survey business, but this one does make the authorś idea very clear.  Issues: Table 2 should refer the source of the results. Also: - has been there progress in any of the systems that could affect results? - the results compared to complex are really head-to-head. I was curious on how many parameters do both approaches have? - how fast do you converge? Does using inverse edges slow down convergence? - BK: itś really hard to get a hold of how far you can go using BK, that text needs cleaning up. - Is the code available?
