The paper proposes a model and training regime for the task of image inpainting. Experiments are run on various datasets with limited qualitative and quantitative results presented.  There are a number of issues with the paper that result in my vote to reject the paper. First, the experimental results are insufficient. The qualitative results are too few for the reader to make an informed assessment of the model (this is a consequence of limited space but nevertheless a problem). In addition, quantitative results are only included for the full model on one dataset. Table 1 should be expanded to include all datasets as well as numerical results from the ablation analysis.  Second, the model change to multi-column is incremental and unclear whether this provides an improvement. The ablation analysis does not provide any quantitative analysis nor is there sufficient exploration of alternative model architecture to draw a conclusion.  Third, it is unclear to me why the nearest-neighbor-based regularization term is called an MRF. I don't see where the MRF comes into things given that in Equation (1), for any pairwise term, one of the terms is always observed.  Last, the writing is very disjoint and often unclear. For example, what does in mean to "keep multi-modality" (L37)? And what is Y on L87 (presumably it's the original image, i.e., X = M * Y where * is the Hadamard product). Other suggestions for improving the writing/correcting typos:  1. "patch-wised" -> "patch-wise" 2. "Exemplar" (L51) -> "Examples" since you use "Examplar-based" inpainting to mean something completely different 3. "zero value is filled" -> "Unknown regions of image X are filled with zeros." 4. "Wasserstain" -> "Wasserstein"
