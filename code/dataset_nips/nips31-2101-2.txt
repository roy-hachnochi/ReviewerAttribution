Image parsing is an important topic in computer vision. However, unlike grammar parsing, image parsing is hard due to exponential many ways of splitting an image region. The authors attacking this problem by associate each splitting with an submodular Markov Random Field (MRF), and an approximate algorithm of MAP parsing is also developed with such structure.  Pros: (1) Allows arbitary shape of regions instead of the very restricted setting (e.g. regions must bu rectangular). Allowing arbitary shape of regions significantly makes the algorithm more practical, as objects can have arbitary shape rather than rectangular.  (2) The hierarchical structure of the proposed method results in an efficient parsing algorithm.   (3) Convergence of the parsing algorithm is guaranteed, and the time complexity of the algorithm is reasonable.  Cons: (1) Maybe the experiment part. The current experiment is performed on a small dataset. If the authors can get more results on larger dataset, if would be much better.
