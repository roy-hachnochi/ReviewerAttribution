This paper proposed a propagative convergent network that bridges between model optimization and deep propagation in a collaborative manner, where the PCN performs as a deep trainable solver used for optimization. The key idea is to use a generic model-inspired architecture and a proximal feedback mechanism to check and update until converging. The paper proves PCN to have strict convergence property, where a relaxed one can provide an end-to-end learning framework.  This paper is well written and easy to understand. The theories are clear and adequately presented in both the paper and the supplementary material (I roughly checked through every step).   One concern I have is the experimental part for image restoration. Although it is not specifically targeting on vision tasks, many pieces of information are not clearly presented, including the task settings (e.g., is it a super-resolution with known degradations, or blind/unblind deblur?), some brief introductions of related work, and most importantly, the insights for why the proposed model can achieve better results, e.g., with either theoretical explanation, or experimental ablation studies.  Given the above paper strength and concerns, I would give the paper in the current version as score 8. I am not an expert in this area, but I can roughly understand all the deductions and proves. I really prefer the collaborative mechanism shown in (9) and (10), as well as the convergence property of the framework. I hope the authors can address the concern regarding to the experiments. I would also see how other reviewers would comment given more expertise knowledge.  Update: I would retain my previous rating after reading the rebuttal, I agree that the issue raise by other reviewers with eq 10 is not a major claim and thus not a factor to re-rate.
