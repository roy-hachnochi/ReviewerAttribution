In this paper, the authors develop a mean-field theory for a model graph neural network and they show that it accurately predicts performance of random GNNs assigning labels to the stochastic block model. Overall, I found this paper to be a good submission that provides insight into an increasingly popular family of models. The theory seemed correct and the experiments seemed carefully done. However, I do think the paper would benefit from clarity in the overall presentation.   Some specific feedback:  1) I think the paper might benefit from a related works section, especially discussing how the methods here relate to other papers that have used the mean field approach.  2) Some notation is not defined. For example,  a) The c parameter in equation 4 is not defined until much later in the text. b) The node state matrix at t=0.  3) I would have loved to see some discussion of GNNs using performance on the model task that could inform more general work on graph neural networks. For example, if I use weights whose variance is \sigma^2 / N is there any dependence in model performance on \sigma? Does this dependence carry over when using GNNs on other problem areas?
