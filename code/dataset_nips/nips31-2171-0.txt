To optimize a composite objective of a convex function and a submodular function, the paper proposes a limited memory Kelley's method with a convergence rate analysis. The method is a variant of OSM with no rate of convergence known. The paper also connects their method with FCFW and show comparable performance with synthetic experiments.     I'm not very familiar with the Kelley's method or OSM, but based on what I read, the paper does consider interesting applications and settings. The method proposed with the theoretical analysis is clear. The analysis of the connection between DL-KM and FCFW is enlightening. The experimental results are apt and encouraging.   I want to propose some issues that the paper could improve upon. The introduction is not very well-structured. It renders from Kelley's method, the definition of sub modularity, to the problem formulation, and OSM's advantages and drawbacks, which followed by related work part again. Logic doesn't flow very well. The second paragraph of the application part compares the proposed method with MD and looks more like background of the problem. The summary of contribution is actually just the outline of the remaining paper.    Most of the cited work is very old. The paper should add some newest reference about bundle methods and FCFW, e.g. [1,2,3], to name a few. [1] W. de Oliveira and C. Sagastiz´abal. Bundle methods in the XXIst century: A birds-eye view. Optimization Online Report, 4088, 2013 [2] Jaggi, Martin. "Revisiting Frank-Wolfe: Projection-Free Sparse Convex Optimization." ICML (1). 2013. [3] Lacoste-Julien, Simon, and Martin Jaggi. "On the global linear convergence of Frank-Wolfe optimization variants." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2015.  In the intro, the authors mentioned that DL-KM is favorable than MD since Bregman projections is more computational complex. But have you done such analysis later? What is the per iteration complexity of the proposed methods?
