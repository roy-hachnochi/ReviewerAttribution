The paper proposes a limited memory version of Kelly's cutting plane method for minimization of composite functions of the form   g(x) + f(x)  where g is closed convex and importantly f is the Lovasz extension of a submodular function. The authors build upon Original Simplical Method (OSM) where one approximates f iteratively by f_{(i)}, the maximum of some supporting hyperplanes of f and f_{(i)} gets closer to f with each iteration, as a new bunch of hyperplanes are added. In the proposed method, in iteration i+1, they keep only those hyperplanes that touch f_{(i+1)} from the previous iteration i, whereas in OSM, all the previous ones are carried forward. They show that the number of hyperplanes will at most be n+1 where x \in R^n. They show convergence rate of the method via the relation between its dual and the Fully-Corrected Frank-Wolfe with approximations. This is a key contribution of the paper. Simulations are supportive but not too extensive.   The authors organize the paper well, explain their work in a clear manner at most places and relate it to previous work. The method is novel and the convergence result is very interesting.
