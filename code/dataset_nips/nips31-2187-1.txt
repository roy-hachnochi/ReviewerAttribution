A neural network model for the estimation of potential energy surfaces of chemical systems given their atomic configuration is proposed. It is an extension of DeepPot and introduces smoothness to the functional, enabling better training. It incorporates known symmetries (index permutation, rotation, translation) of the systems by building them into the architecture.  It is shown that the model can fit a wide variety of chemical systems ranging from small molecules to bulk matter, all within chemical accuracy with respect to DFT.  With the extensive amount of experiments and well-described architecture and training, this is a very good contribution.
