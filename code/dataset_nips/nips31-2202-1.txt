This paper proposes HolEx, a method that uses a combination of purturbed Holographic Embeddings (HolE)  for knowledge graph completion.  STRENGTH  - Nice presentation  - HolEx achieves a performance that surpasses the state-of-the-art in the FB15K knowledge graph completion task.  - Extensive theoretical analysis of the proposed method and its performance.  WEAKNESS  - Some might say the approach (ensemble) may not be novel enough.  - Empirical evaluation on other datasets may be desirable, such as WN18(RR) and NELL995.  - Connection to complex embeddings may be desirable, which is known to be isomorphic to HolE.  COMMENTS  This is a solid piece of work that extends HolE, in somewhat straightforward manner in terms of approach, nonetheless it is quite effective.  Moreover, theoretical analysis provided is very nice.  I would like to see the discussion on its relationship to ComplEx, which has recently been shown to be isomorphic to HolE [Hayashi and Shimbo, ACL 2017], on which HolEx is based --- this is because ComplEx can be computed in linear time while HolE is not.  Some minor suggestions:  Since there is space on the left and right side of Table 1, please report Mean Reciprocal Rank and HITS@1, 5 as well, for convenience of comparison with existing work that only reports these numbers.  Regarding Remark 1, could you clarify the situation of the numbers for ProjE in Table 1?  I checked the GitHub page for ProjE but could not find the numbers on the table there (although there is a discussion in Issue tracker but no numbers are present.)
