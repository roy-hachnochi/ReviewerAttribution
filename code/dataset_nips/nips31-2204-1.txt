The goal of the paper is to provide a methodology to explain deep learning models in generality. The approach is based on Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) methods, more specifically on a BNP regression mixture model with (truncated) Dirichlet process mixing measure. The results of the linear regression model are used to interpret decide which features are important, and grouping them as explaining the decisions taken by the deep model.  I have some concern with the prior distribution on the regression coefficients \beta_j's. This prior is defined in two different places, ie (4-5) and (6-7), but they are not consistent. could you comment why the variance for the prior on \beta_j is the same as the variance for the model, \sigma_j^2? commenting the choice for the covariance matrix in (6-7) would be useful, as it does not seem common practice. The authors should comment on the implementation of the MCMC algorithm, such as running time, mixing properties, convergence: insuring a good mixing of the chains in dimension p=28x28 does not seem trivial at all. Reproducibility of the experiments: a lot of (hyper)parameters are not specified in the model (including R, L, V in line 144) are not specified. Section 3 describes the technical details about the BNP mixture model. However, the link with the next sections is not clearly stated, so that it is difficult to see how scrutability and explainability are derived from the BNP model results. Additionally, some phrasings are vague and difficult to understand. See eg the paragraph on data dimensionality, lines 311-324.
