This paper proposes a novel method to find local minima of non-convex problems. In particular, the proposed method exploits the third-order smoothness to escape saddle points more efficiently. As shown in this paper, the third-order smoothness can help to choose a larger step size along the negative curvature descent direction than existing methods. Overall, the idea is novel and it is well structured.   What I am concerned about is as follows: 1.Since this method utilizes the negative curvature direction, it is better to compare it with the corresponding counterparts, such as the Neon algorithm, in the experiment section.  2.Please carefully refine the writing, there are some typos.     e.g. Line 288: find->finds
