This paper essentially proposed a decentralized version of CoCoA algorithm, or a decentralized version of block coordinate descent. While I enjoyed reading the first section, the theory section is a little bit over complicated in term of presentation. Authors may consider how to simplify notations and statements. Despite of this, I have a few questions / concerns that need authors to respond in rebuttal  - A few key theoretical results are not clear enough to me. In particular, how does the proposed decentralized algorithm improves CoCoA in theory? Authors need to compare the communication cost and the computation complexity at least. (Authors show that the convergence rate is sort of consistent with CoCoA in the extreme case, but that may not be enough. People may want to see if your method has any advantage over CoCaA in theory by jointly considering communication and computation cost.) - The speedup property is not clear to. Since the notation and the statement of the theoretical results is over complicate, it is hard to see if more workers will accelerate the training process and how? - The experiments are performed on the multi-core machine, where the communication is not the bottleneck. To my personal experiences, the decentralized algorithm may not have advantage over centralized algorithms.  =============  Authors partially addressed my concerns. The comparison to centralized methods are also expected to include since in many ML application, people can choose either centralized network or decentralized network. Authors may refer to the comparison in [14].
