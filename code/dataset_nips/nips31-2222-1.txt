The authors present a hierarchical embedding scheme for clinical concept codes with the goal of learning dense numerical representations for forecasting outcomes such as heart failure.   The paper is well written and structured clearly.  I appreciate the quantitative evaluation campaign (especially using PR over ROC curves). A general comment in this direction is that PR measurements should be treated as point estimates that cannot be simply interpolated (as one would do with ROCs).   The introduction hints at the model's potential for application in resource impoverished settings such as detecting rare disorders. While the sub-sampling experiments show promise some robustness to data sparsity, it would be interesting to study the performance on such truly rare outcomes.  It would be interesting to additionally conduct a qualitative evaluation, studying not just the extent but also the way in which MIME classification differs from that of state-of-the-art models. A dedicated error analysis would be helpful for understanding any systematic strengths or weaknesses of the respective models.  In summary, this is a nice and timely study that presents an effective framework for clinical outcome prediction. Considering the original submission as well as the authors' feedback, I recommend acceptance if space permits.
