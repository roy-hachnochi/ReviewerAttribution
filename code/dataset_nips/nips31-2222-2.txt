The authors create a multilevel embedding of EHR data (Multilevel Medical Embedding - MiME) that jointly performs prediction tasks where leverage inherent EHR structure should be beneficial - heart failure prediction and sequential disease prediction. The MiME embeddings outperformed the baselines in predicting heart failure   Strengths: - The paper is well-written and easy to understand. The authors leverage other work when needed, and emphasize their own contributions.  - The experiments are well done - varying data size and visit complexity are good axes to evaluate the embedding on, and MIME is competitive.  - MIME has the greatest performance improvement (15% relative gain PR-AUC) on the smallest dataset, which could indicate better out-of-sample performance on unseen hospitals.   Weaknesses:  - MiME is designed to explicitly capture the relationship between the diagnosis codes and the treatment codes within visits, but this is known to be weak in many cases. E.g., a doctor may give a diagnosis "code" for diabetes, simply so that the patient may be tested for diabetes and have insurance cover the cost. MIME does well here, but I am concerned about the value of this prediction given its artifice.  - MIME does best on HF, but not equally well on the other sequential disease prediction task. In the elderly population targeted here, the outcome will obviously be enriched, and doctors will be looking for HF. I am concerned that the performance could be due to learning the overtreatment patterns of healthcare professionals on older patients, especially given that it does so well on the Visit Complexity task, which is actually Dx-treatment interactions.
