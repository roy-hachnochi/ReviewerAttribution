This paper proposes a definition of proxy use in linear models and provides an algorithm for detecting such proxy use. Inspired by Datta et al. (2016, 2017), they define proxy use in terms of association and influence, where proxy discrimination is the existence of some linear combination of features that is highly associated with the protected attribute and has some causal influence on the outcome.  The authors show that discovering such a linear combination with high association and influence can be relaxed to a SOCP, at the cost of losing one direction of tightness. In particular, they show that if a regression model contains a discriminatory proxy as they define it, then the SOCP that they provide will find it.  Finally, they provide experimental results, showing that very strong proxies exist in both datasets they consider. In the SSL dataset, most of this is due to the "gang membership" variable; however, in the C&C dataset, proxies remain strong even when exempting individual variables, suggesting that in that dataset, many variables participate as proxies, making it difficult to prevent their use.  The techniques provided in this paper seem to provide a fairly interesting way to analyze datasets and understand the relations between the features they contain. While the scope of this work is limited to linear relations and may not be applicable to the actual models used in practice, it still could be useful in discovering which variables might be serving as proxies.
