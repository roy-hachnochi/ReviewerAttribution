The work proposes to combine  Reverse Cross-Entropy (RCE) training and K-density detector for robust adversarial example detection. RCE encourages a deep network to learn latent representations that better distinguish adversarial examples from normal ones. The method was validated on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.  Pros: 1. A metric for assessing whether an input is adversarial is proposed. 2. The effectiveness of reverse cross-entropy training is justified both theoretically and empirically. 3. The authors showed the advantages of the proposed method when handling oblivious, white-box  and black-box adversaries, through experiments.  Cons: 1. To better prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, the authors should evaluate it on the larger ImageNet dataset, in addition to MNIST and CIFAR-10.
