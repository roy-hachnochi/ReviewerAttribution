The submitted paper investigates spectral filtering for general linear dynamical systems (i.e., linear internal dynamics with disturbances and linear output feedback with measurement noise). Using convex programming, a polynomial-time algorithm for learning/predicting the behavior of latent-state linear dynamical systems (LDSs) whose state matrices are not symmetric is provided. Upper bounds on the learning/prediction performance are derived. Performance comparisons with the related algorithms are enclosed.  The submitted paper is concise, well written, investigates an interesting topic, the proposed methodology is plausible, and the mathematics appears honest. Some minor comments are as follows:  1. Is the presented methodology applicable to continuous-time LDSs? Can (a class of) nonlinear dynamics be learned via the presented methodology?  2. At the end of the sentence in the 18th row, please provide a reference. The same applies to the sentence in the 22nd row.  3. The price paid for such strong theoretical results is found in the restrictive set of assumptions between row 92 and 102. In particular, assumptions 2, 3 and 5 appear to be rather restrictive. Is this correct? Is it possible to relax any of them? Is this a part of the future work as well? Please include these comments in the final version of the paper (if any).
