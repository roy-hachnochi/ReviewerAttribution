This paper proposes to improve the GAN model for text generation by introducing a novel metric called the feature-mover's distance (FMD). The metric is used to compare the latent feature distributions of the real and synthetic sentences. It is differentiable and can be computed via the proximal method.  The FMD metric is a variant of the earth-mover's distance, often used in optimal transport. It measures the distance of feature distributions of real and synthetic sentences and is used as the new objective of the GAN model, where the discriminator aims to maximize the dissimilarity of the feature distributions and the generator is trained to do the opposite.  The paper is well organized and clearly described in general. The experiments and evaluations are well thought-out. The proposed metric has been shown to perform well on three tasks, including both unconditional and conditional text generation tasks. Overall I found the paper to be an enjoyable read and think it would contribute nicely to the literature.  I'd suggest the authors to perhaps also comment on the potential weaknesses of this approach. In particular, it looks like the generated sentences (in the Experiment section) appear to be less informative, and occasionally the system output has changed the meaning of the original sentence (in the style transfer case). I wonder why this is the case.  The following paper may be relevant to the style transfer task:  "Delete, Retrieve, Generate: a Simple Approach to Sentiment and Style Transfer", Robin Jia, He He, and Percy Liang, NAACL 2018.
