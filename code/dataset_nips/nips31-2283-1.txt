Summary: This paper developed faster rates of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) under Error Bound Conditions (EBC), and an efficient stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm that provides faster convergence compared to previous studies. Authors shows in-depth theoretical analysis on ERM under the condition and the SA algorithm and did an empirical experiments on various dataset to support the convergence rate of the SA algorithm.  Quality: The technical content of the paper appears to be solid with various theoretical analyses and with experiments. I did enjoy the way it is organized from general concepts for ERM in Section 3, followed by SA algorithm in Section 4, and its application in Section 5. The logical flow made the paper very solid to follow and I feel this is really a solid piece of work besides of good contents in the paper. I also enjoyed reading Section 5 answering this essential question ‘why this research matters’. It applies the paper’s contributions in a various optimization problems and also shows empirical results of the suggested SA algorithm, which shows a solid technical achievements.  Clarity: This paper is really well structured. I particularly liked the a very clear summary of the main contribution of the paper in the introduction section and its related work section. It did provide a great overview of the paper that the reader can focus on the core concepts.  Originality: As pointed out in the related work section of this paper, learning under EBC was not explored intensively yet; thus making this paper novel. The suggested algorithm (SA) is also new to field with various strengths against other baseline methods.  Significance: The paper showed solid contributions on this field as a new pioneer of ERM under EBC.  Conclusion: I believe this is a solid paper, probably not the best paper though.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Post rebuttal: Thanks authors for clarifying concerns.
