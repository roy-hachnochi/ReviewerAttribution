Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of multi-objective decision making. It is an extremely relevant problem for many applications. It is often the case that a decision making agent must balance several competing objectives. They study this problem using the concept of Pareto optimality. They focus on situation where two competing principals have different beliefs on the current state. The main result is theoretical, the authors show that the agent will maximize the principal’s utility whose belief is the most accurate. Detailed comments: Overall, the paper is well-written and pleasant to read. Good high-level explanations are provided. This paper should have more experiments. The author should have chosen a POMDP environment to be more consistent with the rest of the paper. It is not really clear what is the belief of the two agents. What observation does the NRL receive?  The authors provide a lot of interesting qualitative insights but the empirical verification of the results could have been stronger if carried on different POMDP environment. The NRL framework could be better motivated and applied to a more significant application than the one demonstrated here.  It seems like this work could be connected to the Interactive POMDP framework.  This paper and supplementary materials are missing a background section introducing the notations.  Minor: - Typo in the subscripts in section 3? S1, O1, A1. (l126-127) - It would have been useful to write a formal version of Harsanyi’s theorem.  - Quality of figure 2 - L251 missing figure number - Writing style in the conclusion  Response to the author comments: The authors addressed my concern on the POMDP formulation of the example.
