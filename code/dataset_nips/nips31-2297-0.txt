This paper studies the dictionary selection problem. Given a large dictionary, the goal is to approximate many points using a small subset of atoms from the dictionary. The authors analyze the previous Replacement Greedy algorithm for dictionary selection objectives and then propose a variant called Replacement OMP. They show that Replacement OMP achieves comparable performance to dictionary selection/learning methods on standard datasets. They also provide extensions to an online problem and generalized structured sparsity constraints.  Quality/Originality: This paper builds on existing work in an interesting and novel way. Proofs appear to be correct.  Significance: This paper develops new theory to prove guarantees on dictionary selection, which improves on previous work from several years ago.  Clarity: Generally a pleasure to read, but I notice that on line 50: "Replacement OMP have"  Questions: How would the guarantee of Theorem 4.3 differ for Replacement Greedy? Is there any intuition for when the performance of the 2 proposed algorithms would differ?   --------- EDIT: After reading the author response, I feel that they have addressed my minor question about Theorem 4.3. They also addressed the concerns of other reviewers. Therefore I am keeping my review as clear accept.
