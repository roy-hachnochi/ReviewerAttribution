The paper deals with the misinformation spread in online social networks where multiple competing "positive" and "negative" (misinformation) campaigns are launched simultaneously and arbitrary number of cascades is allowed. The misinformation spread then is modeled as a combinatorial optimization where the number of "negative" cascades is minimized.  Strengths  - The novelty of the paper is the extension of existing work on modeling misinformation propagation in social media to multiple cascades run simultaneously.   - The problem of the misinformation propagation in social media is significant and timely given the recent proved intervention of bots and social influencers in national elections.  - The model of cascade priority is interesting and clearly defined.  Weekenesses  - The paper lucks clarity and some bits need to be explained more rigorously. For example, in the abstract DTIME is introduced without a definition of what is this. Similarly, in the introduction the concepts of M and P-dominant cascade priorities are mentioned  while they are only explained in later sections.  - Evaluation is pretty limited. It could be extended to cover a broader range of news stories (and topics) on Twitter. For example, claims made by candidates during the US Presidential election, Brexit or the global warming etc.. You could also focus on evaluating your model on the misinformation diffusion for different "fake news" or propaganda outlets and compare the differences.

User accounts or media sources?  - Line 60: "nontrivial upper bound". What a trivial upper bound would be?  - Lines 74-75: Sentence needs to be rephrased  - Lines 99-101: You could mention that cascade priority will be defined later in section 5.1
