The submission could have been written with more clarity despite an interesting proposed framework. At times, the language and phrasing comes across more convoluted than how it could have been expressed. However, the proposed method is creative in its approach and would be a valuable contribution to the BCI field. Addressing constraints and concerns with the method proposed would also have been welcome, alongside the proposed future research within ALS.
