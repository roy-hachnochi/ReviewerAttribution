The authors propose a new notion of fairness called metric multifairness and show how to achieve it, i.e. "treat similar sub-populations of individuals similarly"  The intuition and rationale behind the fairness through computationally-bounded awareness principle are well-explained and can be summarized as "while information-theoretically, we canâ€™t hope to ensure fair treatment across all subpopulations, we can hope ensure fair treatment across efficiently-identifiable subpopulations."  My main concern is that this application driven work does not provide realistic examples of how the proposed metric and approach work be used. An experimental assessment of the approach would be valuable in this regard as well.   Minor: some typos, e.g. mteric -> metric -- I read the author response
