This paper proposed a series of adaptive negative curvature descent strategies to approximate the smallest eight-value of Hessian by the current gradient’s magnitude. Both deterministic and stochastic non-convex optimization have been considered. The algorithm terminate condition and time complexity were reported.   The idea seems interesting and make sense for me. However, I am afraid the details of this work is not clearly stated. For example, in Algorithm 5, if the condition in step 5 is not satisfied, who will be return? The experimental part is also weak. I am afraid only reporting the oracle calls are not convincing. Other measures, average statistical results, or visual results can be considered to illustrate the superior of their algorithms. Furthermore, why the baseline method NCD are not reported in stochastic case in Figure 1?  Finally, some presentation issues should also be fixed. For example, in line 9 of abstract, the state “we propose an adaptive NCD to allow for an adaptive error dependent on …” should be revised.
