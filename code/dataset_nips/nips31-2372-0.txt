The paper states a list of desirable properties for distortion measure for embeddings including scale and shift invariance, robust handling of outliers and noise. They then proposes a specific measure that satisfies those properties: the measure essentially looks at the variance of the standard distortion over randomly chosen pair of points. They show that this measure satisfies all the properties. They show that for any metric space can be embedded into O(log n) dimensional euclidean space with constant distortion under their new definition. For a metric space with constant doubling dimension they show that any finite set of sampled points can be embedded with constant distortion into constant dimensional Eucliean space.They also show using experiments that their distortion measure is better than other standard ones.  The writing and the presentation is fair, but the novelty and strength of the contribution seems low for this conference. I was unable to open the supplementary material.  It looks like the experiments are only done over synthetically generated data. To demonstrate the utility of the measure it would have been better to show this in some way over real data sets.
