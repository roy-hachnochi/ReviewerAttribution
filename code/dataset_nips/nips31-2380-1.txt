Population risk is ultimately of interest in machine learning and statistics, while a direct optimization acting at the population risk is impossible due to some unknown measurements, or it is unreasonable due to the purpose of privacy preservation. This paper is to find an approximate Local minima of the underling function $F$ by implementing a simple zero-order SGD for an approximate function of $F$. Moreover, the authors proved that the proposed algorithm is optimal under some framework. Finally, they provided a popular example to show their theoretical results clearly. In summary,  I believe that  the current paper is well written and has significant contribution in the literature of nonvex optimization, and particularly established some deep theoretical concussions for their proposed algorithm.
