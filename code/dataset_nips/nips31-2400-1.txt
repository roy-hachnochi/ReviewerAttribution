This paper improves on previous work on capturing the directional coupling spike behaviour of large neuronal systems.   Previous work used synthetic data from the Izhikevich model of neuronal activity behaviour (a simpler model than the well-known Hodgkin-Huxley set of differential equations), the kinetic Ising model and mean field theory for approximate inference. The present paper develops a slightly simplified analytical solution to the equations, which are subsequently applied to the more sophisticated Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal activity model i(the synthetic data part) and real data from cortical neurons of the rat. It appears that although not perfect, the mathematical model performs well when choosing the right parameters.  Quality; well-written and relatively easy to follow paper that has a clear goal and outcome. Clarity: clear structure. Content presumes quite some basic knowledge in neuroscience research, so it may not be too clear for people outside of neuroscience. Originality: the main contribution is the analytical formula (I have no idea whether this is original; I can immagine that similar ideas have been stated before), where the rest of the paper follows previously done research, however in a scholarly way. Significance: moderate.
