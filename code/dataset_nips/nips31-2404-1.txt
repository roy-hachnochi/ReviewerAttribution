This papers proposes a pairwise version of the generalisation of BTL models for the setting of group comparisons (e.g. tournaments of teams games). Instead of considering the score of a group to be the sum of the scores of its components, this work propose to build it as the sum of the scores over the pairs of players to model interactions. Then, they add a factorization on the pairwise matrix to improve the scalability of the method and provides theoretical guarantees on the reconstruction error of this problem.  The overall quality of the paper is ok.  EDIT: The model is clearly explained but the positioning against feature-based methods would benefit from being more detailed, as player interactions can intuitively be learnt from feature similarities / complementarities. A logistic regression is present as a baseline, but there is very few insight about why features fail to capture the interactions, making the proposed method needed.  The paper is well-organised but I have some remarks on clarifications to make: - The theoretical guarantees provided are not well-explained and discussed. It took me a certain time to understand the objective was to only to study the sample complexity and that the f^* was the loss-dependent and class-of-function dependent. The notation is a bit confusing. - The paper could be a bit more polished: l.172 I guess you mean to refer to appendix and not section 2 of the paper / please make sure all the equations are fitting the format.  While the model is well-described and supported, it is a combination of familiar techniques. The BTL on the scores of the groups is already existing, the factorization method based on minimizing the nuclear norm is not new. The main novelty is to build the score of the groups as the sum over the pairs and not over the individuals.  In the end, the approach seems convincing, but does not represent a major breakthrough.
