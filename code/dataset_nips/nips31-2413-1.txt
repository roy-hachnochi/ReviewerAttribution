Summary:  This paper uses meta-learning to solve unsupervised learning problem, especially the clustering problem. The author formulates the meta-unsupervised learning problem, and mentions several possible applications. In the experiments, the author shows that the proposed meta-unsupervised learning problem is helpful to solve some interesting clustering problem, such as deciding the number of clusters and selecting more useful clustering algorithms.  strengths:  1. Theoretical justifications are nice. 2. The proposed application in deciding the number of clusters is useful.  weaknesses:  1. Symbols are a little bit complicated and takes a lot of time to understand. 2. The author should probably focus more on the proposed problem and framework, instead of spending much space on the applications. 3. No conclusion section  Generally I think this paper is good, but my main concern is the originality. If this paper appears a couple years ago, I would think that using meta-learning to solve problems is a creative idea. However, for now, there are many works using meta-learning to solve a variety of tasks, such as in active learning and reinforcement learning. Hence, this paper seems not very exciting. Nevertheless, deciding the number of clusters and selecting good clustering algorithms are still useful.
