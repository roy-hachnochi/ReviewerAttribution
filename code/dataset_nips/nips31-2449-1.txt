The paper studies whether existing perceptual laws could hold under different, non-optimal, neural codings. In that respect, it generalizes previous results that showed that perceptual laws could arise from efficient neural coding.   The paper is very well written, the formal parts very well developed and the material is finely organized. As a reader who hasn't had previous exposure with the literature cited, I get the impression that the authors expand substantially on previously results and it would be a good contribution to the conference.    My main point of critique would be that the authors assume that the reader is a specialist, while a conference like NIPS is much more generalist. For instance, both bias and discriminability are loaded with meaning in the machine learning (bias-variance dilemma) and psychophysics/neuroscience literatures (different variants of signal detection theory). How do the terms employed by the authors connect with these commonly used terms?  I get the impression that discriminability is used as in signal-detection theory in psychophysics and cognitive psychology. It would help a lot if the authors could give a precise example of the problem that the cognitive system they theorize about has to solve.  In reference [1], on which the paper is based, the task solved and these terms were quite clearly explained. In the current publication, the meaning of these terms is, unfortunately, somewhat obscured.
