The authors study efficient coding in neural populations and generalize previous results on a link between discriminability and perceptual bias to a larger family of population codes. In particular, they show that the relationship holds whenever Fisher information is allocated proportional to a power of the prior distribution and compute the constant of proportionality. This is interesting, as previous work had relied on optimal codes where Fisher information is related to the square of the prior. To this extent that I was able to check the derivations, they seem correct. This is an interesting contribution to the neural coding literature. Figure 2B: The three-dimensional figures does not help understanding.  Figure 2D: I find the plot for linearization of the relationship not really convincing.
