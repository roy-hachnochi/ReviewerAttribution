This paper presents an unsupervised invariance induction framework for neural networks that learns a split representation of data through competitive training between a prediction task and a reconstruction task. An adversarial instantiation of this framework and the corresponding analysis are provided. Experimental results on benchmark dataset are reported and discussed.  Pros.  1. In general this paper is clearly organized and well written. The idea is novel and well motivated. An interesting unsupervised invariance induction framework is presented, with sufficient justifications. The technical details are easy to follow. 2. Empirical evaluations on different tasks are conducted and discussed. The proposed method achieves quite promising performance and outperforms many state-of-the-art algorithms. 3. Section 2 presents a very nice review of related work in the field.  Cons. 1. One key component in the proposed framework is using a dropout layer as the noisy-transformer. More justifications should be provided. Other options for the noisy-transformer shall be discussed as well. 2. For experiments on domain adaptation reported in Section 5.3, two baselines DANN (JMLR, 2016) and VFAE (ICLR 2016) are employed. More recent baselines should be considered, such as [a].
