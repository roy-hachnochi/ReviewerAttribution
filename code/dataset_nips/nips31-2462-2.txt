The paper considers online gradient descent for multi-agent learning. For problems where the gradient feedback is available with some probability, the authors employ the reweighting technique of Exp3. The convergence of reweighted OGD to a Nash equilibria is proven for general continuous games.    Extending the theoretical results for a more general class of games is a useful result, however, I would welcome some more practical motivation for the relevance of the result. The reweighting is a standard idea, but proving the convergence for the modified algorithm for multi-agent games is helpful.   Minor issues: - line 161: it should be A_i instead of X_i. There are a few occurrences of `x' later as well. - line 203: convext -> convex (probably spell checking needed). - footnotes are overused; e.g., footnote 6 defines a distance used in Theorem 4.3. This is really an odd way to state a theorem.
