This paper generalize the additive Noise Model to a mixture model and propose a clustering mechanism to find the latent class and a GPPOM to learn the latent parameters. This paper also includes an identifiability condition for ANM-MM.  The structure is clear and well-organized. However, I have some concerns that need further clarification from the authors:    - In line 76, the assumption about $\theta $ independent of the cause X according to postulate 1, which may not holds, because the postulate 1 assume that the function f is independent to the DISTRIBUTION of cause but not independent the cause.   - The theorem 1 is proven under an implicit assumption that we have already known the latent cluster c for each sample. However, there is no guarantee that the clusters are recoverable even when the k-means reach the global optimum.  - In the experiments, this method seems unable to run on a larger samples size, which may be restrictive and unconvincing. Especially, the experiments on the Tuebingen cause-effect pairs, samples size of which are range from a hundred to ten thousand, however, this paper only samples 90 points on each pair.  words: - The two abbreviations -- generating mechanism (g.m.), random variables (r.v.s) -- are not commonly used, which is not a good style.  typos: - Line 59: is it $a_{c} \geq 0$? - Line 156: an sample =>a sample
