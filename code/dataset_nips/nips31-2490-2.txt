The paper extends the additive noise model for causal inference, which assumes independece of mechanism and noise but allows for nonlinear fucntional forms and non-Gaussian noise, to the case where the data are generated from multiple causal mechanisms with the same causal relations but different fuctional parameters, ANM-MM. The paper provides a type of of identifiability condition more restrictive than the general ANM and propopses a procedure for fitting the mixture model.   The approach appears to be sound and reasonable given theoretical results from previous approaches.   The empirical results are generally good, though not distinguishable from non-mixture approachs, e.g. ECP, in all simulations. The application to the cause-effect pairs dataset without significant discussion is confusing, however - are each of these paris assumed to be generated from multiple models? How are the number of models determined? There is a worry that by adding different numbers of mixtures without explicit motivation this is overfitting the dataset.  In general the paper is well written and the procedure is well explained. The paper could do a better job motivating the approach earlier on. We dont get a clear motivating example until the end of the paper, the BAFU air data. Prior to this, ti was not clear whether the paper was attempting to force a combination of ANMs with GP-LVM without clear motivation.   Summary: The paper extends the additive noise model to the case where data are obtained from multiple casual models with the same causal relations but different functional parameters. The paper is sound, well written, and novel, though it's not clear how much this advances the state of the art given questions regarding how much more accurate it is than non-mixture approaches and how widely applicable this approach is.
