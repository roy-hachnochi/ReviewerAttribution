 Summary: this paper proposed some online and approximate PI algorithms. The authors also provide a thorough analysis for the proposed algorithms. The proposed algorithm generalised a previous work 1-step-greedy policy. The analysis is thorough to understand the properties and guaranteed performance of k-greedy policy. The authors found out that the proposed method k-greedy policy does not guarantee to perform better than 1-step policy. From this finding, the paper proposes ways to circumvent this and thus obtain some non-trivial performance guarantees.  Overall: In general, the paper is very well written. The ideas are solid with detailed analysis from which circumvent ideas can be proposed. Though analysis is based on many previous work, the results are significant. Thought the algorithm and analysis are theoretically sound, it would be nicer if the paper has a small set of proof-concept experiments like ones in [5].   - Section 5: Does the generative model G(\nu,\pi) have any specific dependencies on \nu and \pi? Or is it just the underlying environment for a RL problem?  - Analysis is based on an assumption of discrete problems. I wonder how the idea and analysis can be extended to the case of large or continuous problem. Could the authors make any comments on this?    * Minor comments:  - Line 256 page 8: should it be (1-\xi) at denominator of the term after ".r.. is that ..."  - In Algorithm 2 and 3, the notation for G_{\kappa,\delta,\nu} is inconsistent.
