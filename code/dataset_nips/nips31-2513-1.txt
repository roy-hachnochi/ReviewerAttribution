This paper develops a theory for minimax linear regression in online setting, by extending the previous study by Bartlett et al. (2015). Overall, the paper is clearly written and the result is appealing.   - The interpretation as a follow-the-regularized leader strategy is interesting. It would be more interesting if this interpretation (in particular, the form of regularization) can be explained intuitively.  - Is it difficult to extend the results to other loss functions?  - Is it possible to generalize the results to other regression models such as logistic regression? If not, where does the difficulty arise?
