The paper presents two new algorithms for solving the sparse linear regression problem, and show that the proposed methods have a better sample complexity compared to the existing methods. Different from the popular RIP or linear independence assumptions, the paper assumes restricted smoothness and restricted strong convexity instead.   Just one question: I assume the H_s above line 117 and in Algorithm 1  is a projection, but it seems not defined in the draft?
