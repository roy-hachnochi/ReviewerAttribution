Unlike vision where we have a very good understanding of the structure of the input space, olfaction is very tricky - not only are there a lot of different receptors making the input space very high dimensional but also we completely lack intuition about the structure of the space. The manuscript proposes a sophisticated variational estimation procedure for finding a low dimensional embedding of olfactory stimuli that could help build intuitions about this space.   I like this paper a lot - the idea of defining tuning functions using the embedding is clever, the technical part is solid and generally well explained, and the potential neuroscience implications are significant.  A few minor comments: 1) since the model is pretty complicated, it may be useful to have the corresponding graphical model in fig1. 2) on pg4: the Kronecker tricks needed to derive the covariance are nice but very hard to parse as written. Worth thinking a bit if one can streamline the explanation for this bit. 3) It may be because of the lack of space but the explanation of the model selection bit (noise cov rank + latent dimensionality) is hard to follow.  4) If the inferred number of latents is 10 cf text or so and the first 2 dimensions already capture what we knew about the odour topology (cf fig2) what do the rest of the dimensions do?   Post authors' reply: "can one get additional insight into the structure of odor space by looking at more than the first 2 dimensions?" was not really addressed in the reply. What I was really asking was about the biological interpretability of the remaining 8 latent dimensions.
