I really like the paper. The authors provide the detailed analysis of the hashing trick (a.k.a. sparse random projection, a.k.a. count-sketch). Namely, how does the number of rows depends on the "spread" of the mass of the vector, desired distortion and the probability of success? The paper figures out the answer that is sharp up to a constant for all of the regimes!  The proof follows by now standard technique of bounding higher moments, but to accomplish this, one needs hairy combinatorial considerations. Overall, I think the result is more interesting than the proof, but the result is great!  Two minor comments:  * Hashing trick was used for the nearest neighbor search (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02897). This should be cited along with other applications. * The title of Section 3 has a typo.
