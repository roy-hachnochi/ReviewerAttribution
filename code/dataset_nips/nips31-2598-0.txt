The Authors address the task of matching peptides (protein fragments) to tandem MS (mass spectrometry) spectra, an important step in identifying the protein content of biological samples, and expand the parameter learning capabilities of Didea, a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) scoring function, by deriving Convex Virtual Emissions (CVEs), a class of emission distributions for which conditional maximum likelihood learning is concave. CVEs are shown to generalize the widely-used log-sum-exp function; and incorporating CVEs into Didea greatly improves its PSM identification accuracy.   The paper is clearly written, though I’d argue for a different split of topics between the main text and supplementary information. To the best of my knowledge, CVEs are novel and of wide applicability; and, importantly, the demonstrated improvements in accuracy and run time seem convincing.   Specific comments 1. Section 4.3 (and the corresponding supplementary text) proves that Didea’s scoring function lower bounds XCorr’s. While an interesting result and, as noted, a promising future direction, it seems somewhat orthogonal to the main theme of the paper; perhaps move section 4.3 to supplementary information or save all discussion for a separate future publication? 2. Reported improvement in performance in sections 5 (multi-parameter Didea) and 5.1 (+ Fisher kernel post-processing) are numerically identical; is this expected? A coincidence?  3. Fig 4, why not combine with Fig 3, and show all methods side-by-side?   Minor comments Line 121: (described Section 4.3), “in” is missing; l158 and Fig 2: equation for M’_t seems wrong, should be M’_{t+1}? l171: log p(\tau_0, x, z), should be s instead of z?
