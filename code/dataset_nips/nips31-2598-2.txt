SUMMARY This work is about the identification of peptide sequences in tandem mass spectrometry. The underlying problem is to assemble a set of mass peaks representing peptide fragments to a full peptide sequence (which would be the de-novo version of this problem), or to derive a matching score for petptides in a database (which is the version considered here). The de-facto standard methods for this purpose are variants of HMMs or dynamic Bayes nets. The main idea proposed here is to use a specific emission distribution which leads to a concave (conditional) likelihood, thereby simplifying and speeding-up inference.    EVALUATION: clarity: the paper is easy to read, and together with the supplementary material, the derivation is easy to follow. novelty & significance: the main methodological contribution is the definition and characterization of  Bayesian network emission distributions which generalize the convex log-sum-exp function. Applied in the contex of DBN scoring within the Didea model, the conditional log-likelihood becomes concave in the parameters, thus giving theoretical gurantees for convergence to the global optimum. I consider this as a significant contribution. experimental evaluation: equipped with the new emission models, Didea has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art scoring algorithms on bench-mark datasets.
