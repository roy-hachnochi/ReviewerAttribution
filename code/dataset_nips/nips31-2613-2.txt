In this work, the authors propose a novel model-free policy search algorithm, namely POIS, which explicitly accounts for uncertainty introduced by the importance sampling by optimizing an objective function that captures the trade-off between the estimated performance improvement and variance injected by the importance sampling.   The central idea is to use Rényi divergence and derive the surrogate loss like  Equation (9) and Equation (10), which explicitly bound the variance of the importance sampling estimator.  One key confusion is the division of the policy optimization methods, I haven’t seen the “control-based” and “parameter-based” categories in the RL literature. Also from the naming of these two categories, it does not mean what the algorithm actually does. Personally, I’d like to view the “parameter-based” method as a Bayesian form parameterization of the policy, whose weights are sampled from some distributions. And they could be merged into a unified form.  I am not an expert on Rényi divergence nor the theoretical proof. Maybe these parts could be checked carefully by other reviewers.   From the experimental results, it’s a bit unsatisfactory that the performance is almost the same as the previous methods, which seem quite a bit more simpler. I’d like to see the actual benefits from the experimental results, i.e., the benefits of explicit modeling the variance of the importance sampling and whether it actually gets reduced.   ==== In the rebuttal, the authors tried to use some better terms to replace "control-based" and "parameter-based". Though the proposed replacement does not seem very satisfactory, the reviewer trusts the authors can find better terms in the final version.  And the authors have clarified the confusion in the experiment part.
