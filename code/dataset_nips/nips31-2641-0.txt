The authors propose a new method to fit a low rank model to a data frame together with covariates or additive (eg row or column) effects. The authors show a guarantee on the results of their method, and give a simple and efficient algorithm for fitting the model.  A few small remarks: * line 29: how do large vs small data frames differ wrt which methods are applicable? * terminology: you call this a low rank model, but instead consider a convex approach and fit a convex model, which need not satisfy any a priori rank bound. You should mention this earlier. * definition of X(k): how do you model column or row effects in this framework? As rank 1 matrices X(k)? If so, these seem very far from sparse, so that the ||X(k)||_1 term that enters the recovery bound is very large! * the connection with robust matrix completion is not clear, since generally both components are assumed to be unknown; whereas here it seems the X(k)s are given. * Theorem 1 is stated very cleanly and is easy to understand. It would be nice to have more interpretation of the bound, though, and suggestions for which parts are not tight. For example, the dependence on 1/pi seems like a gross overestimate; do you think this can be improved? * How big is ||X(k)||_1 usually? It seems like it would often be O(np), which would make your results more or less vacuous. * The setup for the numerical example with survey data should be clearer. What are X(k) here? How many are there?  --- I have read the authors' rebuttal, and found it convincing. I have upgraded my score in light of (my new understanding of) the novelty of the theoretical guarantees and algorithm.
