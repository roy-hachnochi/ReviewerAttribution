The authors provide a new method for computing reparameterization gradients when the target distribution contains a finite number of non-differentiabilities. They derive unbiased gradient estimators for a class of simple non-differentiable densities, and show in experiments that these can lead to improved convergence results in the number of iterations.  The idea is interesting, novel, and formalizes issues with interchanging integration and differentiation that might not be evident to most of the NIPS community.   The paper is well-written and was easy to follow, even though it relies heavily on the supplementary material to formalize most proofs.  It is still somewhat unclear to me whether the method can be made to be competitive also in wall-clock time. Still I believe the paper presents a method, derivation, and results that are illuminating and useful for the community.  Minor Comments: - You define matrix product notation but not dot-product. Would be extra clear on e.g. line 152 to also define this notation because above you use dot to also represent scalar scalar multiplication. - Line 158, is this meant to be just i rather than i'? Or is there another definition of i'?
