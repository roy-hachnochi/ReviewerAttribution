- The work seems interesting but it is at a preliminary stage. Credit to the authors for admitting this and for their honesty.   - The method is sound and potentially useful (after having the run-time issue resolved).   - As mentioned in the experiments and as was clear from the beginning of the methodology, the computational run-time is a massively impeding problem.   - L153: "A surface integral over such a hyperplane can be estimated easily using the following theorem ...": Estimating the surface integral is still tricky and a major bottleneck. I do not think it can be "easily" estimated.   - In equation (1), I reckon it is rather confusing and non-standard to keep the superscript 0 on x noting a specific example of x.  - Writing of the paper has a considerable room for improvement. There are several typos and also the flow of ideas can improve.   - Results of the experimental section are thoroughly analysed.
