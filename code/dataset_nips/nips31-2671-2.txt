This paper studies restricted isometry property (RIP) that is a commonly required condition in matrix recovery. It shows that a small RIP constant is required for the loss function not to have spurious local minima. It proposes an optimization method to find a matrix recovery problem that has a reasonably small RIP constant and has spurious local minima.  This paper also empirically justified the common observation that SGD can escape spurious local minima in most cases. The results in this paper shows the different behaviors of SGD in different cases, which shows the complication of SGD analyses.  In general, the results of this paper are interesting and, I believe, will provide further insights into areas like matrix recovery, SGD analyses, and non-convex optimization analyses. However, the main contribution of this paper is only the observation that RIP constant should be small to rule out spurious local minima, which a little bit weak. I'd expect more studies in this direction. For example, it would be interesting to narrow the gap between the current maximal theoretical RIP constant 1/5 and the minimal empirical RIP constant 1/2. Also, it would be great to develop other substitutions of RIP that allow a larger range of feasible problems.  A minor question: In Line 64-65, it is claimed that delta = 1/5 is too restrictive. Is there a quantitative way to describe the restrictiveness?  === post-rebuttal review === I've read the rebuttal and it addresses my question. I also increased the score to 7.
