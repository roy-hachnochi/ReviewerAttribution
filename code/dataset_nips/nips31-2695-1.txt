The goal of this paper is to speed up the greedy MAP inference for determinantal point process (DPP). The proposed algorithm updates the Cholesky facto r incrementally which leads to a lower time complexity compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed algorithm is also verified by online A/B testing and is proven to achieve a better relevance and diversity tradeoff.   Overall speaking, the main contribution of this paper is the lower time complexity compared to other greedy algorithms for MAP inference, although most of the techniques are standard.   The application is interesting. In your long sequence recommendation experiment part, you choose the window length to be w=10. Is your experiment sensitive to the choice of window length? In practice, how to choose w?
