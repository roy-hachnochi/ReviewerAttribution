# Summary This paper proposes a new method named Rest-Katsyusha which combines the noble method Katsyusha and restarting methods to accelerate convergence and make the method adaptive respect to the restricted strong convexity (although it is just a heuristics). By using the effective restricted strong convexity, this paper shows the accelerated linear convergence rates of Rest-Katsyusha up to a statistical tolerance. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in experiments.  # Detailed comments This paper is well written and easy to read. In short, motivation is also good. Since the strong convexity is unrealistic in high-dimensional settings, to relax it to restricted strong convexity is one of the major topic in the literature, recently. In addition, I think this paper is the first attempt to show an accelerated convergence rate up to a statistical tolerance in this setting.  One concern is the readability of the proof of Theorem 3.4.  * The notation of random variable (2) in supplement. line 16: \xi_k^t -> i_k^t ?. In addition, the number of stochastic gradient evaluations in each outer loop is $mS$ rather than $k$. Thus, indices in equation (2) is not good.  * I think the proof is correct, but somewhat confusing because an inequality $\epsilon_t > \epsilon$ seems to be assumed without declaration.
