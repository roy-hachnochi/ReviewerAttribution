The authors consider the problem of online linear optimization through an access to an approximation oracle. The paper focuses on decreasing the number of oracle access per round while providing the same alpha-regret as the state-of-the-art.    Specifically, the authors show that under full information Algorithm 1 attains O(sqrt(T)) alpha-regret with O(log(T)) oracle calls per round. Under bandit feedback Algorithm 3 attains O(T^{2/3}) alpha-regret with total O(T^{2/3} log(T)) calls in T rounds.   The key innovation is the use of the online mirror descent algorithm for online learning aided with the oracle calls, which enables the improvements in terms of oracle calls.   Pros: * The paper significantly improves upon the best known results in online linear optimization with access to approximation oracles. Both under full information and bandit feedback the proposed algorithms improve upon the number of oracle access per round. * The results on full feedback consider a more general oracle than alpha-approximation oracle.  * The exposition is precise and the writing is fluent. The Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 are easy to follow. The proofs are novel and clearly presented in the supplementary material. Cons: * In Table 1, the authors provide $\tilde{O}(1)$ as the bounds on the number of calls to the oracle on each round. It is not appropriate as $\tilde$ notation is used when hidden factors are smaller than the one presented. The authors may use $O(log(T))$ as the bound * The paper is theoretical and lacks any experimental validation or comparison. * The continuous multiplicative weight update algorithm and its guarantees are completely deferred to Appendix B in the supplementary material. This makes the results inaccessible from the main paper.  * The importance of the polynomial time sampling from a log-concave distribution in the proposed algorithm is completely omitted from the main body of the paper. Further,  in Appendix D the connection of such sampling to the proposed algorithms is not clearly written. * The geometric intuition of Lemma 3.8 needs more elaboration.
