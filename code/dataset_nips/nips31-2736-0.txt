The paper examines the long term behaviour of learning with bandit feedback in non-cooperative concave games. This is an interesting application that I am not aware of being addressed from the bandit perspective before. The papers provides a clear introduction to and motivation of the problem. It is clearly written with sufficient references. There are also multiple examples of possible applications of the proposed algorithms. The main drawback of the paper is lack of any experimental results, which would make some of the discussed methods easier to understand in an intuitive way.
