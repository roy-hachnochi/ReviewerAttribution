The paper proposes an initialization for noisy rectifier neural network.For multiplicative noise the paper shows that a similar analysis to Poole et al can be carried to obtain recursive equations for infinite number of hidden layers, then by solving the fixed point equation one finds the correct initialization. for additive noise the paper shows that the fixed point equation does not have a solution.   The paper has nice insights on better initialization when using dropout noise and draws  nice comparisons and  connections   to Xavier an  He initialization. Given those initializations the paper shows that one can trainer deeper models. Overall a nice paper with useful insights.
