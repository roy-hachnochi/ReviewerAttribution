Summary of the paper: This paper presents a fast algorithm for optimal transport, and specifically the 2-Wasserstein distance, that does not rely on regularization. The main contributions of the paper are: 1) an interpretation of the optimal transport problem in d-dimensional space as a network flow over a (d+1)-partite graph; 2) an algorithm that scales very well with the number of grid points and outperforms competing methods.  Clarity: Excellent. The paper is very clear, and the algorithm and theoretical contributions were easy to follow. I appreciated the level of detail and illustrative figures.  Originality: Above average.  Significance: Above average.  Detailed comments. Overall, I liked the way the paper is presented. I found the details very clear, and the resulting algorithm is easy to understand and reimplement. My own misgiving is that the method seems restricted to grids for spaces whose ground metric is Euclidean.  I have a few extra comments: + In Figure 3, and Section 4 it is not clear how the experiments are structured. What are the source and target distributions for each of the examples?  + Table 3 shows some results in higher dimensions, but is still restricted to dimension 4. Is there a small, high-dimensional data set that you could use on which Sinkhorn/LP do not run out of time or memory and on which you could see the dependence of dimension on the running time and memory of your algorithm?  + Do you know how/if your method could be adapted to the barycenter problem?  [Rebuttal acknowledged;  My opinion has not changed while reading the rebuttal. If anything, the authors have responded to all my questions and comments. I still believe the paper is well above the acceptance threshold. The only issue remaining for me is the lack of an example with really high dimensionality.]
