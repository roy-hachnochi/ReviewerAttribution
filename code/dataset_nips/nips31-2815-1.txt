 This paper proposes CapProNet, which uses a (capsule) vector rather than a neuron to represent class labels. The feature vector of an input sample is projected to a parametrized subspace. The idea is inspired by the capsule network, but the implementation is much simper and the computational cost is very small.  Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN with different model architecture show the proposed model consistently improves the performance.  In general, the proposed model is simple and effective and the experiments are thorough. The authors claim the computational overhead of the proposed model is small, but why you experiment your model only on small scale dataset? It will be very interesting to see how the model perform on large scale dataset (i.e., imagenet).
