This paper proposes efficient training algorithms for the block floating point (BFP) format which is often adopted for quantized computation and hardware accelerator explorations for neural network training. Specifically, the paper proposes hybrid BFP-FP training algorithm as well as approaches to manage the numerical efficiency of different mantissa and exponent bits.  I find the paper very well written in the sense that, it clearly lays out the problem statement as well as existing work on this topic, highlighting the possibility of reduced bits in section 3. Section 4 then proceeds to explain the motivations of HBFP's hybrid choice, as well as approaches to manage the efficiency of BFP by tiling and storing wide weight floats. The experimentation section gives a thorough study of the different approaches as well as the baseline fp32 approaches. Overall, this is a quite solid paper that, although not mathematically deep, explores a lot of the engineering and statistics front of reduced precision training. As a result I would recommend the paper be accepted.
