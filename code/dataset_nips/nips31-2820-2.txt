Paper summary ----------------  Learning classifiers under noisy labels is one important issue because of their ubiquities. Since noisy labels are corrupted from ground-truth labels by an unknown noise transition matrix, the paper proposes to estimate the matrix with human assistance. Based on human cognition for invalid class transitions, the paper proposes to speculate the structure of the noise transition matrix. The idea is to derive a structure-aware probabilistic model, which incorporates a structure prior. Technically, the paper addresses structure extraction and alignment. Experiments validate the improvement of robustness of classifiers.  Paper summary ----------------  The paper is well motivated by carefully figuring out the major issues and making noisy label learning more practical. The proposed method is reasonable and makes sense, which is interesting as well. Theoretical support is also given. Experimental results are good enough. Finally, the paper is well organized. There are some concerns for the paper.  1. In the part of structure extraction, the paper focuses on a general model which is good. However, it is not intuitive. More intuitive examples or illustrations are needed. 2. The paper introduces human cognition. That would also bring uncertainty simultaneously. How to fix this problem?  ------------- The author response is fine for me. I'd like to keep my evaluation the paper.
