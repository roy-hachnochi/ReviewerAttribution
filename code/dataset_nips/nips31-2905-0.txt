This paper provided the first theoretical analysis of the popular “TopK” sparsification-based communication reduction technique. The proposed approach is fairly general, which  should extend to methods combining sparsification with quantization by reduced precision, and methods using approximate quantiles. Overall, the presentation of this paper is good. The related works and different research pesperctives for communication efficient distributed sgd are well overviewed and organized . While I'm not an expert in the topic of this paper, I have no idea about the originality and significance of the theoretical results and proof techniques. The main idea of the paper looks sound and good. The experiments are well designed. I think the paper is good. One minor thing, the reference 12, 13 are duplicated.
