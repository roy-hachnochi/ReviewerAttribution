The paper presents a method for establishing dense correspondences between a pair of images. Rather than employing a neural network to generate the output flow in one pass, the paper uses a recurrent neural network to achieve the goal. The motivation comes from iterative methods for non-rigid alignment, where each step employs a simple deformation to progressively improve the alignment result. The nice thing is that simple deformation can be nicely encoded using a neural network rather than the sophisticated deformation between a pair of images.   The paper realizes this goal by designing a recurrent neural network where the current deformation is constantly fit as input into the neural network for improvement. In addition, the paper introduces a weakly supervised loss for training the recurrent neural network. The experimental results justify the usefulness of the approach.  On the downside, I would like to see a direct comparison between this approach and non-rigid image alignment. At least for the examples shown in the paper, we can use SIFT/FC7 to guide a (grid-based) deformation field that aligns the two images.   In addition, it is unclear how to handle partial similarities. Is it possible to modify the network or the loss function to focus on a partial region?  Overall, I recommend accepting the paper based on the novelty of the approach.  Minor comments:  1) Please articulate the motivation of the paper. 2) Discuss the limitations. Can you handle objects under drastically different viewpoints? 3) The notations are very involved. Please consider using a table to summarize the meaning of all the notations.   Post rebuttal: The rebuttal addresses some of my concerns. However, I would not change my score. I was hoping for a comparison with non-deep learning based image alignment technique, e.g., those used in aligning medical images.
