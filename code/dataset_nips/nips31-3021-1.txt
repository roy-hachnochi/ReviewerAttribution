After rebuttal: I am now convinced that the results of the paper cannot be obtained as a direct consequence of known results. ----------- The paper studies an online convex optimization problem with long-term cumulative constraints, where the quantity representing the long-term constraint is of the form $\sum_{t=1}^T(g_i(x_t))_+^2$ instead of the basic form $\sum_{t=1}^Tg_i(x_t)$.  I am sorry to say that I was not convinced by the motivation of studying such a special form of constraints: - Why not just define auxiliary constraint functions $\tilde{g}_i := g_i_+^2$ and apply known algorithms for the basic form of constraints ? Would it work? If so, how is the new algorithm better? - Why not more general form of nonnegative constraint functions $g_i$ ?    A consequence of the proposed algorithm (advertised at the end of p4), is that constraint violations for each single steps $(g_i(x_t))_+$ are bounded. But I have the feeling that one could simply define auxiliary constraint functions $\tilde{g}_i := (g_i)_+$ and apply known algorithms which would provide upper bounds on \[ \sum_{t=1}^T\tilde{g}_i(x_t) = \sum_{t=1}^T (g_i(x_t))_+ \] which would obviously imply upper bounds on each $(g_i(x_t))_+$ ...  Moreover, it seems to me that a simple way of simultaneously obtaining upper bounds on various quantities is to increase the number of constraint functions. For instance defining $\tilde{g}_i := (g_i)_+$ for $i=1,\dots, m$ and $\tilde{g}_{(i+m)} := (g_i)_+^2$ for $i=1,\dots,m$ and then applying known algorithms to get upper bounds on $\sum_{t=1}^T\tilde{g}_i(x_t)$ for $i=1,\dots,2m$.
