This paper proposes a non-autoregressive state space model for sequence generation. It builds on flow-based variational inference and uses an importance weighted evidence lower bound to shift the complexity from the generative to the inference model. The paper then performs evaluation on word generation from the BooksCorpus dataset.  Quality: Strengths: The paper is well-motivated and tackles a common problem: non-autoregressive generation of sequences. The model is elegant and the results are thorough and strong compared to the autoregressive baseline. The graphs of the entropy gap and entropy analysis are useful.  Weaknesses: The limit in word length to be at most length 12 makes it hard to know if this approach generalizes to longer sequences. For example, at what sequence lengths does this start to break down? What is the cross-entropy of the baseline that was trained without autoregressive inputs? The network sizes are quite small. Only state sizes of 8 and 16 are considered which are much smaller than standard models. Why weren't larger state sizes used? Table 2 seems like it should also include results from Real-NVP.  Clarity: Weaknesses: The description of normalizing flows in the last part of section 2.2 could be much improved.

Significance: The work has significance for the growing area of non-autoregressive sequence generation.  === POST-REBUTTAL === Thanks for responding to my questions. I have kept my accept score.
