This paper considers learning a set of value functions over different tasks and then transferring them to a novel task.   It's not clear to me why there are no existing transfer learning methods that can be compared to. For instance, PG-ELLA ("Online Multi-Task Learning for Policy Gradient Methods", 2014) learns on a set of cart pole tasks and then transfers into a new one.  It's not clear what changing the speed of mountain car means (changing the maximum speed?) or whether this would change the optimal policy.  -----  algorithm is to attempt at characterizing algorithm will figure out which task is solving
