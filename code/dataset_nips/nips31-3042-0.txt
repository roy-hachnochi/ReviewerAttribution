This paper examines the problem of cluster description, in which the clustering algorithm has access to one view of the data, and we would like to explain its output using another view of the data. The problem is interesting and well-motivated.  The authors begin by formulating the problem in terms of clusters and "tags". We wish to describe each disjoint cluster by a disjoint set of tags such that each member of the cluster has at least one of the tags. Perhaps unsurprisingly given its similar appearance to the set cover problem, this is shown by the authors to be NP-complete (though some special subclasses are solvable in polynomial time).  The authors then introduce an extended formulation which requires that the size of the descriptor tag sets is minimized. While still intractable, the formulation lends itself to an ILP. While this ILP often leads to poor explanations of the clustering, the authors introduce the ability to omit data instances and add constraints on which tags can be used together.  Finally, the authors consider the natural relaxation of the cluster description problem in which the tag sets for different clusters need not be disjoint -- but must have a small intersection. It is shown that this relaxation permits a naive polynomial-time algorithm provided that the number of clusters is fixed.  Overall, the paper is clearly written and its results appear sound. Unfortunately, I am not well-equipped to judge the impact that it is likely to have; the NP-completeness of the first formulation perhaps isn't so surprising, and the experiments with the Twitter election data seem to require a large number of constraints to produce satisfactory output. I'll therefore defer to other reviewers who might better be able to ascertain impact.
