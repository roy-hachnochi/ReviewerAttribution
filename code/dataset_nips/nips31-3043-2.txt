This works studies the problem of generalized uniformity testing that was recently introduced by Batu and Canonne (FOCS'17). In this problem, one is given sample access to a distribution over a discrete domain and is asked to determine if the distribution is uniform over some subset of the domain or far in total variation distance from any such distribution. Batu and Canonne showed that O(1)/(|p|_3 eps^6) samples suffice to test up to total variation distance eps, where |p|_3 is the L3 norm of the underlying distribution which is n^(2/3) for a uniform distribution on n elements.  The main result of this paper is pinning down the exact sample complexity of the problem. In particular, it is shown that  1/(|p|_3 eps^(4/3)) + 1/(|p|_2 eps^2) samples are both necessary and sufficient for this problem.  The upper bound works by examining two cases based on the magnitude of eps. It tests which of the terms 1/(|p|_3 eps^(4/3)) and 1/(|p|_2 eps^2) is larger and uses different strategies for each of the cases. To distinguish between them, it uses a method to (roughly) approximate within constant factors the L2 and L3 norms of the distributions by counting collisions.   In the first case where eps is large, the algorithm works by checking whether |p|_3^3 - |p|_2^4 is 0 or not by computing more fine-grained estimations of the norms. A key lemma that enables this algorithm is that the difference is 0 for a uniform distribution and sufficiently far from 0 when the distribution is far from uniform.   The second case where eps is small is easier, as one can afford to recover the support of the distribution. In that case, a standard uniformity tester is performed on the recovered support.  In addition to the upper bounds, the paper shows a lower bound of 1/(|p|_3 eps^(4/3)) + 1/(|p|_2 eps^2). For  the term 1/(|p|_2 eps^2), the standard uniformity testing lower-bound by Paninski applies here. In that lower bound, the distribution is either uniform or (1+eps)/n over a random half of the support and (1-eps)/n on the other half. To get the lower bound for the term 1/(|p|_3 eps^(4/3)), this work uses a similar construction over a random subset of the whole domain. To establish the lower-bound, a Poissonization argument is used together with the method of shared information of Diakonikolas and Kane (FOCS'16).  Overall, I think that this is a very interesting work settling the sample complexity of a very well motivated and natural problem. It improves both upper and lower bounds significantly over the previous work, giving very simple and natural algorithms for testing. The paper is well written and self contained with very intuitive explanations and presents many techniques in simple arguments behind the proofs.  I enjoyed reading the paper and support acceptance.
