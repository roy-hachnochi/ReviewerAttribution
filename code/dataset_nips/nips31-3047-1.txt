This paper introduced a new convolutional layer that computes box filter responses at every location. The papers shows that it is possible to optimise the parameters of the boxes (coordinates) within end-to-end learning process. Experiments show very marginal improvement over standard convolutional networks.  I lead to accept this paper as a poster as I believe the way to optimise for the coordinates of box filters can be useful for designing new networks, although the current paper doesn't show much improvement.  I believe there's potential to better use the introduced box filters. This paper might have *not* properly used the box filters in a conv network.
