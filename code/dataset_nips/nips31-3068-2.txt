Overview:  The paper presents an end-to-end deep neural network architecture that learns how to detect image features, estimate their scale and orientation, and compute a feature descriptor. Unlike existing architectures, the proposed network (dubbed LF-Net) uses 3D information (e.g., depth and relative pose) for the training phase. The paper presents experiments on publicly available datasets where LF-Net shows improvements over the hand-crafted features and competing architectures.  Pros: - End-to-end architecture to learn image features and descriptors. - Formulation exploits 3D information (e.g., depth and relative pose). - Outperforms competing methods.  Cons: - Clarity of the proposed architecture falls short.  Detailed comments:  Overall this is a good work and my main concern has to do with clarity. While I believe that the proposed architecture can detect interest points and describe them well, I found the text and Fig. 1 hard to follow. I think the paper is missing a detailed description guiding the reader about the flow of information in Fig. 1. This can help the reader reproduce this work and understand it better.  I would suggest including   D. DeTone, et al. SuperPoint: Self-Supervised Interest Point Detection and Description. CVPR 2018.   to the experiments if possible, since LF-Net and SuperPoint address the same problem and are end-to-end.
