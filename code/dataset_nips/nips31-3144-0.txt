This paper is interesting and shows some meaningful results for understanding the loss landscape of deep CNNs. However, I do not feel the contribution of a visualization technique is sufficient. Instead of applying the proposed technique to explain the well-known models (and some conclusions are also well-known in deep learning community), it will make the paper stronger if the paper can investigate some new model architectures or loss functions.
