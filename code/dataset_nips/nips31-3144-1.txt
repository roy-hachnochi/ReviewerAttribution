There is little known about the loss landscape of deep neural nets given their many layers and parameters! The authors of the current work propose a new approach for 2D visualization of such landscapes! Even though the proposed method differs from the existing work in terms of a new normalization, the insights that led to this adjustment is elegant. The authors provides different insights into the loss landscape of neural net with different structures and depths and used their visualization tools to justify why certain structure learn better or generalize better! Even though the work lacks any new theoretical understanding (which is not easy for the loss landscape of deep neural network), I enjoyed reading this paper and I believe it confirms some of our previous understandings and questions some others and overall helps us to design more effective DNN structures!  One minor problem: I understand the authors point about the scale invariance property of neural nets when Relu is used but I don't see scale invariance property is generally held for NNs with other non-linear activation functions. All the experiments are also done with Relu! Thus, I would be a bit more precise in the title and text of this paper by pointing this is not for general NNs.
