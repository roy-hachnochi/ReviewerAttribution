In this paper, the authors consider the problem of molecular graph generation and propose GCPN, a generative model based on GCN, RL and Adversarial-training. The proposed model takes turns to compute node embedding of current graph and predict actions to link nodes or halt. It is able to generate chemical molecule with 100% chemical validity and achieves much better performances compared to most recent state-of-the-art.  Quality & Significance: 7. The paper is overall of high quality. The experimental results are very impressive especially given the recent state-of-the-art JTVAE has already achieved significant improvement compared to previously proposed models. However, as RL algorithms are known to be hard to tune, I would suggest the authors release their code soon.  Clarity: 9. This paper is clearly written and very easy to follow and understand.  Originality: 6. There has been attempts for using RL to guide the generation of chemical molecule, and this paper takes one step further to make it work on graph representations.  The paper is a strong step in the topic of molecular graph generation and I would suggest an accept.
