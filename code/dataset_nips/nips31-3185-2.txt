This paper proposes a method for super-resolution of a 3D shape represented as voxel grid, e.g. from 32^3 to 512^3. By and large, the method seems well-founded. Retaining just surface information dramatically reduces the complexity of the representation and allows upscaling to large sizes. An obvious issue is incorrect reconstruction of highly-occluded regions (can be mitigated with more views although internal detail can never be recovered). The paper is well-written and the experiments reasonable in justifying the method. I am not aware of other work on (deep learning-based) 3D super-resolution. I am also not familiar with the large existing body of work on 2D super-resolution, so I cannot comment on the novelty of the method compared to related 2D methods, if any.
