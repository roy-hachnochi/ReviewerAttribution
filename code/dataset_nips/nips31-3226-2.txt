This work is an extension of non-local (NL) neural network [31]. Inspired by SENet [9], the authors generalize the non-local module and take the correlations between the positions of any two channels into account. The dense correlations bring improvements for fine-grained visual tasks.   Strengths:  1. The motivation of the paper is clear. In order to capture the subtle relationships between objects and scenes, they propose dense correlations to extract information from any channels. The writing is good and concise.   Weakness:  1. Technical novelty is limited. There are two contributions in the paper, one is generalized NL module, the other is the compact representation. For the first contribution, it is basically the combination of NL module [31] and group idea [2,8,32,33,35]. For the second contribution, it is the application of compact bilinear pooling from CVPR 2017.   2. The performance improvement is not consistent, and usually quite marginal (below 0.5%). From the visualizations in Figure 4, we may argue that the better performance is brought by the dense connections, not the generalized NL module.
