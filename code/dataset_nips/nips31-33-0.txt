The paper develops a structure-aware convolution neural network to cope with both Euclidean and non-Euclidean structured data.  Strengths:  1) The proposed structure-aware convolution neural network is capable of dealing with both Euclidean and non-Euclidean structured data.  2) It is easy to understand the paper.  Weaknesses:  1) The technical depth of the paper is shallow.  It lacks deep theoretical underpinning.  The key idea is mainly contained in Eq. (5), which is basically kernel approximation using truncated polynomials.  The idea is simple and straightforward.  It does not represent a major breakthrough.  2) The paper mainly conducts empirical studies by applying the proposed structure-aware convolution neural network to various data sets.  But the performance gain is insignificant and the cost is high.
