This work proposes the Kronecker Factored Real-Time Recurrent Learning (KF-RTRL) algorithm, which is inspired from the Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization algorithm (UORO). RTRL discards backpropagation through time (BPTT) by allowing online updates of the parameters, yet it is impractical because of the requirement of high cost of time and space complexity. To ease these difficulties, both KF-RTRL and UORO approximate the true gradient of RTRL so as to reduce the cost. UORO reduces both run time and memory requirement to O(n2). UORO obtains the unbiased but noisy estimate. The proposed KF-RTRL aims to reduce the variance of the approximation at the cost of O(n3) in run time and O(n2) in memory. With a series of inductive steps, the final estimation is an unbiased approximation and the variance is decreased as the order O(nâˆ’1) by introducing the Kronecter factor.  Pros: - The paper is well-written and explained. - Rigorous mathematical proof is provided. Cons: - Although the experiments show that KF-RTRL is better than UORO under RHN, the constraint of RNN architecture is still a nonnegligible concern. - It is not clear whether it is appropriate to consider only the cosine angle in the variance analysis. Optimization should consider both direction and magnitude of the gradient.
