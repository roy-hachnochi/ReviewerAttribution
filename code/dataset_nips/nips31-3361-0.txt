This paper proposes using user intents in a dynamic model to address implicit data that is missing not at random for recommendation system problems.  The technical ideas of this paper seem sound, as does there model evaluation.  I find it particularly compelling that the basic version of the proposed model does not outperform all comparison methods, but that the constrained version does—this shows the importance of the constraints proposed in section 4.  The notion of temporal dynamics being important for modeling the missing ness mechanism is interesting.  The time between ratings can vary (e.g., the time between T and T+1 is different than the time between T+1 and T+2); unless I misunderstood something, it seems like to proposed omen does not take this into account.  Rather, it assumes users are interacting with items evenly across time.  I think the irregularity in these interaction intervals is an important piece of information that is currently being ignored.  The paper is generally well-written, if a bit dense at times—this seems likely due to page limits.  I appreciated the honest discussion of efficiency, the narrative to describe the core model concepts intuitively, and the interpretive results.  As a domain expert that focuses on recommendation systems, I would refer to this paper in citations and conversation regularly (I currently reference the exposure model quite a bit).  The MNAR problem is very important for recommendation systems with implicit data, but a limited amount of work has been done in this space so far.  This is a novel approach to this problem—I doubt that many researchers in this area have considered the relationship between temporal dynamics of users and item as related to the MNAR problem, but the experimental results show that this could be a very important factor.
