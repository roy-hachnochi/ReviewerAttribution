The authors present an interesting and solid extension of the TDR method used in a number of neuroscience papers by introducing an assumption-free method for estimating dimensionality and permits non-symmetric observation of task variables, a drawback of previous work. The introduction to the topic and summary of previous work was very clear and easy to read.  Major Comments: In simulations the probability of neurons appearing on each trial was fixed at 40%. While the trial number was small relative to the number of neurons, lending support to the results, a value of 40% is not realistic for many neuroscience experiments. For example, for an experiment that includes dozens of sessions, the actual number may be closer to 1-5%. It would be useful to estimate how robust the analysis is under these conditions.  Why was the non-sequential version of dPCA used? Is this decision more conservation than the sequential version because it allows dPCA to estimate the noise covariance?  Itâ€™s hard for me to judge the difference in subspace angle error between MBTDR and dPCA. It seems that most of the additional error accrued by dPCA is in dimensions that already have a high error. Can you provide intuition why small errors in accurate dimensions supports your results?  The ability to include structured prior covariances and noise covariance will likely yield interesting follow-ups with this method!  -------- Author Response: I have read and am satisfied with the author's response.
