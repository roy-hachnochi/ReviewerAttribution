This paper studied the gradient regularization for MMD-based critics in GANs. It proposed gradient constrained MMD and its approximation the Scaled MMD, which is a principle way to control the gradient.  The results on several datasets show the effectiveness of SN-SMMDGAN.   The idea of the paper is novel and elegant, solving an important problem for MMD-based GANs.  The experimental results are pretty solid, compared will most related state-of-the-arts approaches on CIFAR, CelebA and ImageNet. The only concern is the performance of Sobolev GAN, which had some gap between CIFAR and CelebA. It is better to have more analysis on this and disclose the setting of it.   The paper is well written, with good motivation and clear pipeline.  It well described the relations among different regularizers (for general GANs and MMD GANs).
