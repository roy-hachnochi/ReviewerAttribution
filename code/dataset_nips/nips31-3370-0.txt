The authors first note that the existing SGLD techniques (derived from the SGLD) are not appropriate to sample Dirichlet distribution on the probability simplex. This is not a big surprise, SGLD is a general purpose sampler, which has been designed to sample from generic smooth distribution over $\mathbb{R}^d$. Some"generic" modifications can be brought to the SGLD to sample from a convex subset, but of course these methods are generic and are not well adapted to sample "sparse" Dirichlet distribution. I fully agree with these conclusions.   In a second part, the authors proposed a new algorithm to sample from "sparse" Dirichlet distribution. It is well known that sampling a d-dimensional Dirichlet distribution is equivalent to sampling d independent Gamma random variables. There are many computationally efficient methods to sample independent Gamma distributions, and therefore sampling large dimensional Dirichlet distribution.  The authors suggest to use independent  Cox-Ingersol-Ross whose stationary distribution is known to be a gamma distribution. The rationale of using such transform stems from the fact that it can be adapted to the "big data" context (exactly along the same lines than the SGLD). Convergence results are presented in Section 4 and sketch of  proofs  (the main arguments are given, nevertheless the proofs are concise and not really to follow) are presented in the supplementary material. The paper is supported by two experiments, showing the clear superiority of the proposed approach wrt to SGLD. It would have been of interest to compare with the results of a state-of-the art sampler on this problem. Otherwise, this is clearly a solid piece of work,  which would deserve to be accepted.
