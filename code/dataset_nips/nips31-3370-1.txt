This paper introduces the CIR/SCIR sampler, which allows to draw samples from the simplex for Dirichlet/multinomial models. In contrast to previous samplers, CIR/SCIR can draw accurate samples in sparse scenarios. The papers shows the superiority of CIR/SCIR on toy examples, as well as on LDA and DPMM.  The paper is very well written and the comparison to the literature seems fair.  My first comment is the following. There is a stochastic process of the form (3.1) for each component theta. Why are all of these processes independent? I would have expected these processes to depend one another. Am I missing something?  The method presented allows to obtain samples in the simplex for cases where there is a (multinomial or categorical) discrete variable next. Would the same approach be valid for a Dirichlet/Dirichlet construction, or for a more general class of models? If not, the assumptions about the model should be stated early in the paper.  Related to the previous question, it seems like CIR/SCIR requires a block-sampling scheme in which the discrete variables z are explicitly instantiated. Isn't this a limitation compared to an alternative approach that integrates out z and performs HMC (or a similar MCMC method) on the remaining latent variables?  Finallly, how are the parameters of SCIR tuned? For example, the parameter h in (3.3). In line 211, the paper states that the algorithms are "optimally tuned", but there aren't further details on this.
