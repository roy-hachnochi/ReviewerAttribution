 It is important to note that the dimension \delta is constant.  applications using an infinite-dimensional feature space (e.g. when the distnace function emerges from an exponential or gaussian kernel etc.) typically have \delta close to n and aren't covered by the presented theory.  The presented theory is interesting, the practical value is not fully clear (why do we want to test whether a graph is a k-nn graph?). The derivation (and full version of the derivation) may benefit from more precision and detail.   Minor comments: * I guess definition 3 (knn(v)) has problems when the distance function evaluates to the same value for several neighbors of v.  A comment on tie-breaking may be needed. * end of definition 3: if d(v)<k, then wit(v)\neq \emptyset, so in "wit(v)\neq\emptyset or d(v)<k", the latter condition seems redundant. * proof of lemma 5: The sentence "assume the contrary" is unclear, and the assumption made here doesn't seem to be exploited.  Deleting k edges such that the distance to the property doesn't increase isn't always possible (e.g. when the vertex v has no neighbors or has only a strict subset of knn(v) as neighbors). * lemma 5 (6 in full version): specify in what parameter you consider the o(1) notation.
