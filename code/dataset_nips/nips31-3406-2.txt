Review of "Provable Gaussian Embedding with One Observation"   This paper considers the problem of learning an exponential family embedding (i.e., the parameters of the model) defined on a graph. The (conditional) model describes how a measurement at each node is generated based on (i.e., given) the measurements at neighboring nodes. The neighborhood is determined based on the graph. The authors focus on the Gaussian embedding model and propose a conditional log-likelihood based inference. The authors propose two procedures: convex relaxation and a non-convex optimization procedures to determine the estimates of model parameters (low rank matrix M). The authors proceed with theoretical results on the convergence rates for both approaches as well as conditions (assumption EC and SC) to achieve these convergence rates.  Overall, I think that the paper has all the ingredients, including an important problem, a well define solution, and a thorough theoretical analysis.    Minor comments:  * Lemma 4.1 - "are hold" => "hold" * Lemma 4.1 - 'absolute constants' => 'universal constants?'
