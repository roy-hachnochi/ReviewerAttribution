The authors present a method to handle missing values in sequential data by training an RNN to predict the value of the next variable in a sequence and use the predictions instead of the ground truth when missing. They validate their approach on three datasets with different amounts of (naturally or artificially) missing data where they outperform relevant baselines.  The method is mostly clearly presented and easy to follow, although some justifications are missing or not quite to the point. Why does \mathcal{L}_e use an l_1 distance and l_t^{cons} an l_2 loss, even though they seem to serve similar purposes? Also, the justification for Equation (7) is the lack of correlations between features of \hat{x}_t in Equation (1); but these can correlated, since they are obtained from a common h_{t-1}. So does the added layer really need to have zeroed out diagonal elements?  The experiments section validates the author's claims, but is missing important details. The accuracy results for prediction really need to be in the main body, even if something else (e.g. the definition of MAE or MRE) has to be moved to the appendix. (Che et al., 2018) report an AUC of 0.8424 in their paper, why is it 0.828 here? Finally, as mentioned above, the importance of having a zero diagonal in W_z needs to be experimentally validated.
