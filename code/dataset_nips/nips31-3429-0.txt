This paper adds diminishing / accelerating return constraints to lattice models. The authors showed with the additional knowledge of features, their approach can reduce the testing error on some datasets. I think the idea of the paper, that to utilize human knowledge when the data is scarce, is very interesting. Utilizing diminishing / accelerating return constraints is novel according to my knowledge.
