This paper develops a Bayesian nonparameteric tensor factorization model with the goal of fully incorporating the temporal information, i.e. without discretization, and also capturing the nonlinear relationships in the data. This is achieved by defining "event-tensor", whose entries comprise sequences of interaction events rather than numerical values representing the interaction counts. This tensor-events are then modeled using the Hawkes process, which has the capability of capturing the triggering effects.   Major comments: 1. How the triggering effects between two different users can be captured by this model? Can you provide an argument based on the data and model that shows how the similar users end up having close latent factors, while the interaction between users are unknown?   2. Isn't it better to define A_t in (4) based on time proximity rather than event counts, so that related events are not discarded because of presence of other non-triggering events in that time interval?  3. In your experiments for figure 1, wasn't it a better idea to  set C_max to different values, rather than \Delta_max? Isn't this the reason that the results aren't that different?  Minor comments: 1. In line 63, shouldn't the matrix U be t by s, to be consistent with the matrix product notations?
