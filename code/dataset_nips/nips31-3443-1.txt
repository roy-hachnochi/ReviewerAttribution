PAPER SUMMARY This paper considers the problem of completion of coupled tensors. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal of  coupled norms of coupled tensors. These norms are based on the tensor nuclear norm and as functions of the tensors they are convex, thus allowing for globally optimal solutions, once incorporated into optimization problems for tensor completion. The paper also establishes that the excess risk bounds associated with the proposed norms are smaller than the bounds associated to norms that penalize the multilinear rank of the coupled tensors. Experiments on synthetic data and on a real location-user-activity dataset (UCLAF) show advantages of the proposed completion models to existing ones.  COMMENTS My major comment is to put some more effort into clarifying the presentation for the sake of the non-expert reader. At several places in the paper the notation is unclear or motivation is lacking. 1. Some motivation and review of coupled tensors is missing. 2. Some minor issues in the use of English need to be corrected, especially articles are often missing. 3. Please define [M;N] mathematically. 4. Equation between lines 98-99: a comment about how this definition reduces to the nuclear norm for the matrix case is in order. 5. I don't understand eq. (1): What is X and Y? Also, what is the value of the norm? Not, clearly defined. 6. Equation (2): Margin violated. Again, i don't understand how this norm is defined. Is it the infimum of ||W^(1)||*, ||W^(2)||*, ||V||*? What if we take W^(1)=0? What if the constraints being less than \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3 are not satisfied at the same time?
