The paper argues that Determinantal point process (DPP) simply models user engagements with recommended items instead of the conventional notion where the maximum a posteriori (MAP) set from the DPP is regarded as the collection containing diverse, high quality items and is suggested in recommender systems. The authors advocate an alternative framework for applying DPPs to recommender systems where they an optimize an metric named Maximum Induced Cardinality (MIC) that measures the expected number of items that a user will engage with and assert that this metric is more consistent with how DPPs for recommender systems are typically trained. Some properties of MIC are investigated where it is shown that MIC is not submodular. A close submodular approximation to MIC with theoretical guarantees is instead considered and optimized based by the standard greedy algorithm.  The paper is very well written and easy to understand. The arguments made in the paper are very convincing. The approximation to MIC based on Neumann series representation is cogent.   Couple of concerns: 1. In line 196 it is claimed that the function \hat{f} is also monotone but no supportive arguments are provided for the same. Submodularity alone does not guarantee the bounds in equation (11). 2. As f(S) is monotone and f(\emptyset) = 0, setting c = 0 in line 203 will satisfy the inequality c \hat{f}(S) <= f(S). So the constant "c" does exist. If the authors in Theorem 4 mean that there exist an \epsilon >0 such that c>=\epsilon, the sentence needs to reworded accordingly.
