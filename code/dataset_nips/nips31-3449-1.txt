In this paper, the authors use matrix factorization to reconstruct latent confounders from their noisy proxies, tolerating also the case in which the proxy measurements are missing at random. Focusing on linear regression, and given some extra assumptions, they provide an error bound for ATE after this preprocessing step, and show the consistency of the estimator after preprocessing.  To the best of my knowledge, this paper presents an interesting idea with a thorough theoretical analysis. In my opinion, the paper is quite dense and technical, making it quite difficult to read for a causality reader. The clarity could be improved, especially regarding the several assumptions used in different parts of the paper, some of which are vary in the different theorems. The results on both synthetic and real data seem promising.  A possible flaw is that this paper does not mention much related work in either reconstructing latent variables or in general estimating causal effects with unmeasured confounders, e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08816.
