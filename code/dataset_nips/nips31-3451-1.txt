The paper addresses the problem of rho-POMDPs non-convex reward functions, proving that indeed under some cases they, and their resulting value functions, are Lipschitz-continuous (LC) for finite horizons. The paper also proposes and uses a more general vector form of LC, too. This result allows value function approximations of the optimal V^* to be used, as well as upper and lower bounds (U and L) on value as in HSVI, and a wide array of new algorithms to be developed. This is analogous to the PWLC result for standard POMDPs, as LC is more general, allowing for similar contraction operators with Banach's fixed point theorem as in (PO)MDPs, and finite horizon approximations of the infinite horizon objective criteria. Once the paper establishes the main result, it discusses approximations of U and L using min or max, respectively, over sets of cones. This enabled a form of HSVI for rho-POMDPs. While the contribution is primarily theoretical, the experiments compare classical PWLC/PW/LC HSVI with a variety of incremental HSVIs constrained to Lipschitz constant lambda. These incremental refinements of lambda, often starting at 1, differ in their termination criteria. They are compared on several small benchmark domains for standard POMDPs, as well as a rho-POMDP called grid-info. While the PWLC HSVI performs quite well, the incremental LC versions perform similarly, but of course also work on rho-POMDP problems.  The paper does a good job of describing the rho-POMDP and the issues regarding the importance of its reward's and value's Lipschitz continuity. While the experiments do not add too much, they do confirm that the new HSVI algorithm for rho-POMDPs, backed by theory, works as expected. The main contribution is theoretical in nature and useful for rho-POMDPs. The supplement's proofs are clear and seem correct after being read in moderate detail.  A minor question about the use outside a rho-POMDP:  1. What are the primary hurdles that prevent this result for general continuous state MDPs, assuming compact S and A? Perhaps similar Lemmas are needed (e.g., Lemma 3)? Just curious to what extent this and other extensions have been considered.  Overall, the contribution is useful for the research on rho-POMDPs and perhaps beyond, maybe to continuous MDPs and some multi-agent MDPs (as suggested in the paper). The PWLC used in point-based methods seems likely to remain the dominant perspective on approximating standard POMDPs, supported by the experiments in the paper. The paper was clear and easy to read, with the proper mathematical rigor necessary to produce the result.
