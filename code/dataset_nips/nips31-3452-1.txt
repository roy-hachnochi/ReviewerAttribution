The paper presents a new algorithm for online parameter and structure learning of SPNs. The algorithms are tested on a fairly large selection of different problems and situations, and compare favorably against other SPN learning algorithms and (in some scenarios) other deep models.   The proposed technique is rather simple, but seems to be effective. The experiments in particular are convincing. The text flows nicely. It is unfortunate that Theo 1 which shows that the parameter learning update improves on loglikehood is not in the paper; this result should be at least stated in the text.
