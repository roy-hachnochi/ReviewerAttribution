The main contribution of this paper is the idea of a pertinent negative explanation, i.e. the idea of some features that, were they present in the instance, would change the classification. While not entirely new, it is presented here in a logical and convincing fashion.   While the paper illustrates this extensively on MNIST (a pertinent positive if ever there was one!), the paper goes beyond this and experimentally evaluates it on two other, quite different domains.
