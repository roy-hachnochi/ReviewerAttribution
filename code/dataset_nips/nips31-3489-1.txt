I felt that the problem was well-motivated, and I liked the amount of intuition presented in the paper. In full disclosure, however, I did not verify all the algebra in the appendix. The review of previous literature suggests that while other algorithms for this problem may exist, the present one is significantly simpler as it avoids variance reduction and does not require a separate "SGD phase" for each Oja step. This seems to result in significantly faster convergence in the experiments section.   Clarity: The paper is well-written, but there are a few very minor issues:  1. in equation (6) , did you actually mean this to be the definition of sin^2 rather than sin?  2. line 203: "is a the" => "is the"  3. line 207: "guarantee are" => "guarantee is"  4. In section 2, I think you should consider using u_i instead of v_i here, to avoid overlapping with the v_i of the algorithm, and be more consistent with the u_i of the previous notation paragraph.   Originality: I don't know of any other algorithms for this problem, but I am not an expert of the literature in this area.  Significance: The algorithm seems a significant improvement on prior works. However, it seems that a little more analysis of the iterate-averaging version of the algorithm is necessary to prove the more robust version of the algorithm, as otherwise it seems somewhat sensitive to the tuning of the learning rates.
