The paper describe a novel interpretable framework to measure the uncertainty of a prediction from NNs.   The paper is clear and very well-written. Besides, lots of intuitions behind are described, which is very helpful to understand the paper.   The paper is also original since it is quite different from previous Bayesian approach by explicitly parametrize  the distribution by DNN.   However I have some concerns over significance of the paper. The results are very well-presented as well by visualization (Fig2) or by AUROC/AUPR. The data used in paper, on the other hand, is quite trivial. More results(say in CIFAR 10) will definitely make the paper more stronger.  More questions, Q1: should x in line 82 be x^*  in P(\omega_c| x, \theta)?  Q2: Cannot understand the last part of the sentence at line 92 to line 95  Q3: notation \prod_c^K or \sum_c^K is a little bit confusing, to me the common uses are either \sum_{c=1}^K or \sum_{c\in [K]} where [K] is a set.
