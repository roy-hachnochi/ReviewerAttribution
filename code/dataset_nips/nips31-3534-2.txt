Summary The paper studies differentially private learning algorithms for classification problems. The main results are the followings: 1) The first results consider an easier problem in which the algorithm only needs to answer a fixed number of m classification queries (instead of a classifier) based on the private data. Then, building on the sample-and-aggregation framework and the sparse vector technique, the paper gives a poly-time black-box reduction from non-private learner to a private algorithm that solves the easier problem. 2) Then, using the labels given by the algorithm for the easier problem, we can use a non-private learner to learn a classifier as a post-processing while keeping privacy! The cost of privacy is in general well-bounded, losing an alpha^{-1/2} factor compared with the optimal non-private learner where alpha is the classification error.  Comments: - This is a strong paper in my opinion. The problem is well motivated and extensively studied. The standard exponential mechanism solves the problem if computational efficiency is not of concern. Computationally efficient private learners are, however, designed on a problem-by-problem basis in general. That is why the black-box reduction in this paper is a big deal. - The paper is well-written in general. Readers familiar with the private learning literature can easily grasp the key ideas.  - The combination of sample-and-aggregation and sparse-vector is, in hindsight, very simple and natural. It is almost embarrassing that the community didnâ€™t find this before. I take it as a plus of the paper that the techniques are simple and natural.  - The paper hides the dependence on eps, the privacy parameter, in most of the bounds. I understand that it is usually simply a 1/eps dependence but it would be nice to make the bound precise at least in the technical sections (so that we can compare the bounds with those achieved by problem-specific techniques).
