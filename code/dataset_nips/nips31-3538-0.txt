This paper proposes a generative model for molecule graphs based on a regularized VAE objective. The regularization is imposed on graphs generated from latent samples from the prior (and not those reconstructed from the approximate posterior). The model generates a larger % of valid graphs with respect to recent baselines.  Pros: - The paper is very well written and clear, math is sound. - Methods seems to generate a larger % of valid graphs than the baselines.  Cons: - Model outperforms baseline models on the metric it is practically trained to optimize (% of valid graphs when sampling from the generative model).  Comments: - I would have loved to see some application of the model in downstream tasks, such as to better have an idea of the usefulness of the method , apart from generating more valid graphs. - Why Zinc dataset is so hard ? - I am not sure you need to call ‘z’ synthetic, the terminology ‘z’ sampled from the prior is widely understood.  Typos: - In abstract, “For examples” -> For example
