The main contribution of this paper is to formulate general structural constraints on the output of a generative model as regularization terms. The challenge is that the constraint is over the infinite set of all feasible outputs of the generator. To solve it, they marginalize over the outputs of the generator which is approximated by MC sampling. This is done in the framework of VAEs and as such marginalization is done over the latent value z using the reparametrization trick.  The paper is well written. The notation is mostly clear.  I have not checked the proof of the KKT constraint in the appendix but I have some comments about the formulation. The generalized notion of Lagrangian multipliers is very interesting. I'm wondering if the ramp function on the inequality constraints could be derived from the KKT conditions. Also, I don't think the KKT conditions have to be written using the squared constraints.  Results are promising. There is one case where the proposed method does not perform well in reconstruction (Table 3-QM9 compared to GVAE). This needs more explanation.
