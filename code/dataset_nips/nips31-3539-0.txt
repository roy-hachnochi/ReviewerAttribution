The paper addressed the problem of correctly computing sub-derivatives for nonsmooth scalar functions. And proved that this computation can be done efficiently under certain assumptions about the functions. In the introduction the importance for the problem was mentioned, however I am still not sure that the work is important in practice as the paper contains only theoretical results. Would be interesting to see if the new techniques improves the optimisation results in any experiments.  Minor typos: - line 26: ...is often the nearly... - line 146: a function a function  --------------- After reading the authors response and other reviews I agree that the problem is important and the paper is a good contribution to the theory. However, I still feel that the paper needs some experiments or numerical tests about runtime as suggested by reviewer 3. It is a pity that authors did not say anything about their experience for implementing and running their algorithms.
