Summary: This paper compares various methods (HMM,TMM,HTF,LTM,SPN) of estimating a density mixture.  The authors claim to have a filled a gap in the literature by explicitly relating the expressivity of these compact models to one another.  The author(s) in particular characterizes when a shallow density mixture can represent a deep density mixture. concluding an inequivalence between HMMs and SPNs.  The author(s) also compare the methods up to approximation, concluding that any density mixture can be approximated by shallow and hence tractable SPNs.      The referee recommends a weak acceptance.  The summary of compact representations of density mixtures is excellent, and the main results address a gap in the literature.
