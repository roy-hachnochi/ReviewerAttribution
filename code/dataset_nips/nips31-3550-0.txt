In this paper, the author(s) introduced a new problem called subtask graph execution, where the agent is required to execute a given subtask graph in an optimal way. There are indeed some innovations in this work. Such as, neural subtask graph solver (NSS) which encodes the subtask graph using a recursive neural network, and to overcome the difficulty of training, the author(s) proposed a novel non-parametric gradient-based policy to pre-train the NSS agent and further fine-tune it through actor-critic method. The effectiveness is verified in two environments. 1.This paper is well written and easy to read, but there are a few misspelled words and symbol indicates error in this paper, such as, the ‘subtaks’in line 145 and the symbol of the top-down embedding line 147. 2.Two main contributions are presented for solving the proposed problem and training effectively.  3.The author(s) provide sufficient experimental evidence that the RProp and the NSS further improves the performance through fine-tuning with actor-critic method and performs much better than Greedy in zero-shot and adaption setting.
