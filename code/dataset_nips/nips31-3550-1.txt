In this paper, the authors studied the problem of subtask graph execution, that aims to find an optimal way to execute the given subtask graph. To address this problem, a deep RL framework is proposed to explore the subtask graph using R3NN. Empirical studies are performed on two domains with sets of subtask graphs. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. However, my main concerns are that the application-driven motivation for the studied problem is not clear to me. The authors may want to provide more discussion to answer (1) why the studied problem is vital to our real life, i.e., the subtask graph may be hard to obtain, and (2) why the proposed methods are advanced than the existing graph-based multi-task learning tasks. Besides, more experiments should be provided by comparing with more state-of-the-art graph-based multi-task learning approaches.   Strengths: (1) a novel problem of subtask graph execution. (2) the paper is well-written and easy to follow. (3) interesting empirical studies on two real domains with sets of subtask graphs  Weakness: (1) the application-driven motivation of the studied problem is not clear. (2) more comparison experiments should be conducted by including recent graph-based multi-task learning methods.
