The paper considers an important and interesting problem of learning when "no-click" in user response does not necessarily mean a negative feedback, as the user may not have paid attention to the recommendation. The authors propose a latent variable model to capture this. They use  Thompson Sampling (for logistic regression)  with variational inference method for parameter estimation in order to handle the latent variables and obtain approximate posterior. Bayesian regret bounds are provided.  I think the paper is conceptually very interesting and attacks an important problem, with a general technique that may have implications beyond the current setting. The regret bounds are not clean, but that may be expected in such a setting. The paper provides a good start for work in this important direction.  Post rebuttal: I did not have any pressing concerns for the paper. I read the authors' response to the questions posed by other reviewers. I still like the paper as much as I liked it before and my score is unchanged.
