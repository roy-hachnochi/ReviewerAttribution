The paper considers the problem maximizing the expectation of ||Qx||^2 over n-by-k matrices Q whose columns are mutually orthogonal unit vectors, where x is a random vector from a given distribution. The main results are: (i) sub-quadratic time algorithm for computing the ERM (ii) generalization for streaming data  (iii) theoretical new connections between covariance operators in RKHS and the space of square integrable functions with respect to data distribution.  Strong: - Interesting and non-trivial results and analysis. - Good experimental results.  Weak: - The algorithm is very simple: just sample i.i.d. from "RandomFeatures". Do we really need all these theorems to obtain this result? - My main concern is that this result can be trivially obtained (including streaming) using coresets. Coresets are not mentioned at all in this paper and I suspect that the authors are not aware. See e.g. recent coreset and sketches papers for PCA by Christian Sohler, Michael Cohen, Mahoney, and Woodruf. They are for linear functions but it seems that generalization may not be hard.
