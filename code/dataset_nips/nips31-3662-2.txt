The paper hypothesize that real images lie on a union of disjoint manifolds, but a generative adversarial network (GAN) tries to model the distribution as a single manifold and thus can not optimally learn the distribution in practice. The authors propose to use multiple generators as the solution. An EM approach is also used to learn the priors of the generators.  The paper is very clear and well written. It is nicely motivated and the solution seems elegant and novel to me.The experiments are also carefully carried out. I only have a few minor comments: 1. The experiments are only on toy or small datasets. I understand that the authors claim they are not trying to achieve state-of-the-art performance, but it would be great to see if the proposed approach can really solve the difficulties in generating more complex images.  2. Maybe I miss something, but even if the generator can only learn a connected manifold, can't you also use the discriminator during inference and reject those off-manifold samples?
