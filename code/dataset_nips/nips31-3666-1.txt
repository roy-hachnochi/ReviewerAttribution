The authors build off of well established techniques in unsupervised alignment between word embeddings of different languages to do unsupervised alignment between speech embeddings and word embeddings. They demonstrate this allows for some level of automatic word recognition and speech to translated text, without any labels. They also find that the biggest factor impacting performance is an unsupervised word parsing of the raw audio to begin with (chunking).   The experiments are performed well, and the ablation analysis on the different alignment techniques is very clear. The technique is not very original, as it's a logical combination of pre-existing ideas, but that's not a problem as long as it's shown that the results are significant. Unfortunately, it's unclear in the current text how to evaluate the promise of this approach, as only internal comparisons are provided. The unsupervised approach obviously underperforms the supervised classifier, but it would be much more helpful to have some other semisupervised ASR techniques to compare against. The "failure" by producing synonyms seems like a strength of this technique, but it's hard to say without a comparison to a more traditional semisupervised baseline. Given the lack of new techniques, these additional experiments could be helpful for the authors to make their case as to the potential of this approach to semi/un supervised speech-text conversion.  The authors also use  k-means to cluster the audio embeddings, but the need to do so is unclear as they are used in a continuous value regression problem, and the task is to select the nearest text token, not audio token, so I'm not sure why there has to be an audio dictionary. It's seems like an unnecessary compression of the space that the authors find to hurt the performance.
