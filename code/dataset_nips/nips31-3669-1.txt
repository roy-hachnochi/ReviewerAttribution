This is a very well-written article on a particular case of learning determinantal point processes (DPP). Since the principal minors can be estimated empirically, the authors focus on the problem of identifiability: to recover the set of all kernel matrices generating a given DPP, from the list of principal minors.  An algorithm is given, to recover, in polynomial time, such a matrix from the list of minors. This is a very interesting way to model interactions between 0/1 variables, that allows to take into account both positive and negative association.  Maybe the only weaknesses are:  1) The statistical aspects are a bit eluded: is the given algorithm robust to statistical imprecision? 2) The algorithm runtime in N^6 can still be quite slow, are there other heuristics that are faster, or can this be improved in special cases?
