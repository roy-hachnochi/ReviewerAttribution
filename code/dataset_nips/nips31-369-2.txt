This paper proposes a fine-grained image recognition method with maximum-entropy learning. The proposed method is easy-to-implement and simple to understand, which brings scalability and generalizations. Some details:  + This paper is well written and clear. + The proposed method could bring consistent improvements on different base models on fine-grained image recognition. Meanwhile, it also conducts experiments on general image recognition datasets. + The theoretical part is sufficient.  Minor issues: - The format of references is not consistent. - In the title of Fig. 1, CUB-200-2011 could be wrong, which should be Stanford Dogs.
