In this paper, the authors establish new bounds for the error in similarity learning for domain adaptation based on information-theoretic notions of distance between the source and target distributions. These establish that a good similarity function chosen for a particular source distribution is also good for a target distribution, as long as (modified versions of) the TV or chi^2 divergence between the two distributions is small. The authors also show that by minimizing the upper bounds they obtain in algorithms for similarity learning, they obtain much better performance over traditional methods.  This paper is clearly written and appears to be correct, and the bounds are relatively "user friendly." It does not strike me as a huge breakthrough, but it does contain several nice ideas, and the empirical results are convincing.  One aspect of the paper that could be improved is the treatment of the condition supp T \subset supp S. This is *not* the correct condition; throughout the authors mean that T is absolutely continuous with respect to S, which is not the same thing. (If T is a dirac measure at 1/2 and S is the uniform measure on [0, 1], then supp(T) \subset supp(S), but S does not dominate T.) Likewise, assuming that \mu is a dominating probability distribution is not the same as assuming that supp(mu) contains the support of other probability measures.   I do not find Theorem 3 compelling. Bounds of this type are useful to the extent that they can be used to obtain data-dependent estimates of relevant quantities, but this bound is dominated by a term which depends on the derivative of the unknown CDF F_\ell_\gamma and the bound only holds for sample sizes sufficiently large. I would argue that this renders Theorem 3 of little practical or even theoretical interest.   Finally, this paper assumes deterministic labels throughout. Can this assumption be relaxed?
