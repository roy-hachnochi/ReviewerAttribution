This paper combines convex optimization methods with clustering under stability assumptions. It directly incorporates stability-motivated conditions into the SDP formulation for k-means, and proves several guarantees based on such relaxations. It also experimentally measures the distances of nearly-optimum solutions to a point, and shows that practical data sets do in fact have such stability properties.  I am not familiar with the vast literature on clustering, or even recent works involving stability assumptions. However, I believe the design of objectives with such assumptions in mind is natural, and that the paper did significant work in such direction. This includes both the bounds proven, and the experimental studies involving real data sets as well as additional heuristics. I believe these are significant contributions that may motivate further work on convex relaxations under stability assumptions, and would like to advocate acceptance of this paper.
