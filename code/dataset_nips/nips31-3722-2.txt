After reading the rebuttal and others reviews, I have decided to upgrade the score. The added seq2seq results and the argument on the use of simulation data are convincing.  The paper proposes a new recurrent neural network architecture to forecast treatment response called R-MSM. which contains 2 submodules: a propensity network that learns the probability of each treatment and a seq2seq model that predict the treatment outcome.  + The problem of predicting the patients' treatment outcome is interesting. + The idea of using the Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) to adjust for time-dependent confounding in the objective function is new. - The model architecture is too specific to the application. It is not clear how the two models are combined together. It seems that the model is solving two different problems separately. - The experiments are not convincing. In table 1, an important baseline would be seq-2-seq RNN without the propensity network. Furthermore, the data is only from the simulation and it is not clear whether the method could work for real-world data. - Typos: line 130, use->used, line 264 typo in description, line 205, continuos -> continuous, table 1 overflows
