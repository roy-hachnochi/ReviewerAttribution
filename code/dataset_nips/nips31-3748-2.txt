This paper proposed a new method for text generation. The groundtruth sentences are first feed to a pretrained encoder to obtain a fix length represetation. A GAN model is then trained to generate such represetations from a simple distribution (e.g., Gaussian). Finally, a decoder is trained to map the generated represeations to the words.  The idea looks interesting and novel and experimental results are convincing to me . It would be better if the authors can further evaluate the effectiveness of using a pretrained sentence encoder. For example, what is the performance of using a variational autoencoder (maybe with pretrained encoder as initialization) instead of pretrained encoder with random noise?  Minor: the proposed model is very similar to Sec 5.2 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02978.pdf, although that paper focused on a very different task. The only difference is the detailed model architeture. While I believe this model is developped independently, it would be good to add some discussion.
