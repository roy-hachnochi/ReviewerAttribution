The authors propose a DP distributed SGD algorithm, which is a composition of randomized quantization and the Binomial mechanism, which can be viewed as a discrete counterpart of the Gaussian mechanism. The paper is clearly written, and all the technical parts seem solid, though I have not fully checked the appendices.   A few minor comments: 1) Even though it is hard to analyze "Gaussian noise followed by quantization", it might be helpful if the authors can add experimental results of this scheme, and compare the performance of it with the proposed solution. It might be the case that even though performance analysis is intractable, this simple Gaussian+Quantization scheme might perform pretty well.   2) In Thm. 3, C is claimed to be proportional to "log(k+m) + O(1)". Where does the O(1) term comes from? It seems like that the proposed scheme requires k+m bits per coordinate.   3) Typo: (p6) E((\pi, X^n_1) => E(\pi, X^n_1)   == (After rebuttal) I am still not sure why the authors cannot run "1) Add Gaussian noise to discrete input and then 2) quantize it again." Since one can clearly get some DP guarantee for the first step, and the second step does not compromise DP guarantee, one can easily get (eps, delta) of this scheme. This might be a crude upper bound but one can still compare the proposed scheme with this simple baseline. (Actually, this baseline might work pretty well even with their crude privacy guarantees.)
