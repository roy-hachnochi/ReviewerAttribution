Summary ======= The paper presents a software package for approximate Gaussian process regression with Gaussian likelihood. This software uses a batch version of conjugate gradients to leverage parallelization with GPUs. The implementation can also be used to speed up existing approximation methods like SoR and FITC. To reduce the number of conjugate gradients iterations, partial pivoted Cholesky decomposition is used for preconditioning. The authors provide theoretical analysis how the preconditioner improves upon convergence speed for the RBF kernel.   Clarity ======= There is nothing to complain. The language is clear and precise. The paper is easy to understand. Book references (as e.g. [36]) should be augmented with page numbers.  Originality =========== The ideas presented in the paper are not ground-breakingly new, but are a clever combination and implementation of existing ones. That is absolutely fine and sufficient for acceptance. Novel is the theoretical analysis of the preconditioner.  It is not clear to me whether the modification of conjugate gradients is meant to be novel. If so then the submission lacks references to existing work (the seminal paper "block conjugate gradients" by O'Leary and follow-up literature). I did not look into the appendix to see how both algorithms relate to each other.   Quality ======= The presentation of the results regarding speed-up appear arbitrary---twenty conjugate gradient steps are not a lot. I made the experience that in bad cases, conjugate gradients may need more than a thousand steps to arrive at a satisfactory residual. In those cases it is hard to beat the LAPACK implementation of the Cholesky decomposition. The quality of this submission could be improved by adding plots how the approximation quality and the residual evolve over time (for fixed hyper-parameters). This way it is easier to evaluate how much speed-up one can gain, for a certain sacrifice in precision.   Significance ============ Facilitating the usage of GPUs for GP inference is an important contribution.
