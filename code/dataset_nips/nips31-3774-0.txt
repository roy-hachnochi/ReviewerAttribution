Authors present a new method for action detection in video based on capsule networks. The pose parameters provided in capsule layers allows the network to efficiently segment the image at pixel level. They also propose averaging the convolutional capsule votes to increase the scalability of capsule networks. The effect on the generalization due to parameter reduction however is not explored in the ablation study. I am curious about the effect of capsule pooling on the results.  Pros: Significant results, clear and well written paper.  Cons: not enough elaboration on the discrepancy between fmap and vmap. The fmap is not better than sota, where the vmap indicates a clear outperform. I would also suggest adding the prediction of other methods in the qualitative results to indicate the behavioural difference that would lead to the 20% improvement. Moreover, the coordinate adjustment technique should also be applied in the capsule pooling section. Which means that before averaging, the pose matrices should be adjusted based on their relative position to the center of the patch.
