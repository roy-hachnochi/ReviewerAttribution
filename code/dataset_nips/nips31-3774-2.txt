This paper generalizes the capsule network from images to videos for the task of action detection.   Strengths:   The motivation of the paper is clear, and the experimental results is promising. The estimated localization maps look accurate and sharp.   Weakness:  1. This paper is a simple extension of capsule network, from 2D to 3D. It is interesting and straightforward, but novelty is limited.  2. Performance in table 1 is confusing. The f-mAP is quite inconsistent with v-mAP . I don't understand how your v-mAP is so high but your f-mAP is so low. It is counter-intuitive.
