I have now read all the reviews and the authors' rebuttal.  I will stick to my original opinion and happy to have this paper accepted. I fell confident that the authors will address the main concerns (mainly re presentation and inclusion of important details) raised by the reviewers.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The authors propose a stochastic partition process, the Rectangular Bounding Process (RBP). Motivated by the unnecessary cuts dictated by the cut-based approaches, the RBP is a bounded-based approach that fits bounding boxes to regions in an informed manner based on their significance (dense data regions).   I found the proposed approach interesting. It definitely feels that solves pathogenies observed in previous methodologies and adds only an incremental contribution. However, the model is neat and technically sound â€“ to my understanding. The authors provide experiments where the process is applied on relational data allowing for the deployment of the process in interesting domains. The performance is not outstanding compared to other methodologies, however this does not degrade itâ€™s contribution as a mathematical neat and interesting process.   The work reads easily and is clear through and through. I suggest acceptance.   Other: Line 109: BSP --> RBP Line 220: lies --> lie
