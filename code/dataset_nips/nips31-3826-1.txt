I would like to apologize to the authors for my dismissive original review that was based on a careless reading of the paper.  This paper gives a new, tighter asymptotic bound on the number of polynomial threshold functions of n variables and degree d, closing a multiplicative gap of O(d) between the best previously known lower and upper bounds. The paper uses an impressive mathematical repertoire to solve a long-standing open problem that has close connections with learning theory.  The paper's exposition could be significantly improve. I would suggest that the authors emphasize the main result of the paper (Theorem 3.1). As the paper is currently written, the main result is only introduced and discussed halfway through the paper, with the abstract, the introduction, and the conclusion giving very little information about the significance of the results. This can lead a cursory reader (such as, unfortunately, myself) to entirely miss the main contribution of the paper. I find the introductory part of the supplementary material much more informative than the paper itself -- replacing the entire main paper with the first  pages of the supplementary material would seem a clear improvement in the exposition.
