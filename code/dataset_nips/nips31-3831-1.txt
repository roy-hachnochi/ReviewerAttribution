In this work, the authors propose to replace the static non-linear activation functions used in most modern neural networks with context-dependent linear transformations. The authors test their model on a toy dataset and MNIST digit classification as well as on two language modeling tasks, PTB and Wikitext-2. On the latter, they show that their approach out-performs recent comparable architectures.  The paper is mostly clearly written and easy to follow, and the results support the authors' claim (still, running language modeling experiments on datasets at least an order of magnitude larger would significantly strengthen the paper). Further discussion of the added computational cost of the method, which can be as important as the number of parameters both for practical applications and in measuring a model's expressive power, would also be welcome.  A few other random points: - The first part of Section 2 seems to initially motivate the approach as a first order approximation of the regular non-linear activation functions: if that is indeed its purpose, it might help to make it more explicit. - In Figure 3, it looks like the learning rate is cut after 60 epochs on AWD-LSTM and 100 for aLSTM, why is that? - Also, Figure 3 would be more legible with a legend in the graph.
