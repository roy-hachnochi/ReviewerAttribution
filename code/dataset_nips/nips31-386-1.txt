This paper studied the consistency property of learning via convex surrogates by extending the existing studies to the case of inconsistent surrogates. The main result is Theorem 3 that bounded the calibration function from below.  According to my reading of the manuscript, I have the following comments:  Positive comments:  The deduction of the lower bounded of the calibration function in Theorem 3 seems to be non-trivial (I assume the results are correct). From the conclusion section, it also seems that these efforts do make sense in some cases.   Negative comments: 1, According to the authors, the consistency problem of inconsistent surrogates is the main concern of this paper. However, it is not clear to me what motivates this study. That is, what motivates the study of consistency of inconsistent surrogates. I noticed some comments in the last section of the manuscript, which did not help me out.  2, The authors spent too much effort in stating the main results of the study of Osokin et al. [13]. Actually, 5 out of 8 papers were revisiting their results. After reading the manuscript, it makes me feel that the authors studied a mathematical problem that has not been solved in [13].    3, This paper is extremely hard to follow. Many notions are not clearly defined.   --- After reading the authors' feedback and the comments from the other two reviewers, I tend to vote for the acceptance of this paper.
