 I enjoyed reading this paper. In particular, I liked the compact comparison in Table 1. I believe that the results are interesting.  Unfortunately, the authors have not tested their algorithm experimentally with some synthetic cases, for instance.  === AFTER REBUTTAL ===  I thank the authors for including some experiments in the rebuttal. I raise my evaluation from 6 to 7, mainly because I reconsidered the importance and impact of the theoretical results.
