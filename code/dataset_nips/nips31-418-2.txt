The paper proposes a subsampling streaming submodular maximization algorithm. The main improvement is reducing the number of queries per element.  Overall, I recommend the paper to be accepted. I think the analysis of the paper is interesting. I first wondered how the probability q affects the approximation factors. But Eq (2) shows that it only affects the non-dominating terms. Therefore, we can choose it as large as possible. I checked all the proofs except Proposition 10 (I only skimmed Prop. 10), and found no flaws.  [minor] Theorem 1. - the formula needs a close parenthesis.  line 429 - the second line, n will be u_{i_{|T|}} - the first equality in the third line will be the inequality.
