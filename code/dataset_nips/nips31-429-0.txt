This paper used a new framework called FishNet that utilizes features of different granularity (pixel-level, region-level, and image-level) in order to do the final learning task better! The motivation behind this work is that models such as CNN use consecutive down-sampling to obtain the features that are of low-resolution and miss high-resolution features that are critical for pixel-level or region-level tasks! The authors build their framework in a fish like structure where there is a tail, a body, and a head representing different parts of the model. The tail can be an existing model such as ResNet and it is in the body and head of their model where they utilize up-sampling and down-sampling to combine the features with different granularity! The authors shows through extensive experimental study that their framework works better than the baselines for different task including image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation.
