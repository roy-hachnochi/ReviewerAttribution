     The paper proposes a new backbone architecture more suited to various tasks, e.g. image-, region- and pixel-level tasks, than traditional pre-trained backbones. It allows direct backpropagation from deep layers to shallow layers by solving the issue caused by isolated convolutions happening in common architectures, e.g. ResNet or DenseNet. Experimental validation confirms that FishNet backbone is better than comparable ResNet and DenseNet backbones on image classification, and on both object detection and instance segmentation.          The paper is rather clear and easy to follow. The motivations are exposed well and the justification of the idea to solve the issue of gradient propagation in common backbones is appealing. However, the mathematical notations are cumbersome, and not consistent across equations, e.g. the superscripts 'u' disappear between equations (4) and (5). They are also different notations between the equations and Figure 2, see k and K, or different fonts for M function. It could also help to write the name of the variables directly in Figure 2, making the link between the two easier to follow.          Regarding the experimental section, the results presented are convincing on the usefulness of FishNet, especially for object detection and segmentation, where the use of recent frameworks (FPN, Mask R-CNN) is welcome. It would be interesting to have comparisons with deeper versions of ResNe(X)t backbone on MS COCO dataset, as the 101-layer versions are the most common used. It would also be good to evaluate FishNet on the test sets for easier comparisons with the literature, and to have the results from other state-of-the-art methods in the same tables, for both classification on ImageNet and object detection/segmentation on MS COCO. The ablation study seems a bit light, and does not show the relative importance of the main parts introduced, i.e. the fish body and head.        ************* Post-rebuttal recommendation The rebuttal is a bit disappointing since the authors only answer to one of my concern. This said, I like the proposed method and the experiments are overall convincing. I thus stick on my weak accept recommendation.
