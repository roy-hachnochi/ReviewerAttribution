This paper proposes to address the interesting problem of how to retrace a path in a novel environment. For which a two-stage end to end learning approach is developed. The first stage involves an abstract of a path, while the second is for the human or agent to retrace the path in the presence of action noise and a changing world. The presentation is clear in general. The problem is interesting and the proposed algorithm is reasonable and novel. Empirical simulations demonstrate the good performance of the proposed approach. On the other hand, there is a bit lacking in terms of real experiments on practical situations.
