The paper develops two statistical tests, Rel-UME and Rel-FSSD, to measure the relative goodness of fit of two models. As shown in numerical experiments, both methods can control the false rejection rates below the nominal level, as well as achieve large powers with relative low computational costs. Some comments are listed as follows. 1. As shown in Figure 4, increasing J can increase the false rejection rates as well as the test power. In practice, how can we choose a proper J?  2. I suggest the authors add one more section ‘Discussion’ to discuss the advantages or limitations of the proposed statistical tests.
