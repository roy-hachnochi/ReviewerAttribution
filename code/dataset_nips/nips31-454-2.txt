This paper presents a entropy regularization technique for the CTC algorithm. The basic idea is to make sure the entropy for the space under the collapsing constraint is not too small. This prevents the tendency that CTC is likely to choose one path and give small probabilities to alternatives.  Entropy regularization is pretty common technique. Though not very exciting, this paper applies the entropy regularization to CTC loss and it seems to be a nice addition to the CTC related technique.   I am slightly confused with the theorem 3.1. according to your theorem, do you really need to enforce equal space constraints directly. does the regularization itself sort of do that already?
