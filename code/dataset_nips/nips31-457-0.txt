The paper provided a novel and general definition of classifier margin, with the standard svm definition of margin as a special case. Analytical expression of the margin was derived, together with practical implementations to reduce computation. The experimental results also show the effectiveness of this large margin training criterion compared with standard cross entropy criterion. Overall, this paper is clearly written with strength both in theory and practice.  Minor issue:  In equation (8), (9) and (10), all x should be x_k.
