This paper proposes a self-supervised audio-visual synchronization task for learning high-level audio and video features. The proposed method builds upon [22] by including the motion information (input is a set of frames instead of a single frame as in [22]) through 3D convolutional networks. They present state of the art performance for environmental sound recognition and competitive results for action recognition although the method mainly relies on self-supervision (as opposed to the SOTA I3D-RGB[18]).  In overall the idea is straight-forward (using a set of frames instead of a single frame as in [22]), however figuring out how to make it work requires overcoming a set of challenges that paper clearly elaborates. In summary it is a simple idea but executed elegantly.  Positives: + Making use of video instead of a single frame for temporal alignment prediction. + Showing that hard-negatives can significantly improve the quality of features when learned in a curriculum based method. + Near state of the art results for environmental audio classification + State of the art results for self-supervised action recognition (UCF101, HMDB51)  + The paper has a clear presentation  Negatives: - Not too much novelty in the idea, but good execution - Over the limit (9 pages instead of 8)   Experiments + It would be helpful to include cross-entropy only learning method in at least one of the tasks. + If possible, it would be good the see the performance of the AVTS objective trained on the I3D [18] model. This result can be included to table 2.  References:  Would be good to include another concurrent work, though in a different audio-visual setting: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11592  typos: line 28: argued -> argue line 56: that that -> that line 76: detail -> detailed Figure 3 is not referenced in text  Post-rebuttal update: I think authors submitted a decent rebuttal touching on many concerns of the reviewers. In overall, I think the method is a straight-forward extension of existing work [22] but the execution of the idea is good and it also has comprehensive experimental comparisons with great outcomes. I will keep my score positive.
