The authors present an inductive programming approach where a DSL is learned by a search, compile, and compress strategy. They evaluate their approach in three different domains -- list processing, text editing, and symbolic regression. They motivate their approach by pointing out the effectivenes and flexibility of human learning. Similar arguments are presented by Schmid & Kitzelmann, Cognitive Systems Research 2011 and the approach has some similarities with the MagicHaskeler of Katayama.Although some relation to pevious research is missing (mainly the two groups named above), the presented approach is original. I am most impressed by the empirical demonstration of applicability in three rather distinct domains (but: see also Schmid/Kitzelmann, 2011). The presentation is technically sound and the empirical evaluation is very convincing.
