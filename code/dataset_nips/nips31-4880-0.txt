The paper describes a distributed  bicriteria approximation algorithm for k-center with z outliers. It uses 24(1+eps)k centers and (1+eps)z outliers. Its communication cost does not depend on z. They show that communication cost of z is unavoidable if you insists on having only z  outliers with a simple example on the line.  In the suggested protocol each machine first locally aggregates its data and sends the aggregated data to a coordinator that computes the clustering using the aggregated data with a known centralized algorithm.   A similar scheme is suggested for k-means and k-median that uses coresets, but the centralized computation time is exponential.  The algorithms are simple.  minor comments: --  line 58: what do you mean by solving the problem COMPLETELY ? --  line 59: I think you did not say that m is the number of machines --  line 199: Why is there an "s" in the equation ? --  line 294: "need output" ==> "need to output" --  Why do you need so many primes in the notation of Theorem 2.1 --  line 232: seems that w'(q) is just a definition you need and not part of the claim
