This work proposes to improve variational approximation for continue time Bayesian networks (CTBN) using the Kikuchi functional. This approximation in turn, allows efficient Bayesian structure learning using Stirling approximation to the Gamma function. The problem of structure learning of dynamic systems is notoriously hard and has been used to study very small gene regulatory networks. The proposed solution seems to allow a significant scale up of learned network size, as it involves local computations. The Stirling approximation is an elegant solution. The authors refer to previous works that extend mean-field approximations to higher order, however more details about the relation to these works should have been given.  The paper is clearly written, and required background is given where is needed to make the paper self-contained. Some clarifications are needed: (1) In the equation in line 95 the dependency of the reminder on epsilon is not clear; (2) The marginals in the equation in line 101 seem to depend on t, this should be reflected in the notation. (3) It sis not clear in line 131 why should m_n(x,0) = 0.5.  The experimental section contains a comparison to a mean-field algorithm as well as to additional methods for reconstruction of regulatory network structure. To give a more comprehensive view, the authors should have compared accuracy and run-time to the method of [Studer et al. 2016] which they state shares similarities to the proposed method. The synthetic experiments contain 5 repetitions. This should be increased.  --- After Author's feedback --- The authors addressed most of the comments. Relation to previous work should be written more clearly. I am keeping the original score I have given.
