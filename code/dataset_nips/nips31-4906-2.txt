This paper present CC-POMCP, an online MCTS algorithm for large CPOMDP that leverages the optimization of LP-induced parameters and only requires a black-box simulator of the environment. CPOMDP is a generalization of POMDP for multi-objective problems. Similar to POMDP, it can be cast into an equivalent belief-state CMDP and solved by a LP (Eq. 1). Given the dual of this LP (Eq. 2), the problem becomes an unconstrained belief state MDP with the scalarized reward function with the unknown weights. Then the basic idea of the CC-POMCP algorithm is to iterate through the steps of solving the belief-state MDP and updating the scalar weights with the POMCP method. The CC-POMCP algorithm is evaluated on the three benchmark problems, i.e., Toy, Rocksample, and Atari 2600 PONG. The LP and its dual for solving CMDP and POMCP for solving POMDP are not new but using POMCP and the dual for solving CPOMDP is novel.   The main weakness of this work is that it does not fit the CPOMDP scenarios. The motivation of modeling a problem as a CPOMDP is that the constraints are hard constraints and must not be violated during execution. For UAVs under search and rescue mission, the main goal would be to find as many targets as possible (modeled as the reward function) while avoiding running out of battery (modeled as the constraints). Generally, such problems cannot be modeled as an unconstrained POMDP with the scalarized reward function. Based on the strong duality theorem, it seems that POMDP with constraints is equivalent to POMDP with the scalarized reward function. This is only true if the optimal policy is found. Unfortunately, POMCP can only found the approximate policy with limited time and resources. In such cases, there is no guarantee that the constraints are not violated. Without such property, the proposed algorithm is not useful for domains that must be modeled as a CPOMDP.
