Given an n x d matrix with n points in d dimensions (n > d), a popular outlier detection technique to find outlier points requires O(nd^2) time and O(d^2) space. This technique is based on the so called leverage scores. When d is large, outlier detection via leverage scores becomes hard. This paper provides algorithm that reduce the space/time complexity of leverage score computation. I found the results interesting and novel. I would like to see a better comparison with other "fast" leverage scores approximation algorithms, for example https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pdrineas/documents/publications/Drineas_JMLR_2012.pdf
