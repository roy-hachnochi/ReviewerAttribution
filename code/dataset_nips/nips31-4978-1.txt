This paper presents generalization bounds for SGD with multiple passes over the dataset (with large constant stepsizes) for the least squares regression problem. The result is interesting and is consequential to practice. The paper goes into the details of explaining the tradeoffs of multi-pass learning based on the spectrum of eigenvalue decay and the hardness of the problem measured by the optimal predictor norm.   I am unable to quite appreciate these tradeoffs in context of practice (in the sense of which regime(s) are the most practically useful or most common); so clarifications of this sort would certainly improve understanding for interested readers.   The proof technique especially for tracking the averaged SGD iterate to the gradient descent iterate (in the appendix) was pretty neat and goes in a line similar to the technique of Bach and Moulines (2013).   A comment regarding related work: Clearly the authors exhibit a very good understanding about the state of the art in providing generalization bounds for SGD (or its accelerated variants) for least squares (and beyond). Yet, it is surprising that they do not mention several recent papers that provide the strongest known bounds dedicated for least squares stochastic approximation (and beyond): [1] SGD and randomized Kaczmarz [Needell et al 2013], [2] SGD for least squares [Defossez and Bach, 2015] [3] Streaming SVRG [Frostig et al 2015], [4] SGD for least squares [Jain et al. 2016], [5] Accelerated SGD for least squares [Jain et al 2017]. The difference from what I see is that these papers employ strong convexity (note here n>d) - nevertheless, they pretty much define the current state of non-asymptotic generalization bounds for this problem and are a part of the context of this problem. It would help to compare and contrast this result against ones established in the above papers.  ***post-rebuttal*** As for clarification regarding notions of problem hardness, yes, this certainly will help readers understand the significance of these results in practice.  These papers does not deal with multi-pass SGD, but they define the current state of the art for SGD (and their accelerated variants) rates in certain problem hardness regimes.
