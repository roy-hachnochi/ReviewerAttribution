This is a very well-written paper that is beautifully presented with a high degree of clarity. The paper considers a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for probabilistic graphical models (PGM). The general methodology is very similar to what was presented by Naesseth et al. (2014) in a previous NIPS conference. The main novelty of the paper lies in the modification of the SMC sampler with a "twisting function." This builds upon recent work in the SMC literature where twisted SMC has recently been considered. The authors propose three possible twisting functions and show the empirical improvement in using twisted SMC on three examples.   An important requirement for importance sampling is that the proposal should be heavier tailed than the target form which one wishes to sample. This is necessary to ensure that the importance weights are finite. It wasn't clear from paper how this property is preserved by the twisting proposal.  The simulation study is reasonably thorough. However, it is odd that the three twisting functions are not compared against one another. Therefore, it's difficult to get any intuition as to which twisting approach should be used in practice.  Overall, this is a very nicely written paper. However, the paper lacks originality and the novelty in the contribution is relatively incremental.
