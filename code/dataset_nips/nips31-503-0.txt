The paper was well written and easy to read. The authors propose "uncertainty-aware" attention, that models attention weights as Gaussian with the variance being a function of the input.   Strengths: - the uncertainty-aware variational approach is novel and can be used for a variety of tasks - the resulting attentions have greater interpretability (table 2) and prediction reliability (figure 3)  Weaknesses: - It would have been interesting to see experimental results on a different task  Question for authors: Do the authors have an intuition for the approximately 13% error in interpretability?
