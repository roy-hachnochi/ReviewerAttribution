Summary:  This paper considers the classical problem of online portfolios selection. Cover's algorithm achieves the optimal regret bound, but it is not computationally efficient. The authors propose variants of the Online Newton Step with a logarithmic barrier function as a regularizer. The regret bound is a bit inferior to that of Cover's, but still independent of the parameter G, which is an upper bound of norms of gradients of loss functions. The idea is to add a regularizer so that G is small enough w.r.t. N and T.   Quality and Originality:  The paper is technically sound and the idea is neat. But, the analysis follows the standard analysis of the FTRL.   Significance: The paper is rather incremental than innovative. However, the technical improvement is non-trivial and interesting for the community.
