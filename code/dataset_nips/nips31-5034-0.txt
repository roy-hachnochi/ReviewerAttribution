In this paper, a multi-source domain adaptation algorithm is proposed, which is derived from the theory by Mansour et al. 2008 that to learn a weighted combination of source distributions. The authors discussed the proposed algorithm in the stochastic scenario, which is important for being applied into deep neural networks. Experiments on a few benchmarks show that the proposed approach outperforms a few baselines.  Generally, the paper is well written, and the algorithm development is reasonable. However, multiple source domain adaptation is not a new problem, and many approaches have been proposed to tackle with this task based on various principles. Unfortunately, the authors did not present a thorough discussion the connection with existing related works,  [Hoffman et al. 2012, Gong et al 2013b, Xu et al. 2014, Zhang et al. 2015] and reference below. No experimental comparison is provided either. It is interesting to see an instantiation of Mansourâ€™s theory, but the work in its current form is not sufficiently convincing.
