This paper proposes a number of theoretical findings for the multiple source adaptation problems. Specifically, it presents new methods to determine the distribution-weighted combination solution for the cross-entropy loss and other similar losses. Extensive experimental studies have been conducted to verify these findings.  Overall, this paper is well-written. The theoretical analyses seem to be correct, although I cannot fully check all the proofs. The experimental studies are extensive and well support the proposed theoretical findings. My only concern on this paper is the lack of discussions on the related works. The current paper focuses on the discussion of gaps with Mansour et al. [2008,2009], and it further extends to deal with these gaps. However, there are many other existing works studying the theoretical analyses on the multiple source domains, e.g. [ref1], [ref2], and [ref3]. What are the differences of the current paper with these existing works? Some of gaps in Mansour et al. [2008,2009] may have already been considered in other works, for instance, [ref3] also considers the joint distribution of the input and output. The authors should pay more attention to the discussion on those related works, to further motivate the paper and highlight the significance of the paper.

However, after discussions with other reviewers, I also agree with reviewer 1 on the point that more comprehensive empirical studies should be done.
