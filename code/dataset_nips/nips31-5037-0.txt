This submission explores theoretical properties of the reciprocal recommendation task (both parties must agree to match), introduces an algorithm to make recommendations, and validates the algorithm with synthetic and real-world data.  This is a very interesting problem, and quite distinct from the typical  item recommendation task.  It is certainly a task worth exploring in greater detail theoretically and practically.  As far as I can tell, the theoretical analysis seems sound and very relevant for those interested in understanding the problem in greater detail.  I would be interested in some exploration of any fairness implications of such a system for users with different behaviors.  For example, if one user log into the system more frequently, how will their experience be different from a user that logs in less frequently?  What about users that have fewer interactions in general?  It would be interesting to explore issues of disproportionate impact within such a system where behavior properties of users lead them to receive different recommendation treatments.  However, I understand that space is limited already, and that this might be best suited for future work.  The writing is very good, and the authors maintain a reasonable narrative, which is difficult in theoretical papers.  Thank you for making the effort to make your paper readable!  The contributions of this paper are original and relevant to the real-world applications of such systems.  This work has the potential to open new areas of theoretical analyses of these systems as well as to impact the deployment of algorithms on real-world platforms.
