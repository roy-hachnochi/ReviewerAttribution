The authors consider a mainly theoretical investigation of the very widely used stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.  It has previously been shown that SGLD converges weakly to the target with decreasing step size, and in this paper the authors consider the more practically realistic setting of using a fixed stepsize.  In particular they show that the stationary distribution of SGLD can be far from the true distribution as the number of data points N increases, using a fixed step size.  In contrast, the SGLDFP algorithm (using control variates to reduce the variance of the gradient estimates) targets a distribution that gets closer to the true distribution as N increases.  In my opinion this is a very useful addition to the theoretical literature in this area, as it justifies the use of SGLDFP with a constant step size, which is how it is usually employed in practice.  Indeed I think papers of this type should be encouraged, where theory is driven by practical reality and subsequently influences utility.  The paper, although rather technical and densely written, is quite readable and clearly defines the problem and setting being considered.  The mathematics appears to be, to the best of my knowledge, correct.  The numerical experiments section is very short, although I appreciate the difficulty of fitting such a dense paper into 8 pages.  As a suggestion, figures 1 and 2 could be combined to free up some space for a short conclusions section, as the paper currently ends rather abruptly.  A few very minor typos: Line 188:  “On the opposite,”  ->  “In contrast,” Line 204:  Remove “.” Line 87:  “a MCMC”  ->  “an MCMC” References:  Numerous typos and capitalisations need fixed, with line overruns in [6] and [27]
