This paper establishes recoverability results for a number of graph-based inference problems inspired by the famous stochastic block model. These inference problems are inspired by some well studied graph constructions and seem to be new, though I am not an expert on whether they have been studied before.  I do not think this paper ought to be accepted, for reasons that I outline below.  First, the authors should clarify whether or how they have improved on previous results on the stochastic block model. Their non-recovery bounds bounds are much weaker and it is not clear that the authors have added anything to the tight results of [21].  Second, as the authors note, the SBM is very well studied, and the whole point of that literature has been to obtain exact constants (phase transitions) for recovery. In other words, it is very easy to show non-recoverability happens at around O(1/n). As it stands, the authors have obtained these very easy results for a host of different models, but without exactly matching bounds in the other direction (or even bounds matching up to the right order, for new models), I do not think these results are especially interesting.  Third, I do not think the techniques are of sufficient novelty to warrant publication. The authors emphasize their use of Fano's inequality, but this is a very standard tool. Moreover, all bounds are essentially based on the simple mutual information bound I(Y, A) \leq n^2/4 KL(p || q), which is the same bound which would arise from treating each entry in the adjacency matrix as independent. I do not think that there are any new ideas here which merit special attention.
