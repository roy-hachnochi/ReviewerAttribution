The paper investigates information-theoretic limits for community detection with two clusters on a variety of network models using restricted ensembles and Fano's inequality.   The results established in this paper yield novel bounds for the well-studied case of Stochastic Block Model, while yield the first results of their kind for the Exponential Random Graph Model, the Latent Space Model, the Directed Preferential Attachment Model, and the Directed Small-world Model, along with some dynamic models where the edge distribution not only depends on vertices but also on the edges previously generated.  The paper is well-written, and the math is sound. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper that provides a unifying framework that yields results on a variety of network models.
