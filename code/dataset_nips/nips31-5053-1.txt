[Summary] T_x0008_his paper presented a novel graph-based approach for visual question answering. The proposed method first uses object feature and question feature as graph node representation. Then, a spatial graph convolution network is used to learn the image representations that capture the question specific interactions. One nice property is the interpretability of the proposed model by visualizing the learned graph weight. Experiments on VQA v2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.   [Strength] 1: The proposed method is simple and effective, with simple model architecture, the proposed method can achieve state of the art performance on VQA dataset.   2: The graph visualization and interpretability of the proposed method is a plus.   [Weakness]  1: I like the paper's idea and result. However, this paper really REQUIRE the ablation study to justify the effectiveness of different compositions. For example: - In eq2, what is the number of m, and how m affect the results?  - In eq3, what is the dimension of w_n? what if the use the Euclidean coordinate instead of Polar coordinate?  - In eq3, how the number of Gaussian kernels changes the experiment results.   2: Based on the paper's description, I think it will be hard to replicate the result. It would be great if the authors can release the code after the acceptance of the paper.   3: There are several typos in the paper, need better proof reading.
