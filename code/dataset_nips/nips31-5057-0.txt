A nice paper about a new class of ‘adversarial’ conditional random field able to embed customized loss functions.  Learning and inference algorithms for tree topologies to be extended to the low-treewidth case are proposed. Experimental results show a clear improvement with respect to CRFs and competitive performance with structured SVMs.   I think the results are sounds and the paper might be accepted. Yet, I missed some efforts about the motivating Fisher consistency as a desirable features even from a practical perspective.  Perhaps evaluating the gap between AGMs and SSVMs for different training set sizes can do that.
