This paper studies the design of an algorithm for group fairness in online learning. This setup is more realistic than online learning for individual fairness and batch group fairness. The paper is very well written and the contributions are clear.  However, I think the assumption that all the predictors are individually non-discriminatory comes a little strong.  Although it is fine to use this strong assumption for the impossibility results, I did not find the other two results (the positive ones about the same error rates) practically useful.  I think the authors could replace this assumption by making a weaker adversary. For example, assuming that labels come from a distribution instead of adversely getting selected.  I think adding more intuition about these two assumptions would help a lot. 1) Assuming every predictor is individually non-discriminatory. 2) Assuming the adversary can adaptively choose the labels.
