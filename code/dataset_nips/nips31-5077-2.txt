The authors consider the setting of fairness in online learning. It is one of the initial works in the domain. The ideas used are not very novel but it is interesting as it is one of the first works in the domain. The authors prove an impossibility result to achieve fairness with equal false positive metric but show a positive result with equal expected error metric.   Strong Points:  [S1] The paper is well written and easy to follow [S2] The authors have done a good job to explain the ideas with simple examples  Weak Points [W1] I think the motivation behind equal error rate applications (speecch processing, recommender systems) is not well explained. I would have liked one case study or a small motivational example to better convey the intuitions.  [W2] There are no experiments to show the validity of results on real world datasets. It will help us better understand the advantages and disadvantages of the two metrics considered in the paper.    Overall, I like the work. It does not involve many fancy results but presents all the results in a simple manner which are easy to follow. I am disappointed to not see any real world experiments though and hence rate it marginally above the bar (explanation in W2).
