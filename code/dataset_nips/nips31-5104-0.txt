This paper presents a system for 3D pose estimation of multiple people in monocular images. The system is end-to-end trainable, and was tested on two datasets, obtaining very impressive results. The pipeline has several steps, such as feature extraction and volume encoding, and uses techniques like deep learning and linear programming.  === Strengths === 1) The main contribution of this paper is interesting and novel, and the experimental results provide strong evidence for the approach’s viability. 2) The paper is well-written. The contributions are clear and the main thesis of the paper is well-supported by the text and the experimental analysis. The approach is very well explained, with plenty of technical details. 3) The results are impressive. Two different datasets are used and the performance is compared against very recent results [21,22].  === Weaknesses === 1) The literature review (related work) discussion is extremely brief. Obviously, space on the paper is limited, but a bit more could be said about, for example, 3D pose estimation methods that use CNNs. Three citations missing are (and I’m sure there are more):     * Li and Chan. 3D human pose estimation from monocular images with deep convolutional neural network. ACCV 2014.     * Brau and Jiang. 3D human pose estimation via deep learning from 2D annotations. 3DV 2016.     * Chen et al. Synthesizing training images for boosting human 3D pose estimation. 3DV 2016. 2) The novelty is mostly incremental.  === Conclusion === This is a very good paper that presents a novel approach to a very important computer vision problem. The paper is well-written and the experimental results are impressive. Only concerns are limited literature review and incremental novelty.
