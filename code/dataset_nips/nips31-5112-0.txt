         **Summary and main remarks**          The manuscript investigates data-dependent PAC-Bayes priors. This is an area of great interest to the learning theory community: in PAC-Bayesian learning, most prior distributions do not rely on data and there has been some effort in leveraging information provided by data to design more efficient / relevant priors. Classical PAC-Bayes bounds hold for any prior and the crux is often to optimize a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term between a pseudo-posterior (a Gibbs potential of the form $\exp(-\lambda R_n(\cdot))\pi(\cdot)$) and the prior. The manuscript starts with a very convincing and clear introduction to the problem, and builds upon the paper Lever, Laviolette and Shawe-Taylor (2013). The intuition defended by the authors is that when using a data-dependent prior which is *robust* to data changes (loosely meaning that the prior is not crudely overfitting the data), then PAC-Bayesian bounds using this prior must be tighter than similar bounds with any prior. This is a clever direction and the use of differential privacy to address this more formally appears very relevant to me.          A second contribution of the manuscript is the use of SGLD (Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics) to elicit such data-dependent priors (section 5). This section closes with an important message, which is that the approximation found by SGLD still yields a valid PAC-Bayesian bound (Corollary 5.4). This is reassuring for practitioners as they benefit from the comforting PAC-Bayesian theory.          **Overall assessment**          I find the paper to be very well-written and with clever contributions to PAC-Bayesian learning, with a significant impact to the NIPS community. I have carefully checked the proofs and found no flaw. Since differential privacy is not my strongest suit, I have lowered my confidence score to 3. I recommend acceptance.          **Specific remarks**          - Some improper capitalization of words such as PAC, Bayesian, etc. in the references.         - typo: end of page 4, "ogften" -> often         - with the authors' scheme of proofs, it is unclear to me wether the limitation of having a loss bounded (by 1 for simplicity) is easy to relax. Since some effort has been put by the PAC-Bayesian community to derive generalization bounds for unbounded / heavy-tailed / non-iid data, perhaps a comment in section 2 (other related works) would be a nice addition to the manuscript. See for example the references Catoni, 2007 (already cited); Alquier and Guedj, 2018 (Simpler PAC-Bayesian bounds for hostile data, Machine Learning); and references therein.
