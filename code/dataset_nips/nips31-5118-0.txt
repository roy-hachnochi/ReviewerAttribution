This paper presents a deep Poisson-gamma dynamical systems (DPGDS) to model sequentially observed multivariate count data, which is built on top of PGDS and PGBN. It can be seen as: each time stamp is associated with PGBN. The corresponding latent layers $\theta$ are connected with a transition matrix. From figure 1, one can tell each column is GBN and each row is also a GBN, which, I think, is the major contribution of this paper. Given the construction, the inference algorithm should be straightforward by following PGDS and PGBN.   The experimental work is quite comprehensive. The proposed model was compared with the model in the same vein. It would be good to add a bit more empirical study on the scalability of the proposed model, given that Stochastic MCMC is used.  In general, it is an ineresting paper.
