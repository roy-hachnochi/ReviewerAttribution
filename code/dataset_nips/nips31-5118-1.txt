This paper generalizes the Poisson-gamma dynamical systems (PGDS) to more effectively mine hierarchical latent structures in multivariate time series. The resulting model is called Deep PGDS, which places a hierarchical structure on the latent factors, specified again by a Gamma transition equation The closed-form Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed with the same techniques that exploit the relationship between Poisson/Multinomial, Poisson/NB, etc., as well as the stochastic gradient MCMC version.   Overall, the presentation of this paper is very good, considering its notation-heavy nature, and the technical part is solid as well as its experimental section. I quite enjoyed reading the paper, nevertheless, my main concerns are: 1) on the algorithmic side, aside from the algebraic derivation, it's unclear about the technical contributions given that the techniques used are standard; 2) with the complicated MCMC inference algorithm, how practical it is for large-scale datasets?
