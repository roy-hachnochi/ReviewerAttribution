This paper presents Deep Poisson-Gamma Dynamical System (DPGDS) for modeling temporal multivariate count data. It is based on previously developed Gamma-Belief networks, extended to the dynamical scenarios by adding transitions of latent units in consecutive times. The paper is well written, and connections to previous papers are explained clearly.  Major comments: 1. While the temporal structure is based on transition of latent units in a Markov manner, the authors' claim about better capturing long-range temporal changes should be justified more clearly.  2. As the shape parameter in the Gamma distributions corresponding to latent units is summation of two terms, does imposing Dirichlet distributions on \Phi and \Pi makes the latent units completely identifiable?  3. I suggest to compare your performance with dynamical methods based on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models, which are incorporated specifically to have more flexible temporal structure, if possible.  Minor comments: 1. In line 30, "separated" should be replaced by "separately". 2. The sentence starting at line 46 is better to be rewritten more clearly.
