he authors proposed to relate the notion of continuity and precision/recall trade off, and derive upper bounds on precision over reduced dimensionality.  The authors also propose the use of Wasserstein distance as a measure of distortion of distances in the original set and retrieved set.   It is quite meaningful to explicitly show the relationship between precision, recall, and dimension reduction. The proposed evaluation of f by Wasserstein measure between uniform distribution on U, f^{-1}(V) is interesting. As far as I understand, the derivations are theoretically valid. I have positive impression for this paper, but presentation of the paper should be improved.  For example, Fig.1 is uninformative. It is a pretty good explanation of precision and recall, but it is easily understandable from definition of precision and recall. Instead, it would be better to put graphical and conceptual description of, for example, waist inequality or isoperimetric inequality in theorem 6, which would be more informative and helpful for better understanding of the established results.  I'm a bit confused the authors minimizes the lower bound of Wasserstein measure. Is it not very clear by this we can expect a good retrieval results. The authors claim that the experimental results are well aligned to those of optimized f-scores, but there should be more discussion on the reasoning to validate this evaluation. Also, figure 2 is too small and I cannot comprehend anything meaningful from the figure.  Minor points: - between lines 67 and 68, \Gamma(,) is not defined yet. It is defined line 197.  - line 81: unresolved reference.  - line 90: d( x, A), namely, distance between a point and a set should be properly defined.
