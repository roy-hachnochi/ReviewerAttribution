This paper proposes to use Wasserstein ambiguity sets to model uncertainty in the state estimation problem. The most relevant literature is H infinity filtering, where we solve "minimax" filtering optimization subject to the various disturbance (noise) models. While the typical H infinity filtering approach seeks a worst case disturbance "point", this paper seeks a worst case disturbance "distributions", which is more general then the usual H infinity filtering setting. I think the idea is new and interesting. Furthermore the paper proposes a new efficient algorithm for designing a filter under this setup, which is also interesting by its own.
