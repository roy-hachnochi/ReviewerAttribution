This paper proposes an oracle model for parallel algorithms for stochastic convex programming. There are two main oracle models that are studied: In the first one, the algorithm has access to an stochastic unbiased estimator of the gradient for a given feasible point, and in the second one one can query an stochastic proximal oracle (that is, the proximal operator for a random instance f(.,z), where z is sampled from the target distribution). All oracle access are obtained from i.i.d. samples from the target distribution.  Interestingly, the paper introduces sample access architectures that can reflect parallelism, delayed updates or intermittent communication, and it turns out the obtained lower bounds are optimal for most of these cases. However, in some situations the matching upper bound comes from an unnatural algorithms, so it is left as open problem whether the natural algorithms used in practice are optimal as well.  There are several technical contributions of this work. The first one is the incorporation of active queries: this is a standard scenario in statistical learning, but I haven't seen it before in the stochastic optimization framework. The second one, is a simple trick to parameterize nonsmooth and smooth functions simultaneously. Finally, there are these new "unnatural" but provably optimal methods for the proposed oracle models.  Overall, I believe this paper is not only strong, but provocative and indicative of future lines of research. For this reason, I strongly support the acceptation of this paper.  Detailed comments:  1. The idea of using Moreau-Yoshida regularization is already present in some works of lower bounds (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5001). In this work it is also used a simultaneous parameterization of various degrees of smoothness. 2. There are a few typos in the appendix. I will point out some of them. In page 11, line 24, the probability is of the inner product being smaller than c/2 (that last term is missing). In page 12, line 34, the exponential is missing a negative sign. In page 13, line 36, the factorization of ||x|| seems wrong since it is missing the division by ||x|| (it works overall, but the steps are confusing). In page 17, line 78, the upper bound of (eta/2)||y^{\ast}-x||^2 \geq \ell^2/(2\eta) goes in the wrong direction.
