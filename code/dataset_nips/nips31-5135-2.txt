Summary:  This paper studies lower bounds for optimization problems based on a notion of "computation graph," which is to say, how long one has to have computations depend on one another. The authors prove lower bounds on optimization that scale as 1 / \sqrt{D}, where D is this computation depth (or 1 / D^2 if the function is smooth), with variants depending on the type of oracle access the methods have. These results are more or less new, though I think it would be nice if the authors gave a bit more credit to researchers who developed many of the technical techniques in the results.  Criticisms and prior work:  Many of the difficult technical lemmas in the supplement are due to Woodwarth and Srebro [WS16] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08003), which were corrected by Carmon et al. [CDHS17] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11606). In particular, Lemma 1 in this paper is Lemma 9 of [CDHS17], and Lemma 2 is basically Lemma 4 of [CDHS17]. Lemma 3 is Lemma 11 of [CDHS17]. The inequalities involving Surface Area [lines 429--434] are on page 20 of [WS16]. This type of more or less technical copying is unseemly, and does not give appropriate credit to the work of [WS16] and [CDHS17]. I would rather not reject the paper for this, because I think there is some good content in the remainder of the paper, but it is inappropriate to reprove results, without citation, that due to others. The lower bound constructions are similar to those of Nesterov in his 2004 book as well, but probably worth keeping explicitly.  Additional comments: Line 109: These are not really the tightest possible lower bounds in that sense. The function f == 0 has lower bound 0 for any function. As such this sentence seems daft. Line 208: This is not particularly surprising. An algorithm that waits and collects mini-batches will have reduced variance gradient estimates, which are well-known to yield better convergence [e.g. the work of Dekel, Gilad-Bachrach, Shamir, Xiao]. Line 299: The word crisp is the wrong word here. Sharp or tight. Line 327: This line makes no sense to me, because I did not see real discussion of variance bounds in the paper.  POST FEEDBACK REVIEW  I believe the authors when they say they'll give appropriate citations to the prior literature. Happy to have the paper in, assuming that they will do this.
