The paper proposes co-teaching which uses the result that deep learning models learn easy instances first. One network is used to select the examples for the target network. The paper shows that for two type of noise, Co-teaching outperforms several baselines including Mentornet. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness on vision and language datasets.   I have one suggestion: The paper is mostly empirical and analysis will strengthen the results.
