This paper considered the problem of bilinear inversion of sparse vectors. Under the (somewhat unusual) assumption that the signs of the sparse vectors are also available, it was shown that exact recovery can be achieved via a rather natural convex program. The sample complexity for Gaussian random subspaces was derived based on the Rademacher complexity. I personally feel that the availability of the sign information is somewhat contrived, and I'm not familiar enough with the applications mentioned in the paper. Otherwise, the technical contributions appear to be rather substantial to me.
