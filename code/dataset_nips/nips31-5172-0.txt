This paper considers the problem of community structure recovery (in the balanced binary case) when presented with informative node covariates. The authors propose a simple statistical model for this problem and conjecture a sharp threshold for detecting the latent structure in this model (using the non-rigorous cavity method). They then rigorously establish the validity of this threshold in a particular limiting regime. Finally, they provide an algorithm for solving this problem and demonstrate empirical support for the above claims.   The paper is very well written and is bound to be of interest to the NIPS community. I did not check all the proofs in detail, but I performed some sanity checks to verify their validity. I recommend this paper be accepted to the NIPS program.   I have one suggestion for the authors: Please include an intuitive discussion about the threshold derived in Claim 3, right after the statement. This will be helpful for the reader.
