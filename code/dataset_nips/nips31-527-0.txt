Summary:   This paper considers locally differentially private (LDP) protocols under the non-interactive setting. Specifically, they study the LDP empirical (and population) risk minimization problem. Existing work (Smith et al. [19]) states that in general alpha^{-p} term is unavoidable in the sample complexity of any LDP algorithm for this problem. One of the main contributions of this work is to show that it is indeed possible to avoid this term under certain smoothness conditions.  For this, they have used the function approximation via Bernstein polynomials (similar to [1]).  They also propose and analyze the sample complexity of a computation and communication variant of their initial solution (Algorithm 2->3). For this, they exploit the 'sampling resilient' property of the LDP-AVG algorithm.   Comments:   The paper addresses a significant problem, and it extends ideas/techniques from several existing works to answer the questions posed in the introduction of the article.  In the beginning, the paper is well written - problem statement, motivation, and contributions are clearly stated. But the latter parts of sections 5 and 6  are very dense with technical details, with minimal/no discussions following the theorems.   Minor typos: 'd' is used mistakenly in place of 'p' (e.g. line 232)  Questions:  1) The resulting risk bounds of Corollaries 1 and 2 are compared to that of Theorem 1. But is it possible to compare them with the results mentioned in lines 61-68 (Smith et al. [19], Zheng et al. [24])? Are the loss functions mentioned there satisfy your smoothness conditions ((8,T), and (infinity,T))? If then how strong/weak is your bound compared to that?   2) Is the LDP-AVG protocol mentioned in Lemma 2, a multivariate variant of Algorithm 1 or is mentioned anywhere else explicitly?
