The paper is well written. It is, however, dense in many places, which makes the reading hard at the first glance. A supplementary that introduces key concepts on Legendre decomposition. The interesting idea is to compute a unique decomposition of a non-negative input tensor with a given choice of the parameter basis. Although the tensor notion is not really used in the algorithm, it does well in the limited numerical experiments. To this end, I consider the work a good contribution.
