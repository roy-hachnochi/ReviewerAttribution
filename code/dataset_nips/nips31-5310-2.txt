This paper provides an estimator for estimating a class of functionals of some discrete probability mass functions with some favorable properties. Specifically, the proposed estimators have linear time complexity. In terms of sample complexity, they compare well with the straightforward empirical estimator computed with  O(n \sqrt{log n}) samples.    This paper address an interesting problem and provides an interesting solution. The novelty content paper is also high and the work is thorough. The intuition provided in section 6 is useful and the paper is overall well-written.    One question I have is can lower bounds be proved for the upper bounds in theorem 1 ? If so, that would help develop more insight into this estimator.   note: I have not checked the proofs line-by-line as there is not much time to review all allotted papers. But the general strategy looks ok to me.
