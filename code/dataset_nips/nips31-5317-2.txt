In this paper, an analysis of Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) as a moment matching was given. I did not go through the proofs attached in the supplementary. From my experience, SVGD seems to be a promising framework for the synthesis of MCMC and VI, yet there is room for further analysis and development. This work seems to fill some gap by providing description of the 'fixed point' characteristics of SVGD. Specifically, I think the contribution of the paper is significant since it managed to provide analysis when the number of samples does not asymptotically grow to infinity. Such analysis makes more sense because SVGD does not add samples as time grow, contrary to the case of MCMC.   Editorial comments:  - The variable \epsilon is used twice for indicating the 'step size' of SVGD and size of neighborhood in Lemma 3.1. One of them should be changed for consistency of writing.  - \mathtt{Stein Equation} in equation (13) seems unnecessary. - Readability of equation between line 214 and 215 can be improved, e.g., use consistent spacing and make the word 's.t.' into non-italic.  Typos:  - replace 'losses' by 'looses' in line 21. - insert space in 'upto' in line 180. - erase square bracket in equation above line 218.
