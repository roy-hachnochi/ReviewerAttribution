This paper explores differential privacy (DP) under the dynamical scenario where the datasets grow in time. Differential privacy literature mostly considers the static case so this is a fairly unexplored topic. The authors propose a differentially private multiplicative weights method, i.e., an adaptive stream of linear queries, for the dynamical setting. They also provide transformations for private static algorithms (both pure and approximate DP) to work in the dynamical case and study their accuracy.  It is a very well-written paper and good contribution, filling an important gap in the literature.
