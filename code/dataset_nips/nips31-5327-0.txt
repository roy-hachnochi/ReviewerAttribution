The paper establishes problem-specific regret lower bounds for ergodic RL problems with arbitrary structure. The paper focuses on MDPs with finite states and actions, and on learning algorithms that are uniformly good over a class of MDPs. The lower bound is made explicit for unstructured MDPs and Lipschitz MDPs. For unstructured MDPs, the bound extends a previous result in [1] to take into account unknown rewards. For Lipschitz MDPs, the bound depends only on the Lipschitz structure, the sub-optimality gap, and the span of the bias functions, and does not explicitly scale with the size of the state space and action space. The paper then proposes an algorithm, DEL, that matches these lower bounds.   The proposed lower bounds are a generalization of results in [2] from the bandit setting to the RL setting, and the proposed algorithm is an adaptation of the algorithm proposed in [2]. I think the paper is very clearly written in general. The motivation and intuition for the theorems and proofs are all very well explained. The optimization problem which defines the lower bound still seems a little abstract to me. If possible, it might be helpful to further illustrate the lower bounds through more concrete examples other than Lipschitz MDPs.   [1] Apostolos N. Burnetas and Michael N. Katehakis.
