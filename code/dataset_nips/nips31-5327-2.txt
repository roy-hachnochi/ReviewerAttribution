This paper present an analysis of regret lower bound of structured MDP problems. For Lipschitz MDPs, the regret bound are shown to not grow with the size of states and action spaces. A algorithm called DEL(Direct Exploration Learning) is also proposed to match the regret lower bound.   Theorem 1 proves a regret lower bound for arbitrary structured MDP. While the factor K_{\Phi}(\phi) seems a little bit complicated, the authors did a good job explaining it. Theorem 2 handles the special case of unstructured MDP while Theorem 3 deals with Lipschitz structured MDP. The implications of S_{lip} and A_{lip} are obscure without further explanation. The d exponent seems to be indicating that S_{lip} is on the order of S, depending on the other  factors in line 234. Without further explanation, that will weaken the analysis on the Lipschitz structure case. Although the proposed algorithm is a proof of concept one, it's satisfactory to see that the lower bound are actually achievable.   The results are interesting and the technical details are solid, with that I recommend accept for this paper.
