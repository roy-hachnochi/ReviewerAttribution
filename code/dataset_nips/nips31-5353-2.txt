This paper describes a method to learn a low-dimensional dynamical system from high-dimensional observation data. The method builds upon the so-called amortized inference, more precisely on semi-amortized inference with iterative refinement. Thanks to the SOC formalization, the auto-encoder is learning the low-dimensional sequence of states from the high-dimensional data. The manuscript reports resulst on the inverted pendulum application as well as real motion capture data. The reported results demonstrate that the proposed approach reaches a tighter bound.  I am unable to double-check every single mathematical derivation done through the paper, since they are quite a few and some of them very technical. From an experimental perspective, I think having a "toy" and a "real" dataset is a nice choice.   I am most concerned, however, on the pratical implications of the study. I understand the importance of estimating a tighter bound, but it is equally important to understand the practical effects of this tighter bound. Is it really meaningful in practice? Can we get better performance in some applicative scenario? These considerations are important, and to my understanding, missing in the paper.
