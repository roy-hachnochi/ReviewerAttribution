Summary: The paper considers the problem of non-parametric regression using Wavelet basis functions. The main contribution of the paper is a clever interpolation scheme that allows the authors to handle irregularly spaced data. With the interpolation scheme the estimation problem reduces to a Lasso type problem and the authors are able to use existing technical machinery developed for the standard Lasso problem to obtain minimax convergence rates.  Comments: The paper is well written and easy to follow. The interpolation method is novel and appears to be useful in practice. However, the Theoretical analysis is essentially standard. The proposal of using additive models for high-dimensional estimation is also fairly standard. I have essentially some minor comments to improve the presentation of the paper. 1) The linear interpolation scheme (lines 117 to 118) can be described a bit more intuitively. 2) The compatibility condition for wavelet regression can also be explained a bit more intuitively.
