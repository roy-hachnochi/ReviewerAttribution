This paper proposes and validates an approach for inferring latest velocities given weather radar data.  The proposed approach is a framework based on Gaussian Process (GP) models, and addresses many aspects (partial velocity measurements, station specific geometries, measurement noise, and other domain specific issues, such as "aliasing", etc.) in a unified manner. The empirical application is done on the problem of inferring bird migration patterns/speeds given the weather radar data. Sophisticated and talented use of various existing techniques are made to solve this problem elegantly and satisfactorily. Only minuses of this paper are: significance and applicability of the proposed approach to other application areas are less clear, and so is the significance of the proposal on the methodological development of central interest to the NIPS community. Nonetheless, this is a good application paper, which probably deserves to be represented in the conference.
