This paper presents Quadrature Fourier Features as an alternative for random features to improve the scalability of Bayesian optimization under the additive model assumption. The additive model assumption has been extensively studied previously as correctly mentioned in the paper. In this case, the authors use a variation of the Thompson sampling acquisition function, where the sample is selected from the approximation of the GP model using QFF, which are much more efficient. However, as pointed out by the authors, although QFF scale better than the GPs for a high number of data points, it scale poorly with the dimension of problem. Given that the paper is about high dimensional BO, this is a serious concern. It is true that, for some problems, the effective dimension is lower, however, in the paper, all the experiments rely on a effective dimension of 1 or 2. This is completely unrealistic in practice. Given the limitations of QFF with the dimensionality of the problem, it is necessary to evaluate how far can be applied in practice.       Minor comments:       -Figs 2 and 3 are tiny and difficult to read even in the PDF. The legend is too invasive. Given that the colors are the same for multiple plots, they could use a single legend outside all plot or describe the colors in the caption. ---- The author's response about the effective dimensionality is compelling. It would be nice to have an experiment that pushes the limit of the method, like having multiple cliques with effective dimensionality of 4-6 each of them. Nevertheless, the paper is a nice step towards high-D BO.
