This paper introduces improved algorithms for unfolded sparse recovery solvers, provides better theoretical understanding of these algorithms and shows linear convergence (unlike before) for the introduced algorithms. It also does number of experiments showing various properties of the models and improved performance. Paper is nicely done and relevant. It is good and interesting that simplification of the algorithm (having one instead of two trainable matrices) improves the algorithm.  - Line 22: Does ISTA and solution to (2) even converge to x* of (1) ? It shouldn’t as the |x| pushes down on the solution. Do you mean to say that it converges sub linearly to the final solution of (2)? In your graphs for ISTA later in the paper, do you do L2 error to x* or to solution of (2).  - It would be good to say what sub linearly (or linearly) means - in terms of what? Of course you go into detail in the text later but it would be good to know at this point. - It would be good to state the protocol at the start. We unfold for N steps and train the network to predict (only) at the last step. It is interesting that the algorithm has good predictions at earlier steps, even though it was not trained for that.  - 123: and “trust them as true support” -> “trust them as true support and won’t pass them through thresholding”.  - Figure 3: How come there is so little difference between ISTA and FISTA - I though the latter converged quite a bit faster. Is it because of my first point?
