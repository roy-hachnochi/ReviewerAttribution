This paper proposes a variant of LISTA with coupled weights and provides a theoretical analysis for it. It shows that if LISTA converges then its weights values and the thresholds in it go to zero.   The two variants proposed by the paper are using a combination of soft and hard thresholding and coupling the weights in the network. In the experiments, these changes are shown to give better results.    Though the paper is interesting with some theory that is lacking for LISTA, I believe there are several important details that are missing in it:  1. The code used for the proposed technique is very sophisticated with per-layer initialization. It is not clear what code was used for LISTA and LAMP. It might be that the better performance compared to them is just the different optimization used for the method proposed in the paper.    2. Where do the authors use the ``network extension'' part, where they learn both the dictionary and the network parameters? It is unclear where it is used.    3.
