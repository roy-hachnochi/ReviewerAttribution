This paper adresses the problem of learning invariant representation by defining an information-theoretic constraint defined as the mutual mutual information between the constructed representation z and the variability factor c. This constraint is further incorporated in a VAE. Mutual Information is know to be hard to compute, and in line with the very very abundant recent literature, the authors propose to use a variational approximation.  I found the paper hard to follow, and I must say that I’m still struggling to write my review. I don’t find that there are original ideas in the paper, Variational Approximation of MI is now something established. Combining it in VAE  seems not novel. I can change my mind on this, but I need more explanations about the real novelty.  Also, I found the title misleading and unrelated to the actual purpose of the paper. Also the part on adversarial attack seems superficial to me.   In the introduction, I didn’t understand why the authors discuss observational studies, and the use of the term « confounding » which refers to causal reasoning is not appropriate in this setting.
