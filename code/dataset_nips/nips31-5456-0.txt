================ Light review ================  I am not an expert in this area, but I think the results presented in this work are accurate. Some questions and comments for the authors below:  1. The paper is very hard to follow. It would be good to describe the model/problem first and then the solution. As it stands, especially in the introduction, the problem statement and solution concept are mixed up.  2. The use of "safe policies" in this work is quite misleading. The technical/research connotation of safety in the context of RL/control/robotics is regarding exploration -- does the agent avoid visiting parts of the state space that are unsafe/unstable. Safety as used here is in the context of AI safety, which I feel is largely a non-technical or popular press use of the term. I would encourage the authors to phrase the problem differently (e.g. robustness to misaligned goals), to avoid confusion in the research community.  3. While the connections to robust optimization literature is interesting, it is unclear what the broader impact of the work would be. The assumptions used are very restrictive, largely to be able to directly borrow results from optimization literature. The algorithms/approaches proposed in this work also crucially rely on these restrictive assumptions (not just for proofs) and hence cannot be applied more broadly. Thus, I would encourage the authors to have a section on how to extend these ideas to cases where the assumptions don't hold -- can any insights be carried over? It would also help to have experiments on more difficult/elaborate tasks.
