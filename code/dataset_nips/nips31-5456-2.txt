Summary: The paper proposes a framework for learning safe policies in the setting where reward functions are unknown but a set of expert demonstrations are available. Under the assumption of linear reward functions, the set of expert demonstrations are used to form a polytope of all reward functions that are consistent with expert. Then to ensure safety, the paper propose to perform maxmin optimization: learning a policy to maximize the worst possible reward from the reward polytope. Under the availability of separation oracles and MDP solvers, the paper proposed two algorithms: 1 an exact ellipsoid-based method and (2) an algorithm the uses FTPL to alternatively updating policy and reward function to approximately solve the maxmin problem. The authors also showed how the maxmin formulation they used is different from previous imitation learning framework.  strengths: the paper is well-wrriten and the algorithms and theorems are clear.   Comments:    1. The FPL maxmin learning requires ellipsoid method with access to SO_R to solve the argmin problem to find the reward function (maybe it should be clearly stated in Alg 3 or the text around Alg 3). As the query on SO_F and query on SO_R both use ALG as internal solver,  is it possible to explicitly work out the complexity of both algorithm in terms of the number of ALG calls to show the gap between the ellipsoid method and Alg 3?
