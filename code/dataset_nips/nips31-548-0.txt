In this paper, a novel sparse and low-rank tensor regression model along with a fast solver are developed and analysed. Concretely, a parsimonious and interpretable mapping is learnt by seeking a sparse CP decomposition of coefficient tensor. To solve this problem an (asymptotically) convergent solver is developed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is thoroughly evaluated by conducting numerical tests in both real and synthetic data. The reported results indicate that the proposed method is faster and in several cases achieves better predictions than the state of the art when comparable RMSE and sparsity are achieved.   Overall, the paper is well-written, and easy to read. Appropriate motivations are clearly stated in the introduction of the paper. I believe that the current version of the paper can be published.
