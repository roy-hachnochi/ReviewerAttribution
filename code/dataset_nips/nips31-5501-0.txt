This work proposes an alternative to the softmax loss with the intention of maximizing entropy for unknown categories. This is achieved by explicitly enforcing uniform class logits for unknown classes with the entropic open-set loss, and is further improved by reducing feature magnitude for unknown classes.  +Empirical results in Table 2 suggest it can be a better choice of loss than the typical softmax, given the added complexity and proper tuning of \lambda. +Paper was clearly explained and easy to understand +Analysis does a reasonable job of explaining some limitations  -Explanation for why new evaluation metrics are introduced appears incomplete. While confidences cannot be directly compared across different detection algorithms, existing works compare the normalized AUC of the precision-recall curve (average precision), which, at the very least, is not affected by monotonic re-normalizations as in the case of the "squared MLP with Ensemble" example. Furthermore, open-set detection tasks such as phrase localization [1] use metrics such as Recall@K. I think it makes sense to include some discussion of why (or when) one should use the proposed evaluation over AUC and Recall@K.  [1] Bryan A. Plummer, Liwei Wang, Christopher M. Cervantes, Juan C.

Post-Rebuttal: The authors have adequately addressed my concerns. I hope they include the comparison with standard evaluations metrics in their final paper.
