This paper proposes a new model for generating Graph node embeddings without the need to manually tune relevant hyperparameters, but rather rely on learning trainable node contexts distribution through attention mechanism to model the relationship between all Graph nodes. These learned attention scores are shown to vary between different graphs, indicating that the model is actually able to preserve the inherent graph information. The paper is well written and structured, presenting the problem clearly and accurately. It contains considerable relevant references and background knowledge. It nicely motivates the proposed approach, locates the contributions in the state-of-the-art and reviews related work. It aligns specifically with the unsupervised Graph embedding methods. It is also very clear in terms of how it differs on the technical level from existing approaches. What I am missing, however, is a discussion of pros and cons. How should we improve in the future? Overall, however, the ideas presented in the paper are interesting and original, presumably applicable to multiple domains including Graph attention or Graph embedding. And the experimental section is convincing. My recommendation is to accept this submission.
