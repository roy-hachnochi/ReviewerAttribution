The paper proposes a methodology that combines predefined structural information, such as position, shape, size, color, with symbolic-reasoning. Demonstrating a state-of-the-art performance over CLEVER dataset, with relatively small dataset, also evaluating their reasoning model for new Minecraft world setup. The paper is primarily an applications paper and in that regard, the experiments are well-executed and provide evidence for the claims in the paper. Clarity/Quality: The paper is well-written. contributions clearly laid out. Originality: The paper inspired and closely follows work of IEP, extending it with extracted structural information. Significance: The proposed approach demonstrates clear improvements: improving answer accuracy, generating plausible programs, reducing the need of labeled data, however, require stronger supervision with structure information. I believe structure supervision should be easier to achieve than annotated programs, therefore I’m in favor of this method.  Some questions: • Reviewer is no expert in the specific methodology, while the structure is well-reasoned throughout, I wasn’t convinced why your approach generates better programs compared to IEP. Both use the same LSTM network. Can you elaborate? • I wonder if there a reason to compare your generated programs to IEP instead of SOTA TbD+reg+hres_ • Have you done ablation analysis, can you explain your design choices. For instance, L144, have you tried weighted version attention as well?  After author's response: Thanks for clearing out my concerns.
