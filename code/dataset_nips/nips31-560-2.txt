The work reported in this paper is focused on reducing the computational cost of convolutional neural networks in image processing.   The major strength of this paper is the conversion of the problem into the frequency domain, as outlined in Equations 1-4, which is also appropriately illustrated in Figure 1. The pruning in frequency domain and band adaptive pruning is also a nice extension.   The major weakness of this work is that most of the gain in the computational cost is available only on hardware where the multiplication with zero is not an operation (nop) and can be smartly skipped. However, most CPU and GPU hardware are not currently geared to take advantage of the savings associated with multiplication with zero. The empirical results also do not comment on practical savings in computational cost and that is a disappointment.
