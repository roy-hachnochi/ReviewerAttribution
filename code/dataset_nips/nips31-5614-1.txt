Most methods used for estimating causal quantities from observational data relf on unconfoundedness i.e. there exist no unobserved confounders between treatment and outcome. In reality however, this assumption is rarely satisfied. Assuming that unconfoundedness holds (when it doesnâ€™t) can create major complications in sensitive applications such as medicine. This paper develops a framework for policy improvement that works well in the presence of confounding.
