The paper deals with l_1 regression when the noise is only assumed to have 2 moments. To proceed, the authors minimize an estimation of the l_1 loss constructed using the estimators of univariate means by Catoni (2012).  Using basic concentration inequalities in an approach similar to Vapnik, the authors derive rates of convergence for this estimator in sqrt(d log n/n).  I think that it would be interesting to have a deeper investigation of the Gaussian case to have a fair benchmark to compare these rates. The strategy developed for the l_2 case follows these lines and it would be interesting to see if the minmax strategy that was necessary in the l_2 case to obtain optimal rates is also necessary in the l_1 case or if the min estimator proposed here is sufficient to get optimal rates.  As the results are stated, it seems that there is gap between rates of the ERM in the bounded case and the rates obtained for the robust estimators. It suggests that the rates in the robust case are not optimal and it would be nice to see if the difference between these rates is necessary.
