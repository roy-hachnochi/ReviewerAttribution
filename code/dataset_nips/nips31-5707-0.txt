The paper addresses the question of finding the number of landmark points for Nystrom approximation when used with Kernel K-means.   The main contribution of this paper is to show that \sqrt{n} number of landmarks suffice to get a low regret of O(k/\sqrt{n}).  While there has been long line of works in understanding Nystorm methods, the result obtained in this paper is new. It is an interesting development and should be of interest to community involved in Clustering with Kernels.  In summary this paper is well written with original results which will be of interest to  experts interested in Kernel methods.
