In this paper, the authors present a theoretical treatment of the question why there are multiple cell types in the retina. While efficient coding theories have provided some insight into retinal structure in the past, little work on explaining cell type diversity has been done, with the notable exception of understanding ON- and OFF-pathway splitting. Given recent interest in cell type diversity in the retina, the contribution is timely and targets a fundamental question in systems neuroscience, and the fit to data from midget and parasol cells of the primate is impressive.  The linear model studied in sections 3 and 4 provides analytical insights clearly going beyond previous work. Just a few comments here: - lines 109-125: These contain the first main result of the paper and seem correct, but could be argued more clearly. I found the argument hard to follow. - lines 142 f: suddently, the authors use the term "mode" and my impression is that this term is never defined anywhere. Please clarify and explain what you mean. - Fig. 2D/E: Improve the contrast of the line - Fig. 2A-C: I find it surprising that the optimization procedure returns filters with sharp boundaries such as shown in this Figure. How does this come about? Can the RFs be visualized in a more conventional manner as well?  In addition, the authors use a 1-layer autoencoder with relus as a slighly non-linear autoencoder. This part feels not complete as the rest of the paper, since RGCs are obviously not the first stage of visual processing, but the third, so a 3-layer autoencoder with relus at each stage would be the more reasonable choice.  Overall, it would be nice to see the authors refer to other work than done in the primate as well (reviewed e.g. by Sanes and Masland) and it would be nice to hear the authors thoughts how the primate compares to the mouse in terms of ecological demands.
