The paper shows some bounds on the number of interventions and samples for distinguishing causal BNs on the same graph with some unobserved nodes(?).  The paper is structured and written very poorly:  Introductions takes 6 pages 4 pages of citations many of which are not relevant here weird and unnecessary quotes theorems inside introduction intro includes a lot of unnecessary common knowledge to anybody actually interested in the paper e.g. two definitions of C-components results and their connections are not explained but only stated huge appendix (the submission has 31 pages in total) including most of the theoretical contribution  The paper would have to be totally rewritten in order for a reviewer to sensibly form an opinion about the theoretical findings, which may themselves be good or not.  AFTER AUTHOR FEEDBACK: I re-read the paper. I cannot give any higher score: the main paper is extremely poorly written, even if there would be something meaningful behind the results (which the other reviews seem to indicate). Writing a poor discussion (also, without any examples) on the results and putting a whole journal paper in the appendix is not enough.  Minor: l. 190: A bidirected edge in semimarkovian graph not only put in when there is a common unobservable parent, but also when there is a common unobservable ancestor, e.g. X<-U1<-U2->U3->Y also turns into X<->Y.
