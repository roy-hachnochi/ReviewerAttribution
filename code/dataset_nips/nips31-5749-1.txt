In this paper, the authors study the implicit bias induced by gradient descent on linear fully connected neural network and linear convolutional neural network. The authors show that convolutional parametrization of the NN has a radically different biased when trained with gradient descent, even if the fully connected linear NN and the linear convolutional NN defines the exact model class.  Even though the linear convolutional NN are not explicitly regularised their solutions are biased to have sparsity in the frequency domain (Theorem 2), and this bias change with respect to the depth of the network (Theorem 2a).  The paper is well written, clear and to the point. Although it is clear that this work allows us to better understand the implicit “regularisation” role of optimization on some specific form NN, because the subject of this paper is not close to my personal research area, it is hard for me to evaluate the Significance of this work.
