The paper does submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint, when there are several functions, and we want to be close to the optimal on the minimal one. This is a natural problem, and they get the optimal 1- 1/e result.  From an algorithmic perspective, they use continuous greedy and maximize the multilinear extension of several functions at once. It's not a completely new algorithm, but they do have some fine print.  In the experiments section, I think your baselines were too naive. Greedy doesn't even look at the functions, and running a bi criteria algorithm without letting it pick enough elements is bound to be bad.
