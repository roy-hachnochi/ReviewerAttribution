The paper proposes three efficient multiobjective submodular maximization algorithms.  I like this paper, and has no clear objection to the paper. The techniques (using one-pass procedure for picking the heavy elements, separating MWU and the continuous greedy) are simple and effective, and seem to be applied for more general problems.    [minor] - l.21: The first paragraph (many well known ...) is arguable. There are many non-submodular combinatorial optimization problems.  - l.60: the approximation ratio of multilinear extension-based method must be (1 - 1/e) - \epsilon. - l.89: Please write the complexity of (1 - 1/e) approx algorithm explicitly. I think it already gives significant improvement from n^{O(1/eps)} to O(poly(n, 1/eps)), and the actual bottleneck of Algorithm 1 is this factor (usually it exceeds n^{100}). - l.129: it wil be better to write x = (x_1, ..., x_n) instead of x = {x_1, ...,x_n}.  [very minor] - l.129: I guess you used $$ ... $$ for the display math. As in https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/PaperInformation/StyleFiles it should be avoided because it breaks line numbering.
