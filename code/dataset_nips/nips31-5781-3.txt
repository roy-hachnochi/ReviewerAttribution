This paper builds on the probabilistic interpretation of MAML (e.g. Grant et al.) The proposed inference procedure allows for meta-learning for few-shot learning problems in which the small amount of data makes the given task ambiguous.  The paperâ€™s writing is clear. The theory is relevant to extending MAML to a distribution over parameters. Experiments highlight the advantages (dealing with ambiguity in tasks) of the proposed method.
