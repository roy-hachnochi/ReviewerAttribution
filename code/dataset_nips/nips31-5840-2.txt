The present submission presents an algorithm and architecture for attacking inverse problems where substantial prior knowledge can be put in the form of a neural network architecture generating the inverses. The idea is simple, modify proximal gradient descent so that the proximal step is a learned neural network, and use a loss that makes the iterates close to the data. The authors also propose an architecture that works well with the algorithm.  The paper is marvelously well written (albeit strongly worded, e.g. phrases like 'we develop a successful system solving all these challenges' in the abstract should be toned down unless strong guarantees are provided that address for example the mentioned challenge of data scarcity).  The idea is simple, and easy to implement, and the results are very good (given I'm not an expert in any of the datasets).  Section 4 is very interesting and well developed, which is arguably of much more use than just this paper since there is growing interest in iterative inference methods. I appreciate that the authors point out the lack of data dependent (distributional) assumptions that ensure approximate convergence with high probability, and I am surprised that the \eta terms are less than one (especially \eta1, which has a large data independent aspect, given the supremum). I would like to know if these terms grow with the number of dimensions of the problem, potentially being larger than 1? This wouldn't be too surprising given the growth of the spectral norms and  L1 / LInf norms of random matrices.  One of the things that I appreciate the most is section 5. The authors don't just present a contraction result with a potentially meaningless bound in section 4, but study extensively in section 5.3 the behaviour of the contraction analysis by carefully designed experiments that elucidate the properties of the method. More research should be done like this, which is much more informative than crude SNR numbers about the behaviour of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, numerous ablation studies are performed that help guide how to use the algorithm.  I think this is a paper with a clear contribution, a useful simple idea, strong results that are well validated, and perhaps more important than that, the proposed method is examined to the core, with targeted experiments and analysis that are likely to be useful for works to follow.  I would like to ask the authors if the code is going to be released with the submission?  ==========================================================  I think reviewer #1 raises valid concerns regarding the significance of the benchmark results, and the need for more accurate baselines. The reason for my rating was mainly on the experimental work surrounding the workings of the algorithm (which I still stand by), and perhaps my limited knowledge of the datasets lead to an overestimation of the other results' value.  I think this is a tricky paper. I still vote for acceptance, given that I think the contraction analysis and related experiments have a strong accompanying value, especially aimed at explaining the algorithm, but nonetheless I think the concerns are valid and the paper should have done a better job regarding the baselines and comparison with previous work. I have thus updated my score to a 7.
