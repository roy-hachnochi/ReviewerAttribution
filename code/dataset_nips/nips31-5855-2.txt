The paper proposes an 1/2-approximation algorithm for non-monotone continuous submodular maximization problem. This is the optimal approximation ratio. I checked the proof outline in the paper, and skimmed them in supplementary material. I did not find any serious flaw.  I believe this paper should be accepted. The obtained result is very strong, and the proof technique (reduction to a zero-sum game) is quite novel. Even the practical performance, shown in Table 1, is not so different with the existing methods, it has a solid theoretical strength.  [minor] - Are the differences in Table 1 significant? (i.e., could you show the variance?)
