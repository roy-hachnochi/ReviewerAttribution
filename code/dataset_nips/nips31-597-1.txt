This paper proposes and develops a novel framework for interactive structure learning, and in particular presents a generalization of the "query by committee" method for active learning for this new setting. The paper then presents fundamental theoretical results such as consistency and rate of convergence for that generalized method.   The paper addresses an important problem, namely that of interactive learning of structures, which generalizes the typical active learning framework in a number of ways, and the formulation they develop is well motivated. Judging from the detailed proofs in the supplemental materials, the theoretical analyses are sound. The supplemental materials also contain considerable empirical results, which adds to the audience's confidence in the general effectiveness of the proposed approach.  It would be nice, therefore, if they could include some brief summary of the experiment section in the paper itself, if at all possible. Overall a good paper with significant contributions on a general problem of practical import.
