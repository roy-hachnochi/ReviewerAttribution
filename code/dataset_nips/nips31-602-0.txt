Summary: The authors study the geometry of multichannel sparse blind deconvolution problems over the unit sphere. The geometric analysis presented  reveals two important results: (1) all local minima of the sparsity promoting objective function correspond to signed shifted versions of the true solution; (2) The objective function is strongly convex in neighborhoods of the local minima, and has strictly negative curvature directions in neighborhoods of local maxima and saddle points.  Assessment: This is an excellent paper, which will be of great interest to the NIPS audience. It is well motivated, clearly written, and well organized. The work is properly placed in the context of prior work. The technical contribution is significant and original and brings great insight about an important class of problems.
