The paper introduces a novel variational algorithm, that aims at dealing highly flexible approximating distributions, in order to reduce to bias of the variational approximation. The paper is obviously interesting but, not being an expert of the field, I found it quite technical and dense, probably due to the lack of space.  The central idea of the paper seems to be the reformulation of the minimization of the KL divergence wrt $q$ (the approximate distribution) into an optimization problem wrt a set of 'local variables'. Based on this formulation, the authors derive an optimization algorithm that is reasonably easy to implement.  My main comments are about a series of claims that are not obvious to me. * The author describe the iterative transformations as non-parametric and I am not sure to understand in what sense. * The sentence in L163-164 is rather obscure, although it sounds a very general comment on the virtues of the proposed approach. * The proposed optimization embedding relies on the choice of a divergence (denoted $D_\omega$). This choice (and its influence on the results) is not much discussed.  Minor points: * L86: should '$q_k$' be '$q_T$'? * L406: 'transform' -> 'transforms'?
