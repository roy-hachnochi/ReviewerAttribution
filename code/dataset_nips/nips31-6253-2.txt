This paper uses variational approach to learn latent alignment, and evaluated its result on machine translation and visual question answering. The evaluation results show that their approach performs better than conventional attention mechanism. However, the general idea has been explored in [18, 19], and the proposed approach is very similar to existing work, which limits its novelty. The authors briefly described [18, 19], but there is no theoretical or empirical comparisons which makes it unclear whether the proposed method improves existing approaches.
