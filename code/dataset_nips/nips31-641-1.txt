The article studies the problem of hybrid SGD under without replacement conditions. Theoretical results in terms of convergence are provided in different scenarios. These results are further reinforced with experimental results. The results suggest improvement of the proposed method compared to the rest. However, when checking the figures of convergence we can easily see how the proposed method clearly converges faster and seems to reach a "plateau" stage while some of the rest of the methods still clearly show a decreasing behavior. I was wondering if the authors checked the convergence beyond the IFO/n values shown.  Regarding the rest of the paper, the organization is correct but difficult to follow. Mostly because there are many different messages involved. Otherwise a nice paper.
