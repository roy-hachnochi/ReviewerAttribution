Summary:  This paper proposed an object-oriented dynamic predictor. This predictor can accurately predict dynamics and generalize to unseen states with the help of a class-specific detector. Strong points:  + Object-oriented method provides a good representation for dynamic learning. This direction can be a very interesting one for future research.  + The architecture is novel to combine static and dynamic objects. Weakness:  - The experiments are only done on one game environment. More experiments are necessary.  - This method seems not generalizable for other games e.g. FPS game. People can hardly do this on realistic scenes such as driving. Static Assumption too strong.
