Summary: In this work, the authors study the problem of testing autonomous vehicles. Real-world testing is putting public into risk and the rare nature of accidents require billions of miles to evaluate. The authors implement a simulation framework to test an entire autonomous driving system. Their goal is to evaluate the probability of an accident under a base distribution governing standard traffic behavior. The demonstration of this framework shows that it is possible to accelerate system evaluation by 10-50P times that of real world testing and 1.5-5 times that of naive Monte Carlo sampling methods.    Strong Points: 1) Interesting problem and solution. The authors try to solve the problem of AV testing by taking into consideration the two following challenges: the rare nature of serious accidents, how to verify the correctness of an AV? 2) The paper introduced interesting ideas on how to improve simulations for AV testing. 3) Claims are well proved, discussed and explained. 4) Extended literature review on verification methods, perception pipeline, cross-entropy method, and generative adversarial imitation learning.  Weak Points: 1) The authors should include which methods are used now for testing AVs in a related work section. 2) Evaluation of the proposed framework is not very clear. 3) There is no explanation on how to pick values for the parameters in the Experiments section.
