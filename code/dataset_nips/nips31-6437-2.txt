Within the framework of Bayesian optimization, this paper studies the differentiability of Monte Carlo acquisition functions and the submodularity of some acquisition functions. The authors consider to differentiate sample-path to optimize acquisition functions and using submodularity to guarantee the near optimality of greedy approaches.  The paper is well written and easy to follow. The efforts on reparameterizing several widely used acquisition functions for differentiability and submodularity in this paper should be recognized. The contributions on methods: differentiating acquisition functions and paralleling submodular acquisition functions are solid, and incremental. Similar ideas have been studied in the past few years. Experiments are well designed and clearly presented. It is a solid paper with some lack of novelty and significance.
