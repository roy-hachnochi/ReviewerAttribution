In this paper, the concept of delayed arriving samples is combined with stochastic optimization. The interesting setup plotted here can be interpreted at controlling (or decision making or ) SGD considering the streaming arrival samples and computational limits. Authors proposed a streaming version of DYNASAGA (a stochastic optimization method with adaptive sample sizes) that adapts to their online setting. They introduce the notion of c-compatibility to compare their method to a computationally limited version of DYNASAGA (is called DYNASAGA(\rho)). Then dependency of compatibility factor to the average arrival time is an initiative result that is confirmed by their analysis. They also have proposed concrete examples of skewed and general arrivals that highlight the notion of compatibility (for sufficiently long time span) better. Iâ€™ve found experiments representative.  In my opinion, the idea is novel and have potentials in online optimization. To improve the quality of the paper, however,  I have the following suggestions:  1. In theoretical results of corollary 1, the dependency of the established bound to the condition L/mu should be expressed as the mu factor might be a function of the number of samples itself.  2. In corollary 1, I wondered whether the established upperbound should also depend on \rho.  3. My main concern about the algorithm is the memory issue. Since the setting is assumed to be online it might be reasonable to consider the memory limited and show how it can change the optimization plan.   ------------------------ I have read the response.
