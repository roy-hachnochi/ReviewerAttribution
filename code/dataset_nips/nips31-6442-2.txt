The paper presents some interesting ideas and results. In general, I like the idea of the algorithm.   STRSAGA uses the same idea as DYNASA. The different is that DYNASA is an offline algorithm while STRAGA also consider a streaming data with various arrival distribution. You have mentioned in Conclusion is that “its empirical risk over the data arriving so far is close to the empirical risk minimizer over the same data”. Do you have any explanation for this behavior? Do you think, because of this, they have a similar behavior as shown in experiments? (According to the experimental results, it seems that STRSAGA and DYNASA are not much different)  For the theoretical part, since the results (for streaming data for various arrival distributions) are new, it would agree that it is not able to compare to SSVRG since SSVRG is not suited for these cases.   I think this paper has some new ideas and may encourage people to investigate more in this direction.   ------- AFTER REBUTTAL ---------  The author(s) provided some experiments comparing to SSVRG that I requested. It seems a promising result to me. I think this paper has some new ideas and may encourage people to investigate more in this direction. I also like the idea of the algorithm. I vote for accepting this paper!
