This paper proposes a new kernel on persistence diagrams. New kernel has  number of appealing properties, the most important is that it is (by definition) psd; this    is only interesting in comparison to Wasserstein metric (popular in PD) which does not result in PD "kernels".  Paper is well written and clear. The contribution is well defined. Experimental                 section is solid and fair i.e. compares apples to apples.  There is no reason to reject this paper, but it does not                       seem to be a breakthrough.
