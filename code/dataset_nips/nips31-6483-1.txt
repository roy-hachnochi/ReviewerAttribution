The paper presents a system to clone voices, allowing one to build a speech synthesis system with a new voice provided just a few seconds of adaptation (or "encoding") data. This is an extremely relevant research topic, and the results achieved seem pretty good to me (although the quality of synthesised speech produced by research systems seems pretty low, IMHO). The main contributions of this work are a detailed analysis of the issues in speech synthesis, and the presentation of a new "encoding" based approach, which is more efficient. The examples also allow th reader to see for himself/ herself the quality of the provided speaker embedding method, which is also more efficient than existing techniques.
