This paper considered the problem of blind deconvolutional phase retrieval. The main technical contribution is a novel convex relaxation that is based on a lifted matrix recovery formulation. The sample complexity for exact recovery is characterized if the two signals belong to known random subspaces (i.i.d. Gaussian entries). The characterization is derived from the Rademacher complexity estimates, which is quite interesting. The paper is well organized and well written. Despite the fact that random subspaces are a strong assumption (typical appropriate subspaces would be deterministic, including partial Discrete Cosine Transforms or partial Discrete Wavelet Transforms), I believe that this paper provides very valuable insight on this very difficult problem. I recommend the acceptance of this paper.
