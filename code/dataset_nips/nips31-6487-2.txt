Summary of the paper: This paper considers a problem that combines aspects of phase retrieval and blind deconvolution. One wants to recover two vectors w and x, given phaseless measurements of the Fourier transform of the convolution of w and x. This is motivated by applications such as optical imaging using an unknown channel or filter. The authors propose a novel convex programming approach, which combines ideas from both PhaseLift (to deal with the phaseless measurements) and BranchHull (to deal with the bilinearity). They prove a recovery guarantee, with a near-optimal number of measurements, for the special case where the vectors w and x belong to known random low-dimensional subspaces. This result, although not directly relevant to practical applications (due to the assumption about random subspaces), is a step towards finding rigorous and tractable algorithms for this problem.  Overall, I think this paper makes a nice conceptual contribution, by coming up with an apparently-new convex relaxation for a challenging signal recovery problem. The idea is quite simple and elegant. The proof of the recovery guarantee uses some powerful probabilistic techniques (which are not new, but are quite recent). I agree with the authors' assessment that this work is a theoretical advance, even if their method does not work that well in practice.   The paper is quite clearly written. Some minor notes: In line 16, there seems to be a typo, in the formula for F[omega,t], in the exponent, where sqrt(m) should be m. In Theorem 1, can one say anything about how the constant c_t depends on t? In line 175, it may be a good idea to explain the \oplus notation.
