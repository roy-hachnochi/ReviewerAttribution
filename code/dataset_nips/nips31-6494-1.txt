The authors present an algorithm that can defend against worst-case adversarial attacks on image classification, for adversaries that are allowed to affect a maximum number of pixels in the input image. They also provide theoretical guarantees for the method, as well as good motivation with practical uses (I particularly liked the comment about compression algorithms like JPEG and MPEG making the same assumptions). Finally, the presented experimental results are compelling.  It would be good to add details on how the models were trained (i.e., optimizer and convergence criteria), so that the results are reproducible.  Some minor typos/comments:  - Line 9: What is “CW”? Noticed later that it refers to the names of the authors. You should probably make that explicit in the abstract as it is currently confusing. - Line 65: “In section 4 we” -> “In section 4, we” - Line 72: “In section 4 we” -> “In section 4, we” - Line 74: Missing a space before the last opening square bracket. - Line 86: “all zeros” -> “all-zeroes” - Line 98: “In other words if” -> “In other words, if” - Line 109: Missing a space before the opening square bracket. - Line 110: “although in that” -> “although, in that” - Line 111: “and have some” -> “and make some” - Line 113: “but their work” -> “but that work” - Algorithm 1: It may help to define F, k, t, and T, in the algorithm definition. - Line 138: “Also our” -> “Also, our” - Line 154: “In section 2.1 we” -> “In section 2.1, we” - Line 177: Missing space before the opening parenthesis and the opening square bracket. - Line 184: “In fact we” -> “In fact, we” - Line 191: Missing space before the opening square bracket.
