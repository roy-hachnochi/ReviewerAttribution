******After rebuttal ***** The authors have addressed my minor concerns. After also seeing the other reviews, and considering the authors rebuttal, I stand by my grade of 8 and my original review. In particular, I disagree with most all of other reviewers issues and find that they are mostly non-issues. **************************    The paper uses a tensor sketching method to speed-up the computation and reduce the memory usage of Tucker decomposition methods. The authors offer two new algorithms that use the sketching, two theoretical results, and numerical experiments which are particularly convincing. I have only minor suggestions and find that the paper is at a high standard as is.    The theoretical results include: Proposition 3.1 shows that one of the subproblems in their algorithm, which is a sketched linear least squares problem, has a concentrated spectrum with high probability, thus justifying their use of conjugate gradients (CG) to solve this linear least squares problem, as opposed to using a direct method. This is a welcome proposition, since indeed CG is only truly efficient at solving reasonably well conditioned problems.  The second theoretical result in Proposition 3.3 is mostly indicative (though none-the-less welcome) and informally states that if a tensorsketch is re-sampled at each iteration  (different from what is implemented), sketching the remaining subproblem in their sketched Tucker algorithm suffers only an additive error in comparison to the solution of the true (unsketched) linear least squares problem. Details are only given in the supplementary material. But I  Their numerics comparing to several state of the art tucker decomposition technique clearly shows the superiority of their methods in the large data regime, and that the sketching only sacrifices very little in terms of the quality of the resulting decomposition.  Finally, here are some minor issues and suggestions:   line 69: You introduce the matrix B but later in line 71 and 72 use a matrix A. Was this intentional? line 118-119: on line 118 you give the solution to (5) which, at this point, looks impossible since it only involves adjoints of A^(i) and no pseudoinverses. But of course this follows since you explain in the next sentence that each A^(i) is given by the leading singular vectors of Z_(i). Simply re-ordering, and properly connecting these two sentences, would make it easier to follow. e.g. the solution to (5) is given by "G =..." since each A^(i) is orthogonal...etc  In the supplementary material:  lines 79 -83: There seems to be a mix-up between rows and columns. In particular is a_{:r_n}^(n) the r_nth column of the r_nth row of A^(n)?
