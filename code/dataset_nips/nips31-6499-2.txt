The authors propose a cache memory model for image recognition, extending the one proposed by Grave et al. for language modeling. This simple extension to standard CNNs for image classification provides a boost in accuracy and improves the robustness to adversarial attacks. An analysis for these results is provided, based on the input-output Jacobian.  The method is powerful, conceptually simple and easy to implement. In my opinion, it may open new interesting research lines, as this work can be extended to other domains, e.g. few-shot or lifelong learning. I enjoyed reading the manuscript, it is easy to follow and the design choices are clearly motivated. Overall, I consider this submission a very positive contribution to NIPS.  Please find below some minor modifications that I would like to see in the revised version of the manuscript:  - Did you run any experiment on CIFAR-10/100 to check the effect of reducing the number of items stored in the cache? Memory footprint is one of the main drawbacks of this method, which can prevent its deployment for larger scale datasets. Understanding the role of the cache size is thus important, and some plot/table with this information would add value to the paper. - Related to the previous point, did you perform any experiment where images in the training set are added (or not) to the cache only if they are classified correctly? For memory-constrained applications, it would be important to properly select which samples are kept in the cache. - Regarding the adversarial attacks in Table 2, I understand that they are generated for the baseline model and then evaluated on the same model combined with a cache model. This is somehow measuring transferability from the baseline model to the cache-enhanced one. Wouldn’t it be possible to generate the adversarial images directly for the cache-enhanced models? - Line 175 points to Table 2, but I believe it should link to Table 3. - Seeing that Section 2 is already ‘Results’ was a bit surprising. Perhaps the authors could split it into ‘Method’ and ‘Results’ and follow a more traditional structure.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The authors addressed (or will adress) all my concerns/questions to improve their submission. As stated in my review, I vote for accepting this submission.
