The paper proposes a nonparametric Bayesian generative model for jointly evaluating the local spectra corresponding to a Gaussian process latent signal, and shows how to explicitly obtain closed form expressions for the same owing to its gaussian structure. Even though I am not an expert in the field, to the best of my knowledge this is a new line of work. The paper is fairly readable . Bayesian non-parametric models have been readily used over the past couple of years to model in a component-free manner, and this line of work directly connects to that. The work appears significant since it opens up a plethora of ways to model signals using bayesian methods.
