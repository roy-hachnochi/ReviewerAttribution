TITLE Bayesian Nonparametric Spectral Estimation  PAPER SUMMARY The paper discusses Bayesian spectral estimation under a Gaussian process signal model, and presents a method for posterior inference of the spectral density.  QUALITY Everything appears technically correct.  CLARITY The paper is extremely well written and clear.  ORIGINALITY To my knowledge, the methods presented in the paper have not been considered before. After reading the paper, the approach seems almost obvious.  SIGNIFICANCE I think this contribution is very valuable, as it provides a fairly simple, direct, and consistent way to approach quantifying uncertainty in spectral estimation, which works in many cases including under non-uniform sampling.  FURTHER COMMENTS  Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) -> Do you mean discrete Fourier transform (DFT)?   Perhaps you should make a distinction between the power spectra density and the energy spectral density.  (rather than a parametric function) -> The AR method is also a stochastic process. Perhaps you mean to distinguish between parametric and non-parametric model based approaches  Notice that the assumption of stationarity is required... -> I do not see why that is true  Figure 1 is a bit confusing as it does not distinguish between stochastic and deterministic nodes  Line 103: ...where the last two identities in each line are... -> where the last identity in each line is   Figure 4: The rightmost subfigure is difficult to read.  Edit: I have read the other reviews and the authors' response and remain confident that this paper should be a clear accept.
