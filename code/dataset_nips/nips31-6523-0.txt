This paper defines a measure of Synaptic Strength inspired by the human brain, to represent the contributed information from a connection. The authors use this method for pruning CNNs with high compression. Sparsity-induced regularization is performed on the synaptic strength.  Experiments on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that performance is not compromised with significant reduction in parameters. The authors further present robustness analysis results. The paper is very well-written and presentation is excellent.  Minor comments: - loss it -> lose it - going to pruned -> going to prune - several works has -> have
