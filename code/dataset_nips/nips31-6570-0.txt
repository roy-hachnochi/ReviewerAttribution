This paper derived under certain conditions the minimax convergence rate of nonparametric density estimator formed by truncated series estimator with terms of mapping to orthonormal basis under adversarial losses. The rate is approximately n^{-\frac{s+t}{2t+d}} under Sobolev space and a similar form under GAN. Under further assumptions on risk etc., the proposed minimax results for density estimation imply results related with implicit generative modeling.  This is a nicely written paper with clear logic and meaningful theoretical result relating traditional nonparametric estimation and recent practice like GAN. A few detailed comments below:  1) Define notations like Line 49 \mathcal{L}^{p} when first appear, Line 75 \mathcal{Z}, … and Line 81 f^{(s)} briefly in this paper may help presentation.  2) Line 80 should be p\geq 1, Formula (3) latter part should be \hat{P}_{z}\phi_{z}=\frac{1}{n}… 3) Some “by default” assumptions like existence of sup{a_{z}^{-1}} can be understood, but would be nice if all assumptions were stated out together.  4) Line 82-84: Browsed the proofs but not too carefully, not sure which are all the places that the bounded condition was required and whether can be relaxed with a little more effort in maybe a future work (maybe just my biased preference/two cents)
