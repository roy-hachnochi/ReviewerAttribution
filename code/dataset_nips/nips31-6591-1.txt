I preface this by saying that I have reviewed this paper once for NIPS 2016, and re-read it. It seems the paper has no essential changes, so my opinion is largely the same.   The paper considers the problem of learning the parameters of a Bayes net with known structure, given samples from it with potentially adversarial noise. The main goal is to get bounds on the samples that are independent of dimension. The main requirements on the Bayes net parameters are reasonable: the probability of any configuration of the parents is reasonable and the conditional probabilities on any edge are bounded away from 0 and 1.   The algorithm is quite similar morally to [DKK+16] -- on a high level it designs a quantity F(X,q), s.t. E[F(X,p)] = p, where p is the conditional probability "table" specified by the Bayes net and q is the empirical conditional probability table. The covariance matrix of F(X,q) on the other hand, "catches" the adversarial noise: if the covariance has a large eigenvalue, one can "filter" the "culprit" samples, and repeat the process. Otherwise, the empirical estimate is close in TV distance.    The paper is well-written, though the proofs are straightforward and natural (and largely follow the structure of [DKK+16]). There are some new tricks (e.g. how one "fills in" F(X,q) in the unobserved spots; why the mean of F(X,p) is diagonal; and how to use the spikes in the spectrum to produce a filter), but I feel like it's a poor fit for NIPS for two reasons.    For one, the techniques are quite similar to [DKK+16];  For another, it may be of interest to a relatively specialized crowd, both in terms of theoretical tools and practical algorithms.   As mentioned a previous time I reviewed this paper: the more interesting question is structure-learning Bayes nets, even under "benign" noise assumptions.  _______________________ Edit after rebuttal: after the rebuttal/discussions with other reviewers, my opinion is largely the same, though I may have scored a bit harshly. Correspondingly, I raised my score up by a point.
