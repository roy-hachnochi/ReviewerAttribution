The authors present an algorithm for estimating parameters in a Bayesian network over binary variables with *known structure* in the presence of adversarial noise. The algorithm is shown to achieve near-optimal performance in polynomial time.  The paper appears to be a solid theoretical piece. I haven't checked any of the details.  The interest to the NIPS community is probably limited but I cannot identify other significant drawbacks.  The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on simulated data and it outperforms the naive estimate (just use all data) and a RANSAC-based technique. (The authors state that the RANSAC-technique is described at the end of Sec. 4 but it isn't.)
