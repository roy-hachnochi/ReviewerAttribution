The paper "Using Quantum Graphical Models to Perform Inference in Hilbert Space" provides several results related to linking QGMs and HSEs, including the equivalence between the sum rule for QGMs and kernel sum rule for HSEs. The paper further introduces HSE-HQMM to model dynamics, and empirically shows its improvement over LSTMs and PSRNNs. Overall, the paper is well written with important results in it. From what I understand, the technical details are correct, but it is also possible that I misunderstand some critical steps since this is not my research area.  One minor suggestion is that the authors can improve the quality of their Figures 4 and 5 such as making fonts larger, unifying the fonts and making the figure captions more informative.  I have read other reviews and authors' response. I would like to keep my original scores.
