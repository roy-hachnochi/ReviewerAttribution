This work approaches the question of fairness through the lens of welfare and risk appetite. That is, what are the tradeoffs between social welfare, risk adverseness, and the canonical definitions of fairness? Drawing on a rich set of references, the authors define a constrained optimization problem where loss is minimized with respect to expected utility greater than a threshold.   The theoretical section followed easily although it was not clear to me what Proposition 1 contributed. The experiments are explained well, and I particularly appreciated Figures 2-4 since the work begins to engage with prior methods.  I am curious if an impossibility theorem exists regarding welfare and risk and other notions of fairness. The experimental results seems to suggest this, but analysis here would greatly strengthen the paper.   Minor nitpicks  - Figure 1 was hard to parse since we are comparing models against each other. Suggestion to switch out legend and x axis and have the x axis be the different models and the colors correspond to groups.   - Figure 2's caption refres to Dwork measure, but the y-label says accuracy. It does not appear that these are the same. I also did not understand the third sentence: "Note that for Dwork and ... for social welfare larger values reflect greater fairness." I'm assuming the left-most plot was supposed to be Dwork measure instead of accuracy?  - Please proof-read again for grammar, e.g. line 267: "compare with one another according [to] accuracy" and spacing after periods (line 270).
