This paper proposes a new definition for “robustness” of the model, and analyzes its lower bound for discrete uniform distribution over the corners of the hypercube (all binary vectors). The results are presented clearly and the techniques used in this paper are interesting. In a nutshell, based on a isoperimetric inequality for hypercube with Hamming distance, this paper calculates a lower bound for the expansion speed of the boundary of any set, which leads to the lower bounds.  The new definition of “robustness” in the paper seems reasonable. Its relations to the previous definitions are also discussed in the paper. The only concern I have of this paper is about the motivation/significance of the study.  1. The authors justify this research in the introduction, emphasizing the importance of studying discrete distributions in the literature. But the papers referred there are all about DNF. I understand the fundamentalness of the DNF problems. But some more discrete examples would give much better justification. 2. It is also not clear why studying “robustness” is important, even in the context of DNF. Also, in section 3.3, only results for monotone conjunctions are presented (Not quite yet about DNF). Could the authors propose some learning settings, where the robustness of learning a monotone conjunctions plays an essential role?  Other comments:  1. The proof of Theorem 3.2 seems to miss the case when E is empty. Also in Theorem 3.2, Risk(h,c) is not yet defined in the paper 2. In section 1.1 about the monotone conjunction part, PC and OT should be introduced before they are used. PC is also not consistent with PCh on page 4. 3. On page 7 in the proof of Theorem 3.2, Line 4 and 5, K_E -> k_E. It also misses a denominator 2^n for the last term. 4. In Theorem 3.10/3.12, \rho(h,U_n,c) ->   \rho(h ,c) Disclaimer: I didn’t read the proofs for Section 3.3.   ==Update after rebuttal ========================= 1. I don't think the rebuttal addresses the significance problem raised in my review. But I change my score to 6  for its rigorous manner in the adversarial robustness literature. 2. I misunderstood question 4 in my original review, thus it is updated to 2 now. My apologies.
