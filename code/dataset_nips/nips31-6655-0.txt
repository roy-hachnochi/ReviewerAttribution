The paper is concentrated in a new task in which we want to model the placement of object given its semantics and context.  The proposed method disentangles the generation process of possible positions and possible shapes, which is certainly a plus.  STN serves as a bottleneck between two modules and made the whole network end-to-end trainable.   At the same time, there are some issues in the current submission:  1. Missing training details The model consists of two generators and four discriminators.  To be honest, I'm doubtful about the training procedure itself, especially no specific details given, such as whether there is mode-dropping or not.  2. Missing qualitative evaluation Even though it's imaginable that for this new task, no direct qualitative metrics could be applied,  this part is a big minus to the convincibility of the proposed method for its audience.  3. Missing ablation study The paper also misses a solid qualitative ablation study.  As is, there might be some visual differences between the presented design and ablated design in Fig. 5.  But the differences are minor and not clear enough to be considered as non-trivial improvement or necessity, especially given a very condense and bulky network architecture.  Overall, this is a paper on the right problem but w/o convincing deliberation of design or qualitative results.
