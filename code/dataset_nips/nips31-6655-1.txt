In overall, I think this paper proposes a well-designed pipeline for semantic map synthesis which is helpful to image generation tasks. The rebuttal addresses my questions about the ablation study. I strongly suggest the authors to add the ablation study in the final version if this paper is accepted. My final rating is accept. ========================================= This paper proposes a where and what pipeline to synthesize and place object instances into a semantic map in an end-to-end way. This method can help to generate diverse natural semantic map which contains important structure information. The generated semantic maps can benefit the image synthesis task.  Pros: * The proposed idea is interesting that using the context information to predict the position and shape of object instances in order to generate novel semantic maps. * The writing is easy to follow, and empirical experiments show that it is able to synthesize natural semantic maps. * The decomposed where and what modules make scenes and can provide some control during the synthesis. The well-designed jointly training strategy is suitable for the semantic map synthesis task. The proposed framework can also be useful for other structure generation tasks.  Cons: * In total, there are four discriminators. I wonder how do they affect the training and results. Is there any ablation study for this?  Given that this paper is about the context-aware location and shape prediction, it is suggested that some recent work on context based structure prediction for image inpainting and generation can be included in the related work, e.g.,  [a] Q. Sun, L. Ma, S.J. Oh, L. Van Gool, B. Schiele, and M. Fritz. “Natural and Effective Obfuscation by Head Inpainting.” In CVPR, 2018. [b] K. Ehsani, R. Mottaghi, and A.
