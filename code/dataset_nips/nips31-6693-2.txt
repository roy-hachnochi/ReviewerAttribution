The paper addresses the design of private prediction markets that allow actors to participate in a market to improve accuracy of predictions while preserving privacy.  Privacy is introduced by adding noise to the revealed market state, so that past states cannot be used to infer true values.  In past work [8] it has been shown that differentially privacy can be guaranteed only in the case of unbounded loss.  This paper offers an extension of the model suggested in [8], that the introduction of a transaction fee would alleviate the situation.  The present paper presents this model with transaction fees and shows that with transaction fees, privacy can be ensured in the bounded loss case.  The authors do not clearly explain the prediction markets model.  For a reader unfamiliar with this model it is extremely difficult to follow, especially since many financial terms are unnecessarily used.   The authors don’t make it clear how Section 5 fits within the rest.  The proof sketch in this section is quite informal and doesn’t give any intuition into the situation.
