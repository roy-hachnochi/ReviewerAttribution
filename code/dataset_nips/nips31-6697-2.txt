This paper proposes a method to train deep networks using corrupted training data. The core idea is to exploit a small set of clean labels from a trusted source. The authors argue that getting such additional data is practical, which is reasonable. The paper is well written and the experiments are quite thorough.  My main concern with the paper is regarding its novelty. Training deep models using noisy labels has been previous explored. The main contribution of the paper is in estimating the corruption matrix using a rather straightforward process as described in Sec 3.1. I feel this is not sufficient for acceptance in a venue like NIPS.
