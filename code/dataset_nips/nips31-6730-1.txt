The paper addresses the problem of Bayesian network structure learning by providing an algorithm for sampling CPDAGs (the equivalent class of DAGs). The basic idea is to modify a constraint-based structure learning algorithm RAI by employing recursive bootstrap. It shows empirically that the proposed recursive bootstrap performs better than direct bootstrap over RAI.  I think the paper is a useful contribution to the literature on Bayesian network structure learning, though not groundbreaking.  It provides a method for dealing with the main weakness of constraint-based learning, that they are sensitive to errors in the independence tests, by a novel way of combining bootstrap with constraint-based learning.  Overall the paper is clearly written. I donâ€™t see any technical issues. The experimental evaluations are adequate, though it would be interesting to compare the proposed algorithm with those latest MCMC algorithms (e.g. Niinimaki & Koivisto 2013, Su & Borsuk 2016).  I wonder what the complexity is of constructing a GGT (algorithm 1) and sampling a CPDAG (algorithm 2).  Updates after author feedback: Thanks for the complexity analysis.
