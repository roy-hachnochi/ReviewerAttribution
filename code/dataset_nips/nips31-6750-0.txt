This paper proposes the Ephemeral Value Adjustment method to allow deep reinforcement learning agents to simultaneously (1) learn the parameters of the value function approximation, and (2) adapt the value function quickly and locally within an episode. This is achieved by additionally storing one layer of current hidden activations. Experiments on Atari games show this method show that this method significantly improves both the learning speed and performance using the same architecture. The presentation is clear and the results are convincible. I am not familiar with this topic but the basic idea of this paper makes sense.
