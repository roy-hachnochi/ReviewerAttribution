In this paper, a new regularization method to improve the robustness of neural network is proposed. The new learning problem is formulated as generative adversarial networks, where the adversary critic is to designed to tell regular and adversarial images, and the classifier is to fool the critic with the adversarial images. The goal of this paper is to make the adversarial examples visually confusing, which seems not the case in the previous adversarial training. The new problem is to minimize the traditional classification loss, plus a new regularization term, which is the distance between the distribution of the regular data and the adversarial examples.  The experiments show that in terms of robustness, the proposed method outperforms three existing methods and also a simple baseline on MNIST, with both a fully-connected network and a convolution network. There might be a typo in Table 1 row 3, col 3.  From what is presented, the result makes sense. But I am not familiar with this field.
