This paper investigate online portfolio under cardinality constraints. Matching upper/lower bounds in full-information/bandit settings are provided.   The paper is well-written. I could not check the details in the paper because it is too technical for me given the limited review time. But viewing the results, the authors have almost clarify the landscape of this problem in both regret upper/lower bounds and computational complexity. Given that there are relatively less literature about computational lower bounds, I would consider the technical contributions in this paper significant.
