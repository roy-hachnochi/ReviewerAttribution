This paper proposes statistical hypothesis testing methods for combinatorial structures of the precision matrix of a Gaussian graphical model.  Two types of tests are considered: connectivity test and k-colorability test.  In the connectivity test, the proposed method subsamples the nodes and expands the neighborhoods of the sampled nodes. Connectivity is rejected if such an expansion is contained locally.  The existence of edge is estimated only when necessary in order to reduce computation cost.  In the k-colorability test, the method first estimates the entire precision matrix and apply classical deterministic tests on a thresholded estimated graph.  One concern is that the formulation of null and alternative is unnatural as a statistical hypothesis test.  In statistical hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis typically refer to a null model with no signal, but the null hypothesis considered in this paper is highly structured: a disconnected precision matrix with bounded degree!  The second concern is the stringent conditions required for the validity: the data is Gaussian, and the precision matrix is $s$-sparse.  I wonder how $s$ is determined for the real data example.  The procedures essentially combines known deterministic tests with standard subsampling with estimated precision matrix, and hence are valid and not surprising.  #### Response to author feedback ##### Thanks for your careful explanation.  The concern of the usefulness of the hypotheses still remains.  In particular, in the connectivity test, the formulation of the null hypothesis seems to be motivated more from the procedure rather than practical interests.  In the max clique test, it is unclear how the null and alternative hypotheses reflect "structure" and "structureless".
