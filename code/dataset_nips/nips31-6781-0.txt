The paper provides a graph theoretic connection to regularized spectral clustering for community detection in networks. The spectral clustering method of community detection can also be interpreted as relaxation of normalized cut measure of subgraphs of networks. The paper proves that regularized spectral clustering can be seen as a relaxation of similar cut measure of subgraphs, which has been called Core-cut in the paper.  The paper provides theoretical proof on connection between regularized spectral clustering and Core-cut measure. The intuition of Core-cut measure is given for sparse inhomogeneous graphs and its representation in terms of core-periphery model. The paper also provides properties of Core-cut measure, which are similar to normalized cut measures. However, the paper states 'Facts' in the paper and supplementary and it is not clear what kind of statements are the 'Facts'. It would be better to either give a proof of the 'Facts' or refer to paper/books where the proof can be found.  The paper is generally well-written and gives adequate intuition for the results and definitions provided in the paper.  The paper considers recently developed regularizations in spectral clustering for sparse graphs. To my knowledge, this is new work and nice attempt to link cut measures of graph to regularization and try to find significance of regularization by analyzing the Core-cut measure.  The paper is of more theoretical in nature. It mostly provides a connection between cut measures in graphs and regularization in spectral clustering. Thus, this paper gives a strong case for regularization in spectral clustering, by showing that the Core-cut measure is better in partitioning networks with core-periphery structure often seen in sparse inhomogeneous graphs.
