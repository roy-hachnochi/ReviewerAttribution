The paper proposes a novel sampling method using thermostat assisted continuous tempering for HMC. The proposed method helps to sample iid data from multi-modal distributions and neutralises biases from mini-batch samples.  The paper is very well written and easy to follow. The experiment results are both visually appealing and positive on both the toy and real world datasets. It would be nice if the authors also measured the ESS of the samples and compared it to standard HMC, and preconditioned HMC.
