This paper provides the first sublinear time algorithm for the subspace approximation problem in the streaming and in the distributed settings of computation. Subspace approximation is an important machine learning problem. The paper is very well written and i found the results interesting and important. One weakness of the paper is that the experimental results are short and not very informative.
