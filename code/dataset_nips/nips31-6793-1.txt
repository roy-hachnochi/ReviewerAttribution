This paper discusses the subspace estimation problem which is defined as follows: Given a set of n points in R^d and an integer k find a subspace S of dimension k such that the (loss function of) distance of the points to the subspace is minimised. There are (1+\eps)-approximation algorithm known for this problem with running time  that is polynomial in n and d but exponential in (k/\eps). Moreover, these algorithms inherently do not work in the streaming setting where only one (or few) passes over the data is allowed. The main result claimed in this papers is a streaming (1+\eps)-approximation algorithm matching the running rime time bound of previous non-streaming algorithms. Streaming algorithms capture most realistic settings where the data is available only as a stream and does not sit in the memory. Given this, I consider the results in the paper significant. The paper also gives some experimental results on synthetic dataset.  The main innovation in the paper is in the theoretical analysis which is not easy to follow for a non-expert. Many of the proofs is in the Supplementary material. The authors try to give some high-level ideas in Section 3. Unfortunately, much of the analysis is dependent on previously known results and it is hard for a non-expert to verify all these results quickly.
