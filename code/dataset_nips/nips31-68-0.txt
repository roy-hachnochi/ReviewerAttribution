The paper provided a doubly robust Bayesian inference method for online change-point detection, through the application of General Bayesian Inference with \beta-divergences. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to outliers and can adapt to non-stationary data via online parameter update. Overall, this is a paper rigorously written and a valuable contribution to the change-point detection community.  Here are some additional comments about the paper: 1) In the algorithm description in Section 3.2, there is an operation called FullOpt, however I could not find the exact definition of this operator. 2) In the same section, the authors mentioned that "an MCMC implementation in Stan takes 10^5 times longer". I was wondering how this conclusion is obtained. It would be better if the authors give concrete running times for both approaches. 3) The main content of the paper is about change-point detection, but the title of the paper is about Robust Bayesian inference in general. I would recommend to have a title that more accurately reflects the content of the paper.  Note: The authors agreed in the response to include more details of computational time in the final version, to make the comparison more clear.
