The authors present an analysis of coordinate ascent variational inference in the stochastic block model with two components. They show that if a pair of model parameters are known, then the majority of random initialization give the truth. However, when they aren't random restarting is pointless. Overall, I'm a big fan of this kind of analysis, it helps understand if we should trust results from approximation algorithm. I have several questions:  - What happens when the number of communities exceeds 2?  - Does the Gibbs sampler recover the truth, when p and q are unknown? Does it take exponential time?
