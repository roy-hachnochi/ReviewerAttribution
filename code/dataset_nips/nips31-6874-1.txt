In this paper reinforcement learning is used for non-parametric estimation of temporal point processes.  The method is compared to RNN and WGAN based point processes on several synthetic and real data sets.  The paper is clearly written and the method is novel.  Overall from a theoretical perspective the paper is interesting.  There are some problems with the baselines and experiments that can potentially be addressed.  First, temporal point processes such as 911 calls are fairly low dimensional with a lot of noise.  So I'm not completely convinced RNN and WGAN are the best baselines.  There is a large body of statistics literature on semi and fully non parametric methods for point processes (LGCP, non-parametric Hawkes with non-stationary background rate, etc).  I think these would make for better baselines as they may have better variance reduction properties and may ultimately be more accurate.  The experiments also need more details and to be improved.  How is cross-validation performed?  In temporal point processes the split should be in time where training is done over one time period and evaluation over a subsequent time period.  Is this the case here?  Figure 5 is somewhat useful, but AIC values might be better.  Figure 6 is hard to read, it might be better to use a KS plot.
