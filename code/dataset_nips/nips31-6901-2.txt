The paper provides an analysis of OMP that shows lower and upper bounds for sparse recovery in terms of the sparsity and matrix conditioning, where the lower bounds correspond to specific matrix constructions and where the two bounds are of the same order. While the results are interesting, there are some issues with the description and narrative that need to be addressed to recommend acceptance.  The paper describes distributions for A and y starting at page 3 line 108, but a distribution is only specified within Section 3.1; the former may be just a wording issue.   The practical impact of Theorems 3.1-3.3 appears limited due to the very small upper bound on delta (which results on strong requirements on xmin and s+s*) and the very large value of the constant C. The authors should contrast the order relationships implied by the theorems (and the improvements with respect to the literature) with the numerical results to highlight the value of the result not being lost by the constant. There is no numerical evaluation of the upper bounds of Theorems 3.1-3.3.  Some of the derivations in page 5 were not clear to me (3.0.4, 3.0.9).  Minor comments follow.  Page 3, Defs. 2.1-2.2: Why not just write w = z-x? This way these conditions more closely resemble the asymmetric restricted isometry property. Page 3, Line 100: From your reply, I would consider C a parameter as well. Page 6, Line 190: It is not clear what "the support is distributed evenly" means - you should make it explicit as in your response.
