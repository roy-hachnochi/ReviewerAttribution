This paper proposes differentially private change-point detection methods for both offline and online settings.The offline (easier) case is handled with report noisy max mechanism, while the online case uses above threshold mechanism to find a likely window for a change-point, then uses the offline algorithm on that window.  The report noisy max mechanism for the offline case requires finite likelihood ratios (bounded sensitivity). When this is the case, for example the uniform distribution case, the resulting method is epsilon-DP. The authors provide (alpha,beta)-accuracy analysis for this case. They also relax this by allowing infinite likelihood ratio with delta probability, which leads to an (epsilon,delta)-DP method. The accuracy bounds are weakened in this case also.  A well-written paper with a clear message. The impact of its contribution is limited.
