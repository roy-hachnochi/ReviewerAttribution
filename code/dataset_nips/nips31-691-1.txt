This paper addresses the minimization of general dynamic regret in online convex optimization. The paper provides a lower bound and an improved matching upper bound for the problem depending on the path length of the reference sequence of comparators. The paper also gives an efficient version of the algorithm that only requires 1 computation of the gradient based on a surrogate loss function.  The paper is clearly written.  The contribution is of interest. However, the approach in the paper seems to be heavily inspired by the work on MetaGrad by van Erven and Koolen and overall does not look very novel or surprising.   line 38  'doesnot' -> does not line 113 'an lower bound' -> a lower bound
