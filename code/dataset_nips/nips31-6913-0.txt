The paper proposes learning sets of decision rules that can express the disjunction of feature values in atoms of the rules, for example, IF color == yellow OR red, THEN stop. The emphasis is on interpretability, and the paper argues that these multi-value rules are more interpretable than similarly trained decision sets that do not support multi-value rules. Following prior work, the paper proposes placing a prior distribution over the parameters of the decision set, such as the number of rules and the maximum number of atoms in each rule. The paper derives bounds on the resulting distribution to accelerate a simulated annealing learning algorithm. Experiments show that multi-value rule sets are as accurate as other classifiers proposed as interpretable model classes, such as Bayesian rule sets on benchmark decision problems. The paper argues that multi-value rule sets are more interpretable on this problem.        The paper is sound and clearly written. It seems a straightforward extension of work on Bayesian rule sets (Wang et al. ICDM 2016). My main questions are about its evaluation. The significant feature of the work is the use of multi-valued rules which are motivated by interpretability, which is tricky to evaluate. No user study or human evaluation was conducted on the learned models. The primary comparison is conducting by counting the number of rules and features used in the learned models. Learned multi-valued rules have fewer rules and features than other models, but no information on the number of feature values per rule is provided. I agree that a rule like IF A == V1 or V2, THEN... is more interpretable than two rules IF A == V1, THEN... and IF A == V2, THEN... (2 rules vs. 1 rule) but I do not agree that it is even as interpretable than just the rule IF A == V1 (1 rule with 2 feature values vs. 1 rule with 1 feature value). It seems that there is an unexplored tradeoff space here, and only partial information is provided on where each model is in in that space.  UPDATE: I appreciate how thoroughly the authors responded to my review. I am raising my score to a 7.
