The authors propose a novel approach to domain adaption the relaxes many of the standard assumptions. In particular, they address the setting when both the causal graph and the intervention types and targets are unknown. Their methodology follows two steps: first, they select a set of features which are likely to be invariant; second, they use these features to draw causal conclusions.   Although I am not very familiar with this branch of causal inference, I found the paper well written and easy to follow. I have some minor comments listed below:  - Connect the examples to real-world applications.  - Typo line 109 "Given are data"  - Fix the axis in your figures so that they are they can be read without having to zoom in.   - What happens if one or more of the conditions in Assumption 1 do not hold? - Are there any strategies to asses the validity of Assumption 1?
