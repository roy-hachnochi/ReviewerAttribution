The paper proposes a novel algorithm and analysis for solving mixed regression problem. The paper uses atomic norm to relax the original problem which is intractable due to the combinatorial nature of determining which component the data come from. In solving each step of the greedy step, the algorithm takes advantage of a solution similar to MAX_CUT and arrives at an efficient optimization algorithm. The authors also back up the proposed algorithms with convergence and generalization analysis. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the solid performance compared to other state-of-the-arts algorithms.  The paper is very clearly written and it is a pleasure to read. It is organized very nicely and the results are presented in a clear manner. In addition, the motivation, and the description of the algorithm, and the experiments are all clearly presented.  More importantly, the algorithm is novel and wth good theoretical guarantees. In fact, the sample complexity is much better than tensor decomposition based approaches. It is interesting that convex relaxation achieves such good results on this problem.  The experiments are also solid. The paper presents extensive results compared to other approaches, and the performance is significantly better. Though, it will be interesting to also compare time complexity to verify its scalability to large datasets and to large number of components.  ============================================================ From other reviews and the rebuttal, it seems there is more efficient optimization algorithm in the literature, which is not discussed in the paper. The authors should add some discussion about this issue.
