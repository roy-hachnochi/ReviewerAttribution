This paper proposes a novel algorithm for find Top-K frequent elements, the algorithm is based on the well-known Count-Min Sketch method and combine the Frequent based counting algorithm for better reducibility and parallelism. The authors also provide good theoretical results on their algorithm.  Personally I think this paper is well-written and solving an important problem, however the major reason of me giving a weak rejection is that the experimental results seem to be not finished, the figure 1a - 1e only compare the CMS and FA methods and no Topkapi related results is reported. And to be honest these figures are extremely difficult to see because the font size is too small, and in figure 1f, I just cannot tell which part is the "Merging Thread Local Summaries".  UPDATES: The authors did clarify the results reported in the figures, these results are able to demonstrate the parallelism in the Top-K frequent problem is improved with proposed algorithm.  Minor Comments: - In line 107, over $D_1 \cup D_2$ should be $S_1 \cup S_2$. - There are no definition for $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, although their meanings can be inferred from the references.
