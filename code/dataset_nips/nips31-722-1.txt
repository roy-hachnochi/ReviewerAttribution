The authors introduce here an innovative generative model for data, based on learning the manifold geometry rather than the density of the data. They claim that this technique can deal w/ sparsity and heavily biased sampling. In practice, this is realised through a diffusion kernel which generates new points along the incomplete manifold by randomly generating points at sparse areas.  The paper is well written, with a grounded theoretical frameworks and based on an interesting novel idea. Although no ingredient of the pipeline could be considered really novel, the overall solution can be deemed original because of the proposed smart combination of the components.  The experimental section is very rich and all the results are consistently supporting all the authors' claims; in particular, the results obtained on biological datasets are biologically plausible and meaningful, making the proposed method particularly suitable for this kind of data. A number of points can be raised whose discussion might enhance the manuscript value: - what is the relation with the stochastic block model in clustering? - what is the relation with UMAP and/or tSNE in dimensionality reduction and manifold approximation? - I would strongly suggest using MCC as the performance metric  ##  After reading the authors' rebuttal, I confirm my rating: the observations included in the rebuttal are convincing and further supporting my evaluation of the manuscript as a good submission.
