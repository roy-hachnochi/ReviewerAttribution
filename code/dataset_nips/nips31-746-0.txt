The work presents a novel approach to introduce gradient descent to optimise spiking neural networks. The main contribution is to replace the Dirac-Delta function in the activation function of spiking neural networks with a differentiable gate function allowing for a gradient descent optimisation to be used. The approach is reasonable and has the potential to overcome major challenges in the wider application of spiking neural networks. The paper is, however, not very easy to follow. The postsynaptic adjoint state p_v is not defined in eq 5,6 and a lot of assumptions have been made on the detailed knowledge of the reader. The test cases presented are standard in the literature and do not demonstrate the potential of the new approach.
