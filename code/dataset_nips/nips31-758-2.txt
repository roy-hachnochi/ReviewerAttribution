This paper addresses the following question in machine teaching: When does an adaptive teacher outperforms a non-adaptive teacher?  Adaptivity refers to the teacherâ€™s ability of picking the examples in an adaptive manner; namely the next example to be presented to the learner may depend on the current state of the learner (in contrast, a non-adaptive teacher presents a batch of examples that depend only on the initial state of the learner).  Main results:  1. Formalize of a mathematical framework in which this question can be studied quantitatively (and showing that previously studied models fit in as special instantiations in the new model) 2. Provide explicit examples of teaching tasks (Examples 1 and 2 in the paper) in which adaptivity helps (Theorem 2), and showing that for a previously studied class of learners adaptivity does not help (Proposition 1).  3. Design a heuristic teaching algorithm (Algorithm 1) and state sufficient conditions under which this algorithm attains provable guarantees (Theorem 4)  The paper well written and the presented framework is natural and I believe it would be interesting to the ML community.
