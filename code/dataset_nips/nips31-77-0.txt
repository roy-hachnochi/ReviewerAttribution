Post author response: Thanks for the response. That windowing idea sure did not turn out well! Unfortunately, I still feel that my original score represents my assessment of th epaper.  The main idea in this paper is to create an online inverse optimizer. The paper also proves that the proposed solution is statistically consistent and has sqrt(T) regret. The paper then examines the algorithm in the context of utility, budget, and transportation problems.  Quality: I rated the work as just above the threshold. it solves a useful problem in an interesting way, but I wish other points of comparison were used. Could a windowing approach be applied to the batch approach or perhaps some approximation to (1)? Also, the key algorithmic contribution seems to be in recognizing that the problem can be structured in a way (KKT conditions) to be solved as a mixed integer second order conic program (MISOCP), that seems a little incremental, in terms of the contribution. I do not mean to imply that there is something incorrect about this, it is not low quality!  Clarity: I really liked the clear, step by step structure of this paper. I was never confused about what I was reading and why.  Originality: It certainly seems original, but it really does depend on the MISOCP solver.  Significance: Here too I was a bit disappointed. I understand in principle why this is an important problem, but I did not find the "sketches of representative applications" all that compelling. A real application with real monetary consequences, or data adapted from a real system would have made the paper more compelling.  In addition:  At the start of section 3.2 you assert that the resultant problem is a MISOCP, Since this point is the key to the solution, it would have been worth stepping through this just a bit, perhaps moving some of the material from the supplemental materials into the body and adding some more to the supplement.
