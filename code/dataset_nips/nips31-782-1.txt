This paper studied large-scale object detection with explicit and implicit knowledge. For explicit knowledge, the weights between different regions are learned according to the weights between different classes in explicit knowledge. For implicit knowledge, the weights between different regions are learned through backpropagation.  Strength: - well written paper, easy to read - incorporating knowledge for reasoning is a very important task and attracting growing interest  Weakness: -the proposed method seems to be very straightforward. The novelty is marginal - some parts are not clear to me. For example, in line 180, how can you get multiple different graphs? If a different weight is learned for an edge, would it be too much parameter? - some very relevant paper is missing and not cited. Wang et al. Non-local neural networks, which essentially models the implicit relationships between different regions. The authors should also compare this paper
