The paper considers the problem of learning from pairwise measurement. The model is in the form of an exponential family distribution, and includes some well-known models as its special cases. The proposed contrastive estimator is based on a transformation of the original data, thus eliminates the requirement of specifying the base measure function for the model. The statistical rate of convergence is proved for the estimator showing that it achieves the optimal rate of convergence up to a log factor.  The paper is nicely written, and has a good discussion comparing the work with learning from pairwise measurement and matrix completion. The removal of the base measure assumption is very interesting, making the estimator attractive and robust when specifying the parametric model itself is not easy.  The experiment part is not adequate. Some real world experiments are needed to support the usefulness of the estimator, while the paper only has simulation results. Even the simulation data are rather small, in terms of matrix size.
