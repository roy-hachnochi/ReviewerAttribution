This paper studies the problem of learning causal Bayes nets from a specific type of single-node international queries. (Given this type of query access, it is information-theoretically impossible to learn the graph exactly  -- but it is possible to learn its transitive reduction, as done in this paper.)  The algorithm works in two steps: First, a noisy form of a path query is defined. A path query can answer whether there exists a path connecting two given nodes in the unknown graph. A simple algorithm is given to learn the graph using noisy path queries. Then it is explained how to simulate noisy path queries with single-node interventions.  The authors also give some basic experimental evaluation of their algorithms and give sharper bounds for special cases of the problem.  Overall, this seems like a reasonable paper that could be accepted to NIPS. One issue I had with the paper is that the parameters are a bit confusing and it is not immediately clear how tight the results are. The authors give some related references, but it would be useful to elaborate somewhat on the precise statements -- if only in the appendix.
