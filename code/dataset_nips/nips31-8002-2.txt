Summary This paper proposes a method by using a multiple instance learning formulation along with an early prediction technique to learn a model that can achieve better accuracy. The method is very practical and the ideas of this paper are organized logically. Figures and tables are clear and easy to understand. Also, this paper is written in academic and fluent English.  However, there are some unclear parts in the paper.  1. The parameter setting in experiments should be introduced clearly.  2.  The equation A.2.18 in supplementary is not easy to understand. Further explanation is encouraged.   Several spelling mistakes: 1. Line 58, "We we". 2. Line 64,  "typically".
