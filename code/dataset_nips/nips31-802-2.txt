In this paper the authors propose a new bound for the multi-class classification setting based on the notion of local Rademacher complexity, which is then used to derive two novel multi-class multi-kernel methods. Theoretical guarantees and experimental results are provided for both methods.  To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that local Rademacher complexity is used to derive multi-class learning methods and as such this contribution is quite interesting and promising. As far as I could tell, the mathematical justifications for both the bound and the methods are sound. The paper is well written, even though there are a few typos (e.g lgorithm line 223, of missing ling 130, etc) and awkward phrasings (e.g. sec 2.3).  Edit after rebuttal: I think that the authors did a good job at addressing the various questions raised by the reviewers, as such I'm keeping my rating for this paper.
