The paper focuses on developing CNN that is usable at mobile devices. The authors believe that the main problem of massive parameters comes from the convolutional filter, and they introduce spatial- and channel-based versatile filters. Experiments are also well designed, results (especially Table 4) verify the claims raised by the authors. I think it is a neat article, which is acceptable.
