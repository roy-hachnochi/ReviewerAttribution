Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) form one of the most important family of deep neural networks and have provided powerful applications in various domains including image classification and speech recognition. There has been a strong remand in reducing further the computational complexity of deep CNNs and some methods have been proposed in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new method of versatile filters by treating filters in two levels where the secondary filters are derived from the primary ones without using more storage. This method can improve the capacity of the CNN filters. Two classes of versatile filters are introduced from a spatial or channel perspective. Experiments are also carried out to illustrate the method. The method is promising and the presentation of the paper is nice.
