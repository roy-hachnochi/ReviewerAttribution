This paper proposed an accelerated randomized algorithm for solving linear systems based on sketching and projection. Then they extended it for matrix inversion problem and also presented an accelerated BFGS optimization algorithm using the same heuristics.   1. This paper claims this is the *first* accelerated randomized algorithm for solving linear system. I am not so sure what is the right baseline rate that this paper tries to accelerate. Usually the non-accelerated is O(\kappa \log(1/\eps)) and the accelerated rate is O(\sqrt\kappa \log(1/\eps)), \kappa is the condition number of A. To my best knowledge, the first accelerated stochastic algorithm that can achieve the latter rate under certain condition is from this paper:  http://proceedings.mlr.press/v84/xu18a/xu18a-supp.pdf where they analyzed the general stochastic three-term recurrence.  After reading the paper, the paper is accelerating the the specific Sketch-and-Project algorithm which has a rate O(1/\mu\log 1/eps). It is not clear to me how the accelerated rate O(\sqrt(\nu/\mu) \log 1/\eps) from this paper compares with the typical accelerated rate O(\sqrt\kappa \log 1/\eps). To be precise, the paper should not claim this is the first accelerated randomized algorithm, unless it makes it very clear which specific rate/algorithm they try to accelerate.   From a more practical point, what are the scenarios where these algorithms can outperform CG or MINRES?  2. In the experiments, it is not clear that what the legends/axis are.   3. I suggest to include CG in the experiments for comparison.  4. Algorithm 3 is very interesting. If the paper could do some analysis on the momentum scheme for BFGS, that is a really big contribution. Unfortunately there is none.  Overall, I suggest that the paper should better position their paper, be more descriptive about the experiment and do some analysis on Algorithm 3. Then that will be a very strong paper.
