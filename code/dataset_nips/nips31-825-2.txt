This paper first analyzes the Accelerated Sketch-and-Project of ref. [24] in more general cases and then applies that method for Matrix Inversion problem. They show the accelerated convergence rate for the inversion problem. Finally, they propose that the acceleration tweak could be incorporated in the BFGS algorithm.    C 1- This is an incremental contribution over the original Accelerated Sketch-and-Project and its application over matrix inversion problem.   2- It is not clear why there is the section 4.2. It needs more explanation.   3- It mentioned in the paper that the assumption(12) holds for the inversion problem. Is it independent of the sketching strategy? How so?
