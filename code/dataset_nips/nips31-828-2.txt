The paper proposes a novel two stage scheme for semantic segmentation. In the first stage,  a sub-network predicts the initial rough segmentation results which are the seed of the second stage. In the second stage, another sub-network estimates the similarities between the pixels based on their multi-level features. Finally, cascaded random walk is performed to update the results. The evaluations on Pascal VOC 2012 and Pascal Context validate the effectiveness of the proposed method combined with Deeplab v2.  The novelty of the proposed method is sufficient as common segmentation networks are purely feed-forward ones, e.g. PSPnet and Deeplab. The proposed network addresses the boundary localization problem and fragmented prediction simultaneously within a single framework. Compared to existing networks that incorporate crf and random walk, the proposed method seems still unique. One concern is that the proposed method should be compared to Deeplab v2 that contain crf or random walk components described in previous papers, in terms of mIoU. Comparison to only Deeplab v2 itself is not sufficient.
