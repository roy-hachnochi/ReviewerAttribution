Quality and Clarity: The paper is an easy and pleasant read. It is well-organized and the claims are supported by either theoretical justifications or empirical results. The paper is technically sound. Originality: It proposes to bring in the idea of conditional GANs into adversarial domain adaptation. In doing so, it proposes a novel approach of explicit multilinear feature map to combine the feature representation as well as classifier output of a source/target sample before being fed to the domain-discriminator. Furthermore, it proposes a simple weighting for the samples in the adversarial loss. The weighting tries to up-weight “easy” samples in order to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in the early stages of training. Significance: Although, the original contributions are quite simple and do not drastically change the formulation from the standard DANN [17], they are shown to be surprisingly and significantly effective in practice. The experiments are done on multiple hard benchmarks and further ablation analysis is conducted. The differences in performance and the accompanying analyses conclusively show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the prior works.  Domain adaptation and adversarial training are important fields for both practitioners as well as academic researchers. The paper’s proposals are simple to adopt and clearly effective. Thus, it is a clear accept for NIPS.   I do agree with R3:  The rebuttal addresses most of reviewers' concerns. However, there is still an outstanding issue that I strongly encourage the authors to take into account for the next version:  - The introduction should be toned down in claiming to be the first paper that considers conditional UDA. In that respect, the related works should include the discussions in the rebuttal on the difference with the works R3 mentions.
