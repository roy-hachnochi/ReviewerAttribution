The paper proposes an end-to-end convolutional NN that produces candidate image correspondences. The paper proposes a network that uses 4D convolutions to identify consistent matches. The proposed method trains a model using a weak supervision in order to avoid exhaustive manual annotations. The paper presents experiments on semantic and image-feature correspondences where the proposed method shows improvement.  Pros: - End-to-end convolutional NN architecture - Trained using weakly supervised methods  Cons: - Insufficient experiments - Missing a discussion about limitations    While I believe that the proposed network is an interesting idea, my main concern with this submission is that it lacks a few experiments and clarifications.   First. In many matching applications, it is crucial to know the timings the matching procedure takes given that many CV-applications use exhaustive search. It would be interesting to know how long the net takes to establish candidate correspondences as a function of the number of features to match. Clearly, if this is faster than exhaustive search, then clearly this will become a very good contribution that deserves to be extended.   In applications that estimate a geometric model (e.g., pose, homographies, essential matrix), it is also important to know about the number of false positives (FP) that this method generates. This is because these applications will use RANSAC, and the higher the number of FPs, the slower the convergence of RANSAC.  Lastly, I think the paper is missing a section discussing the limitations of the proposed approach.
