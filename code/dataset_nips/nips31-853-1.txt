*** UPDATE *** Thank you for your author feedback. I feel that the paper is strong, but discussion with fellow reviewers persuaded me to reduce my score from 9 to 8 due to their feedback that aspects of the presentation are unclear. ***  This paper makes a strong mathematical contribution to the concept of leverage, linking this to notions from the theory of reproducing kernels and, ultimately, proposing and studying (mathematically) a "regularised" Christoffel function. Such a contribution is, to my mind, timely and its theoretical emphasis is welcome at NIPS.   The paper reads well and the only comments that I have are extremely minor:  - for transpose in latex, ^T ought to be ^\top  - on p2 "which degree is" -> "whose degree is"  - on p4 "approximate integration" -> "approximates integration" and "we first precise" -> "we first make precise"  - on p4, technically L^\infty hasn't been defined.  - the overview of numerical cubature in methods in sec 2.4 was rather limited, and the authors could emphasise that in general a cubature rule should be selected based on properties of the function being integrated. For example, arbitrarily fast convergence for smooth integrands can sometimes be achieved with quasi-Monte Carlo methods.  - on p7 "numerical evidences" -> "numerical evidence"
