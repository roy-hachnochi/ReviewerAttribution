The connection between leverage scores and density using the proposed regularized Christoffel functions is interesting. However, we found this work missing some motivations, namely the authors need to motivate the use of the proposed Christoffel functions compared to the commonly used methods in estimating leverage scores.  We think that the constraint f(z)=1 in (1), and almost everywhere, needs to be further investigated, and its influence on the obtained results. For instance, the result given in (2) relies on the representer theorem, and the influence of this constraint does not show in this expression. This goes also for the other results.  In the section 3.2 "Main result", the constraint in (5), namely f(0)=1, is not correct (the function f being defined on R^d).
