The authors build on top of the non-local neural network of Wang et al., 2017 [37] and incorporate it into a recurrent neural network for image restoration. The non-local recurrent network (NLRN) provides top results on image denoising and super-resolution.  The paper reads well and provides a good balance between method description and experimental results.  The reported results are very good especially for the image denoising task.  For the image super-resolution study I suggest the following works: Timofte et al., NTIRE 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Methods and results, 2017 Ledig et al., Photo-realistic single image super-resolution using a generative adversarial network, 2017 Bae et al., Beyond deep residual learning for image restoration: Persistent homology-guided manifold simplification, 2017  I think that the authors should compare with the approaches of Bae et al., 2017 and of Ledig et al., 2017 (SRResNet).  A runtime / time complexity comparison, in addition to the Table 3 contents, would be interesting to have.
