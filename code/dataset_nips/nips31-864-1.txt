[post-rebuttal] Thanks for the rebuttal - the change proposed by R1 seem to good to me!  The model applies graph Gaussian processes to node classification in a graph. The posed task is to accurately perform classification and active learning in the face of scarce labels. The model compares favourably to various baselines when there are many labels, and outperforms them in the limited data regime.  # Overall Score  I would be confident implementing this model from the paper, and the experiments seem fair and to present the model's strengths in a balanced way. To my knowledge, the paper attributes prior work well, and makes a clear contribution on top of this work. I believe the paper to be significant in its data efficiency.  # Confidence  I am familiar with GPs and their variational approximations, and have somewhat out of date familiarity with neural architectures for graph embedding from a project last year, however I cannot claim to have sufficient understanding of the derivations in Section 3 to be able to implement the model without close reference to the paper. Section 3.1 was helpful to my understanding of the paper.
