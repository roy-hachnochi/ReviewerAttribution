The authors introduce a quadratic optimization with relaxed boolean constraints that jointly learns to localize and segment objects from images and videos. So, a graph cut-based clustering framework is enhanced through transferring learning and least square loss that allows coupling foreground labels and bounding boxes. Overall, the transferring of knowledge via spatial relation is the core of the proposal and seems to be interesting to support CNN-based frameworks.   The paper is clearly written, with the method detailed (both mathematically and intuitively). However, experimental results are not completely convincing, especially, those presented in table 3. Moreover, a suitable analysis regarding the free parameters in Eq (7) could be performed.
