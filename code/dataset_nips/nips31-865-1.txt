The paper is good, presents a new idea that achieves excellent results at the level of performance. I'm familiar with these types of techniques but I can not quite understand why has been used the histogram metric rather than some gradient-based technique (e.g., Gradient Edge Detection) to differentiate an object across all image.  The submission present a video/image segmentation and localization framework for learns to localize and segment common objects in images and videos using a discriminative clustering model. The originality of the work is focused on: 1) Introduce a foreground/beckground discriminative model nased on histogram matching term. This foreground model are incorporated into discriminative clustering one and optimizated together. 3) Show a novel mechanism to exploit spatial relation between superpixel and bounding box in an unsupervised way.  The technical content of the paper appears to be correct but the authors did not highlight well both the strengths and weaknesses of their work.  It's generally well-written and structured clearly. Maybe it's too structured in the paragraph 6. In this case, I recommend making the text more fluid.   I don't have any minor remarks and typos.
