This paper formulate the video/image segmentation and localization problem as a single optimization problem that leverages the geometric relationship between bounding boxes (localization) and super pixels (segmentation) as optimization constraints. It also incorporate a foreground model. However, the reviewer don't see much novelty in this framework as this kind of optimization formulation has been used for this problem in prior literatures and the improvement based on modeling bbox and super pixels seems to be minor. The experimental results do not look promising either. This makes the contribution and significance of the paper to be questionable.
