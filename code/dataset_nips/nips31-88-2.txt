This paper takes the input reconstruction (autoencoder) as the regularizer to attain the generalisation of neural network models, which is being called supervised auto-encoder (SAE). It first proves an upper bound for showing the uniform stability of linear SAE, hinting good generalisation performance. Then, it shows empirically that the addition of the input reconstruction can consistently make the neural network models learned to generalize well.  Strengths: - Given that most of the deep learning work is empirical, this paper shows theoretically that including the input reconstruction error (auto-encoding task) into the objective of linear SAE can theoretically be shown to improve generalisation performance. This contributes to both originality and significance. - For the experiments, when the dimension of the hidden representation is kept increasing, the SAE is shown empirically to be able to achieve persistently good generalisation performance. The experiments also include the use of the different form of non-linear units and the improvement persists. - The paper is well presented and motivated.  Specific comments: - Line 127: D is undefined - How is the performance of SAE compared with the use of autoencoder for pre-training?
