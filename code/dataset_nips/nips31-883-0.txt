The paper proposes an algorithm, LINUCRL that recognizes the fact that users' preferences can be  time-varying and the recommendations may itself influence the preferences.  I have the following questions/ suggestions  a) The paper mainly cites several key papers in MAB setting. However, boredom in recommendation has been previously studied. For instance, WSDM 2015 paper "Just in Time Recommendations: Modeling the Dynamics of Boredom in Activity Streams". Citing some of the work addressing boredom and contrasting this paper's contribution could be useful.   b) The authors illustrate the farsightedness with the three genre example of action, drama and comedy. Churn is a serious problem for online recommendation (a user may get frustrated with the recommendations and leave the system). How does the authors plan to address churn?   c) I like the way the paper attempts to circumvent unavailability of data sets and construct the experiments. However, I felt the algorithmic contribution of the paper is not substantial.  Also, I would like the recommendations to be more fine-grained than just plain genre and extending the results to more fine-grained recommendations would improve the paper.   Overall, I find the paper well-written, while the literature review section can certainly expand few lines of past work involving boredom.   %After rebuttal%  After reading the authors' rebuttal, I am willing to increase the overall score to 6.
