The paper proposes a temporal regularization technique for the estimation of a value function. The idea consists in averaging over previous values weighted with the probabilities of a reversal Markov chain.  Pros:  - The idea of using the reversal Markov chain and related results (although simple) are novel, as far as I know  - The experimental results are convincing  - The paper is reasonably clear  Cons:  - The presentation could have been more rigorous. Notably, the notational issues (see below) should be fixed before publication  - I would have appreciated more details on how PPO is extended with temporal regularization. Is (10) applied with a finite N?  Minor remarks and typos: l.73: the notation \pi( . | s) doesn't fit its definition as a function from S x A (3): shouldn't r also depends on \pi? (4): r(a) is not defined, the max operator over vector should also be defined (5): a_t should also appear or the dependence on \pi should be clearer l.129-131 and (9): n vs N and several index problems l.135: missing word caption of Fig.4: missing space
