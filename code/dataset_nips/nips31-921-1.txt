A collaborative learning framework for training deep neural networks is presented in the paper, targeting at improved accuracy. It is an interesting formulation, starting with a rather simple operation, based on using multiple classifier heads in the training procedure. Although significance of outcomes should be better determined, the formulation and optimization procedure described in Section 3 show a good potential for the use of the methodology. Effectively determining the hyperparameter values is an issue to consider. A somewhat better evaluation of the Table 4 results (training time vs memory wrt accuracy) could be presented.
