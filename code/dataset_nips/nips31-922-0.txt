* Summary  This paper studies a high-dimensional regression problem through applying the Lattice-based technique The technique restricts the true parameters \beta^* as rational numbers and represent them as division of integers,  and obtain the true parameters as an output of the Lagarias-Odlyzko algorithm. Their approach enables us to obtain the true parameter with ultra high-dimensional case in which the previous approach could not prove theoretical guarantees.  * Comment  The idea of this paper is quite interesting for me. Though the Q-rationality assumption is restrictive a little, it seems an appropriate way to simplify the regression problem and obtain a sharp result.  However, I have mainly two comments for some faults of this paper.  1. Assumption on noise W is quite restrictive. The authors assume that the noise level decreases rapidly as n increases, and this is a severe condition for high-dimensional regression. (For an instance, this paper assume \sigma = o(n^{-1}\hat{Q}^{-1}) in Theorem 2.5.A.) In the field of high-dimensional statistics, it is always assumed that \sigma=O(1), so the setting of this paper is not acceptable for the statistics.  2. Numerical evidence This paper lacks numerical evidences to support usefulness of the result of this paper. Since this paper provides theoretical results by applying a new framework which is not common in the fields of high-dimensional statistics, the authors should show validity and usefulness of the new approach by numerics.  Also, I have some minor comments.  -The limit condition (eq.(2)) is difficult to interpret. What N works for? -Typo: in line 253, \beta^*_i should be \beta_i ?
