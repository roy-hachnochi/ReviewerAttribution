This paper introduces the problem of high-dimensional regression with a structural assumption on the parameters. Formally, X and y are observed such that either y=Xb* or y=Xb*+noise. This problem is ill-posed without further assumptions on b* in high dimension. Here, the assumption is that b* has rational coefficients, with a fixed bounded denominator.  A new algorithm is proposed, related to the LLL basis reduction algorithm, and analysed, showing that some amount of noise can be tolerated in this problem.  I think that the result is interesting, and as far as I can tell, correct. Maybe the main weakness of the paper is that it is not very clear how useful and well-motivated this problem is. However, the technical contribution is important.
