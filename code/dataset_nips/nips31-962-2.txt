The authors propose a distributed stochastic algorithm for expected risk minimization that achieves optimal convergence rate $N^{-1/2}$, with time  $O(N/m)$ (here $m$ is the number of ``local machines"), space $O(1)$ and $K= O(1)$ communication rounds.   The algorithm seems interesting.  However, as I did not manage to read the proofs,  thus I am willing to let other qualified reviewers make the final decision.  Minor comments: There are much ``taking expectation step" in the paper. Perhaps it is better to clarify which random variable you are taking the expectation with respect to?  For example, in Proposition 1, $\mathbb{E}[g_t]$ should be $\mathbb{E}[g_t | w_t]?$  In the proof of Lemma 1, $v_k$ is a random variable, and thus when applying the concentration inequalities,  the event will also depend on this random variable.
