The submission presents a new method named Virtual Softmax for deep learning based general classification task. Virtual Softmax aims at learning enlarged inter-class classification margin and compressed intra-class distribution via injecting a virtual class during training. The idea is simple, yet produces very promising results in multiple publicly available datasets in the object classification and the face verification. The paper is very well written and the experimental evaluation is solid. The proposed approach method is general and thus has very good application potential to different scenarios.   The reviewer recommends an acceptance of the work, and does not have concerns regarding to the manuscript.
