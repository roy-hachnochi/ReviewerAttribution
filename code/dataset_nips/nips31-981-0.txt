Summary - The paper explores the effect of attention and convolutional structures in a convLSTM, for the specific case where the ConvLSTM takes spatio-temporal feature maps extracted by a 3D-CNN, and the task is gesture recognition. Experiments are shown on four variants, from which it is discerned that the best architecture is a convLSTM that uses fully connected layers for the gates and convolutional layers for the input-to-state transition, thereby decreasing number of parameters and computation.   Strengths -  -> Paper is well written, easy to follow, and the figures are good. -> Results obtained using variant a) on gesture recognition are very good, and establish that linear gates are sufficient for spatio-temporal fusion.  -> The proposed variant a) significantly reduces number of parameters and computation.  Weaknesses -  -> The problem statement for attention is slightly shaky. It is evident that feeding spatio-temporal features from a 3D-CNN, would diminish the need for an added attention mechanism inside the convLSTM. The earlier works, like VideoLSTM, exploit attention on convolutional feature maps, which is interesting. This exploration of attention on 3D-CNN feature maps, although rigorous, is not highly interesting or informative, in my opinion. -> The paper shows results for the task of gesture recognition. The proposed architecture could have been adapted for the action recognition task and results shown on the popular UCF and HMDB datasets, to strengthen the arguments put forward in the paper. ->  Although relevant papers are discussed in the intro, the paper lacks a comprehensive related work section.   Overall assessment - The significance of the paper lies in the newly proposed architecture that reduces number of parameters and computation, but is limited from a research perspective. However, it can add to the knowledge of people working on combing CNN and RNN architectures, as the writing is good and experiments are detailed.
