This paper proposes a two stage Bayesian model selection procedure to (1) screen for a set of candidate change points, and (2) select a set of change points from that candidate set. The paper gives selection consistency bounds under and over segmentation errors. Then the paper applies the procedure to a set of synthetic data with varying error distributions, and a set of actual magnetic resonance imaging guided radiation therapy data (which has sufficient noisy to break most existing change point detection methods).  The paper is generally well written, but some of the details, such as the behavior of local and moment priors, is not explained in the main paper and it is missing from the supplementary material. However, the main strengths of this paper are (1) a new change point detection method that solves some of the noise sensitivity present in other change point methods, (2) strong theoretical results to support that method, and (3) application to a real problem. Image-guided radiation therapy data is usually thoroughly messy and fast, stable inference to detect tissue and tumor regions in a patient that may be moving (including heartbeats, breathing, etc) is a tough problem.
