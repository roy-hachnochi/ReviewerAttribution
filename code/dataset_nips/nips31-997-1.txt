The article analyses convergence in hard-thresholding algorithms and proposes an accelerated stochastic hybrid hard thresholding method that displays better convergence with respect to the compared methods.  The article is dense but relatively fine to follow. Theoretical development seems to be complete and accurate, though I admit I have not throughly followed the full derivation. Experimental section is in accordance with the theoretical claims and is more than sufficient.  Just for the sake of reproducibility of the results an exhaustive pseudocode or repository should be made available as a companion to the article to further strength the autor's points.
