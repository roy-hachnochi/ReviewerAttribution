This paper proposes to use HSGD with hard thresholding for L0 or rank constrained problems. The paper exhibits improved rates compared to state-of-the-art SVRG and SGD approaches, and proposes an accelerated variant using the heavy-ball method. Numerical experiments are convincing and illustrate the improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines. I think that this is a good paper, which provides an interesting contribution to the field.
