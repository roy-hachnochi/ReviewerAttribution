-bravo for detailing computational mechanisms that may link associative processing in hippocampal place cells and metric processing in entorhinal grid cells  -it is somewhat unclear what type of analyses and results have actually been aimed at and obtained  - page 2: CA3 synapses are mentioned first summary of contributions  -discussion: reward, in the eyes of this reviewer, should not be considered a 'sensory stimulus'; rather, reward processing is the result of neural processing of sensory cues in the environment  -the figures and their captions are well thought out and effective in communicating their message
