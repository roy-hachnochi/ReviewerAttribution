The paper tackles a very important problem and bridges two growing fields. The methodology is sound and different observed phenomena are covered to test the feasibility of the framework. The main problem of the paper is that its theoretical contribution is not explicitly specified. Particularly, some ideas in section 2 seems to be borrowed directly from the AI. While the authors have cited the related work in the beginning of the paper, I think it is necessary that they specify the source of each equation (or if it is from themselves).
