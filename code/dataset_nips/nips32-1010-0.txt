Originality: CDDNwithTDC is new and novel: its cascading dense blocks with dilated convolution and its two-step data consistency layer. The author adequately cites relevant works.   Quality/Clarity: This is a complete piece of work. The authors are honest about the proposed solution's strengths and weaknesses. The solution may take longer to train and test than some of the prior arts. Nonetheless, the solution uses much fewer number of parameters while setting the new state of the art as far as its performance (PSNR and SSIM) is concerned. The authors also provide an example image with the lesion region zoomed in so that the reader can qualitatively compare the effect of the  extra data consistency step in the proposed model. The experiments are also thorough. It showed the effect of the sampling rate and the number of parameter on the model performance (PSNR). The mathematical formulation is sound and clear as well. Overall, it was pleasant reading and following the paper.  Significance: The proposed solution and the results reported in the paper are very significant from both algorithmic and application perspectives.
