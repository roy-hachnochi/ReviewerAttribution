The authors have done a commendable job at developing a model to reconstruct MRI from k-space and evaluating it quantitatively. I'm raising the following possible questions/concerns: - Since the test set is small (3 patients), I would have liked to see k-fold cross validation. - A fair test to compare the reconstructed image to the ground truth could be radiologists' interpretation of them. Quantitative and anecdotal qualitative assessment is great, but it is also important to know if the radiologists' interpretation would have been consistent between the reconstructed and ground truth images. - Have the authors looked into using the FastMRI dataset? I do not have a clinical background, but I wonder if the FastMRI dataset could have been used as a second dataset for reproducibility and generalization of the proposed approach.
