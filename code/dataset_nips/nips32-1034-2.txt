Originality：This paper solves the multiple marginal mapping problem by defining a multi-marginal Wasserstein algorithm firstly. Quality: The whole structure of this work is consistent in general. Under a specific condition, the paper gives the sound technically analysis, contains  the equivalence of solutions, and the generalization analysis.  And the theoretical analysis and the empirical experiment results to support for the proposed algorithms.  Clarity：The paper is written clearly and easy to follow. Significance:  This work makes a moderate advance for M3 problem. Under a specific and rigorous condition, the authors done an adequate work theoretically and experimentally. The only problem is that how can real problems satisfy the condition. Some concerns: 1)The whole work stand on a condition that a shared potential function is sufficient for problem 1 in paper. But authors just use the experimental result in appendix I to show the practicability in some real-world tasks. It seems weak.   2)In theorem 1, there is a key assumption which states “if (f_0, \cdots, f_N) and (\lambda_0f , \cdots, \labmbda_N f ) are solutions to problem 1”. How can you verify this assumption?  The key question I want to known is, why you can replace N different functions with a unified function f and N constant factor? Or within what distance among the  multiple domain, you can do such replace. 3)Toy data experiment. Can you explain more detailly about how to understand the Figure2 especially the value surface of the discriminator.
