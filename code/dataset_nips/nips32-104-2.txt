***** After Author Response and Reviewer Discussions ***** I have gone through all the other reviews, the meta-reviewer's comment, and the authors' feedback. I will keep my evaluation unchanged. **********************************************************  *originality: To my best knowledge, the results are original. The methodologies of analysis belong to classical asymptotic statistics, but the problem analyzed is new.  *quality: Due to the time constraint I did not go through the proofs. The claim in the abstract is well supported by the theorems. The work appears to be complete. The authors are honest about claiming the strength and weakness of their work.  *clarity: The submission is clearly written, well written and of elegant style. Since this is a theoretical paper, the proofs provide enough information for an expert reader to varify the theorems which are the results.  *significance: The results are important and significant for understanding the behavior of MSWE and MESWE. This paper is likely to be cited by people working on the application side of these two estimators. The problem is difficult and the authors have provided better analysis than that in literature to my best knowledge. The analysis provided advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way. The analysis is theoretically unique.
