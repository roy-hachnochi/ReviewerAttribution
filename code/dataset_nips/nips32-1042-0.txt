Quality - The theoretical part is thorough enough, both in terms of the scope of results presented and quality of proofs (in the appendix). The empirical part is acceptable, but I feel could be improved (detailed below).  Clarity - Apart from some minor peeves (detailed below), the paper is clear.  Originality + Significance - The method introduced by the authors seems like a better approach to use IS weights, so while they did not introduce a new concept (I think most people who worked with importance sampling will recognize the methods as variants of the same idea), I think it is important to rethink how to use the idea of IS weights in ways which avoid their huge variance.  Post rebuttal update - Despite the authors response, I think giving at least one simple model based baseline would be useful, as these make up an important approach to OPE and I don't think an IS paper is truly complete without such comparison, especially as these methods often perform better in practice. Nevertheless, I will keep my score of 7.  A concern which arose during the reviewers' discussion regarded the validity of assumption 1. Especially in the regime of limited data, I believe that assuming transition are drawn i.i.d. is unlikely. While this assumption is used frequently in OPE, quite often for other estimators entire trajectories are sampled rather that individual transitions. Thus the trajectories are more likely to be i.i.d as opposed to individual trajectories. While I don't think the problematic nature of assumption 1 is big enough to prevent the paper from being published, if the paper gets accepted I strongly encourage the authors to have a thorough discussion in the text regarding when this assumption might hold or break.
