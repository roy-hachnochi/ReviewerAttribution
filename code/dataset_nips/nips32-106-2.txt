***** After Author Response and Reviewer Discussions ***** I have gone through all the other reviews, the meta-reviewer's comment, and the authors' feedback. I will keep my evaluation unchanged, and emphasize a point found by the meta-reviewer, that is the authors should not claim ReLU or leaky ReLU to satisfy the smooth conditions. ****************************************************************    Originality: The methodology provided in this paper is, to our best knowledge, new. It is an innovative combination of the well-known techniques, namely the SW and Radon Transform. The paper is clearly different from the previous contributions and the related literature is sufficiently cited.  Quality: The submission is technically sound. The claims are well supported by the analysis, although due to time restriction I have not gone through the proofs. This work is complete. The authors are honest about evaluating both the strengths and weakness of their work.  Clarity: The submission is clearly and elegantly organized and written with good style. Since the proof is provided in the supplementary materials, it is sufficient for the expert readers to validate the claims.  Significance: The results are obviously important. I believe that the method developed here would attract lots of interests and push the frontier of the research forward. For the suitable problems, the methodology would advance the state of the art in a demonstratable way. This paper provides unique theoretical approach.
