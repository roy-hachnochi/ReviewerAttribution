This paper proposed a good motivation on the issues of existing out-of-sample detection work, and then proposed a new dataset that helps to evaluate the quality of out-of-sample results. Based on this new dataset, the paper further conducted an empirical study of existing baselines and showed the challenges of solving the out-of-sample problem.  The value of this work mainly lies in the creation of the new dataset that helps to address the out-of-sample detection problems.
