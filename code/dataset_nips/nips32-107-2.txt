***************After Author response************  (1)-(2)-(4)-(5)-(6) were only recommendations and will of precisions. (3) was a mistake I made inferring from Theorem 1 that all results were only 1-dimensional. But the authors pointed out my mistake. Sorry for this lack of attention.  The main concern I have is about the conclusions drawn from the result they prove. They deduce flatness near local minima from the fact that the basin of attraction of the latter is wide (from Theorem 2). I may be wrong but for me there is no reason that this happen even with the Holder-Gradient condition (even in R as they tried to prove in the rebuttal). Moreover, the big novelty with this model is the fact that the dynamics is not continuous anymore and seem to jump without taking care of the heights of the barriers. Do we observe these unusual jumps in practice ?   I am sorry to show my skepticism because the paper is well-referenced and nice in general, I have only doubts on the fact that it model well Neural Networks.  For all these reasons, I decide to keep my 5, as it is said in the description : Marginally below the acceptance threshold. I tend to vote for rejecting this submission, but accepting it would not be that bad. And if other reviewers and yourself are convinced by the model, I would be ok with it.   *******************************************************    Originality: The paper is quite original and the new assumption on the noise model of SGD leads to a new continuous time limit SDE for the dynamic of SGD under which the exit time properties are fairly different (polynomial time versus usual exponential time). I appreciate the will of finding new good model for SGD that explains the practice.  Quality-Clarity: The paper reads very clearly and is, despite its novel ideas and technical background for the ML community, fairly understandable. Moreover the continuous-time limit is explained and the result for the exit time of the discretized counterpart is related to the continuous one -which is not always the case in this literature.   However, I am not totally convinced by the conclusions of the paper when affirming that as the time to exit from an interval is polynomial with respect to its width and does not depend on the height of barriers, SGD has a tendency to stay in wide minima bassins. To explain this phenomenon I would have expected a result depending on the flatness around local minima whereas the result is about every interval of width a (whether this is a neighbourhood of a local minimum or not). I would be glad to have more precisions about this in the rebuttal.   Significance: see Contributions section.
