I have a few questions and would appreciate if the authors can answer them in the rebuttal and / or the final version of the paper :  1. The paper deals with the movement cost ||x_t - x_{t-1} ||^2 as compared to ||x_t - x_{t-1} || (which one might expect in standard applications). What happens for the latter case ? Do the upper bounds / lower bounds and the new algorithm extend to that setting ?   2.  Are there any lower bounds or impossibility results for regret when L is large (in the definition of L-constrained dynamic regret, Theorem 6) ?   3. Why is the \gamma parameter not tunable in the lower bound of Theorem 2 for OBD.   4. Suppose f_tâ€™s are G lipschitz. What can be said then ? It seems that the current lower bound will not work if the hitting losses are forced to have bounded gradients. Is online balanced descent optimal then ?   5. Is the regret still bounded when  f_t is stochastic and not known before making the decision x_t. It seems that the competitive ratio is hard to bound, but regret may still be controllable.     Writing Style:  The paper is overall well written. There are some minor typos (e.g. lemma-1 in appendix; line 281, etc), but I am sure they will be corrected in the final version of the paper.   ============ Post Author Feedback ============ I want to thank the authors for giving me a detailed response to my review and, sharing connections of their work to the existing literature. I am increasing my score by 1 point (from 7 to 8) to acknowledge my satisfaction. Best !
