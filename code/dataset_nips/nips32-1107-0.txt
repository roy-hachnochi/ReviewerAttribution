The paper presents a novel meta-learning method as well as the detailed algorithm and analysis of its convergence property. The proposed method can adaptively learn an explicit weighting function directly from data. The weighting function is a MLP with one hidden layer and the method can fit a wide range of weighting functions. The paper discusses lots of related work and analyzes the pros and cons. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The paper is well organized, the figures and tables are clear. But there are also some handwriting errors. For example, at line 180, there should be “stable” rather than “stale”. At line 69, there should be "tradition" instead of "traditional".
