Originality: The paper is moderately original — the idea of splitting diversity into lexical and syntactic is interesting. However, the approach taken is derived from [13] and standard VAEs.  Quality: The paper is technically correct and cites relevant work adequately.  Clarity: While the writing is generally clear, the notation is a bit cluttered and hard to parse with the “.” and “..” superscripts for variables.  Significance: The idea of splitting diversity into these two factors is both novel and interesting. The paper takes a reasonable route to model both these aspects and also shows that it leads to improvements (over at least other VAE-based methods, [3] and other RL methods perform better, see COCO leaderboard). Therefore, it is of reasonable interest to the community.
