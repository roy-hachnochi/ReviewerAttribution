Originality: TransNorm follows similar style from AdaBN and AutoDIAL, but shows higher performance.   Clarity: the paper is well written. I especially like Figure 1, which clearly illustrate the proposed TransNorm.    Quality: The proposed technique seems sound, and experimental settings/results are solid.  Significance: The algorithms is easy to use (so as other normalization techniques). Though higher performance is shown in the paper, it is unknown how significant it is when adopting in other real scenarios compared with other normalization techniques.
