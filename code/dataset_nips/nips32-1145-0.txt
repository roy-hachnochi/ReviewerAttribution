The manuscript is clear, original, well written, and contributes towards the theoretical understanding of an important problem.  The only weakness appears to be the overreliance on the Guassian assumption for the features and the assumed regularity of the covariance function, which is satisfied by ReLU but not other activation functions, such as tanh.
