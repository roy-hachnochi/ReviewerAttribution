With the above contributions, the paper explores the problem of paired-image classification. It designs plausible ways for the two streams of the network to interact so as to simulate the binocular vision. However, the connection between the network architecture and human binocular vision system is far-fetched. The simple minus and concatenation do not seem to be a generic way to pass messages across streams of networks.   In particular, the effectiveness of the proposed modules is not well-justified. It is not surprising at all that a two-stream network with across-stream interaction can perform better than an early fusion network. How about the late fusion networks and other fusion methods that pass messages between the two streams? Without comparison more possible baselines, it is not possible to experimentally justify the proposed modules are particularly useful for binocular images.  The experimental settings are toy-like, and the neural network backbone is also weak. Results under these settings are not practically meaningful. When a strong neural network can get much better accuracy using a single image in practice, it is not so useful to use a suboptimal binocular system to get some improvement regarding weak baselines on non-realistic datasets.
