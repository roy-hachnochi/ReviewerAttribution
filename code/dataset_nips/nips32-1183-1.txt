Originality: - Paper is the first to propose the counterfactual objective, which allows for algorithm users to smoothly interpolate between the alternative life objective and excursion objective. - The paper takes the gradient of this objective directly and find a set of updates using the same inspiration as previous methods in order to introduce a new update algorithm according to this objective.  Quality: - Mathematical arguments are convincing and reasonable. - Paper is clear about not necessarily doing better than OPPG algorithms like DDPG, but instead showing the effectiveness of emphatic algorithms in a difficult domain using nonlinear function approximators. - Potential issues about the instability of estimating F, C, and V are mentioned, which could lead to the algorithm not converging as well as in theory. - Unclear how the research into GOPPG can improve applications of OPPG. Since this paper does not lead to significant results, perhaps a longer analysis of this and suggestions about improving OPPG methods would benefit the work.  Significance: - First emphatic algorithm to make significant progress on the Mujoco domain. - Results are not that signifcant over SotA for these environments, and do not compare to more recent OPPG algorithms like SAC and TD3.  Clarity: Paper is fairly clear and well organized. Math is understandable, and the more space taking proofs are in the appendix. Paper is clear about its downsides.
