Originality: My main concern is about the novelty of proposed method. Actually, the key part in the proposed counterfactual objective and the gradient is the covariate shift term d_gamma. However the way of correcting for the covariate shift are directly from [Gelada and Bellemare, 2019], and the rest is just put it into the policy gradient theorem in the ACE paper.  Clarity: The paper is written in a clear way. Easy to follow.  Significance: The comparison between DDPG and Geoff-PAC shows good practical performance and potential of the proposed method.   I have another minor concern with respect to the implementation of the method. It looks not clear to me how the term g(s) in Thm 2 can be computed efficiently, especially it is later mentioned that the algorithm use a replay buffer.  === After Rebuttal  === After read authors' response about the novelty, I would like to increase my score accordingly. I hope the original contribution of this paper comparing with Gelada's work will be presented more clearly in the final version. Particularly on: 1) Explain the necessity of using a new counterfactual objective, and the advantage comparing with the direct gradient re-weighting method. 2) Highlight the novel part is how to computing F_t^{(2)}.
