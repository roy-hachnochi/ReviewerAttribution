While this paper makes a nice contribution to an important problem, I am not sure if it is significant enough for the conference. The overall outline of the analysis follows closely that of [2], and the main new component is the improved gradient lower bound, which is largely based on previous ones in [2] and [16]. Although the improved analysis provides new insight and I find it useful, I do not feel that it will provide a big impact. The other technical contribution on improved trajectory length is also nice but again I feel that it is somewhat incremental.   The results seem technically sound; the proofs all look reasonable although I did not verify them thoroughly. The paper is well written and easy to follow in general, and the problem is an important one in machine learning.  * After author response:  I am satisfied with the response, but it does not change my opinion. Although the idea in the improved analysis is nice, I still feel that it is hard to push the idea much further, and very different ideas may be needed in order to improve the over-parameterization requirement significantly.
