Summary ======= The paper studies how to implement the well-known k-WL algorithm, which is a well-investigated heuristic for the graph isomorphism problem, in the language of linear algebra.  Consequently, the authors introduce so-called $k$-order graph networks, an extension of GNNs, that have the same power as the k-WL.  Specifically, they show how express the $3$-WL (or equiv. the $2$-FWL), and then sketch how their techniques can be used to show the general case.  The experimental results indicate that the new layer provides some benefits over the well-known baselines as well as the $k$-GNN layer (Morris, 2018).  Assessment ========= Interesting work that extend/sheds a different light on the work of Maroon et al 2019, and Morris et al, 2018.  I didn't check the proofs in detail, although the results and high-level ideas seem logical and plausible.  As the work is similar to the one of Morris et al, 2018, the authors should put more work in making their contribution clear.  Discussion of related work is good.
