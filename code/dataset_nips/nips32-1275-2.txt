The paper puts k-order networks introduced previously in relation to the k-WL test for graph isomorphism. The paper is on a high technical level, but clearly written and generally comprehensible. The results are closely related to two recent papers (Morris et al, 2018, Xu et al., 2019), which are prominently cited and discussed in the abstract and introduction. The paper presents a different formalism based in k-order networks and introduces techniques to obtain models that are as expressive as the k-WL test. In this technical part the relation to the two other papers is less clear. For example, multiset representations have also been proposed by Xu et al., 2019 for a similar task. Why is a different PMP based method introduced by the authors? The advantages of the introduced techniques should be stated more clearly. The contribution of section 6 is more clear, where a 3-WL equivalent model is proposed, which emulates the folklore 2-WL. The approach is claimed to be more efficient than the approach of Morris et al. with the same expressive power. The argument is understandable, but a result in terms of computational complexity or experimental running time is missing. This would strengthen the contribution.   Minor remarks: * Section 3.1: Graphs and possible attributes should be introduced. * p6, l.205 ".5" should be removed   ===== Edit ===== The authors have provided complexity results with their rebuttal. I have increased my score by one point.
