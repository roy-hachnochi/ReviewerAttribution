The authors tackle the problem of conditional independence testing problem by using a generative model to obtain the p-value.   Pros: - Using GAN to generate conditional independent sample is a new design and a new method to tackle the problem. - Good result on control of the type 1 error - Promising simulation result  Cons - Any rationale behind the reason why increasing lambda causes the increasing of type 1 error? - I feel that the sample size and scalability would be an issue here. If the data is limited would GAN be able to generate high quality samples of X? Also for a decent result how many sample should be generated until the p value become stable? It would be good if one investigate these problems for large implementations.  Thank the authors for the feedback addressing my questions. I am keeping my score at 6.
