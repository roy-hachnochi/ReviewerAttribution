Some comments per section: Section 2 - Line 128: I am not sure how the distance measure between two pairs (pair of index and split value) should be interpreted/computed. - In case of presence of correlated covariates, is the algorithm able to discover the required linear transformation simultaneously with the  required local split value?  Section 3 - As for correlated covariates, please comment on how this is handled in Algorithm 2. I don't see any reference of matrix $P$.  Experiments - How big is the ensemble size? - Please comment on how correlated covariates were handled for each of the datasets.  Summary Originality: the proposed method is an easy extension of existing methodologies. Quality: overall quality is average because of the clarity problem (see below). Clarity: the paper overall is clearly written - however, could use some work in organization and maybe bring in one of the theoretical results inside the main writeup. Significance: because the work is largely based on existing methodologies, either a strong theoretical result or an empirical result should have been provided. Given that the theoretical result in this paper is not quite strong, the paper is more empirically oriented.
