Originality: Borderline. The components are not new, and the core NOX map is a rather straight forward extension of NOCS map. However, it is not trivial to assemble a pipeline that consistently outperforms others. So I would consider the originality of this paper on the borderline.  Quality: Borderline. The performance under Chamfer distance metric is mostly better than other methods, however, there are some cases that deserve more explanations, e.g., Table 2-Car rows, Table 3-Car-first element of the third row. It seems that claims  from Line 58-59 are not backed by results.  Clarity: Good.  Significance: Good.
