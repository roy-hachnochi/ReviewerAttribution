I think both the NOX maps and the feature pooling over multiple input views make sense on an intuitive level. On the other hand, there is a large amount of literature in this area, and the proposed ideas are minor variations on well known concepts. The paper is also missing some important related work, and it would be good to consult a recent survey (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06543.pdf) to make sure the most relevant work is discussed. One notable omission in the related work is "Matryoshka Networks: Predicting 3D Geometry via Nested Shape Layers" by Richter and Roth. Their geometry representation is related to depth peeling, but they use several nested layers which allows them to represent internal surfaces, as opposed to just front and back as in NOX. In addition, their results seem much higher quality than in the proposed approach.   An other weakness of the paper is the limited comparison to only two other techniques, one quite dated (3D-R2N2). The second compared method (differentiable point clouds) does not use 3D supervision, hence this is not really a fair comparison.  While I think there are some interesting details in the paper, overall I feel the paper is too limited for publication at NIPS. The results do not seem to be state of the art. The limited comparison does not allow a full assessment because the reference methods are dated or address a different problem statement (3D reconstruction without 3D supervision). Visually other techniques (such as Matryoshka networks by Richter and Roth) seem to lead to much higher quality.
