Originality: The techniques seem to be build upon polynomial-approximation based techniques provided in [25]. If that is the case, the contribution of that work needs to be better acknowledged. In the current version, it's only introduced among several other papers on entropy estimation.    Quality and Clarity: The results are clean and well presented. The reviewer enjoyed reading this work.  Significance: The work is very interesting to the reviewer. However, I'm not sure about its significance, since I'm not an expert in this area.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Post Rebuttal: The authors have provided detailed responses and addressed my comments. The reviewer recommends acceptance.
