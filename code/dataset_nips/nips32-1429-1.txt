Originality: The paper proposes a new method that combines a fully-connected CRF which is completely learned and inferred with a CNN for structured predictions of facial landmarks. Its novelty is incremental as variants of CRFs have been widely used and combined with CNNs previously, including for prediction of landmarks, albeit using different formulations than the one proposed.  Quality: The authors show improvements over several existing methods and compare on 4 datasets, where their method performs the best. However, they omit comparisons against many of the latest state of the art methods. I would like to see how their method compares against these latest methods.  Clarity: The paper is well written and clear.  Significance: The paper is of incremental value in a niche application area.
