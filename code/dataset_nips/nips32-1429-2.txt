The paper presents an approach for facial landmark detection/alignment based on a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network and a Conditional Random Field, to impose structure on predicted landmarks.  Strengths: 1. The work is novel 2. The paper is well presented and clear 3. Results are very promising  Weaknesses: 1. Unclear experimental methodology. The paper states that 300W-LP is used to train the model, but later it is claimed same procedure is used as was used for baselines. Most baselines do not use 300W-LP dataset in their training. Is 300W-LP used in all experiments or just some? If it is used in all this would provide an unfair advantage to the proposed method. 2. Missing link to similar work on Continuous Conditional Random Fields [Ristovski 2013] and Continuous Conditional Neural Fields [Baltrusaitis 2014] that has a similar structure of the CRF and ability to perform exact inference. 3. What is Gaussian NLL? This seems to come out of nowhere and is not mentioned anywhere in the paper, besides the ablation study?  Trivia: Consider replacing "difference mean" with "expected difference" between two landmarks (I believe it would be clearer)
