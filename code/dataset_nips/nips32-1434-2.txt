This paper proposed a practical method for anomaly detection in different domain. The proposed method does not require anomalous instances and could be used directly or fine-tuned in the target domain. The authors present their idea logically. For example, they combine Gaussian distribution and Neural networks to generate latent vector; They add a regularization term to avoid overfitting and modifies loss function to use only normal instances in finetuning. The experiments on 4 public datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.  The experiments in section 5 and supplementary material are complete.  However, the 4 datasets are relatively simpler comparing to CV datasets. And even the method NN(neural network classifier with only one hidden layer) could achieve a good result on the 4 datasets. Could the proposed method be used on CV datasets? Is the proposed method limited by the performance of encoder & decoder? Besides, for section 4.2, how the Z works in network F and how the Z is estimated by neural network are not clearly indicated. That would be important details to reproduce the method.
