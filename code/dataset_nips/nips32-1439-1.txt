Update: I have read the author responses, and they have addressed my main concern by explaining how Table 1 was generated. My score remains 7, accept, as before.  The work is a novel combination of existing approaches to sketching for low-rank approximation: the authors carefully chain together CountSketch and leverage score sketching. The resulting algorithm demonstrates a desirable empirical tradeoff between accuracy and run-time, and is accompanied by supporting theory.   The paper is clearly written: it provides an outline of the proof of the correctness of the main algorithm that gives the reader an intuitive grasp of how the dimensionality reduction arguments come together to ensure a low relative-error approximation and a fast run-time. The empirical evaluation is not sufficiently convincing to this reviewer: the description of the experiments on real data that generated Table 1 is missing -- how were these datasets converted into TLS problems?  The significance of this paper is mainly theoretical: it shows that sketching can be employed to obtain a near linear-time approximation algorithm for the TLS problem.  Some comments: - Claim 3.1 should use the square of OPT - On line 265, the rank should be 2, not 3 - It would be clearer to report the times in Figure 1 as time_method/time_TLS in the same way as the costs are reported relative to those of TLS. - Section 4.1 references a figure (Figure 2) that has been moved to the supplement
