It is great to see the kind of interest in applying machine learning, and specifically reinforcement learning, into real-world problems such as computer systems as presented in this paper. While the paper has no significant contributions on either a theoretical or algorithmic front, it does an important job at highlighting some of the issues in applying modern RL algorithms to real problems, and provides a necessary benchmarking environment for computer systems research specifically. The problem domains included have a wide variety of characteristics, from high-frequent real-time systems to very-long horizon problems, uniquely structured state and action spaces and both simulated and real environments (some other related work that could be added is [1]). Especially the latter is valuable to ground any research. Moreover, the authors provide an RL baseline result for each of the proposed tasks, and highlight some of the problematic characteristics of these tasks for RL specifically. There could be a more elaborate discussion of the results however.  Overall the paper is clearly written and structured, although there are some minor grammatical errors (mainly in the appendices).

UPDATE I thank the authors for their rebuttal and agreeing to incorporate my suggestions. I am sticking with my score.
