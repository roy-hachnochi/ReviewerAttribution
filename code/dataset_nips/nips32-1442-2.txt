This paper (alongwith its supplementary material) provides good detail of the Park platform and the hyperparameter settings during the experiments which makes the work reproducible. The paper is well written and the flow is understandable too.  The paper claims Park to be an extensible platform at more than one occasions, however, the claim has not been substantiated with any metric. What makes the platform extensible should be more elaborate in the paper. For example may be a case study can help elaborate how easy is it to add a new systems environment? How much effort is required? etc.  The paper should discuss how different/good/bad is Park from similar or the closest platforms s.a. Facebook Horizon. What makes Park different from others and how? If Park has outperformed any baselines in other environments/problem specific learning methods, those comparisons can be made part of the paper to show superiority of Park  There are a few horizontal lines (i.e. no improvement in policies is seen) in figure 4. These cases should be discussed in text why has this happened? any possible reasons for such situations  Line 284: The paper should further elaborate which existing heuristics and optimal policies have been provided (just name them in the paper as an example for ease of the reader)
