The draft is basically well written, except that Section 3 seems a bit disorganized.   Estimation of treatment effects from observational data is an important topic in causal inference. A line of research has been done in recent years. This work uses neural networks for the estimation of treatment effects from observational data in “no hidden confounding” setting. They proposed two methods in terms of two stages. First, they proposed Dragonnet, a three-headed architecture that provides an end-to-end procedure for predicting propensity score and conditional outcome from covariates and treatment information. If the propensity-score head is removed from Dragonnet, the resulting architecture is the TARNET architecture from Shalit et al. Second, they made a modification to the objective function in training. The main inspiration here is the targeted minimum loss estimation (TMLE). My main concerns are the novelty. Both of the methods seem like we have A and B, so we can try to combine to see how it works.
