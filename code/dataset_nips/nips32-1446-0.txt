The presented paper generalizes the standard setting in regression via conformal prediction in order to adjust for covariate shift between train and test sets (i.e. while the conditional probability P_{Y|X} is constant, the covariate marginal P_X changes from train to test set). Although the structure of the paper seems somewhat uncommon, it is very easy to follow and gives excellent explanations of assumptions, interpretations and theoretical and empirical results. Proofs are supplied in adequate detail. A broader look on the context and importance of the generalized exchangeability is provided, indicating the paper's significance beyond the special case of covariate shift. I would consider the contributions of this paper as very significant. Conformal Prediction is especially relevant in safety sensitive situations (such as the medical domain, or autonomous driving), but in these settings covariate shift is extremely common. To properly deploy ML algorithms in these settings, covariate shift has to be taken care of - this paper provides both the algorithmic and the theoretical basis for this.  Some (minor) critic points: - a theoretical analysis of the approximated likelihood ratio would have been very helpful; in practice, the true likelihood ratio will not be known, and although the authors give a practical way of dealing with this situation, the theoretical properties were not established - it would have been interesting to see, whether and/or how the proposed method translates to the classification setting, instead of only regression - the empirical evaluation is somewhat limited. A more rigorous evaluation on a more diverse range of data sets would have been helpful. - code could have easily been provided via anonymized links or in the supplement
