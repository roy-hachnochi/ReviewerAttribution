Summary Conformal prediction is a distribution-free method for confidence region construction, which resembles the jackknife procedure. This paper addresses one failure of the exchangeability assumption, which is at the core of the theory underlying conformal prediction. The essence of the proposed adjustment to the theory and the modification of confidence interval construction is the addition of importance weights, which help deal with differences in distribution of the observed sample, e.g. due to covariate shift in supervised learning tasks. Authors numerically compare the classical procedure to the weighted prediction. The experiments also compare weight oracle against weights estimated via a contrast-based density estimation approach.
