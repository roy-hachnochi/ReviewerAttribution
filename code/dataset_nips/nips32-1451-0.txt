The main result is an extension of the two known results: a recent result from [13] that provide the suboptimal approximation ratio of order $O(k+1)$ over $p \ge 1$, and the classical result from Deshpande et al. ([14]) that analyzes the case $p = 2$ (i.e., Frobenius norm), and proves the bound $O(\sqrt{k+1})$ matching that of the present work. The key technical novelty is the application of the Riesz-Torin theorem that allows to bound the approximation ratio for any~$p \ge 1$ by interpolating the bounds for $p = 1$, $p =2$, and the bound for $p = \infty$ obtained by the authors (the analysis for the latter case is, in fact, way simpler than for the case $p = 2$ addressed in [14]). This allows to obtain  sharp results for $p \in [2, \infty$, whereas those for $p \in [1,2]$ remain suboptimal.   As far as I can tell, the Riesz-Torin theorem has been hitherto unknown in the TCS community, and drawing attention to it would be useful; hence I recommend to accept the paper.  The main reason for my (modest) evaluation score is that the case $p = 2$, clearly the hardest to analyze among $p \in \{1,2,\infty\}$, is already known from the classical work [14]. The key contribution is really the application of the Riesz-Torin theorem to interpolate between the different values of $p$; arguably, this step is less interesting mathematically than the analysis of the case $p = 2$ (cf. lines 412-412 vs. lines 421-423 in Appendix 3). The lower bound construction also crucially relies on the known results. However, the application of the Riesz-Torin theorem is non-trivial (as it invoves introducing a specific multi-linear map), so I think this is a decent contribution, and the paper is worth to be accepted, even in absence of experiments and demonstrated applications of the new results.   My other remarks are minor and mostly refer to the exposition.   First, the authors denote the usual and ordered subsets by the same symbols $I$ and $J$ throughout the text, which is at times quite confuzing, and hindered my verification of the proof of Theorem 1.1 (which I was still able to verify). For example, in lines 123-127, $I$ and $J$ denote the ordered subsets, whil, e.g., in the proof of Lemma 2.3 the same symbols are used for unordered subsets.   Second, the reduction to the cases $p \in \{1,2,\infty\}$ in lines 223-227 is very concise (I had to perform the calculation ad-hoc), as this part of the text was unreadable for me. I urge the authors to improve this part.  Regarding the quality of the text and the exposition, the paper is quite well-written. A few typos:  L194: "The second [to] last"  L417: The factor $2$ in the second term of the right hand side is extraneous, accordingly further down the text. This does not change the argument.  L421: $l$ instead of $t$ in the second line of the display.
