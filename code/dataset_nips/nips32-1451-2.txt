The paper is well written, well motivated and most of the results are stated clearly with well written proofs. I have enumerated my questions and comments below.  Questions and Comments 1. In Ln. 46 the authors say "Unfortunately the loss surface of the problem suffers from spurious local minima and saddle points [12]". [12] doesnt seem to be a correct reference for this fact. Is this fact known? And if yes, can the authors point to a reference for this. 2. (Ln. 70) CUR is undefined. 3. (Ln. 79) I think you mean lower bounded by \Omega(k^{1-2/p}) 4. (Ln. 83) you say there is O(k^{2/p}-1) gap but given your results there seems to be a O(k^{1/p - 1}) gap. 5. Theorem 1.2 is hard for me to understand. Specifically I am not certain I understand what "There exist infinitely many different valyes of k" means here. Do the authors mean for every m there exists a k such that the lower bound holds? 6. (Ln. 126) The dimension of matrix seems non standard, I would prefer if the authors change that to row of the matrix (which is the term that they have used before)  ============Post Author Feedback=============================  I would like to thank the authors for their polite rebuttal and for clarifying my confusion about their lower bound.
