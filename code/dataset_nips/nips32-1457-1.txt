As you described in the paper, there are many studies on the generalization analysis of DNNs, including flatness/sharpness. In these studies, this paper focus on a novel concept of a loss landscape of DNNs. This work may be potentially useful, but the current version provides little explicit motivation for the proposed concept. What is the main contribution of analyzing asymmetric valleys compared with other concepts? What problems does this concept solve that cannot be solved with other theories? For example, flatness typically seems to include asymmetric valleys.
