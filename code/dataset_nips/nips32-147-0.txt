At one level I really like the very cute observation (Theorem 2) presented in the paper and acknowledge that it has potentially interesting implications. On the other hand, I see the following major issues with this work, which makes me feel that it does not rise to the level of a NeurIPS paper.  (a) Very limited generalizability: The findings do not generalize to (i) notions of fairness other than demographic parity (equalized odds is nothing but demographic parity over positively labeled data points), (ii) scenarios where there non-binary sensitive features -- e.g., it is unclear how the observation generalizes to scenarios where there are more than 2 races in a population, (iii) scenarios where the noisy labels deviate from mutual contamination model with constraints (\alpha + \beta < 1)  (b) Notations and definitions are messed up at different places -- E.g., equations (4) and (5) are inconsistent in the way they define the corrupted distribution. equation (1) does not define \Lambda and seems to redefine a loss function already defined before. The loss function with a bar on top in equation (2) is not defined.  (c) Something I did not quite get: In equation (5), \alpha D_{0,.} goes in one way, while (1 - \beta) D_{0,.} goes the other way. But, given that \alpha and \beta don't sum up to 1, what happens to the remaining data points?   (d) Technically, the paper does not have a lot to add. But, the primary contribution of the paper is the cute observation and its application scenarios in practice. I wonder if this paper might be better suited at a conference focussed on the topic.
