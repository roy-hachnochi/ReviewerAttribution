This paper focuses on solving model compression problem with limited labeled data. Taking a pre-prepared large-scale dataset as unlabeled, a handful of data from the original training data as positive, it is an interesting way to select data for the subsequent compression task with the help of a PU classifier.  Robust KD method is used to deal with the noise and the data imbalanced problem. Multi-feature network with attention structure alleviate the dimensionality gap between datasets. This two-step method is clear and efficient, and the experimental results are very impressive.   -----------------------  I am satisfied with the rebuttal.
