 This paper introduces an algorithm for the direct estimation of the difference between two functional graphical models. This work relies on Functional Graphical Models developed by Qiao et al. and theoretical results therein (functional PCA and convergence analysis). The paper is in general written clearly. Theorems and their proofs seem correct. The idea seems novel, at least for FGMs. However, the techniques employed to prove theorems look similar to those in Qiao et al. I do not have a specific comment about the theoretical results, but have some concerns about experiments.  Qiao et al. mentioned that there is a caveat when applying AIC/BIC-based model selection methods: “However, given the complicated functional structure of FGM, it is unclear how to compute the effective degrees of freedom for AIC/BIC.“ But the paper simply chose the parameter “to be the number of edges included in the graph times M^2”. Can you please provide a reference / justification where this is a good choice?  With respect to the experiment for the EEG data (Figure 2), it would be good to compare it to a result based on Qiao et al. In their paper, they presented two graphs, and their edge-differences. However, they didn’t present a result based on ||Theta^X - Theta^Y|| > a threshold. Comparing two methods based on the EEG data (with matching number of different edges) will help readers understand their differences more clearly.  minor comments - Algorithm 1, Initialize \Delta^{0} can be just \Delta since no index is used throughout the algorithm. - max → \max (L143) - maximizing? or minimizing?
