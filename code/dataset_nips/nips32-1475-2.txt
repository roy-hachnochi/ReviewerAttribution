This paper studies the problem of multiclass classification with rejection. The authors firstly survey the confidence-based approach and separation-based approach based on binary classification, and then extend these two kinds of approaches to multi-class cases. For separation-based approach, the authors defined a necessary condition for rejection calibration. For confidence-based approach, they discussed the one-versus-all loss and cross-entropy loss for multi-class cases. The error boundaries of related losses were also analyzed. Some experiments were also implemented. Although this is not the first paper to discuss the problem of mutli-class classification with rejection, the contribution of this paper is that they provide many theoretical analysis and experimental comparison for the related problem, including some theorems and some interesting experimental conclusions. There are many theorems and proofs in Appendix, I just checked two of them and they are all correct. The experiments appeared in the paper and Appendix are also  convinced. I think this paper is useful for the research area of learning with rejection.
