Summary This paper provides a novel perspective to study the generalization of GANs. The author has theoretically and experimentally analyzed the connection between the information leakage and the generalization of GANs.  Strengths 1.    The insight to study the generalization of GAN from the view of privacy protection is very interesting. This work may motivate the following research to study the properties of GANs from the privacy aspect. 2.    The theoretical analysis that employs differential privacy and the stability based theory is insightful 3.    The experiment demonstrates that different Lipschitz regularization techniques can not only reduce information leakage but also improve the generalization ability of GANs. This conclusion is useful to guide the training of GANs in practice.  Weakness 1.    The attack used in this paper is relatively straightforward. The author should evaluate different attack methods and show the experimental results 2.    The theoretical analysis has mentioned the connection between this work and the Bayesian GAN. It is better to demonstrate some evaluations of the information leakage of Bayesian GAN in the experimental section.  Comment after rebuttal: The authors addressed the raised concerns. As pointed out by other reviewers, more advance of theoretical finding is desired.
