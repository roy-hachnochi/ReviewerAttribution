The paper is well-written, clear and approachable. It would be much stronger if it was backed by open-source code since itâ€™s far from solving the problem, and could be improved on in several ways, including ones suggested in the video (temporal modeling). I would also have been interested in the claims that the two models can be trained completely independently, since, in the absence of randomization of the camera and robot setup, it seems unlikely that the system as-is would have learned much robustness to calibration. I understand that stating this may break anonymization, but am I correct to suspect that the robot used was the same one as in [22]? If so, it would be good to address directly the question of whether the two trained models have to be trained on very tightly coupled data or not. POST-REBUTTAL: Thanks to the authors for their responses. I took note that the code and data would be open-sourced, which strongly increase the value of the publication in my POV. I also note that the experiments transferring across robots mitigate my concern about overfitting to that one particular setup. Increasing my confidence level.
