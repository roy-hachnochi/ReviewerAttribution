1.One of the applications for the proposed algorithm may be the case with the zero norm. However, for the zero norm, extensive theoretical analyses have been done, such as matching pursuit, IHT, and StoIHT. Some of them even guarantee perfect support recovery.  Comparing with those algorithms, what are the benefits of the newly-proposed algorithms? Here, first-order stationary points may be far away from the optimal solution when the sparsity regularizer is imposed. It might be interesting to know the property of support recovery for the   proposed algorithms. Or in a more general case, what is the behavior related to the convergence of x_t to the “optimal x^*”? 2. Based on Theorem 5, the proposed algorithm 3 will not converge to a first-order stationary point, since $(\gamma + 4\theta L ) sigma^2 / 2 \theta L |S_1| $ is dependent on batch size |S_1| and |S_1| is upper bounded by data size n ( at least in the finite-sum setting ). In order to make (\gamma + 4\theta L ) sigma^2 / 2 \theta L |S_1| \leq O(\epsilon), |S_1| may need to be larger than n, which is not possible. At least from Theorem 5, this reviewer has problems understanding why it is true for the finite-sum setting in Corrollary 6, which may need further explanation. 3.
