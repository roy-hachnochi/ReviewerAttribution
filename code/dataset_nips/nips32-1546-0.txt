The paper studies the Follow-the-perturbed (FTPL) leader algorithms for multi-armed bandit problems (both stochastic and adversarial).  In the stochastic setting, a unified analysis of FTPL with sub-Weibull perturbations and FTPL with bouded perturbatinos is given in the case of sub-Gaussian arms.  In the adversarial setting, the paper provide a negative result regarding the construction of a FTPL algorithm achieving the optimal $\sqrt{KT}$ regret bound: it asserts that there is no perturbation so that FTPL is equivalent to the optimal INF algorithm. A conjecture, based on extreme-value theory, regarding the form a such an optimal  perturbation is proposed.  Overall, I believe the paper brings several interesting contributions to the study of FTPL algorithms for MAB.
