********* [added after the rebuttal] I have read the reviews of the other reviewers, who did not raise any major concerns, and so the authors' rebuttal wasn't expected to bring any major correction or clarification. Overall I stick to my originally given score. *********  Originality: for the adversarial setting, the paper builds on and significantly extends previous work [1,2]. For the stochastic setting, it seems to be novel. Quality: technically strong, using concepts and methods from different theories, providing several statements with proofs and a conjecture. Clarity: very good, easy to read. Significance: I found the unification ideas of high interest. The problem in the adversarial setting is very hard and the authors showed a mix of negative results and a positive result in a special case.  Minor comments: L52: please specify the range for t (starting at 0 or 1?) L83: after -> before L167: FTRL is not defined until L185 L285: what is the difference between the number of epizodes and the number of iterations (mentioned in Figure 1)? L287: define the algorithm parameters that need tuning L288: B(1,1/2) is not defined
