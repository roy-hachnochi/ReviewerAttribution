This paper proposes a knowledge graph embedding model where entities and relations are represented in the quaternion space - this generalises some recent trends in knowledge graph embeddings where the complex space was being used to overcome the limitations of some existing models [1, 2]. The dependencies between latent features are modeled via the Hamilton product, which seems to encourage more compact interactions between latent features. The model design is sound and, with little added complexity in comparison with other methods (a slightly more convoluted scoring function, and  an uncommon initialisation scheme) the model achieves robust results in comparison with other methods in the literature (see Tab. 4 - although a bit far from SOTA [2]) and the resulting models are fairly parameter efficient (see Tab. 6).  Small issue: "euclidean" should be "Euclidean".  [1] proceedings.mlr.press/v48/trouillon16.pdf [2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07297
