This paper introduces quaternion embeddings for entities and relations in a knowledge graph. Quaternions are vectors in hypercomplex space with 3 imaginary components (2 more than usual complex numbers). It also proposes to use the Hamilton product to score the existence of a triple. Hamilton product are non-commutative which is highly desirable property. Also Hamilton product, represents scaling and smooth rotation and are easier to compose and avoid the problem of gimbal lock. They are also numerically stable when compared to rotational matrices.  The score function is s(e1, r, e2) is defined first by a Hamilton product between e1 and normalized r (to only model rotation), followed by a inner product with e2 to output a scalar score. The paper also shows that both complex embeddings and distmult are special cases of quaternion embeddings.   The paper also gets convincing results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR. The ablation tests are convincing and it has comparable number of parameters wrt the baseline.   Originality: The paper presents a novel way of representing entities and relations Clarity: The paper is well-written and was easy to follow. Significance: the results are significance, and the paper will be impactful.
