Using quaternions seems novel. The experimental results look good too. However, the necessity of quaternions is not very clear, i.e., why more degrees of freedom is needed? And, do quaternions solve the problem in the example of "elder brother"? In the appendix, octonions are considered, but similarly, there is almost no explanation why this is needed. In the conclusion, "good generalization" is mentioned as an advantage, but I did not see any corresponding rigorous argument in this paper.
