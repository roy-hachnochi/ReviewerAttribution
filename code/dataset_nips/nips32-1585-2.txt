The idea of turbo AE is novel as far as I know, and it is interesting. It allows to learn a code of long length. The alternative training process presented in this paper enable us to train both an encoder and a decoder simultaneously. Unfortunately, from the experimental results, advantages (scalability, comparison to the conventional turbo codes) of the proposed scheme  appears not so clear.    I increased the overall score to 7 from 4.
