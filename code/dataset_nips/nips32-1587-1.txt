Watershed is a well known and well studied segmentation procedure in graph theory. Over the last 20 years or so, our understanding of graph-based segmentation procedures have improved tremendously. This paper is an excellent contribution with a detailed stochastic approach that provides new interpretation of some links between watershed and other well-known graph-based procedures.  Another key contribution is the uncertainty evaluation of the provided segmentation. Finally It shows how probabilistic watershed can provide better results by sampling over a larger set of forests.
