This paper proposes a new identification strategy in causal effect estimation on a graph, and the identification strategy generalizes the framework of do-calculus. This paper shows a novel algorithm for searching an identifiable causal effect, which is an NP-hard problem. Authors also show the experimental results and provide their code for reproducing the results. One of the drawbacks of this paper is the complicated notation. For example, authors should define the do-calculus explicitly in their paper even though it is a well-known concept in this field, and we can understand the meaning after reading several pages. In addition to the above drawback, I could not understand the intuition of the rules of calculus. I think that authors should provide a more intuitive explanation about the each rule to justify them.
