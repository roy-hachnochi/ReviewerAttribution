I think that this paper is a solid extension of masked language model pre-training to image-and-text (e.g., captioning) tasks.  It defines two novel but intuitive pre-training tasks for this scenario: (i) predicting the semantic class of masked image regions given the surrounding image regions (from the same image) and the corresponding text, (ii) predicting whether image and text pairs are aligned.   They demonstrate significant improvements over both the previous SOTA and the strong baseline of simply using a pre-trained text-only BERT model. They also show that having two encoders (with different parameters), one for images and one for text, is superior to a joint encoder.  I would have liked to have seen more ablation of the pre-training tasks, since I think that this is more interesting than the model depth ablation that the authors performed.  I think that the biggest weakness of the paper is that all of the experiments were pre-trained on Conceptual Captions and then evaluated on other image captioning (or closely related tasks). So effectively this can also be thought of as transfer learning from a large captioning data set to a small one, which is well-known to work. It would have been nice to see what the results could be with just image and text data without correspondences, as an additional ablation.  The paper does have significant overlap with VideoBERT, but since the work is concurrent I don't think it's fair to penalize this paper because VideoBERT was uploaded to Arxiv first, so I did not factor that in.
