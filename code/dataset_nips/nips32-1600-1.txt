Thanks the authors for the feedback. After a long discussions with the other reviewers, I maintain the positive review. But I agree with reviewer 1 in the sense that the authors should put significant amount of efforts in improving the presentation of the main results. Specifically, a crystal clear high level roadmap for the results should be added.   -------------------------------------------------Original Comments-----------------------------------   It appears to me that the contribution of the work is pretty solid. One (possibly minor) technical question, is the algorithm EBF computationally efficient? Is it possible to leverage EVI alike technique to efficiently execute this step?  The quality of writing needs to be improved. For example,   1. Definition 4 is not sound, it is required that all te_k and ts_k to be defined w.r.t. L. 2. in line 142, why would the sum of reg be O(\sqrt{N})?  Many more can be found throughout the paper.  There is also some misleading parts in the related works section, for example, it has been pointed out in many places that [Bartlett and Tewari 09] contains some mistakes.
