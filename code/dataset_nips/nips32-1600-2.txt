I do understand that it is important to demonstrate the existence of algorithms achieving the regret lower bound while they may require some non-trivial cost or assumption. However, my major concern is the intractable complexity of the proposed algorithms, and thus the absence of the evaluation in canonical cases. As the lower bound is defined in a mini-max sense, achieving the mini-max lower bound does not guarantee efficiency in canonical cases with moderate sub-optimality gap. Hence, it would be helpful if a performance guarantee in terms of the sub-optimality gap is provided.  Minor comments/questions:  - In my understanding, Jaksch et al.'s lower bound is built upon no prior knowledge on the bias function. Is it possible to obtain similar lower bound under the assumption that the upper bound analysis requires?  - According to [Agarwal and Jia 17], Lemma C.1 is an extension of results in [Osband and Van Roy 16]. Does it mean the result of [Osband and Van Roy 16] is untrue?  - Is it possible to translate the upper bounds for the finite-horizon MDPs?  - line 38: impossible  - line 89: wrong reference?  - Have you contacted the authors of [Agarwal and Jia 17] about the errors in their lemmas? I'm not very sure if someone else's mistake should be pointed out in this way.
