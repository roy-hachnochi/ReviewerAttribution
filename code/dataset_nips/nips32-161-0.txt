Strengths: The paper is clearly written and easy to follow. The author established several unimprovable variance bounds under specific assumptions. The property is appealing, though the smooth constants for most functional families are difficult to compute. The subsampling trick may be useful or be able to generalize to infinite some of functions.   Weaknesses:  1. The problem discussed in this paper is relatively straightforward, even it is targeted for black box variational inference. The overall discussed topic is still relying on the existence of affine mapping for location scale distributed latent variables. The more general reparameterization trick has been discussed in [12] and "Implicit reparameterization gradients (NIPS 2018)". I admit there is no error in this manuscript, but I think that a thorough analysis for more challenging task would meet the acceptance bar of NIPS venue.    2. In the experimental section, only two toy models (Baysian linear and logistic regression) are considered. I understand the experiments are supportive to verify the variance bound proposed in this paper. However, in order to recognize the value of this work, I would like to see at least one additional experiment with amortized variational inference, such as a simple VAE whose bound may be easy to calculate.
