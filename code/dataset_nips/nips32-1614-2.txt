This paper modifies the primal-dual form of EXTRA and shows the linear convergence of the algorithm under certain assumptions, which partially closes the gap between decentralized algorithms and centralized algorithms with the presence of the non-smooth term in theory. It also extends the convergence results of EXTRA under a stronger assumption. The proof is concise and correct.  One drawback is the strong assumption it builds on. It would be helpful if this assumption can be removed or weakened.
