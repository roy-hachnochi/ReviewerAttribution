The authors begin with a survey of the related work which is a good representative of the current work in this area. I like their first process control experiment as it clearly lays out what is being achieved, with respect to conventional state of the art (i.e., not just the last few years' DRL papers). I would like to have better understood how well the proposed algorithms would fare by also looking at a baseline with the true models. This would tell us not just the improvements from below, but the upper envelopes in this setup.  I find that the experiments have explored the factors of variations suitably, within the confines of the environment within which they are setup. One major source of model uncertainty, in the real world, is uncertainty in the environment (both epistemic and aleatory). It is not yet clear to me how this method could cope with that, and that would be a helpful experiment.
