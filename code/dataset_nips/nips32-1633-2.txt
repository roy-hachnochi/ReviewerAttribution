Originality: The denoising autoencoder regularized trajectory optimization is a novel method to deal with the adversarial effect with the learned dynamic model in the model-based RL framework. Instead of investigating new ways to learn the dynamic model, this paper tries to improve the performance and sample efficiency from the trajectory optimization regularization point of view, which is interesting and nice try.   Quality: The quality of the paper is good. The only concern I have is about the experimental evaluations. The chosen tasks are relatively simple, the implementation of the more complex experiments are expected. Also, a comparison to more algorithms would be useful.  The method of [Ha & Schmidhuber] is an important work in the field of model-based RL, the comparison to world model is encouraged to include. I understand that the problem set up in the current submission is different to world model. However, the dynamic model learning method should also affect the performance, which is not discussed in the paper. Thus, the model learning method in [Ha & Schmidhuber] (VAE-based model) or some other methods, is encouraged to try in the implementation of your model learning part.   [Ha & Schmidhuber] David Ha and Jurgen Schmidhuber. World models. arXiv: 1803.10122, 2018.   Clarity: The paper is well written and organized, and it is easy to understand.    Significance: The applicability of model-based RL is on the premise that the dynamic of environment is learned accurately. However, we all know that the approximation of the environment is challenging especially in the complex real-world problem. This paper tries to mitigate this bottleneck problem of model-based RL methods from a different view, which is with great significance. It is nice to see more real-world applications of the proposed method.   ****=======**** I have read the author response. I have to clarify that my concerns is not on dynamics models, but on the dynamic model learning method. Although most of my concerns are responded, I still think that more comparative discussion with other dynamic model learning approaches are necessary.
