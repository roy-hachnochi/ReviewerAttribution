The issue that I found with the paper is regarding the initial formalization of the approach. I mean the technical details. It is really poor. Indeed it takes only three quaters of Page 3. I have also some concerns about the exposition of the paper.  The terms like "behavioural cloning", "V-Trace", "historical policy distribution" and so on.   I am also confused by the lack of interpretation of the empirical results. One can indeed all kinds of combinations and plot the results. But it does not add any value unless one can technically interpret the behaviour. That aspect is lacking in the paper. One needs to come up with some basic justification for the kind of plasticity or stability or robustness achieved in the results.
