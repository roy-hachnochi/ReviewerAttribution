In general I like the paper. The definition of activation regions is sound and it makes intuitive sense. The empirical evaluations are also well thought out.   Specific comments:   The authors state that usually there is no distinction between activation and linear regions. The way activation regions are defined in the paper, there is no reason to believe the two to be identical. Along the same lines, the fact that one is a union of the other (Lemma 3) is expected.   While I understand and buy into the definition of an activation region, I think more intuition would be helpful. For example, why it suffices that A is arbitrary, why -1 to the power of a_z, etc.   In (3), activation regions is not defined. I believe it is the union of individual activation regions.   Line 39: it's unclear what is T at this point. It should be added: for a constant T.   Theorem 5: conditions 1 and 2 should be simply restated as continuous RVs.   Line 177: two heuristics for the second (5) - there is just one (5)  In 3.2, the intuition is a little bit too shaky. Between "many times" and O(1) there are many options in between. In other words, if something is not 'many times' I would not conclude that it is O(1).   F_learn is vaguely introduced, but no further discussion is provided. I find this confusing and suggest to remove the references to this set.   There was work in the last ICML (Long Beach) on linear regions. If it is not cited, it should be added and discussed.
