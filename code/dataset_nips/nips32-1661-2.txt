The paper contributes an extension to GECO which admits a hierarchical prior   p(z) = \int p(zeta)p(z|zeta) \dd{zeta}  whose likelihood is intractable. The motivation for such a prior is to combat posterior collapse and enable better disentanglement.   The authors then design an importance-weighted upperbound on KL(q(z|x) || p(z)) by lowerbounding log p(z) using samples from an importance distribution q(zeta|z).  GECO as well as REWO (the proposed variant) rely on constrained optimisation, where the constraint is replaced by a weighted penalty, whose weight (the Lagrange multiplier lambda) is optimised via SGD. In this paper the authors propose a modification of the update for lambda that promotes convergence to a proper ELBO whenever the constraint is satisfied. The constraint corresponds to a pre-specified expected reconstruction loss.  The novelty is in the combination of techniques (GECO + importance weighted bounds) and the different update rule for the Lagrange multiplier.  I found the paper quite clear though the argumentation is sometimes a bit too informal (see for example, lines 123--131, where authors list merits of the technique--perhaps justified empirically---which are hard to predict from design choices alone).
