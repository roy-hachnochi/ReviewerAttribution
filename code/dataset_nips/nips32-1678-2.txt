The authors describe a novel method for Bayesian optimization in discrete input spaces. The method is based on using combinatorial graphs and their graph Laplacing to specify a covariance function for a Gaussian process. An efficient implementation is described.  Quality:  The proposed method is of high quality: well-motivated, with significant theory and validated through an exhaustive series of experiments.  Clarity:  The paper is very well written and easy to read.  Originality:  The proposed method is novel up to my knowledge. This is the first time that a method based on combinatorial graphs is applied to the problem of Bayesian optimization with discrete inputs.  Significance:  The contribution is highly significant. The proposed method is shown to be clearly better than existing baselines in exhaustive experiments. The approach respresents a new way of solving Bayesian optimization problems in discrete spaces.
