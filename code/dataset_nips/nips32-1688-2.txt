The paper builds on the existing idea of lazy training. where the authors give new insights using the idea about the existance of an implicit scale that controls this phenomenon. This is an interesting idea, nevertheless it feels that they should expand more on this. Technically, the paper is not strong, it feels more like an experimental paper. The idea is novel, I am not sure about the importance of it at this point.   ================================================== After rebuttal: I am still not convinced about the significance of this contribution (which is not technical for sure). I keep my score as it is.
