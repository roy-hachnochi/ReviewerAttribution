Update after the rebuttal:  I stand by my review and rating. The additional experiments and explanations in the rebuttal largely clarify the concerns I had.  --- The paper proposes an approach to improving training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on images. The idea is to use regularizers based on image-specific similarity metrics (SSIM, NIQE). The method is evaluated on non-progressive GANs trained on three datasets: CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA. The proposed method seems to substantially improve FID and IS relative to baselines.  Pros: 1) Reasonable and, to my knowledge, new idea. 2) Quite clear and complete presentation 3) The results are good, both qualitatively and quantitatively, especially in terms of FID. 4) Extensive supplementary material with many details and extra results.  Cons: 1) Not a huge technical innovation, but a rather incremental modification based on existing techniques. 2) Some questionable statements: - The usage of SSIM as loss function has been limited (Section 3). It definitely has been used in many works, one example is [1] below. - Boundedness to [-1, 1] immediately renders SSIM an invalid distance metric (sec. 3.1) - why?  - Why does d^Q serve as a good candidate for regularizing GANs?

I think the paper can be published.
