The paper is well written, with emphasis to follow the main results and the implications. Some questions for clarification below:  1. What is the intuition for the choice of this reparametrization ? Is it the reparametrization which leads to sparse of the solutions  or the choice of the free parameters ?   2. Though the authors mention the existing works on implicit L2 regularization, it would be interesting (and self-contained) to contrast the implicit L2 vs the L1 regularisation in terms of the algorithms and the results.   3. What are the possibilities of extensions of these sparse recovery towards structured sparse ones ?  Minor comments / typos: 1. Algorithm 2, step 2. Duplicate notations for â€˜mâ€™, being used as a scaling factor (scalar) as well as a vector.  2. Line 181. Maximum noise term w*_max ? 3. Line 243. Constat -> constant
