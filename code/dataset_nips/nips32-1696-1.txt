The paper's introduction is well written, the structure is also good. However, some important points could be made more clear, for example: 1. line 164-165: Where did you show the corresponding optimization path contains sparse solutions? Is the entire path sparse or it is only sparse at some iterations? It will help the reader if some more intuitions behind the algorithm could be provided. 2. Some notations in the main results should be clearly defined. For example, w*_{max} is the largest entry of w*. 3. The growth condition for dimension d with respect to n?
