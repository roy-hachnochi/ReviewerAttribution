The paper proposes to use integral/summed observations within the Gaussian process framework. For regression, the outcome of this model is neat because all operators are linear. The paper is clear in its presentation, except for a few points listed below.  1, In terms of originality, the paper is a useful application of block kriging and Murray-Smith [35]. However, the paper currently lack references to and discussions on these two works. In additional, eq (4) is an instance of the linear mode of coregionalisation, and references to this is missing.   2, The paper uses numerical approximation of integrals for integral observations (line 198). This is a practical and common approach. However, it'll be contribute to the paper significantly if the authors can propose an alternative, given that this paper is primarily about integral observations.  3. In the experiment, the observations are rates, but the paper uses a regression model. A warp GP model or a more appropriate likelihood would be more appropriate.  4. The experiment compares SAGP with GPR, 2-stage GP and SLFM. I am not clear the relevance of comparing with SLFM. It'll be better if the paper can have a more thorough comparison with 2-stage GP instead, for example, by examining the variances of the predictions and also the significance of the learned hyper-parameters and perhaps also the computational time complexity of the two methods.  Clarity points 1. Line 125: Is the domain "a set of cities" rather than just "a city"? 2. Line 302: It is not clear how the transfer learning across multiple cities is achieved. Are these just treated as different locations? In this case, the correlation between data from the two cities would be very minute, unless there is a significant long-scale component in the (stationary) covariance function.
