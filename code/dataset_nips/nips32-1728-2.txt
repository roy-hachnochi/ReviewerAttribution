Originality The task being addressed is in fact quite novel and also well motivated. Acquiring dense pose annotations in video could be tedious and time-consuming. This provides a strong case for studying pose estimation from sparsely labeled videos.  Quality The methodology is technically sound. Evaluation on PoseTrack2017 is compared with proper recent approaches. The results might be more complete if the paper could add some ablation study on the proposed network architecture.  Clarity Overall the idea and results are clearly exposed. It could be helpful to add a more rigorous description on deformable convolutions (L119-121).  Significance The paper demonstrates three important tasks with the proposed technique (1, 2, 3 in the last block), which shows the wide applicability of the technique.  ---Post Rebuttal Feedback--- The rebuttal does not change my view, which has been positive initially.
