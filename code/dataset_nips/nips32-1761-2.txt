Originality: The paper deals with a well established problem and answers an open problem. It does so not just by analysing online algorithms but primarily through graph partitioning, which seems novel for the problem of cooperating agents.   The algorithm (and notation!) for the bandit part of the paper is a direct continuation of the work of Cesa-Bianchi on cooperating agents, but it is the papers main focus to answer the open problem posed in that paper.  Quality: Though proofs have not been checked, the paper seems sound. The approaches and analyses are well explained in the main text.   Clarity: Though the technical material is well covered through lemmas in the main text, the paper is not well written as such. The are several places where it is not polished, and phrasings such as "... sharing of information makes perfect sense." (p. 1, l. 31) which are of little scientific value.   In terms of improving on the cooperative setting, it is stated in the conclusion that the new bound implies the bound of Cesa-Bianchi. This should be explicit in the form of a corollary.   Significance: As stated before, the problem is well motivated in literature and in general there is currently a significant interest in online learning on graphs.    In general the paper has a very nice self contained scope, dealing with a single problem while still putting in significant amounts of new work.  Especially the non technical part require a thorough review in the camera ready version.  ==== After the author response: The authors have promised to address my concern in the camera ready version, but exactly how is not made explicit yet. My (accepting) score stands.
