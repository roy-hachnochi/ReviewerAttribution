I think overall this paper is a good contribution. The Bayesian and the frequentist analysis for the TS-MNL algorithm is novel. Especially the frequentist analysis builds on recently proposed proof techniques in [2,4] (for linear contextual bandits) and extends it to the MNL problem. The frequentist regret bounds matches the corresponding bounds in the linear case. I have a few concerns and it would be great if the authors can correct/respond to them:  1. Concerns: Lines 142-144 is confusingly written. y_{t,i} is supposed to belong in {0,1} as noted before. It is better to write that the y vector is sampled from the multi-nomial logit distribution given by equation below line 140, rather the sub-gaussianity based description where it seems like y_{t,i} can take values in [0,1], even though it is technically correct.    Assumption 1 actually says that x_{t,i} is actually i.i.d. This should be clarified before in the paper, as there are multiple mentions of x_{t,i} varying over time. It should be clarified that the distribution is i.i.d.  Line 4 in the algorithm: I think the monte-carlo sampling scheme should be discussed in more details in the body of the paper. Also, how does this approximate sampling the theoretical or practical regret performance of the algorithm, needs to be discussed. The exact details of the markov chains construction are missing from the appendix as well.   Line 201: There is no needs to use the term oracle if a polynomial time algorithm exists to solve the problem exactly. You can just refer to the algorithm (I am just commenting on the usage of the term oracle). It would also be appreciated if the computational complexity of the said algorithm is revealed in the discussion.   Add a list of differences from [6] earlier in the paper.   A little more details about the experimental setup is needed for the main body of the paper. For example, which algorithm was used as the optimization algorithm for line 5 in the algorithm.   The real experiments are essentially semi-synthetic. A model is learnt from the actual dataset and then that model is used as the ground truth parameter.  Can you think of a better evaluation method?    Typos: Line 24 -- exploitation-exploitation trade-off -> exploration-exploitation trade-off Line 24-25 -- there are epoch/epsilon greedy strategies as well Line 136: and and -> and
