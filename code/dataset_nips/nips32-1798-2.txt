This is a solid paper. The model studied in the paper is well-motivated and has many applications. I found the example of hiring ML researchers in the introduction very helpful. It provides a clear description and motivation of the model.  I like the equivalence between DTV and MaxSep. In particular, it implies that the principal’s optimal policy has a simple form: just binary classify the signals into “good” and “bad” then count the number of “good” signals to decide whether the distribution is good. Even though the principal can use much more complex policies, it is surprising that the optimal policy has such an intuitive form.
