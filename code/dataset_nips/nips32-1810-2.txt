Originality: Novel.  The proposed approach is novel in utilizing the idea of output space gradient descent in making sure it is permutation-invariant. Although similar ideas has been adopted in some other scenarios such as other generative model problems, this idea has not yet been formally generalized and applied to set prediction problems. So I believe this paper has sufficient novelty.  Quality: High quality.  1. The paper solves an important problem which hasn't been well studied by the community. Set prediction is a very interesting problem which has lots of potential applications such as object detection, relationship detection, etc.  2. The paper is very well written. The experimental validation is convincing which shows that the proposed method is promising. However, more set prediction baselines would be even helpful.  Clarity: Very clear.  The paper is very well written and clear. It is a pleasure to read the paper. I think the paper very carefully organized and structured which can keep a readerâ€™s interests throughout the whole paper.   Significance: Significant and inspiring.  I believe the paper has great significance. The two major ideas can potentially inspire a lot of researchers in this area: (1) the idea of conducting optimization over the output space to achieve a task and (2) the idea of gradient descent in the output space keeps permutation invariance. The experiments prove such idea is promising although they can be further improved. But I think beating the state-of-the-art is not the main goal of this paper given its other intellectual contribution.
