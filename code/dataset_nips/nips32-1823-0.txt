1- The messages exchanged are a bunch of floats. What these messages  mean or represent, and how agents can make sense of them looks currently as black  magic. There's a lack of explainability, and intuition of "but somehow  it works, so..." with no analysis of the messages meaning. 2- The way the "confidence level" of an agent is computed is somewhat naive. 3- Equation 1 is unclear: which variance exactly is computed? The  variance between agents' messages or the variance of the messages coming  from one agent? 4- The environment chosen (StarCraft) seems adequate, and results are convincing. 5- I found the interpretations offered by the authors of the strategies  developed by the agents while communicating interesting and welcome.
