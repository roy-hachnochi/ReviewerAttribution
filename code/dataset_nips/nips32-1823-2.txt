The paper is well written and easy to read. I very much enjoyed reading the paper.  1. Line 151: an individual agent can access the global observation and global history only through the conditioned messages. Is that right? If so, please make it explicit for better clarity.  2. Line 154: The fact that the combiner is just doing element wise addition can also be motivated as each agent trying to pass the message which could be the value of each action from that agentâ€™s point of view. This could also motivate the variance based control loss because when there is not much variance in the message, then that agent do not have any preference over which action to choose and hence its message can be safely ignored.  3. It is not clear whether the communication protocol is used during the training or only during the testing time. I assume that you are using the same communication protocol even during training. Please explain this.  I did not verify the correctness of the proof.  ##########################################################  Originality: The paper proposes a novel variance based loss to reduce communication overhead in a MARL setting.   Quality: The work is good enough to be accepted at NeurIPS.  Clarity: The paper is well written. I have given few comments above to improve the clarity in the presentation.  Significance: Definitely a significant contribution to MARL.  ######################################################  Minor comments:  1. Line 232: derivation -> deviation.
