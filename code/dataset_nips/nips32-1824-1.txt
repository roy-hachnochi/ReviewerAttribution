The core of the method is the interaction between the learner and the falsifier. The learner minimizes the Lyapunov risk, defined as the maximum violation of the Lyapunov stability condition over the state space. The falsifier solves a non-linear constraints feasibility problem where it tries to find a state that violates the Lyapunov stability criterion given the current Lyapunov function and controller. Due to the delta-completeness of the falsifier, if no such example can be found, the controller is guaranteed to stabilize the system.  The originality of the work is not clearly defined. In the related work section, the authors mention other works that use NN to learn Lyapunov functions as well as other works that use similar learner-falsifier frameworks which use the same non-linear constraint solver to learn controllers for non-linear systems. As such, it is not easy to assess the novelty of the paper.  The clarity of the work could be improved. The authors use a good amount of space to report things that do not really give an insight into the paper while they introduce central concepts in just a few lines. For example, the authors unroll the definition of Lyapunov falsification constraints in example 1 for a simple NN and a simple controller and they report the numerical values of the entire matrices learned by their method in section 4. In my opinion, these do not help to understand the paper better. On the other hand, the authors do not introduce the constraint solving problem. Moreover, they mention that solving such a problem is NP-hard as it involves the global minimization of a highly non-convex function but they do not explain or give an intuition on how the delta-complete algorithm can deal with this.  The problem of finding complex non-linear Lyapunov functions together with the controllers for which they can guarantee stability is very important to the community and, therefore, this is a relevant paper.
