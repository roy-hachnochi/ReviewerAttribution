The paper provides the first O(1)-competitive algorithm for facility location in adversarial arrival and departure model with reasonable recourse and update time.  The algorithm works by showing that the optimum solution can not change dramatically: ignoring a static multiplicative factor of 2, one can show that deleting a client can decrease the cost by at most f, and adding a client can increase the cost by at most f.  This way, one can divide the algorithm into phases: if at the beginning of a phase, the cost is Theta, then we can afford to run the algorithm for roughly Theta/f  steps using trivial operations. Then at the end of each phase, we can recompute the solution from scratch.   The algorithm for k-median/k-means is more complicated, since a single client can change the cost of the optimum solution dramatically.  Thus, the algorithm can not achieve small recourse; the main focus on k-median/k-means is the update-time.  The algorithm in the paper works by maintaining a small corset (for each guessed optimum value) that contains a good set of centers.  The algorithm works in phases of k-steps. Inside each phase it only performs simple operations to the corsets.  At the end of each phase, the corsets will be recomputed.   The algorithm for the facility location problem is well written. However, I could not see the details of the algorithm and the analysis for the algorithm for k-median/k-means due to the writing style. In particular, I am confused with the procedure ``Delete point'' (see comments later); there is no intuition for this part at all. One reason is that the pieces of the algorithm are split in a somewhat arbitrary way into two parts: the main file and supplementary material.  Moreover, there are some inconsistency of notations and typos.  More details: there are many places in the supplementary material whether the authors used R_t, R^t_i and R_i.  In the algorithm, should there only be R^t_i?   In the Algorithm, DeltePoint, t_ell is an index for time and i is a time point between t_ell and |X| (indeed, this is a bad notation since i is used for something else). I am confused with the variable x_i.  In the problem setting, x_i is the client that arrives or departs at time i. The total number of time steps so far is n, and the set of current clients is X.  Then, what does the set {x_t, x_{t+1}, ...., x_|X|} represent?  In the second column of figures for empirical analysis, the orange line is so think (is this a bug) that I can not see the blue line.
