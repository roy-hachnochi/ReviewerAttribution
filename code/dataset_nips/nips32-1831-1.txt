Originality: The paper appears to be original.  Quality: Good empirical results. It is reassuring that multiple instantiations of the model perform well and very valuable to show these results for different variations.  Clarity: This paper is very clearly written and has excellent organisation.  Significance: The authors provided a "simple" (yet powerful) implementation of their model, that is competitive with baseline models and may be a strong foundation for future work.
