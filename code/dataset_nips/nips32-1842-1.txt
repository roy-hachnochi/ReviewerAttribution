This submission aims to meta learn curvature estimations such that it will lead to better generalization than Hessian or Fisher-information matrix.  In terms of writing, this work is well written.  A concern is I couldnâ€™t find how is equation (10) leads to better generalization, since the second term in equation (10) is a weighted gradient on validation dataset, the weights reflect the similarity between gradient of training loss and test loss but do not link to generalization directly.
