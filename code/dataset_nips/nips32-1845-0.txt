4) Originality: The background is extensive and clearly position the proposed methods in relation to the previous techniques used in the field. The proposed estimators are a combination of well-known estimators. The obtained estimators achieve boundedness and stability properties of SNIS and the consistency and local efficiency of DR methods. To my knowledge, the proposed estimators are the only estimators having all these properties.  5) Clarity: The math of this submission is fairly involved, but it remains accessible for non-experts. The submission is clearly written and introduced every definition needed to understand the contribution. The notation is consistent and not overly complex.  6) Quality: The contribution is technically sound. The results for the RL experiments show good improvements over the baselines.  7) Significance: I believe that the methods proposed in this work are likely to be built upon by the community. Specifically, off-policy RL methods rely extensively on OPE methods and such an improvement could lead to more efficient algorithms.   Conclusion: I believe this work should be accepted given all the properties of the proposed estimators that were not satisfied by existing estimators. Furthermore, the OPE results on CB and particularly RL are convincing.
