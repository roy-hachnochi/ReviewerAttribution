Advantages: 1. The proposed framework subsumes most previous fairness notions. It can potentially help identify, analyze and compare new fairness notions.   2. The proposed bounding method is simple and makes sense.   3. The paper is clear and easy to follow.    Weakness:  1. There are many limitations of the proposed method. The proposed method assumes that the causal graphical is given. Also, the values must be discrete.   2. It would be good to show how to use the proposed method to achieve fair policy learning without "severely damaging the performance of predictive model".   3. It would be great to discuss why the fairness bound achieved by the proposed method is tighter compared with previous methods.  Minor issues: line 17 irrespective their -> irrespective of their line 240 to find -> to finding  Should the the numbers in Table 3 CE #of o 4 be bold?  The bound of the proposed method is tighter than previous methods.
