The authors attempt to unify different definitions of counterfactual fairness frameworks by characterizing them as appropriate conditioning along specific causal pathways. The main unification is simple. However, the primary contribution appears to be a method to bound the fairness effect under the unified definition of path-specific counterfactual fairness by parameterizing the causal model appropriately and mapping the estimation to a constrained optimization.   A few things were not clear in this parametrization process. For example the composition in Line 168 only becomes clear later in the examples. In terms of originality, although the method is computationally intense (requiring response variables that scale exponentially as the node degrees), the contribution and originality are useful as they attempt to bound fairness in unidentifiable situations as well.  Quality - The paper is technically sound although a lot more description could have been moved and/or included in supplementary material which only includes code and data as of now. This affects clarity of the paper from time to time. The related work seems adequately cited and compared to.  Significance - The method is severly limited as it only works for discrete variables and as the authors note, the domain sizes of the response variables can grow significantly and quickly. While they address this to some extent, it is not clear how generalizable this method is to continuous case at all. Nevertheless it is an important contribution to counterfactual fairness literature.
