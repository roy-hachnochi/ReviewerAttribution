This paper takes a reasonable approach the task, and the results do appear competitive with state of the art methods.  The authors must clarify which parts of their approach constitute novel contributions as opposed to existing technology. In particular, Section 3.1, appears to contain the same content as Section 3.1 in Neighborhood Consensus Networks by Rocco et al.. Equation (1) is copied verbatim. While this work is cited as [13] in other sections of the submission, it is **not** mentioned in Section 3.1. A citation as well as discussion must be added. In addition, I would like the authors to clarify this point and make clear their contributions.  The proof that the learned displacement field is smooth needs requires some clarification. While it defers to the universal approximation theorem and regularization techniques, these claims do not constitute a proof. Additional discussion and empirical results would be necessary to support the smoothness claim.  The authors provide only a few qualitative results and do not discuss failure cases. This would be necessary to better evaluate the work.  Minor comments:  13: "is prov*en*" 112: "further *amplify*" 118, 129: commas should be on the same line as the euqations 120-121: some more intuition on the normalization of the correlation tensor would be helpful 147: "trivially prove*n*" 148: "dose" --> "does" 217: "correspondence*s*"
