 The paper considers an important and critical societal matter and is well-written.   Personalized interventions are ideal in cases where everyone has access to the same resources, but resources are limited and intervention on one’s treatment may impact interventions on other individuals in the population. In other words, decisions may interfere with each other. This has been studied in this recent paper:  https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/ScheduleMultitrack?event=4860.   Also, fair personalized intervention has been considered in this paper:  https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/ScheduleMultitrack?event=5183  where the setting is very similar to the one being considered in this paper (offline optimal policy learning under fairness constraints).   I was wondering what the authors’ thoughts are on these two papers? and how limited resources impact their disparate impact metrics?
