Specifically considering the setting where model provides a score that can then be used later in making a decision is novel to my knowledge. The paper is clearly written and introduces an original criterion that can also be generalised to non-binary decisions. Ultimate significance of this style of work remains uncertain - it is arguable that eventually such investigations must shift to the discussions of applicable fairness criteria in certain specific situations, e.g. credit scoring, video recommendation, search result ranking etc, with concrete guidance for practice.
