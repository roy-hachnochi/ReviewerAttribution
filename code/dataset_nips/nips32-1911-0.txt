The paper is technically strong, but it has some weaknesses in terms of the motivation and nomenclature.  Firstly, I am not sure that 'capacity-bounded' makes intuitive sense for this definition, as there appears to be no direct link to capacity-like properties of the underlying function classes.  ** Section 3  It is a bit unclear why $\cal{H}$ corresponds to some kind of adversary assumptions. In particular the statement 120-121 seems vacuous. If it is intended to offer an explanation of why $\cal{H}$ is a good way to represent adverary capabilities it fails. For the example given, why wouldn't an adversary just be able to perform a simple hypothesis test for $P$ versus $Q$, rather than be restricted to (2) ? The definition itself is very interesting technically, but the connection to adversary capabilities is far from apparent. Is the implication of e.g. a linear $\cal{H} that an adversary would be calculating a linear distinguisher between two possible neighbouring datasets? Why couldn't the adversary just use simulation and rely on $\cal{H}$ instead? Why wouldn't the adversary have access to the output of the cb-DP algorithm?   ** Section 4  The properties in Section 4 are essential for a new definition to be of potential use, so they are in a sense the core part of the paper.  ** Section 5  This gives us a couple of simple mechanisms as examples. While not essential, this is a useful section, that would perhaps have been nicely complemented by a small experimental result.  ** Section 6  Here we have a generalisation bound, as well as an inequality extension to the restricted setting, which is also of potential general use.  ** Appendix:  Proof of Theorem 2, l. 459, step 4: The concavity claim is a bit strange for step 4. Wouldn't it be the case that for $Z = \lambda A + (1 - \lambda) B$, \[ E_Z [f^*] = \lambda E_A [f^*]+ (1 - \lambda) E_B [f^*] \] Just as in the previous line? I fail to see either a logarithm or a term which involves the expectation of a convex combination, i.e. \[ E[\lambda f + (1 - \lambda) g] \leq \lambda E[f] + (1 - \lambda) E[g], \] so step 4 should be an equality?
