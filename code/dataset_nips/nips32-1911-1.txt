I have read the rebuttal. I think my concerns around the benefits and the threat model still remain. While I think it is definitely interesting to investigate various relaxations of differential privacy, in this case I do not see the clear utility benefits of using this weaker capacity bounded differential privacy notion. --------------- The paper presents capacity bounded differential privacy â€“ a relaxation of differential privacy against adversaries in restricted function classes. This definition satisfies standard privacy axioms (such as convexity, post-processing invariance, and composition), and in the case where the adversary is limited to linear class in some cases it permits mechanisms that have higher utility.    I think the overall the idea of capacity bounded differential privacy is neat. My main concern with the paper is that the paper does not make it obviously clear the benefits of using this relaxed privacy definition. At this point it feels that the risks (in terms of possible privacy breach) of using this relaxation outweighs the potential benefits. Unless this issue is addressed it is unclear to evaluate the potential impact of this definition.
