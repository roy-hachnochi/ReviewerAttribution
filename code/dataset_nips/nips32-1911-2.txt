The paper is extremely well organized, building up towards the (reasonably complex) definition without getting bogged down in technical details. The new relaxation of differential privacy is based on the variational interpretation of f-divergence, where the set of distinguishers is restricted to a particular functional class.  My main concern is that any definition is only as good as it captures any desirable properties of the resulting construction. In the security domain (of which privacy is a part), new definitions are justified by presenting a security threat model where they somehow capture the adversary's capabilities.  What is the threat model where the privacy adversary is limited to a class like linear functions?  The submission offers two answers to this question. First, it considers an adversary that is itself an ML model of some restricted concept class. Second, it hypothesizes that the analyst may be contractually bound to perform only certain classes of computations. The main problem here is that the definition - as the submission correctly observes - is not closed under post-processing. In other words, once the (ML or contractually bound) adversary does its computation, _its_ output can be observed and processed by someone else, without restrictions imposed by the definition.  The new definition does lead to better parameters at the expense of a stricter security model. The submission analyzes two basic mechanisms, Laplace and Gaussian, and compares their parameters for the same target level of Renyi DP (RDP). According the plots, RDP against the restricted adversary _improves_ for higher orders. (The standard RDP is monotone in the order.) This is an illustration of how different, and tricky, the new definition is.
