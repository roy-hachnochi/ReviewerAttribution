# Strengths  - A clear demonstration of a failure case of current BVI methods.  BVI variants potentially offer a powerful extension to classical mean-field based VI approaches. However the authors can show both empirically as well as theoretically that they can fail even when the true posterior is part of the family of approximating distributions, demonstrating the necessity for further improvements on prior work.  - Switch to Hellinger is well motivated in itself and especially in the BVI context.  The switch to the Hellinger distance from the more common KL divergence allows the authors to overcome these problems and is well introduced and motivated.  - Strong theoretical evaluation  Throughout the paper the authors present a strong theoretical evaluation of their proposed method. Through a series of propositions which are proofed in great detail in the appendix a variety of bounds and convergences are given supporting the claims.   # Weaknesses  - Weak empirical evaluation  The empirical evaluation of the proposed method is limited to mostly synthetic datasets that serve well to demonstrate the qualitatively different behaviour to earlier BVI approaches. However apart from these synthetic experiments the experimental section is rather limited in scope. A wider range on real world datasets would be desirable and further improve the quality of the paper if the authors can show that the theory performs also well in the practical application.     # Recommendation  Apart from the experimental section which could be improved, the paper is overall clearly written, motivated and on the threoretical side well evaluated. I therefore recommend acceptance.
