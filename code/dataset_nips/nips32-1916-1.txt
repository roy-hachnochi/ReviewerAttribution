This work is an extension of a work by S. Mei et al. that looks at the landscape of empirical risk. In that work, the authors established uniform convergence of empirical risk to population risk and one to one correspondence between critical points of the two function under strongly Morse assumption. In this work, the authors relax that assumption and allow the Hessian to be be even degenerate, provided that it has a negative eigenvalue. This allows the authors to apply the theory to cases were strongly Morse assumption is violated.   The authors show that the assumptions are satisfied in two examples, and in one, they show how one can use quotient manifolds to circumvent the fact that at the global min, the Hessian is degenerate, and still apply the same theorem.  One minor issue with the result of the paper: can authors briefly describe how theorem 2.1 can be used to get estimation error bounds? This theorem is very strong in the sense that it provides a result for every connected compact subset of B(l). Therefore it seems reasonable to assume that getting estimation error bounds using this theorem should be doable, but the details should depend on the specific examples and underlying distributions. Establishing one to one correspondence between critical points of the two functions are definitely useful, but the ultimate goal, at least in the examples provided is to get estimation error bounds, and unfortunately it is not discussed at all.  The paper is very well written and easy to follow. I did not check the details of the proofs.
