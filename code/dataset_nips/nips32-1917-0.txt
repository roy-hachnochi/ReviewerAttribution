The paper addresses "the right to be forgotten" and how an individual's data contribution to the trained model can be removed without having to retrain the model from scratch. I believe this work makes important contributions to the study of a real-world problem with significant practical and policy implications. The paper is generally well-written and well-structured, but I believe it could be made more accessible to the average reader of NeurIPS (See below).   Authors have done a thorough literature review (in particular, I liked that they clearly distinguish their problem from privacy.)  I very much appreciated the 4 principles they lay forward in the discussion section. I just wish they had made better references to those principles in the exposition of their algorithms.
