Overall, I found this paper to be interesting and well-written. It was somewhat surprising to me that stochastic extragradient would not converge in cases where batch extragradient does, and the authors did a nice job of presenting the counterexample and explaining why this is the case. The proposed algorithm SVRE appears to work fairly well in practice, and the main theorem (Thm. 2) appears to be correct, and doesn't make excessively restrictive assumptions. I expect these results would be of interest to the community, in part because it combines two timely topics: variance reduction and optimization of games. One comment is that in the description of variance reduced gradient methods in page 4, I think you could have explained a little more about the work of Palaniappan and Bach and why their work is a natural model for your own. In particular, what are the main differences, and how does the analysis differ?   I would have been curious to see a comparison of the IS (or something comparable) as a function of wall-clock time for BatchE in addition to SE. Is there any reason that was not included? In general, it seemed like the authors did not spend as much time/space evaluating the computational tradeoffs between the algorithms as a function of wall-clock time, which I think is ultimately the more important metric (as opposed to number of mini-batches, for instance).  Another minor comment is that there are some strange grammatical errors in the introduction in particular, it may be worth reading over that to clean it up.
