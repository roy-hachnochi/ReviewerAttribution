In this paper, authors first investigate the interplay between noise and multi-objective problems in the context, and then propose a new method “stochastic variance reduced extragradient” (SVRE) which combines SVRG estimates of the gradient with the extragradient method (EG). This method succeeds to reduce noise in GAN training and improve upon the best convergence rates.  advantages: Show that the noise can make stochastic extragradient with a motivating example. Combine the advantages of stochastic variance reduced extragradient method (SVRE) and extragradient method (EG). Experimentally, it effectively reduces the noise in GAN training. As shown in experiments (table2), it can improve SOTA deep models in the late stage of their optimization.  disadvantages: In table2, SVRE has worst performance on CIFAR10. Authors do not give a explanation here but only show WS-SVRE, which apply SVRE from an iterate point of other method, has best performance. It will be better if the reason behind that is carefully explored.
