The paper is well written and the topic is highly relevant is this era of reproducibility crisis. However, its significance remains unclear wrt to the actual literature.  1- The classical conformal prediction method (section 3) is already valid for *any* regression algorithm (including quantile regression) and *any* conformity score function (including E_i in Eq. 6) (under mild assumptions e.g. exchangeability of the data and permutation invariance of the score). In that sense, the novelties of this paper rather limited and seems to be a direct application of classical conformal prediction with a quantile regression algorithm. If it is not the case, it should be interesting that the authors precisely clarify the fundamental differences between these approaches (More, the proofs seems to be exactly the same).  Relatedly, the sentence in line 61-63 seems confusing. As far as I understand, standard method is not only restricted to conditional mean regression. Same remark for line 58-60, since any estimator can be used, the coverage guarantee hold regardless of the choice or accuracy (which one: accuracy in optimization or in prediction?) of the regression algorithm (also under mild assumptions).  2- To me, the discussions on the limitation in length of C(X_n+1) in Eq. 5 is also confusing.   a) When one consider *full* conformal prediction set (not necessarily an interval) [mu(X_n+1) - Q_{1-alpha}(R), mu(X_n+1) + Q_{1-alpha}(R)] for all possibilities of y_n+1, the quantiles Q_{1-alpha}(R) depends on X_n+1 and its length is *not* fixed (in cases where it is an interval). Hence this limitation seems to come from the splitting strategy itself.   b) The proposed conformal set C(X_n+1) in Eq. 7, has a length that is lower bounded by 2 Q_{1-alpha}(E, I_2) independently of X_n+1. Why the critics above does not hold in this case?  Perhaps the locally adaptive approach can alleviate the issue.  If the above points hold, the numerical experiments rather highlight the critical importance of the choice of the estimator and the conformity score used, to obtain small confidence set.
