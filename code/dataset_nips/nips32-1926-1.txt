The paper is novel, well-written and important. I do not have any complaint but a few minor suggestions.   (1) There are some works on linear quantile regression, which provided the non-conformalized version of the method in this paper, e.g. Zhou and Portnoy (1996, 1998). These may be worth mentioning.  (2) The acronym CQR has been used for composite quantile regression (Zou and Yuan), which is another influential paper. It may be worth changing the acronym as this paper is likely to become influential too!  (3) I like the point that conformalized quantile regression is better than locally adaptive conformal prediction. It may be better to design numerical experiments with highly heavy-tailed distribution (say Cauchy) to further illustrate this point.  References Zhou, K. Q., & Portnoy, S. L. (1996).
