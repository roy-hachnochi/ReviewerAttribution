The paper provides an interesting link between Quantile Regression and Conformal Prediction that would allow to combine the strengths of both when dealing with heteroscedastic data. Both methods provide different ways of constructing prediction intervals. Quantile Regression portion of the method can use any QR method including Linear Quantile Regression, Quantile Random Forests, etc depending on the problem at hand. The experiment section demonstrated the tighter prediction intervals obtained by CQR Random Forests and CQR Neural Net.
