This work studies a Bayesian multi-armed bandit with a known and finite time horizon. The proposed framework introduces a technique of relaxing the non-anticipativity constraint in operations research to bandit problems and generates several interesting algorithms. These algorithms can exploit the knowledge of time horizon in a systematic way and achieves better performance than thompson sampling. The paper is well-written and organized. And I believe the results are very interesting to the bandit community and even larger field of reinforcement learning. I have some comments:  1) Can this framework get rid of the knowledge of T? In the frequentist setting, one can use a doubling trick to extend the regret bound obtained in knowing T to the setting of not knowing T. So I am wondering this framework can be extended to the setting of not knowing T. That would be interesting in practice.  2) In most cases, IRS has computational complexity that is linear (or even polynomial) in T for each round. This complexity can be a problem in some cases when the time horizon is millions or more, which could be limit to its practical value.  3) Any theoretical results for IRS.V-EMAX in the form of Theorem 2 and 3?  a minor one: line 34: focus "on" the Bayesian setting ...  ==== after response==== Rebuttal read.
