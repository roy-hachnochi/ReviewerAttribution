The paper applies information relaxation techniques to the finite-horizon multi-armed bandit problem. By proposing a series of information relaxation penalty functions, the authors are able to derive a series of upper bounds on the optimal value function that are increasingly tighter at the cost of increasing computational complexity. The authors also propose a spectrum of algorithms with increasing computational complexity using these penalty functions, with one end being Thompson sampling and the other end being the optimal policy. Algorithms derived from this technique take into account the effect of having a finite horizon in a natural way. I think these results are very interesting and the approach shows great promise for dealing with problems with a relatively short time horizon.   The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms perform better than vanilla Thompson sampling, with the cost of more compute time. What seems interesting to me is that the performance of information directed sampling looks comparable to IRS algorithms, even though IDS only looks at the current time period at each time, and does not consider the future or having a finite horizon. What is the advantage of IRS over IDS? My guess is that IDS probably does not scale well with number of arms. Could you please confirm?   The paper is pretty well-written in general. There are a few minor typos, so please proofread. Also, since IRS.Index achieves the best regret empirically, it might be worthwhile to discuss it in the main text.
