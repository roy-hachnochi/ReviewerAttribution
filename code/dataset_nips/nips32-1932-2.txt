Overall the manuscript is well written and very accessible. The authors introduce a nice idea to personalize prediction models based on individual samples. They avoid over-fitting by constraining the matrix of personalized parameters to be low-rank. Furthermore, they introduce a regularization scheme as a second option, encouraging model parameters to be similar if the covariates are similar.  The manuscript could benefit from drawing a connection to unsupervised domain adaptation methods, maybe at the point, where the distance matching approach is introduced.
