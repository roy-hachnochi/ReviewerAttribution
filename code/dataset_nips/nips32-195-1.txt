This kind of nonadaptive testing for graph recovery problem seems to arise in numerous settings and is therefore natural and important; the sparse Erdos-Renyi setting is perhaps the most basic for average-case analysis and so the focus there makes sense (there is a brief discussion of general graphs).  Although I didn't check each proof, line-by-line, the high-level ideas of everything indicate correctness to me.  The fact the simulations qualitatively line up is also suggestive.  There is a lot of content in this paper, with several distinct achievable schemes (4 by my count), of which one is near-optimal, whereas the others have potentially interesting relationships among them.  Although the writing is generally well-organized and clear, I wonder if so much material is perhaps ambitious for an 8-page conference paper.  In particular, a significant part of the content, including pretty much all proofs are deferred to appendices.  Although 1-sentence sketch of proofs are often given in text, a little more detail in the main text would have been nice, especially about the sublinear time decoding algorithm.  Moreover, Appendix H on comparing standard group testing to this setting would have been appreciated in the main text, to help clarify novelty.  I should say, there is certainly novelty.  ADDENDUM: I have read through the other reviewer comments as well as the author rebuttal, and my scoring remains the same based on the theoretical contribution.  I appreciate the authors will try to include more content by more concise formatting and the extra page; based on R4's comments as representative of broader readership, perhaps one should ignore my previous suggestion of reducing the scope of the experimental section.  R4's suggestion of releasing code is also a good one, for reproducibility and greater usage of your algorithm.
