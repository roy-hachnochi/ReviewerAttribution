The paper shows that the GNN model of Scarselli et al. (2009) can be adjusted (with many parameters) to be related to other filtering and diffusion methods that are based on a graph Laplacian $L$. However there is no significant and concrete novel insight that could be derived from these connections. At the end of Section 2, only obvious statement like "Based on the mathematical analysis, the diffusion pattern is controlled by the kernel of $L$" could be made. Important questions like "how to quantify the effectiveness of a kernel of $L$, and what is the best kernel of $L$ for a given task?" are not addressed. In fact, the kernel for QIA in Eq. (12) was chosen rather heuristically without any further analysis. Therefore, the paper does not really advance our understanding of GNN.  The framework QIA-GNN in Section 3 was also constructed quite heuristically, and too complicated with three layers L1/L2/L3. There is no solid analysis and justification for these layers.   The task QIA is subjective, with no clear objective metric for comparison. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the merit of the proposed GNN model.  ***** POST REBUTTAL I have read the author response that provides some positive comparisons, both qualitative and quantitative. However, these experiments are small and could be cherry  picked. I slightly increase my score from 4 to 5.
