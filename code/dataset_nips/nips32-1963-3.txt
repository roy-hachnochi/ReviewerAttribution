Originality: The paper proposes a novel and principled way of using and constructing GNNs for a wide variety of tasks. They claim their technique generalizes to multiple tasks.  Clarity: The paper is fairly clear, well referenced, and well written. Some minor typos noted below. There are also some details in regards to the preprocessing of faces that could be clarified (see below).  Significance: The paper proposes a principled way of constructing GNNs that appear to generalize to several useful computer vision applications.  Additional experimental results and/or a small scale user study would be helpful to assess how the GNNs' output compare to other techniques and whether they generalize well. The authors should demonstrate their GNN is robust to both   The main contribution here is providing some analysis on how these GNNs can be constructed in a principled way for this task. This way of parameterizing GNNs has the potential to be useful as parts of future computer vision pipeline.
