Originality: The lower bound seems to be new for the considered class of problems and stochastic algorithms. It is not clear what is the difference in proving the lower bounds from previous similar works.   Quality: The authors should mention more related work on stochastic strongly convex optimization with optimal convergence rates.   Clarity: There are  a couple of papers on stochastic strongly convex optimization that provide 1/t convergence rate  for last iterate. It is not clear why the authors paticularly refer to [8,18]. It is also not clear why the lower bounds on Y_t is more interesting than the objective gap.   Significance: It is not clear how the results in this paper can advance our understanding on stochastic strongly convex optimization given so many studies on the upper bounds and lower bounds.   I have read the rebuttal.
