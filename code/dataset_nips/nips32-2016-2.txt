GenerallyÂ speaking,this is a very interesting work with great originality and quality. However, the formulas and principles are not very clear. For example, how does the Gaussian primitives generate another Gaussian, and must the Gaussian policies be used? What is even more puzzling is that the addition model can't really be able to activate multiple primitives simultaneously as the multiplication model? From the perspective of the formula, the two are just the difference between addition and multiplication. Finally, I believe that  learning and composing skills effectively are very meaningful research directions, and this paper does a significant job.
