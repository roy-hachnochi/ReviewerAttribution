The paper appears to be rather original, in terms of task and architecture, although conventional in terms of machine learning theory.   The proposed architecture appears to work reasonably well, and a few contrasting conditions are explored with varying performance.   The main conditions are the so-called Bat-G network which features a late integration of spatial and temporal features, versus a so-called SAE network which performs earlier integration, and works less well.  The effect of temporal versus spatial features is also compared.  However the system contains a great many design decisions that are not explicitly tested.  No conventional sonar/ultrasound methods are compared against, so it is difficult to determine how this work compares to prior methods of d al significance of the scores is rather unclear.  For example, if the voxels at the visible surface were all correct, it seems the system could still achieve a bad score by misclassifying other voxels that are not visible.     The writing is at times a bit ungrammatical (e.g., figure 5 caption "the objects have vertexes" instead of vertices).   A glaring mistake is having figure 1 appear before the abstract.     It is not possible to fully understand the architecture of the SAE network without seeing the supplementary material.
