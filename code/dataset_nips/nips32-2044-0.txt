I like the approach.  This paper describes something new for continuous-time structure estimation.  While mixtures have been explored for structure estimation in other domains, they have not been applied here and there are non-trivial hurdles that were overcome to do so.  This method seems to be scalable.  However, this is not tested in the paper.  It would be good to see some experiments that would demonstrate this, particularly as the BHPS data was down-sampled to 200 trajectories (from 1535) and it isn't clear why.  The variational method used seems very similar to that of [4].  This paper should make the connection clearer.  Finally, structural EM (SEM) (see Section 19.4.3 of Koller & Friedman or Friedman's original 1997 paper) from BNs has been applied to CTBNs before (see [16], for example, and it seems to be implemented in CTBN-RLE). While exact inference is not scalable, this could be used with the the variation inference of [4].  This would make a natural comparison, as it is a scalable existing alternative that also employs variational inference.  Minor notes: - I think Equation 2 needs a "+1" inside the Gamma function, as well. - The last equation on page 2 of the supplementary material does      not seem to account for the sqrt(2pi/z) part of Stirling's      approximation (which has an apostrophe, please note).
