Overall: I like the paper -- node differential privacy has been shown to be extremely challenging to achieve -- and consequently, this work is a solid algorithmic advance. I think it deserves publication at neurips. That being said, there are two aspects of the paper that render it less useful than I would have liked it to be.  The first is that almost no intuition is provided, which makes the algorithm rather opaque. Why is the "concentrated degrees" property needed? Where does the analysis break when this property is not there? A detailed discussion of this in my opinion is necessary.  The second is that no constants are provided and all smoothed sensitivity calculations are carried out with a O notation. For example in Lemma 3.1 the local sensitivity calculation is done with a O. While this is fine for a theoretical paper, in my opinion this considerably lowers the value of this work. Any practitioner who would like to implement the algorithm would have to work out all the hairy details from scratch; this is exacerbated by the fact that these exact numbers are indeed needed to implement the algorithm correctly.   In my view, addressing these two aspects would make the paper considerably stronger.
