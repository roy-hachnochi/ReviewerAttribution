The fact that a node-DP polynomial time algorithm is available and with almost the same error guarantees as the non-DP algorithm is quite an achievement. I haven't checked all the details of the proofs, but the reasoning seems to flow. The lower bound is also interesting, mostly because it shows that novel techniques are needed to get improvements for G(n,p).   One doubt that I have is how the value of s (2nd to last line of Alg 1) can be computed efficiently.  The paper feels a bit unpolished in the presentation, especially in terms of conveying intuition and explaining what is going to happen next. The pseudocode in particular feels unnecessary and can easily be replaced with a more thorough description in the text.   Please use the correct accents above the 'o' of Erd\H{o}s: in LaTeX, use \H{o}, not \"{o}.  Please do not italicize "et al.", as per most manuals of style.
