The authors describe a way to compute Bayes factors that could be implemented by neurons to carry out model/causal inference. My primary concern with this paper is that while the authors describe a plausible inference rule for neuronal computation, they do not actually present any empirical evidence to support their claim. The authors argue that the proposed inference method may be implemented by "opposite neurons". While I do agree that "opposite neurons" support the plausibility of the authors' arguments, I feel that for a NeurIPS submission stronger evidence would be warranted. As such, I think this is a decent paper with some interesting ideas, but that is not sufficiently comprehensive for NeurIPS.  On a side note, the authors appear to equate Bayes factor computation with causal inference. I would recommend a more careful wording here. In my opinion, computing Bayes factors may -- but does not need to be -- one step in a causal inference algorithm.  Update after rebuttal/discussion: The authors and other reviewers have convinced me that there is value in this work without strong empirical evidence. I have raised my score from 4 to 6.
