  This paper tackles a fairly difficult problem, namely data  association for multi-object tracking and provides a novel algorithm  based on a min-cut, max-flow formulation. Given the complexity of  data association for MOT, I found the technical presentation to be  especially clear (and insightful). I also give high marks for the  scholarship and demonstrated familiary with both the problem and the  literature. Rather than blindly applying standard algorithms to the  problem, they provide a thorough analysis of the complexity of the  graph and how it may be pruned in way that achieves significant  computational savings. While one might view this as a very  specialized result, I think the detailed analysis would be of  interest outisde multi-object tracking for other problems that might  benefit from graph simpification. They provide analysis and  guarantees related to the various algorithmic changes. They provide  convincing empirical comparisons to existing algorithms. It was the  case that I had to reread various sections due to the density of the  material, but I think that is the nature of this particular  problem.   Minor questions/comments:    1) if an object is detected in frames i-1 and i+1, but missed in i,   can the algortihm recover the trajectory. It seems like the answer   would be no since a flow cannot be established.    2) line 261 "We designed the graphs using three different methods" -   What does this mean? I assumed the graph was based on a set of   detections. Is this just saying that depending on the detection   method, you would get a different graph (seems obvious) or something   else? Please clarify.  Post Rebuttal:  The authors addressed the minor questions that I raised. I still feel strongly that this paper merits inclusion. It contributes to both multi-object tracking in a practical and important way *AND* the analysis provides insight into other network flow problems.
