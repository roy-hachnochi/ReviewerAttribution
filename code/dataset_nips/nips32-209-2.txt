The paper is clearly written, and the theoretic part is solid. The experiments also show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.   Minor concerns: The running time of different algorithm can be influenced by the CPU brand, compiler options, memory speed, \etc. The authors can give a detailed spec of the platform in the appendix.  ==== After rebuttal ====  I think the author resolves the reviewers' concern successfully. I tend to vote accept for the paper.
