Originality: The proposed method is an extension of the work from [20] for generating action-conditioned videos. The authors propose a modification of the landmark discovery pipeline to also generate foreground masks for the object moving in the video. Once the landmark discovery network is trained, the generated landmarks are used for supervision to train a stochastic sequence generation model. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first model to achieve this without the use of landmark labels.   Quality: The paper writing needs work. There are many grammar errors throughout the paper that I noticed (e.g., line 199: detected keypoint are -> detected keypoints are). I recommend the authors to fix these in the next revision. The illustration of results are good and showcases the quality of the generated videos, and also, the supplementary material is very helpful to determine the spatio temporal quality of the generated videos. I would have, however, liked to see side-to-side video comparisons with the baselines.   Clarity: The method explanation is clear, however, I feel the way the mechanical turk evaluation setup is explained could be improved.   Significance: The quantitative and qualitative results given the unsupervised nature of the method makes the video generation results highly significant. In addition, the applications for video inpainting, object removal and pose translation can be of interest to researchers in the area of image/video editing
