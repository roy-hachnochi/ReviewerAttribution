This paper addresses the problem of learning a sequence model for marked temporal point processes. The problem has been studied in the literature and is of interest to the community. However, the paper is not written clearly and lacks coherence, there are many typos, and the authors use a language that is not appropriate for a scientific paper.   One of my criticisms of the paper is the use of "causal-graphs" in the paper. The term causal generally refers to causal statements which answer counter-factual statements of the form "what if ...", the authors use this term extensively to describe the graph which they recover using their method, while the recovered graph may not be the causal graph in the sense often understood by the community.  My other criticism of the paper is lack of coherence between sections of the paper. This makes understanding the motivation behind every section very difficult. In its current form, it is very difficult to follow the logic behind each step and hence understanding the paper.
