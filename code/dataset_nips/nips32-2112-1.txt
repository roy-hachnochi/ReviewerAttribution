The paper presents several fresh ideas and techniques for leanring high-dimensional event sequence in the continuous time space, which is challenging and still remains open.  Specifically, the authors devise a random walk based approach among the local causal graph of markers, for high-dimensional event generation with a linear complexity efficient implementation, after a rigrous theoretical study.  Meanwhile, a latent intensity model is devised without explicitly defining the network structure. This model can be also useful for high-dimensional marker space, as it instead model the latent space rather than the raw marker space which can be intractable.  The distance between two high-dimensional event sequences is modeled via adversarial imitation learning, which makes the distance computing more tractable and flexible.  Overall the paper is well written and the technical novelty is solid. The experiments are comprehensive.
