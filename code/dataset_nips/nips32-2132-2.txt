(1) Quality: Is the submission technically sound? Are claims well supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results? Is this a complete piece of work or work in progress? Are the authors careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work?  The quality of the work is good. It is interesting, it makes clear claims and it supports them with both theoretical and empirical arguments.  One aspects that this paper is lacking in is motivation/context. I understand that the issue this paper addresses is coding using flow models, however, since flow models are not commonly used for compression, it should provide motivation why one might want to use them. The paper should argue why the problem that it is solving is important for either theoreticians or practitioners. If flow models are indeed competitive with VAEs, that should be demonstrated empirically.  (2) Clarity: Is the submission clearly written? Is it well organized? (If not, please make constructive suggestions for improving its clarity.) Does it adequately inform the reader? (Note: a superbly written paper provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce its results.)  The paper is well written and easy to understand. I really like that each algorithm is shown in pseudo code.  One part that was unclear to me is in section 3.5, why is it a problem is log delta > 1? Why is that a waste of bits?  (3) Originality: Are the tasks or methods new? Is the work a novel combination of well-known techniques? Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions? Is related work adequately cited?  All of the ideas presented are novel and original to my knowledge. Compression with flows is a new research area and I am unaware of any prior works.  (4) Significance: Are the results important? Are others (researchers or practitioners) likely to use the ideas or build on them? Does the submission address a difficult task in a better way than previous work? Does it advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way? Does it provide unique data, unique conclusions about existing data, or a unique theoretical or experimental approach?  For the reasons stated above, it is difficult to judge the significance for practitioners. To be able to conclusively state its importance, we would have to see comparisons to existing methods. As for researchers, I do find the idea interesting and I think it could have future applications.  __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  After reading the author's reply, I decided to keep my original score.
