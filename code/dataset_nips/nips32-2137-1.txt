This is a really wonderful paper, in moving away from perhaps naive uses of Gaussian distributions in VAEs to the so-called echo distribution that has both theoretical and practical benefits.  The paper also solidifies the rate-distortion view of VAE and yields distributions with closed-form mutual information expressions. The topical area of VAEs is certainly important and so this is a great contribution for the community.  The analytical idea for constructing echo noise is also quite clever.  The paper is generally well-written and the experiments are also well-performed.  As far as I can tell, this work is quite novel.
