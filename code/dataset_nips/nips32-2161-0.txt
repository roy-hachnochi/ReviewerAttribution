1) This paper is clearly written. The motivating example in its introduction makes me believe that tie-aware ranking is crucial for crowdsourcing problems.   2) Traditional methods merely adopt the strong signal（sparse parameter） for model prediction and structural learning. Different from this routine, their proposed method explicitly separates the strong signals and weak signals, then uses strong signals to learn a semantic structure as the outlier indicator and combines both the weak and strong signals to do a fine-grained prediction. As pointed out in the work，its helps to decouple the model selection and model prediction process.
