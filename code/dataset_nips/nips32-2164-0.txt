I really like this paper primarily for its novel technology idea to select the best camera views for 3D pose estimation in multi-person scenario with occlusions. I can see similar idea can be used in many other relevant problems when it needs to find the best subset of camera views, like real-time holoportation. Even though the technology itself is not super exciting and completely new, applying RL to tailor this specific problem is novel enough for a paper. I have a few minor questions   * what's the trends of performance when the # of cameras > 10? from the plots, it seems that the gain trends to be small when using more cameras compared with other baselines, can you explain why? for example, the performance is almost close to Max-Azim when the # of camera is 10(see figure 2)  * I believe there is a strong reason, but I am curious why not using the exhaustive triangulation of 2d pose estimate in practical applications? What's the benefits of using this auto-selection based algorithms.  * This paper has not discussed any downside of this approach, to be fair, what are the things need to be careful when applied for other problems like Multiview 3D reconstruction?  *other minor issues (1) Figure 5 is missing (2) line 223~224, the sentence " The corresponding results but for 2d reprojection errors onto the OpenPose 2d estimates are given in Fig. 3. Looking also at reprojection errors is relevant" is very hard to understand, please polish it.  ***Rebuttal***: I've read the authors rebuttal and other reviewers' feedback, I keep my original rating. I like the idea and problem formulation, however, as pointed out by reviewers as well, the practical impact of this work for real application is not quite clear. I am okay to accept, but will not fight if it is rejected.
