They try to estimate the manifold in the feature space of real images and the generated images separately. They do it calculating the pairwise Euclidean distances between all feature vectors in the set of real images and for each feature vector forming a hyper-sphere with radius equal to the distance to its kth nearest neighbor. Together, these hyperspheres define a volume in the feature space that serves as an estimate of the true manifold. Similarly, manifold of the generated images is estimated. Further, precision is estimates as the fraction of the generated images that lie in the manifold of the real images. And recall is estimated as the fraction of the real images that lie in the manifold of the generated images.   Originality: I believe the proposed method of estimating precision-recall is not novel. Given its simplicity, it must have been used in some previous works although in a different context (not for high dimensional images).   Quality: The paper is well written and results are clearly explained.   Significance: Given their numerical experiments, the proposed method holds significance in evaluating the quality and variation of samples generated by GAN/
