I found this submission really interesting and influential. It represents a great step forward compare to the prior work on recall/precision estimation of GANs. The authors show examples where previous way to estimate recall/precision fails to find any difference despite obviously varying quality of samples.  The paper is very well-written and contains thorough experiments (for instance, one experiment semi-accidentally pushes StyleGAN state-of-the-art in FID).  As a sidenote, the underlying idea of growing hyperspheres around data points reminded me about persistent homologies. It is a concept from computational topology which can be used to estimate manifold topology when the manifold is described by point cloud of samples. The authors may benefit from exploring this connection.
