- I think there are quite a few novel and interesting ideas in this work. The crop selection is not a trivial problem and the authors use the visual code of each object for matching. It looks interesting but I do not quite understand how well this approach works. I suggest the authors can make some visualization on this.  - What are u_{img} and u^{attn}? What do they refer to? - The paper looks technically interesting but I am not if all the components are necessary. For example, is D_{obj} really useful? I think D_{img} is probably enough and D_{img} has more global information than objects.  - How are the hyper-parameters tuned? The lambdas are supposed to be weights to balance different terms in the loss function. - Not sure if the code will be available.
