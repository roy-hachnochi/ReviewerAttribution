The paper is well-written and the approach is interesting, however the paper contributions listed above highly overlap with a previous work [Massias 2018a AISTATS].   The differentiating part between two works is that the previous approach averaged noisy observations, whereas this work slightly updates the previous solver to minimize a data fidelity term which is the summation over all repetitions.   It is empirically shown to have some advantages over the averaging approach (this point was also emphasised in the supplementary part B.8).
