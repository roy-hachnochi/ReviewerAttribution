Originality: The paper seems original compared to a set of alternatives that the authors have provided and compared against. Its potential for neuroimaging applications such as M/EEG is also interesting.  Quality: The paper is overall well-written. Reproducibility is much appreciated, and the supplement preemptively answered some of my questions related to the experiments.  Clarity: For the most part, it was written clearly so I was able to follow the crucial points for the most part given my limited knowledge in the area. The provided code helped me a lot to digest some technical pieces of the method. However, the neuroimaging related explanations were relatively less clear than the other part which I will describe below.  Significance: Given my understanding of the paper, I was able to appreciate the contribution of the method towards some real data applications. Thanks to the provided code, the impact of the paper could be immediate and more probable.
