The paper proposes a joint model to simultaneously learn item tree index and user representation that support efficient retrieval. The tree learning algorithm is based on the maximum weight matching in the bipartite graph for which an approximate algorithm is proposed. Authors further propose to iteratively leverage the tree index to infer a hierarchical user representation that is shown to improve recommendation accuracy.  The paper is well written and addresses an important problem in collaborative filtering where fast retrieval becomes critically important at scale. I think the proposed approach is sound and I particularly like the hierarchical tree-based user presentation. It is quite different than most of the proposed approaches that are either neighbour-based or use inner product latent representations.  The experimental section provides a thorough comparison using large public datasets. It is also useful to see that the method performs well in a live production setting. Here, I would have also liked to see training and inference times given that even with the proposed approximations Algorithm 2 can be expensive. I think the authors need to quantify this overhead and compare it to other approaches, particularly since the method is targeted towards very large datasets.
