Authors propose a theoretically sound solution to uncoupled regression via pairwise ranking. They utilize statistical learning theory. They also analyze the estimators properties such as variance and develop generalization bounds. Furthermore they also supply empirical evidence for their algorithm.  Paper is well written and connected to literature. Experimental study is well connected. My concerns are the practical value of the contribution and computational requirements,
