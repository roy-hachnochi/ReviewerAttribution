The paper proposes two novel methods for uncoupled regression by employing pairwise comparison data within the framework of empirical risk minimization. Compared to existing methods, the new approaches can get rid of the strong assumptions on the target function by adopting the ideas of risk approximation or target transformation. The authors derive the estimation error bounds and demonstrate by numerical experiments that the proposed methods perform comparably to the ordinary supervised regression. The results are novel and very interesting. The paper is well written and easy to follow.
