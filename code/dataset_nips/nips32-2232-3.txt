I think this is an interesting paper, establishing a choice of the parameter in the Bethe Hessian matrix that is threshold-optimal for the sparse degree-corrected block model. This is novel up to my knowledge. The random matrix theory (establishing the value of the overlap) behind the work is interesting and non-trivial.   I see two slight drawbacks:   ** The paper is not very clear about the comparison with performance of the non-backtracking matrix spectral method for the same problem. From my understanding that method has the same threshold. Does it have a worse overlap? I think so, but could not find a clear statement about it in the paper.   ** Remark 2 and related appendix in SM seems non-sensical to me. The authors use the works Bayes-optimality and Nishimori condition in a way different from the literature to which they refer without defining them properly. Clearly a spectral method will not be able to reach a Bayes-optimal overlap, such as degree-corrected belief propagation is conjectured to reach. The derivation in the Appendix is more than heuristic. The authors end up with a mapping into an Ising model that would not even maintain the right sizes of the groups if exact sampling was implemented for it.
