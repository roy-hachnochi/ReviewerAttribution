I think this is a very solid but unspectacular paper - explained below. Looks like a safe paper to accept as a poster.   1. The paper studies an interesting problem of next item selection to maximize retention in memory-related tasks (German, Biodiversity). The difference between this work and prior works is multi-concept; while this is an important contribution, it is not a fundamental one.   2. I like the theoretical contributions: the formulation is solid, the results obtained using submodularity are more or less expected. The model-specific result for exponential forgetting curves is somewhat useful - memory strength and the number of concepts have a log relationship, which makes sense.   3. For the human user experiments, the results are pretty good - statistically significant improvement despite using only 80/320 users. However, these results are heavily restricted; the whole session lasts only 25 minutes, which makes it hard to conclude that the same results will hold for real-life learning settings. I also wish there is a parameter sensitivity study (lines 264-270), since the authors simply ran the algorithm with some prior parameter choices and didn't tune them. Can you use the collected data to fit some parameters and compare them with your choices?  Writing is good.  I read the author response and it is good - I'll keep my score.
