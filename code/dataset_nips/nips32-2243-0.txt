I found the results of the article useful but difficult to follow without being an expert on previous results on weighted low-rank approximation. Additionally, I think the clarity of the paper could be highly improved. For example, at the end of the Introduction section, they refer to a matrix A which is not defined before, making the reading difficult. Similarly, in line 89, matrices D_{W_{i,:}} and D_{W_{:,j}} are used but defined later in lines 93-94. Also, in line 121 the concept  of non-negative rank is used but not defined. Experimental results are rather weak. For example, the particular case of matrix completion is not covered, which consists of using a binary weight matrix. The regularization parameter lambda was set to 1 without a clear justification.
