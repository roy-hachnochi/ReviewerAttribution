Thank you for addressing my review comments. I am somewhat satisfied with the answers. I will increase the score provided that authors will add the suggested experimental comparisons in the rebuttal to the final version of the paper. --------------------------------------------------  This paper discusses improvement for weighted low-rank for matrix approximation. This paper closely follows methodologies by [Razenshteyn et al. ’16]. Overall the paper is well-written, however, though the theoretical analysis is strong enough to show an improvement over [Razenshteyn et al. ’16], the paper does not properly demonstrate the results through experiments.  One of the main contributions they claim is the improvement of the running time of matrix approximation (in lines 87-90), however, there is no empirical evidence in the paper ([Razenshteyn et al. ’16] gives experiments on running time). Can the authors demonstrate this speed up by experiments?   Experiments: Why do you set the regularization parameter \lambda equal to 1? Why not cross-validate? Any theoretical justification? I feel that the dataset sizes are too small (dimensions of 1000) to demonstrate that the proposed method is useful in real-world applications. Can the authors provide at least one experiment with a large dataset?  As I mentioned earlier, it is desirable to see experiments with running times.
