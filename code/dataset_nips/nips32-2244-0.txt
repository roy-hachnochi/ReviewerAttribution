There are several rooms for improvement of the proposed method.  For practical use of the RAM-MC estimator, \hat{q}_N(z) should be known, however, this assumption seems restrictive. Several sampling methods work without known density functions, hence it is necessary to develop an estimator without knowing density functions.  Also, the theoretical analysis may be improved. Since a main source of the error is from estimating density functions from both theoretical and practical aspects, hence an error of the estimator should be investigated without known density functions.
