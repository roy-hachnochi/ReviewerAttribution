The paper considers an important problem of estimating f-divergences under a scenario which has a lot of potential applications.   Pros: - The proposed estimator is simple to understand and implement.  - The theoretical analysis is complete and many cases are examined. - Simulation considers many cases and contains real data and simulated data, as well as comparison of other methods.  Cons - Some notations in the paper are confusing. (e.g. line 59, q() is multi-defined. Please use proper footnote to distinguish them) - N=1 in the simulation seems not very necessary. What is the purpose here? The other methods are all under N=500 - If there is an extra table comparing the proposed method with the convergence rate of the existing method that would be very helpful.  Overall a good contribution to the venue and I would recommend the paper to be included.  Edit: Thank the authors for the rebuttal. I appreciate the specific replies. I will keep my score as accept.
