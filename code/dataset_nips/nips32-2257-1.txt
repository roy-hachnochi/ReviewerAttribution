The paper rigorously tackles the question of what is the best way to learn point process parameters given the presence of very long sequences which are samples drawn from the point process. There are two ways of training the models by using either sub-intervals or, as recommended in this paper, by thinning the original sequences to make them shorter. The authors first rigorously establish the classes of models for which thinning can work, show that the variance of the gradient of the residue calculated for the thinned sequence is going to be smaller than that calculated over the sub-interval sequence, and show using experimentation that thinning manages to learn the state-of-the-art models.  The paper is very well written; each lemma/theorem/definition is followed by a clear example and explanation. The presentation is also smooth and the paper is approachable while remaining rigorous.   However, there still are a few parts of the paper which could do with more explanation. Firstly, the authors hint at the gradient for stochastic intensities potentially being unbiased in line 186-190. An example here and potential discussion of the limitations would help contextualize the contribution better, Also, there seems to be a rather sudden jump from learning/modelling one intensity function to multi-variate intensity functions between Definition 4.2 and Experiments.   Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution and should be accepted for publication.  Minor:   - Line 66: Missing period.  - Eq (2): R(.) is undefined.  - Line 196: "of applying"  - Missing Theorem (reference) in Supplementary, above eqn. 9.
