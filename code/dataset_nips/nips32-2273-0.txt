I do not have many comments, as the paper is technically strong, and the writing is extremely clear. The authors connect very well to previous work. The experimental results are useful to have as well.  Thank you for your rebuttal. Overall, even though the paper is well-written, the use of the CLT makes some of the proofs a bit unsatisfactory and hard to check: checking requires a bit more intuition than I would want in a formal context. In the end the paper is making a number of approximations, but since they appear to be useful in practice,  I think it is fine as long as the authors emphasize where approximations are made and how their theoretical results could be strengthened,
