Response to rebuttal: I think the rebuttal is well developed and answers most of my questions. I raise some questions in the review because I am not aware of some constraints within the quantum computing framework. The idea proposed in this paper seems to have broad applications in some other EM algorithms, which have high dependency on the data size at each step. But I still hope the authors can state q-means++ more clearly in the formal version. ================================= There has been a lot of interest recently in quantum computing; however, few has used it to solve clustering problems. This paper investigates the problem of applying quantum computing to solve the classic k-means problem, which is known to be NP-hard in most cases. The authors propose a novel quantum algorithm called q-means, and they provide time complexity of their algorithm at each iteration. Since neither quantum simulators nor quantum computers large enough are currently available to test q-means, they argue that a robust delta-k-means algorithm should have similar performance as their algorithm. Some numerical results are presented to show that delta-k-means can achieve almost the same accuracy as plain vanilla k-means.   The main strength of the paper lies in the improvement of time complexity per iteration, reducing the linear dependency on data size to poly-log by using quantum information. This is a novel idea and can be used for other clustering algorithms.   This paper is well organized except for section 2. Maybe moving the algorithmic scheme in supplementary to paper can help understanding. Some important notations are also omitted.
