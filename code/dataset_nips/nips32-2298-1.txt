Review unchanged after rebuttal.  My comments are high level:  In the introduction author's may want to reconsider example they use to demonstrate learner's domain conflict. This example of auto-pilot makes one believe that the teacher is the bad one. Teacher suggests that learner should break rules endanger humans etc. to achieve some \pi*. Looks contrived and actually does disservice to the message paper wants to put across.  Though answered and addressed later in section 5, learner agnostic teacher should obviously under-perform vs leaner aware due to lack of information [ assuming you can actually use that additional information], this makes results of the paper sound trivial. Again this undersells paper due to the way the authors propose and setup problem in introduction. Only after reading section 5 I realised that the teacher not being aware of exact learner constraints is also handled in the paper.   I would suggest this paper being submitted as a journal paper rather than a conference paper, e.g., Theorem 2 and section 5.1 [which are interesting bits of the paper] are entirely in supplementary material. If i decide to read this paper alone without the supplementary material, I would have very little to take away. I am all for writing detailed proofs in Appendix, but when you write algorithms central to your theme in appendix, I start wondering weather this is a journal paper squeezed into 8 page limit due to prestige of NeurIPS.
