The paper proposes to regularize the training of the embedding layers based on a knowledge graph capturing known relationships between entities. Instead of a straight-forward approach using graph laplacian embeddings, the paper proposes stochastic swapping of embeddings that should result in a similar loss function.   The paper is well written, and the method seems relevant. The quantitative results are thorough comparing the method with others in 6 example cases.   The method is a contribution worthwhile to be presented at NeurIPS and is very likely relevant for the audiance.
