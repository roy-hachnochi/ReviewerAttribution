As described above, I am quite positive about the paper. I consider the proposed dynamic proof technique as a valuable contribution for several problems in optimization and machine learning. The paper considers an optimization problem for which solvers are dominated by static approaches. Of course, for static approach, we may always construct examples for which the worst case run-time is attained. On the contrary, the dynamic approach can take a shortcut to the final result. The main drawback of the approach is the following doubt: Does the proposed dynamic approach always find a solution (e.g. a fully verifiable proof)?    ------------------   I have read all reviews and the authors responses. The answers support the good quality of the paper. I recommend to accept it.
