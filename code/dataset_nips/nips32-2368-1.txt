1. The distortion problem is well-known on the time-series data. This paper aims to propose a new objective function named Shape and Time Distortion Loss (STDL) to address the problem of time series forecasting for non-stationary signals and multiple future steps prediction. The proposed loss is useful for researchers to train an end-to-end forecasting model that can handle the shape and time distortion error in a convenient way.  3. The results of this work show the proposed loss significantly outperforms other baseline loss functions such as MSE and DTW. Moreover, the proposed loss function is tested in the end of this paper to point that the loss function helps smaller models to perform as well as some other larger models.  4. Moreover, this work points the complexity of the computation of this loss by their custom backward pass is in O(nm). The implementation time between standard Pytorch auto-differentiation mechanism and the custom backward pass implementation has a significant speedup with respect to the prediction length k.
