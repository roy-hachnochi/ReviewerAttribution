The paper is very well written. The motivation is clear and the approach which involves finding curved axis for projecting the data is very intuitive. The authors provide theoretical analysis that significantly improve the quality of the paper. The experimental evaluation is also convincing. Overall, I believe this is a significant contribution and it should appear in NeurIPS. My main questions/comments are as follows: 1) Shouldn't there be a notion of orthonormality for the curved axis (thetas)? How do you enforce the axis from collapsing to directions with higher variation? 2) The discussion in page on derivation of the (smoothed) gradient is a bit unclear and hard to follow. Please try to simplify that. 3) Can you please comment on the runtime and the complexity of the algorithm? How does it scales to significantly large datasets? It would have been nice to have access to the code for having a better assessment of the method.
