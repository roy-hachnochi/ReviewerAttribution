The paper is well written in general. My main concern is that, although the formulation of the proposed metric is new to my knowledge, the choice of baselines is not appropriate.  The proposed model is a NONLINEAR generalization of the linear Mahalanobis. However, most of the baseline methods (except DDML and PML) are standard LINEAR models. This comparison is unfair since it is known that nonlinear approaches (e.g. nonlinear kernels or neural networks) outperform linear models in metric learning.   DDML was published in CVPR 2014 and PML was published in CVPR 2015. They then do not correspond to state-of-the-art deep metric learning approaches. The authors could use more recent baselines such as those reported in [A] (angular loss etc...).  The authors also do not explain how they trained the nonlinear baselines. Did the authors use the neural network architectures used in the original papers? How were the hyperparameters determined etc...
