The paper seems to propose a new (original) method, which is significant in that it enables more complex inversion problems. The paper is generally well-written (clarity), although it is quite dense for a reader not intimately familiar with the subject matter. The authors make an attempt to include information from other papers that a reader may not be familiar with. This does not always succeed: In Eq. (6), it is not clear how this layer can be trivially inverted analytically, unless function G() is trivially invertible analytically. For 2.3, it is not obvious how a layer containing of ReLUs, or downsampling at large, is invertible. This section should be expanded notably.  I have a concern in quality. The paper's results validate the method on the authors' chosen task. However, the paper's underlying tone. both by the rather general title and the abstract/conclusion, is that the method is generally applicable. However, it is not clear how specialized MRI really is, or what kind of problem classes this can be applied to. To uphold the claims of generality, the authors should speak to this, or alternatively, change the title to be more specific. I personally dislike papers with very general titles that then apply only to a very narrow application area.  In 4.4, it is claimed that the machine state occupies over 7% of available GPU RAM, and therefore it is not trainable with current hardware. However, there is no reason one could not page memory between GPU and CPU. Would that really make things infeasibly slow, e.g. if properly interleaved memory copies are used?
