This manuscript describes a new deep learning model called Graph Recurrent Attention Network (GRAN) for the generation of a generic graph. This model has the following unique features:1) combine a RNN-based generator with an attention-based GNN that can model complex, long-range dependencies; 2) only need O(N) steps where N is the graph size (i.e, #nodes). Each step may generate a block of nodes; 3) the algorithm can generate different graphs by different orderings of nodes. The authors have shown that their algorithm can generate graphs of similar quality but much more efficiently. Their experimental results also show that their algorithm indeed has some advantage over existing ones.   One concern is about the presentation of the experimental results. The authors used a few metrics to measure the quality of the generated graphs, but did not explain how these metrics are calculated and how they shall be interpreted. For example, when two methods have the spectral score 0.01 and 0.02, respectively, how different are they?
