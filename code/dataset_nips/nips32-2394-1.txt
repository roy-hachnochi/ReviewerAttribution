Significance: 1. The paper is very well written and easy to follow. However, most of the experimental details are missing and in the absence of code makes it difficult to imagine. 2. For example, no where it is mentioned how Eq. (11) is trained with ? It says 2-layer GCN but what is the input node representations ? And what is the GT in order to train for mixture network ?  3. Current drawback is that the model need to know the maximum allowed graph size 'N' (required for RNN module) 4. The results in Table 1 suggests that GRAN (this approach) performs best for Grid data. On other two dataset GraphRNN is better.  Clarification: 1. a's in Eq.(5) are scalars ? Are they normalized using sigmoid activation function ? 2. What happens if RNN modules for node generation are not used ? h can be initialized randomly and updated based on GRU outputs of GNN module or something similar. Please inclkude this in Table 2 of ablation study.  3. How is overall training performed ? Is it teacher forcing approach ? 4. Please include model size comparison.
