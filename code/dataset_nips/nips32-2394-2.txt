The general presentation of the paper is quite good. The paper is well written, and the authors present convincing derivations of the statistical foundations of their approach. Key arguments are widely supported by mathematical facts or well placed references.  The experimental evaluation presents convincing results, with both quantitative and visual content to assess the quality of the generated samples. However, the fact that most of the comparison is made on purely synthetic data is slightly disappointing. Indeed, the only real dataset used is the protein dataset. Yet, it only contains small graphs, which is not the configuration where the proposed method is supposed to be the most relevant. The authors could have made use of open source social interaction graphs datasets, so as to prove their point about scalability, and demonstrate high sample quality on real-world large graph datasets.
