In this study, inertial Bregman proximal gradient algorithms (BPG and CoCaIn-BPG) were considered for matrix factorization.  The problem here was the existence of L-smad property in matrix factorization. To tackle this issue, Authors proposed a novel Bregman distance, and proved the L-smad property with this distance and infer convergence of BPG and CoCaIn BPG. I think the contributions in this paper is novel and significant.  In experiments, three problems (matrix factorization, non-negative matrix factorization, and matrix completion) were solved by the proposed optimization algorithms and the effectiveness compared with state-of-the-art algorithms such as PALM, iPALM was demonstrated. I think it was nice if the convergence behaviors are statistically evaluated because the stationary points obtained by non-convex optimization are usually varied by initialization. Thus, I claim that the experiments are slightly weak.
