Updates: I appreciate the authors' effort to provide additional experiments. Now I understand the difference and significance of the proposed grouping method compared to MA-CNN, as well as its effectiveness on large-scale ImageNet dataset.  On the other hand, I still feel the core methodological contribution is marginal because pairwise clustering is an well-studied approach to clustering in general, and I think switching to it is not a surprising direction.  Overall, I would like to set my final evaluation as borderline negative.    This paper presents a method combining bilinear pooling and channel grouping for fine-grained image recognition. Overall, the idea itself is quite reasonable as it can significantly reduce the dimension of resultant features, and the results also seem promising. However, because the idea and effectiveness of channel grouping for fine-grained recognition are proposed in MA-CNN [9] and not novel,  the contribution of the paper seems rather incremental: just performs the standard bilinear pooling on top of the grouped features.      Moreover, the presentation of the paper is not very clear and I cannot see some crucial points as I commented in "5.Improvements".  For those reasons, my initial impression is leaning toward rejection.
