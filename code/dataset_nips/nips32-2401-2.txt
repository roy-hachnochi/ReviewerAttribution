Clarity. - The paper is well-written and the method is well-explained.   Originality. - The proposed extension is very well-motivated, but the paper itself is incremental. As the major contribution seems from limiting pair-wise interactions within each semantic group.  Significance - The proposed extension to bilinear transformation is well-motivated, and, to certain extent, combines advantages of bilinear pooling and part-based learning.  - The proposed method looks a good practical approach for very good fine-grained classification results.   =========================== Thank authors for the response! I have read the author response and my opinion remains the same, as I still feel the contribution seems a bit incremental over existing work.
