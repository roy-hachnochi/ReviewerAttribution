The authors modify the moments accountant analysis of Abadi et al for a subsample-and-aggregate style algorithm. The key technical idea is that their analysis treats differently privacy loss when a data point is removed vs added.  The results seem plausible and rigorous (although I did not verify all details), but I wish more effort had gone toward comparing the results here to the analog without the separate downwards and upwards moment accounting to help show the power of this technique. At many times the prose was too high-level/imprecise to help me understand the significance of the pieces not immediately inherited from Abadi et al.   Comments:  *Avoid opinion language like “we believe” in comparing techniques qualitatively and speculating about their future impact. *The paragraph before 4.2 seems to be the main idea, but it could use some clarification. How much better should we expect (4) to be than (3)? You make a comment about how it is “unlikely” that the two bounds are the same, but what does unlikely mean in this sentence? More rigorous claims along these lines could strengthen the paper. *The paper should be reorganized so Section 4 is (at least almost) all new contributions; as it is, almost all of 4.1 is just inherited from Abadi et al. *Use $\ell$ instead of $l$ for readability. *Is there a typo in Thm 2? alpha does not appear to be defined with u as a parameter. *Thm 3: “The mechanism” -> “Any mechanism” *m is defined to be the the fraction of teachers that voted for all but the least popular vote c_min, which is different from the claim at Line 203 that unanimity is the only way to get m=1. Thus Line 203 seems to be an overstatement. Can you clarify? *The simulations are useful baselines, but a formal accuracy guarantee is really required in 4.3 to assess the quality of this technique.
