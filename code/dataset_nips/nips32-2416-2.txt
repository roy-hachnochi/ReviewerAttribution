The paper explores a remarkably simple but consequential improvement on the standard sample-and-aggregate framework. We have two main concerns about the paper. First, it is the relatively niche appeal of the result - for pragmatical reasons, sample-and-aggregate, or PATE, frameworks are very rarely used. Second, the paper compares its personalized accountant mechanism with the original sample-and-aggregate, outperforming it slightly. A more relevant comparison would have been with either PATE, or the "Scalable PATE" (ICLR 2018), both of which apply their own versions of data-dependent accounting mechanisms.  In its current form the paper is somewhat half-baked: rather than improving on the latest state-of-the-art, it uses as the main benchmark a 2007 paper.
