-------------------------------------- Post rebuttal ---------------------------------------- I thank authors for providing the rebuttal, specifically for clarifying the relevance of OT to the problem considered and for agreeing to extend the discussion of OT use-cases in RL. I am increasing my score. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The paper is rather clearly written. Detailed supplementary material was helpful to clarify several questions I had while reading the main text.  It seems that Proposition A.3 requires a bit of a revision for the particle case. For a 1d Wasserstein barycenter to be an average, the particles should be ordered as in the Proposition A.1, but nothing about ordering is stated in A.3.  One of the most intriguing properties of OT is its ability to take into account the geometry of the support of the distributions. In this paper OT is used for the value-function posteriors, which have 1d support without any apparent geometric properties. This also leads to quite trivial barycenters. My question is what is the reason to use Wasserstein barycenters over some other way of averaging distributions?  Perhaps a more promising direction to incorporate OT into RL is to consider distributions over the state space. In many RL applications state space has interesting geometric properties which seem to be ignored by standard RL algorithms. I am wondering what authors think about such perspective and the premise of OT in RL in general.
