The paper claims that the best representation should minimize the maximum error in approximating all the possible value functions and not a single one that pertains to a given policy. As such, the authors establish further results, which reduce the maximization over all policies to the maximization over the finite set of external vertices which corresponds to (distinct in Lebesgue measure) deterministic policies. These value functions are termed adversarial (although these are adversarial only from approximation point-of-view).  I enjoyed reading the paper. Here are some comments, which may help improving the paper.   The presented theory is indeed linear, but it is coated as being generic through some introduction on the representation mapping \phi and the so-called "two-part approximation". The distinction is that in a generic case, \phi becomes part of the computation through its gradient and such, which is not the case here. I am personally not favouring the presented perspective, yet it is not a real issue to argument against. Note that in all classic sources (e.g. Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis numerous books and papers) V = \Phi \theta is the definition of linear ADP. There is no need for saying otherwise.  Figure 1 (Right): I would add the axis. The current figure is hard to understand. Is it the value space for a 2 dimensional state-space? i.e., V^{pi}(x(1)) vs V^{pi}(x(2)) ?  L94 --> \mathcal{V} definition: looks like it should be “for all” not “for some”. Additionally, mathematical statements should be succinct. I would remove it if you mean “for all”.   Supplementary material -> the first equation after equation 6: the sub-scripts of v’s should be super-script.   L107: \phi should be in R^d and not \mathcal{R}=R^{nxd}. In other words, \phi is a row of \Phi.   \delta is called interest function in section 3.1, yet it was called direction in Lemma 1.
