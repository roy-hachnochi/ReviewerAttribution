This paper presents a novel approach to solve the problem of multi-source transfer learning by using the maximal correlation.   The method are evaluated in 3 dataset. However the setting in the three dataset are somehow similar. The dataset are divided into several parts. One is chosen as the target and the rest as sources. The target task and the source tasks are from the same domain in all the experiments. The classifier is also limited to binary or 5-way classifier but not with more ways.   The experiment shows that the proposed method has a significant gain in k-shot learning when k <= 10 and it can benefit from multiple sources. It also shows in fig 2 that the maximal correlation is a good metric to show how the new task benefit from a certain old task.   The paper is well written and easy to follow.
