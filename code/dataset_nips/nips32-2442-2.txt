originality: The paper presents a new method to perform domain adaptation. It originally uses a statistical tool to design a dedicated algorithm. quality and clarity: The method is shown to outperform some alternative methods to perform the task. However, The description of the method lacks (see the specific comments below) both in notation and exposition - it remains unclear why the method performs well, what are the properties of the data that are leveraged, and what makes the method specifically suitable to few-shot learning.  significance: The setting addressed is important and seems to become prevalent.  Specific comments: From the description in section 3, it is unclear why the method is specifically applicable to low-shot settings.  The pseudo-code in Algorithm 1 as presented uses expectation over the underlying P^t_{X|Y} rather than an estimate.  line 37 - maybe also mention differential privacy (and state of the art related research and results), as related to the setting.  In the related works section, why isn't the method mentioned in lines 91-93 applicable to the paper's setting? should elaborate (also how compares conceptually and performance-wise).  Provide reference for the work mentioned in line 101 (Yoshinski) and line 102 (Bao).  What is the orthogonality requirement mentioned in lines 115-116 ?  line 118: It is stated that the prior P_Y(y) can be estimated from the data. Wouldn't this estimate be very noisy in few-shot settings!? Similarly, in line 129 - the conditional expectation is stated to be easily 'computed', however the correct term is 'estimated' and again, this estimate would be very noisy in few-shot settings.. In formula (2), should make the dependence of g on f explicit. e.g., g_f(y) = ..   Some typos: line 110 (of of) line 111 sigma_{i}. Also, shouldn't the f and g be starred at that definition of sigma_{i} !? formula (3): P_{Y|X} formula (9): P_{Y|X} formula (10): P_{Y|X}  --------------- Given the detailed answer by the authors and their commitment to address the typos and editorial comments (although a couple of mine remain un-answered) I increase the score to 6
