This paper changes the way of the regularization of the VCL algorithm based on some heuristic intuitions. The idea of maintaining the uncertainty for each hidden node is actually interesting. And it also makes more sense to give high regularization strength when either of the nodes it connects has low uncertainty. However, I think the proposed method in this paper focuses on the modification on the regularization which only provides incremental improvement with respect to VCL. The ideology behind the proposed method is not well explained from a theoretical viewpoint.   The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm cannot be verified just through a two-hidden-layers fully connected network. Since this paper uses two hyperparameters to control the uncertainty, it is important to include experimental results show the influence of them.
