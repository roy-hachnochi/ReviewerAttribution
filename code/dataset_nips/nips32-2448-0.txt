The paper is well written. I do not have any clarity issues.  To a large extent, the paper is a successor of the work by Zeyu et al. [16]: it is a straightforward extension of learning intrinsic reward to the cooperative multi-agent setting. Therefore, the technical contributions are somewhat limited. PS: Another paper on multi-agent intrinsic reward. Liu, Bingyao, Satinder Singh, Richard L. Lewis, and Shiyin Qin. "Optimal rewards for cooperative agents."  I have given my list of three most significant contributions and suggestions for improvement in other sections of the review. Here I have some minor questions:  Any particular reason why the authors did not choose all the tasks used in the COMA paper, for the purpose of comparison? In the COMA paper [9], the tasks are 3M, 5M, 5W, and 2D3Z. In this paper, we have 3M, 8M, 2S3Z, 3S5Z.
