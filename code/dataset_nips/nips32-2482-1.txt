Comments: - interesting paper - please check the paper w.r.t. the usage of similarities, dissimilarities, distances and    make it consistent - some assumptions like psd should be clearly mentioned - 'method constructs a low-rank approximation to a Gaussian kernel' - well technically it can be   used for any psd kernel - and even more generic (non-psd) as shown in    A. Gisbrecht et al. Metric and non-metric proximity transformations at linear costs. Neurocomputing 167: 643-657 (2015) - Adaptive Nystroem is fine but can lead to suboptimal results for very small set of landmarks    hence the number of landmarks should be reasonable large -> which at the end has some negative impact   on the memory / runtime consumption - Could you please also comment on the out of sample extension - e.g. if I use the calculated/approximated proximities   and generate a model how should I effectively and valid apply the model on new data   - would it be 'safe' to calculate the proximities exact? - it would be nice to have a larger evaluation on the practical impact (not only runtime) of the approximation   on its usage in some algorithm (so far only Fig 2) --> this is somewhat covered in the supplement but its a bit   sad not to have a clear summary in the main paper
