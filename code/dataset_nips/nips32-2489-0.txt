 The proposed algorithm seems impractical. The problem in Equation (1) is not only nonconvex (for the MCP regularizer \rho_\lambda), but also combinatorial (for any regularizer \rho_\lambda). The combinatorial aspect comes from the constraint B \in D, where D is the set of p*p matrices representing the weighted adjacency matrix of a DAG. This problem is NP-hard. This is why [21] and [23] argue for an identifiability condition that allows recovering the node ordering in poly-time.  The paper is overselling its contributions. Results in [23] do not require faithfulness, equal variance or Gaussianity. The submitted paper needs Gaussianity and equal variance. Furthermore, the submited paper is not the first to avoid faithfulness.  Experimental evidence is mandatory in this particular case. Since the problem in Equation (1) is combinatorial/NP-hard, it is important to perform synthetic experiments to assess the time complexity.  Minor comment: Some references labeled as Arxiv seem to actually be conference papers, for instance [21] [22] [23].  === AFTER REBUTTAL  I am not satisfied with the authors response.  The authors argue that reference [1] solves the problem in equation Equation (1). The authors in [1] use a heuristics, not exact optimization. Thus, my comment on practicality still stands, given that Equation (1) is NP-hard.  The authors argue that their method is the first score-based method (for Gaussian, equal-variance data) to avoid faithfulness. Theoretical results in [23] do not require faithfulness, equal variance or Gaussianity. Thus, the "score-based" part does not bring any advantage.  My comment about experiments was clearly due to the NP-hardness of exact optimization (not heuristics), and it still stands.
