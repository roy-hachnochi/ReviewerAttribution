originality: Moderate, the task have being studied in previous negotiation competition like D-brane, but the SL+ RL approach to study this problem is new.  quality: Experiments are very solid, results are well presented.  However, more theoretical analysis of the problem and intellectual insight would hugely improve the work.  clarity: Well organized writing. However, the paper definitely does not provide enough information for possibility to reproduce the results.  significance: Moderate. The approach that by collecting a large dataset of human games and do SL on it, later improve with RL is not new, but the execution of this idea on diplomacy is still a non-trivial job. This paper looks like a well-written, well-executed project report to me, though it should give either more insights, theories or  more detailed algorithm, dataset and code.
