The authors are interested in computing the influence of a feature p on the prediction of model M, both in terms of individual predictions and global trends. While previous work in interpreting model predictions has focused on computing feature importance via saliency maps and sensitivity analysis of the model to input perturbations, the authors are concerned with the total influence of p on the model predictions, including through model sensitivity to features besides p which nonetheless serve as proxies for p.  I believe this is a useful direction of research in model interpretability. I also believe that the idea to learning an invariant/factorized intermediate representation is interesting. However, in my assessment the submission is not up to the standard required for publication. There are improvements to be made in terms of properly defining and motivating the problem, reducing formalisms that are not used by the implemented method, and improving the experiments. I offer some concrete suggestions below.  The experimental justification for the proposed method in particular requires some attention (again, I will elaborate below). Put briefly, the authors deviate from the standard approach to modeling DSprites with disentanglement priors (e.g., in data dimentionality, architectures, and metrics) and their baseline comparisons are not enlightening.  As an overall impression, I felt that the paper was not very clearly written, and the claim from the abstract that "our method is more powerful than existing methods for ascertaining feature influence" was not substantiated. I hope that the authors are not too discouraged by this feedback, since I suspect there is a useful contribution to be had in this direction given further empirical work and a rewrite of the paper. If the authors are interested in more of a fairness spin to this work, I would suggest including at least one additional tabular dataset besides Adult.
