The paper is very well written but I'm concerned whether the paper is a fit for NeurIPS. The main contribution to ML in Section 4 feels rather compressed, and by far most of the references got to venues in cryptography and information security (only one each for NeurIPS and ICML). Furthermore, given that the paper introduces a new functional encryption scheme, it would make to sense to submit to a venue where this receives due appreciation and scrutiny.  Post rebuttal: I appreciate the author's efforts to introduce a new concept to the ML community, but I stand by my preference of scrutiny in a more appropriate venue.
