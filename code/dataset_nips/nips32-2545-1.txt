The paper presents a novel FE scheme and discusses it in detail. I enjoyed reading it. However, the definition of this encryption scheme remains unclear in the end. The authors refer to Figure 10, which is not available. Without this crucial information, the remainder of the paper lacks clarity. However, the experiments are chosen carefully and highlight their finding. I wonder which important information the circles and lines in Figures 2 and 3 reveal to the reader? Eventually, it would have been more informative to replace these two Figures by Figure 10 from the appendix. Otherwise, the paper is not self-contained.
