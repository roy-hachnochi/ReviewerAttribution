The authors propose a decentralized algorithm for stochastic bandits. The key idea is to use information that is mixed to build the upper confidence interval of each arm. The regret bound of their algorithm equals the optimal regret for N agents plus a term depending on the spectral gap of the communication graph, and the communication cost is O(K) per round for each agent. Besides, their empirical results also show the good performance of their algorithm.  I am concerned about a tighter lower bound relevant to the graph structure. I mean, the graph structure may cause communication latency, which results in a higher regret. However, the lower bound proposed in the paper doesn't indicate the dependence on graph structure, which is derived by comparing with the centralized UCB algorithm for TN steps. I believe that a tighter lower bound relevant to graph structure can indicate whether the regret can be further improved.  I also wonder whether the communication cost can be improved. In DDUCB, each agent needs to communicate with other agents every round. As a result, the communication cost is linear in T. Is it possible to communicate only in certain rounds without loss of the regret? For example, for a single-agent stochastic MAB problem, we can only update the mean rewards and counter of an arm when the number of pulling that arm is doubled. This will not cause much loss of the regret. I don't know whether this idea can be used to reduce the communication complexity.  Overall, I believe this paper is interesting and well-organized, and I vote for accepting it.
