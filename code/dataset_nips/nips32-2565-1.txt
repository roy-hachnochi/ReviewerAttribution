This paper takes a commonly used machine learning model, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) whose discriminant function for classification task, as the target for approximation by neural networks, and provides clear theoretical analyses over it. To be specific, it proves the necessity and sufficiency for a two layer neural network with a linear number of nodes to approximate the GMM, and also the necessity of a single layer network with the exponential number of ndoes. The paper makes good contribution to consolidate the theoretical basis of the deep learning methods.  === After rebuttal: no change of the score. Regarding the deep learning, the theoretical works are less than sufficient. This one counts for a piece.
