This appears to be a detailed, carefully written, and theoretically/empirically supported piece of work. The results are based on RKHS theory and appear to extend the state-of-the-art in a number of ways, including learning KMEs while dealing with dependent samples (e.g. from a Markov chain), low dimensional/rank approximations with state-of-the-art error bounds, and a variational approach for clustering, as well as a robust set of experiments. On the whole, I am satisfied that this clearly meets the acceptance criteria for NeurIPS and I am recommending it for acceptance. I have a few comments below on aspects of the paper, where things were either unclear, or might benefit from a revisit.    It is unclear how strong assumption 2 is. It seems to me that if the marginal p(x) is in the Hilbert space H, and the joint p(x,y) is in the joint Hilbert space Hx\tilde{H} then it is natural to assume that the conditional is too, but it isn't clear whether this is a strong or weak assumption. When could it be violated?  The equations under [lines 147 and 158] seem to be inconsistent (one is the theoretical and the other the approximate conditional probability). I think the first equation should have half powers on the C-matrices.  Theorem 4 appears to assume that the underlying process has a correct clustering of states, but this isn't explicit in the theorem.  The stochastic diffusion process could be a bit better described.  And a better interpretation/intuition over the results. The colours in the #clusters=15 plot should be distinct (I count 8 colours and 17 contiguous regions).  There appears to be a bit of repetition in the description of the DQN experiment, and the pairs of states could be more formally described (how did you identify that these states should be close to one another before you conducted the experiment, or was it a post-hoc analysis).  ## typos  [line 48] metastablet sets -> metastable sets  [line 130-1] shift-invariance kernel -> shift-invariant kernel  [line 158] Assumptions 2 -> Assumption 2  [line 168] states within the same set shares -> states within the same set share  Equation under [line 179] The symbol i on the top line should be an x I think. Also, it should be stated that this misclassification rate is with respect to data where the ground truth is that the states belong to m clusters.  [line 220] with the number of clusters vary -> with a varying number of clusters  ## After reading the reviews  I can see some valid points made by the other reviewers in their comments particularly with respect to the clarity of what contributions are novel. I still consider this to be a good paper though, and I will keep my score as it stands.
