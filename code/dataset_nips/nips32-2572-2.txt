I think the theory proposed in section 2 is quite interesting and a novel way of computing a Markov transition matrix given sampled transitions. From my understanding it basically requires sampling transitions and projecting them on to a random set of features, and then using the projection to approximate a transition matrix and its SVD.   I think that the paper is not written very well because it does not emphasize the intuition behind projecting to random features or other work on random features.  Further this could be modified to be a streaming algorithm which the authors don't do.   The next section is more confusing. First, the authors don't specify in what sense their markov transition matrix is irreversible. I believe they are referring to the fact that the normal diffusion operator is reversible after multiplication by a degree conjugate. However, it seems like the same general type of symmetrization trick is working here. At least this needs to be written clear for a non-familiar audience.
