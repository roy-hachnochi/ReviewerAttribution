The authors present a novel network architecture and encoding for point clouds. Specifically, they propose to use additionally to the plain point position an enriched representation that includes the positions of the nearest neighbors of the point. The paper is technically sound, though I have some additional questions which I state below (see "Improvements"). The paper does not include a discussion of the failure modes of the proposed algorithm (especially the invariance properties w.r.t. rotation and scale could be interesting), but is reasonably well evaluated. The paper is clearly written and well-structured. I do find the described idea moderately interesting, where my main concerns are 1) general applicability of the method and 2) the failure modes of the proposed approach. I will go more in depth on these issues in the "Improvements" section.  Additional comments after the rebuttal: I thank the authors for the additional insightful experiments and their detailed response. On ground of the classification scores, I tend to accept the paper. However, I still feel that there is not a good explanation for the globally optimized feature combination function.
