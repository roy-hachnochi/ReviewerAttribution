Originality: The paper builds on several known ideas (dilated causal convolutions for the encoder, and similar triplet loss ideas from other domains), but the application to learning time series embeddings appears novel (and, as the empirical evaluation seems to demonstrate, effective).  Quality: The proposed approach appears technically sounds. The empirical evaluation is extensive and demonstrates several desirable attributes of the proposed embeddings.  Clarity: The paper is mostly clear and easy to follow. Some of the details, in particular about the exact model architecture used for the experiments, are relegated to the supplementary material. I was surprised not to see a weighting factor (also depending on K) for the different terms in eq. (1), but looking at the code it seems one was actually used -- this should be described in the paper. It's also not quite clear how the hyperparameters for the experiments where chosen.   Significance: The proposed technique, though fairly straightforward and making use of established techniques, appears novel and, especially due to its encouraging results, could lead to further fruitful work in this direction.
