- Originality The method is new and differs from previous contributions. The related work is adequately cited.  - Quality For most of the submission: it is technically sound; the claims are supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results; a complete piece of work; the authors are careful about evaluating the strengths and weakness of the work. The part for the resilience against ambiguity attacks is a little bit weak to me.  - Clarity The paper is clearly written and well organized.  - Significance The paper address an interesting task overall and present a new idea.   Question about resilience to ambiguity attacks -  Different from the existing watermarking methods which do not need any training/test data in verification, this method uses test performance as a metric to verify ownership â€” requires dataset in verification. To be fair, if anyone wants to forge watermark and is informed about the verification method (on passport layer) and verification data. They could easily learn qualified passport using same objective with the weights fixed. If they're not informed how the verification works, surely it's hard to construct ambiguity attack, but this also holds true for any other watermarking method.  Together with the increasing complexity of both training and verification process, it's questionable whether people would use this idea in practice.
