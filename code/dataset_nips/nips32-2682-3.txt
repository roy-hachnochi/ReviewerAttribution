Originality: reasonable. The paper is a follow-up on Braverman et al. 2018, but it extends that model to adversarial arrivals. I believe the main algorithmic contribution is nicely original, though the approach is probably not that surprising to experts in hindsight.  Quality: Good in my opinion. I didn't find errors. Although, the math is very terse in the main submission, I didn't verify proofs.  Clarity: Very good in my opinion. My only complaint was not having a helfpul high-level description of the algorithms.  Significance: Medium. The paper addresses an extension of the problem that seems very natural. The main significant contribution seems to be the option-based algorithm, but the other results also seem helpful in understanding the space.   Other comments:  I appreciated that Section 3 goes from easy cases to more difficult ones, but I still had trouble pulling the key idea from even the "warm-up" -- some more intuition would have been helpful.  I was a bit confused whether the theorems really capture "extracting full surplus". Any instantiation of the algorithm loses O(T). We can apparently make the constant factor as small as we want, but it's still qualitatively different than an o(T) guarantee.
