Originality: To the best of my knowledge the proposed approach is original. The new loss MaxSSN and the new training strategy does seem to significantly outperform the state of the art AVOD in all experiments. Same with the latent ensemble layer,   Clarity: The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.  Quality: Although the propose method is simple, it seems effective. Technically the methods seems sounds and works. However, it may actually work only for the case demonstrated where there are two sources of information being fused. It remains to see whether it will work in a different setting, where sources of information have some other dependencies, or may even be correlated. Also, what happens when there are more than two sources of information.  Significance: The proposed method is significant enough to merit publication.
