Originality. Pros: To the best of my knowledge, the proposed method is new.  Quality.  Pros:  - Detailed proofs and analysis of the proposed method are provided.  - Ablation study is provided for a good understanding of the work. - Experimental results are good. Cons:  - The paper claims that the method preserves the original performance on clean data. However, there are evident performance drop on clean data after applying the TrainSSN algorithm. For example, the 3D AP and BEV AP decrease by ~5% and ~7% for moderate clean data in Table 1. - For demonstration of the generalization ability of the method, it would be better if the paper could validate on more tasks/models. Currently only one task (3D detection) and one model (AVOD) is validated.  Clarity.  Pros: - In overall, the paper is well written and organized. Cons: - The hyper-parameter (t) in the sparse constrain of the latent ensemble layer is missing.  Significance. Pros: The robust learning problem in feature fusion model that the paper addresses is an important topic and critical in practical applications like autonomous driving. I think the proposed method and results should be useful for the community.
