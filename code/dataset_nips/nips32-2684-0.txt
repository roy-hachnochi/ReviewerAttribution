# Originality The problem, i.e., policy evaluation in presence of unobserved confounders, is not quite new and there exist a great deal of previous works on this topic. But it is worth noting that this paper provided some rigoriously theoretical results, albeit with some strong assumptions.  # Quality The theoretical part of this paper is technically sound but the experimental part appears not that convicing. The setup seems a bit simple. I think it is necessary to conduct one or two more complicated or real-world experiments, say, higher-dimensional Z? more complicated distributions over Z? more complex function of Y? etc.   # clarity The paper is organised well and is easy to follow. The notations are also presented clearly.  # Significance Although the results are kind of interest, they are quite limited in real world due to strong assumptions. For example, the authors assume access to an identified latent confounder model, which is almost impossible in practice. Also, some assumptions in Section 3.3 are not likely to occur in real world applications. As such, the proposed approach is probably of limited importance in practice.
