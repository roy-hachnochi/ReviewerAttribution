This paper proposed a hybrid model, which tries to tackle the challenges of multi-dimensional time series forecasting (TSF) from two perspectives: (1) to grasp the 'global' evolutionary laws of time series datasets that have a wide variation in scales of the individual time series; (2) to extract the 'local' patterns through a data-dependent attention model. The motivations are clear. The experimental results on 4 real-life tasks validate their superiority in comparison with other competing TSF methods. However, there is still a lack of necessary validation and explanations, especially with regard to the specific roles of the global and local models in TSF. Is it possible to provide some more detailed theoretical proofs or design a more detailed experiment on a dataset to demonstrate the power of global and local models? Otherwise, the contributions are weak and unclear. Besides, It would be better to extensively compare the empirical performance of DeepGLO with other existing hybrid models, such as Yu et al.
