1. Although the gated fusion of visual and semantic representation is simple, but the idea is interesting and effective.  2. To my knowledge, I have not see similar idea in few-shot learning. But I am not sure if there might be other work having similar ideas or implementations?   3. In the gated formulation Equation 5, the computation of \lambda should come from the concatenation of both visual representation and word embedding rather than only word embedding. Please refer to the following two papers: 1, Gated fusion unit for multimodal information fusion, ICLR. 2, Learning semantic concept and order for image and sentence matching, CVPR.
