In this work the authors study the following problem: given an input graph G, define as Cut(G)  the set of all graphs with the same cut structure. The goal is to find a graph H within Cut(G) that dominates spectrally G. The idea is that applying spectral clustering on H will result in better outputs, and will avoid the pathological performance of spectral clustering which actually occurs in real-world datasets.  The author(s) prove that Racke's trees serve this purpose. Interestingly, sparse spectral maximizers also exist; just sparsify if needed the maximizer.  The algorithm is simple to implement, and can potentially have broader impact. The weakest part in this work are the experiments. It would be interesting to demonstrate better the impact of the method.
