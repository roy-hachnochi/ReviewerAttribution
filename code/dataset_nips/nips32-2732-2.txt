Update: I have gone over the comments from the other reviewers and the authors' response to the same. The wall-clock experiments provided by authors only reinforce my opinion that this paper should be clearly accepted.  Originality: The paper seems to be a clever idea for speeding up minibatching methods, although at some level it seems natural to consider a Poisson auxilliary variable instead of the usual Bernoulli variables.   Quality: The results in the paper are impressive considering usually methods based on minibatching has asymptotic biased. The authors here present clear results on the rates of convergence of the proposed methods, and provide reasonable simulations.  Clarity: The article is fairly well written, and the concepts are clearly described.  Significance: If minibatching is possible and useful in any problem, I would think that this particular article would be very pertinent to practitioners. However, it is unclear if this article (and any minibatching techniques) are universally useful for all problems.
