Update after author reply:  The author response was okay, I won't update my score. I agree with the other reviewers:  1. rescaling the weights during initialization should be a part of the experimental setup, that might change these results. that should be a central part of these experiments, and the authors should update the paper with such experiments. 2.  as is common in lottery ticket work, there are insufficient comparisons against other (non-lottery ticket) approaches. eventually lottery ticket work will have to compare against other relevant work; for now, i don't think this means we should reject.  My original review is below ================================================  The experimental results are convincing, and the experimental setup is not bad. This paper is original, and answers a relevant and timely question for lottery ticket research. It's clearly written, and while it does leave a few questions about exact implementation details the author do a better job than most at being clear. This feels like a complete result, with thorough experiments.  One problem throughout research on lottery tickets is the lack of comparisons against other pruning methods. It's understandable that this work only analyzes lottery tickets, as already this includes a lot of experimentation. However, it's not clear to me if the properties found here are simply re-finding the same generalization properties that have been known about other pruning methods (e.g. L1 or L0 feature selection) for years.
