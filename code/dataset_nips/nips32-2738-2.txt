# Originality To my knowledge, this is the first study of the transfer properties of tickets found in one dataset to a different dataset.  # Quality The experiments were clear and provided error bars across six random seeds for the core experiments.  # Clarity I found the writing to be clear and it was generally easy to follow the methodology and results. One complaint I have is that the colors in Figure 4 are inconsistent between the subplots. This made it more difficult for me to follow the patterns that were being pointed out.  # Significance I think that the most significant aspect of this is the study of the transfer properties of tickets found in one dataset to a different dataset. Transfer learning is increasingly important as the cost of training large models grows, and finding ways to sparsify the model could help open the way for faster research.
