The paper is interesting, well-written and addresses an important topic. Its main contributions are described in the section above. This paper is original in addressing a generalization of previously considered fair clustering cases (one of them published in NIPS 2017). As mentioned above, the authors note that a similar generalization was considered in a parallel work (currently available on Arxiv).  While the main LP-based algorithm is relatively simple and uses quite standard methods (effectively MBDMB), it is not trivial, and these methods are used for this problem in a nice way. The experimental results are also interesting, but using just 4 UCI datasets for studying this general problem seems too little, and might not reflect the overall behavior. It is unclear, for example, why the authors did not use the Diabetes dataset used in the NIPS 2017 paper of Chierichetti et al that they cite. The main significance of the paper is in the theoretical result, which significantly improves upon previous work, while the experiments mainly explore sample cases and demonstrate that they may behave better than guaranteed. I am currently grading this paper as a good submission. For accepting it following the authors response, I expect to at least see experimental results for the missing dataset out of the datasets considered in the NIPS2017 paper (UCI Diabetes).
