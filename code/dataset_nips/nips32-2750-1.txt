The paper studies fair variants of a class of clustering problems that include k-center, k-median, and k-means. The fairness constraint studied here is a generalization of the one introduced by Chierchietti et al. The main result is a black-box reduction of the fair clustering problem to the vanilla clustering problem. This is an interesting result, and immediately gives constant-factor approximation algorithms (with constant violation of the fairness constraint) for the corresponding fair clustering problems.  The experimental results are not impressive. Mainly, the fair algorithm given in the paper is compared with the vanilla solution. No comparison with a baseline is provided.  Also, the paper does not discuss a recent related paper by Ahmadian et al. (in KDD 2019). The two papers have some overlap in the results and the techniques. Even though the overlap doesn't cover the main result of the present paper (the black-box reduction), it still needs to be discussed.
