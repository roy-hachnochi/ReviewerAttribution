The paper gives a new algorithm for a generalized version of the fair clustering problem.  The algorithm works by using a black-box clustering algorithm and then reassigning points in order to meet the fairness constraints.  The point reassignment algorithm is an LP relaxation solved via iterative rounding.  The reduction and black-box setup of the algorithm is elegant and nicely simple.  Because of the black-box clustering algorithm setup, this solution applies to k-means, k-median, and k-center algorithms.
