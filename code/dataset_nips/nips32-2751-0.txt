The framework proposed in this paper addresses the problem of multi-agent online decision-making when the population size is large. The problem is well motivated by practical examples such as online ad auctions. The results stated here are nice.  Some references to background knowledge should be provided:  1. In Section 2.1, it is claimed that N-player game is hard, but this needs some verification. 2. In Section 3, what is the definition of Wasserstein distance?  There also exist some confusions in notations and possible typos:  1. In line 67, what is s^t? It seems like the authors are referring to s_t. 2. In line 78, the definition of the indicator function is unclear. It would indeed be good if the authors can use a separate section to state notations.
