This paper combines architecture search and pruning to find better CNN for memory-limited MCUs. The biggest problem of deploying CNN on MCUs is memory constraints. This paper address this problem by using multi-objective optimization. The CNNs found by this paper are more accurate and smaller, and can run on MCUs.  Originality: The MCU target is new for architecture search. However, the constrained search problem is not new to architecture search researchers. Existing works have already addressed the problems like constrained number of parameters, constrained FLOPs, or constrained latency. The authors have to cite these works and compare with them. Other methods used in this paper are all well-known techniques.  Quality: This submission is technically sound. The proposed methods are thoroughly evaluated. The only missing component is a comparison with existing architecture search works.  Clarity: This paper is well-written and well-organized with adequate background information.  Significance: The MCU is an interesting target for deploying CNNs. This work definitely advances the state of the art for MCUs. However, I am still doubt about the use cases of CNNs on MCUs. Can the latency and power consumption meet the requirements?  Questions: 1. What is the latency and throughput performance of the proposed CNN compared to baselines? These are very important for applications. It will be better if the paper can add some experiments with regard to these metrics.  Overall, the MCU target is interesting but the novelty of this paper is limited.
