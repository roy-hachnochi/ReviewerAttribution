I generally like this paper.  The task is compelling and the benchmark is well thought out.  Experiments are well done and well reported.  I think it should make a good contribution and help drive more good work, much as CLEVR has.  At the same time, I have a few concerns (see Improvements below).  These could be addressed in a revision and I would be interested to hear from the authors in rebuttal on these points.
