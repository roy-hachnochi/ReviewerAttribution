This paper focuses on the problem of the low-rank matrix recovery, and proposes a factor group-sparse regularizers as a relaxation of the number of nonzero columns in a factorization of the matrix. It seek to minimize the number of nonzero columns of the factored matrices. Analysis is conducted. However, there are some concerns to be addressed. -The motivation is somewhat unclear. In introduction, some contents should be presented in the related work section or the Preliminary section to well show the motivation of this work. -My another concern is about the value of p. In real application, how to set the suitable values of p? Is there any suggestion? -In experiments, how about the results of FGSR-1/2? It is better to show the results of different values of p.
