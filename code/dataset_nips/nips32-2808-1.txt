The paper is well written and very clear. Novelties over state-of-the-art are well described and the authors do not oversell their method, by always referring to existing approaches. Performances of the method in this context are clearly demonstrated but I would have liked a deeper investigation on some points :  - One of the novelty of the approach is the component counting module : I would have liked to see the influence of this module in terms of performances : what if this module is removed ? Are the improvement due to this module or to the change in the encoder architecture ? What if the number of components is misevaluated ? Does it degrade the results ?  - Same questions about the noise level : what if this parameter is misevaluated ? Section 3.4 gives some insights about this, but I think that the fact that the method is fully automatic is an important point that would have needed a more detailed discussion.  - How would the standard PSnet behave with an additional component counting module ? Would it achieve the same performances ?  After rebuttal : I'm satisfied by the answers the authors gave on the precise influence of the changes they made over [23] : it was one of my main concerns and I find their arguments convincing. The new results clearly show that they have investigated the robustness and cared to make a fully automatic method, which is a nice addition to these algorithms that are often difficult to calibrate. The conception of the counting module is also not trivial, as described in the new simulation : adding a trivial counting module to PSNet does not allow to achieve the same performances.
