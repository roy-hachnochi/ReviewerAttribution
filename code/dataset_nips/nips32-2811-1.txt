In Eqn 4 and Eqn 5, the z_0 should carry an index i for the i^th training example, i.e., the index shows up only in the loss l_i, but not in the dynamics.  In the Neural ODE paper of [8] time dependence is explicitly included in the function f:   dh/dt = f(h, theta, t)  In the architecture, it enters through an extra channel for time. While the coupled ODE formulation of the paper is elegant, It is unclear whether this mechanism of introducing time-varying weights is better and if so precisely why.  The paper grounds its motivation through the observations in [9]: "other discretization schemes such as RK2 or RK4, or using more time steps does not affect the generalization performance of the model". However, it is not made precisely clear how the ANODEv2 approach resolves these problems.  The reference to Turings paper on The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis has the wrong year.  The diffusion-reaction-advection model for convolutional weights is interesting and worthwhile to study in greater detail.   The Baseline in the experiments is not described.   Overall the improvements over Neural ODE seem smallish but consistent.  Which integrators are used in the implementation? Timings are not reported.
