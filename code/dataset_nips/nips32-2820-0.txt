The paper presented a new approach for working with strategies in sequential decision making problems. The new algorithm using the approach advances the state of the art for that class of problems, although the practical applications might be limited by the requirement of no chance events.  The writing was fairly clear, although this paper does seem a bit cramped: there were a number of things I wish could have been expanded. That said, I don't think there is room without cutting or condensing something else, and the results stand well enough on their own that the paper should still be published as is. (Consider an expanded journal version?)
