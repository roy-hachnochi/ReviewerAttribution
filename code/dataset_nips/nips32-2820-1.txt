This is a well written paper with a original and significant contribution. Paper is well referenced and written very clearly. I very much appreciate that authors include the small running examples before the full construction. This makes it much easier to comprehend the ideas - and authors generally do a really good job trying to get the idea through rather than just jumping to formal constructions.  The only weaker part of the paper is the evaluation section, which feels a little rushed and cramped.
