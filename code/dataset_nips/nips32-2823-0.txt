I doubt the applicability of the work to real-world problems. It involves constructing systems of rectangles around points in input space, a potentially tedious task. The authors should explain more how this is actually done, and why it doesn't represent a computational bottleneck for the proposal.  I didn't check the technical details in the paper, but they appear sound from afar.  Typos: 165: Typo "been been" --> "been" line 174: series ==> sequences
