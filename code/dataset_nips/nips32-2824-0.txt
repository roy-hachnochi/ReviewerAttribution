Edit after author response <<< No concerns after respons and proposed changes for camera ready. I would still like to see OOMD results in addition to the discussion proposed in the response. >>>  Given the amount of theory, the paper was fairly clearly written. It extends the recent optimistic regret minimization framework to sequential decision making strategies (treeplexes) -- extending the state of the art for a moderately popular theoretical framework.  The paper uses the optimistic regret framework with two saddlepoint solving algorithms, and compares the game solving algorithms to a currently used algorithm CFR+, showing at least one game instance suggesting CFR+ is asymptotically worse in the worst case.
