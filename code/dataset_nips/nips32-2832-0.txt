Originality: The main and novel contribution of this paper is showing how to exploit/embrace the non-convergence of MCMC to learn interesting models.  Related work is well cited, and it is clear how it differs from previous approach like contrastive divergence and moment matching GANs.  There are also interesting connections to energy based dynamics to models used in neuroscience.  Quality: The authors have come up with an interesting novel strategy of embracing what was seen as undesired property (non-convergent etc MCMC), and built a complete and interesting work exploring the results of said strategy . The paper appears technically sound and it should be possible to recreate their model and results from the descriptions in the paper (ignoring the fact that the code is already provided).   The paper also does a good job of exploring the connection to the related work.  Minor correction:  Line 136 - "a deterministic" -> "made deterministic".  Clarity: The paper was clearly written and understandable..  A minor improvement for Section 4 would be to start by clearly stating that the FRAME model would will be examined first as stronger statements can be made in the restricted regime.  Significance: The significance of the paper is potentially quite high as it may unlock deeper connections between EBM, MCMC and more general CNN approaches.  It is also a quite simple algorithm, but still exhibits competitive results.  It might also yield insights into why existing methods like CD work despite not having convergence in their MCMC chains.
