the paper provides an interesting statistical justification of the short-run MCMC. it views the short-run MCMC as a generative model, with initial image as the latent variable, uniform noise as prior, and the Langevin dynamics as network. this is an interesting formulation.  I have three major comments.   one is on why short-run MCMC can reconstruct the observed images and interpolating different images. is it due to the "short-run" property that allows short-run MCMC for good reconstruction? it is due to the choice of a fixed K? how does the theoretical argument in the paper help justify this?  while the theoretical argument says that the short-run MCMC is preferrable because the short-run MCMC does not need to have the EBM as the stationary distribution. however the empirical results in tables 2 and 3 still favor large K. does it mean short-run MCMC still favors stationary distribution?  the short-run MCMC also appears closely related to Monte Carlo EM, where it is common to run MCMC for a fixed number of steps in the E-step without reaching a stationary distribution. does the theoretical results of Monte Carlo EM directly apply to short-run MCMC here?
