Originality - The work primarily builds on Koh and Liang's Influence functions work and extends it to evaluating influence over non-random groups of examples instead of single examples. The work is an interesting analytical extension of influence functions work. Contributions and related work are clearly specified and justified.   Quality - The theoretical analyses appears sound although I did not go through the proofs in exact detail. The analyses shows empirical as well as theoretically the gaps in estimating influence using Koh and Liang's methods when used to analyze group effects. The analyses is mostly carried out in the regime where a large fraction of samples are removed. The analyses uses newton approximation of influence functions to bound a decomposition of the actual and estimated influence.    Clarity - The paper is well written, comprehensive and empirical evaluation is adequate.  Significance - The work in and of itself is interesting but significance to the field is low. Nonetheless the analyses has important implications of explainability and other related fields.
