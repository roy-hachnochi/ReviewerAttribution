# Originality  As far as I can tell, the proposed use of influence functions is new. The experimental design, theoretical analysis, and case studies also appear to be novel.  # Quality  I think this paper is very well done. The empirical results are thorough, and the limitations of the theoretical analysis are clearly discussed.  # Clarity  The paper is well written; I enjoyed reading it.  # Significance  Several recent papers in the ML community have focused on influence functions. The paper presents another use for influence functions, and the case studies at the end of the paper make a compelling case for why group effect estimates are valuable. The paper also presents interesting new empirical and theoretical analyses that will likely be useful in other papers that study influence functions.
