(1) Originality: This work shows a new data generation method, part-level identity shufﬂing technique. However, learning disentangled representation is not a new method in person reID field. ID-related or -unrelated feature learning is also similar to previous works, e.g. DG-Net ([1] Joint Discriminative and Generative Learning for Person Re-identification). ID-related or -unrelated feature is a different kind representation form of the structure and appearance features in [1]. The training strategy and most of loss functions of these two works are similar too. (2) Quality: The claim of this work can be supported by the ablation study in the experiments. The method achieves good performance on the widely-used dataset. There is no analysis of bad case, but it does not matter. (3) Clarity: Well-written. It’s easy to read.  (4) Significance: This work may inspire future work to a certain extent, but it is limited to design new generation methods. The main contribution of this paper, disentangled representation, is similar to previous works.
