(See improvements below.)  AFTER READING REBUTTAL: The rebuttal bumped my score up a bit; thanks, authors, for addressing some concerns.  I do think the relation to related literature is still a little light, as I mentioned in my review, and would appreciate seeing better placement in newer versions of the paper.  Also, point (1) -- another discussion-based point -- should be addressed.
