- In terms of originality, the main contribution of the paper is the introduction of the ODE-RNN, which is novel if not extremely original. This model is a natural application of the Neural ODE. It does extend in an elegant fashion previous approaches for irregularly-sampled time-series [Mozer 17]. The proposed Latent ODE model relying on ODE-RNN is an immediate extension of the work of [Chen 18], and is less original than the ODE-RNN.  - Clarity: overall, the paper is well written and easy to follow.  - Quality: poor. The main concerns I have for this paper are related to the experimental section. The toy experiments are poorly conducted, are not convincing and bring little insight into the qualitative properties of the model. Interpolation and extrapolation errors are mildly convincing - see detailed remarks. The only convincing experiment is the classification task on the PhysioNet dataset.  - Significance: the ideas proposed in this paper could be quite significant, since the problem addressed arises in many time-series applications.   ** Update after the authors' response** I thank the authors for their response. This response addresses several experimental problems listed in the review, especially by providing error bars which help appreciate the significance of their results and raises the quality of the paper. Provided the toy experiments are better explained in the main paper, I vote in favor of accepting this paper.
