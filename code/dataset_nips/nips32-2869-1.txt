Originality: Somewhat. Using SSA-based loss in combination with a new model architecture is perhaps new but it is yet another combination of existing building blocks.   The paper misses an important previous work:  [P1] Yinda Zhang, Thomas Funkhouser. Deep Depth Completion of a Single RGB-D Image. CVPR 2018   which should be reviewed and included into the comparison.   Quality: The paper execution is reasonable. I would not be able to reproduce it without the source code and data but that is common situation with many DL papers.   Clarity: I found the paper quite hard to read, in particular section 3.2 and graphs and tables in Experimental part. Many tables (eg 1,2,3,4,5)have no units. False color visualizations, eg Fig 6, are only very qualitative and do allow to really compare performances of the methods.   Significance: Medium. The method seems to work somewhat better than other methods but is not compared with all very relevant methods. The model is a combination of existing elements but reasonably engineered.
