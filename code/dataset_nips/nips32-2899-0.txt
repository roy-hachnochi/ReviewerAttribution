originality, significance: I am not sufficiently familiar with the contextual literature to deeply judge these aspects. However the ability to preserve sparsity over similar methods with such convergence guarantees is significant.  quality: The quality seems high, but I wonder about the lack of error bars. How does the method react to random initializations? The large number of datasets makes me not worry too much about that-- but it seems like you did more than sufficient number of experiments to generate such uncertainty estimates so why aren't they shown?  clarity: The writing is very clear and a pleasure to read.  ==================================== ==================================== Thank you for your thorough response and for including the error bars.
