In summary, I like the rationale for doing this but the problem domain is so restricted its hard for me to see the path forward to more realistic settings, with stochastic dynamics and dense rewards.  Each of those two seems to break the algorithm by itself.  A smaller comment: It is common to present "the algorithm" in one place as pseudocode.  This paper doesn't have it and I think it would help the presentation.
