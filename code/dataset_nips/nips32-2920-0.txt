The paper is well organized and written. First an important problem is discussed, then theoretical bounds are given to address this problem, driven by which a new algorithm is proposed.  However, there are some questions need more explanations. (1) Why do you restrict the analysis to the hypothesis families of regression trees and say your results can be extended to other families? (2) Although it says running time of RGB per thread is comparable to that of standard GB, Iâ€™m worried about the efficiency of RGB. It would be better if running time of the experiments are given and compared. (3) There is only one algorithm GB compared with RGB. If RGB is able to beat many other algorithms across different datasets, it would be considered to be more practical.
