[UPDATE] Given the authors' response (which I find instructive and promising for the final version), I raise my score to a clear accept.  The paper presents a novel method for recommendation with collaborative filtering based on Markov Random Fields (MRF). Starting from a general approach that regresses the full graph of items, the paper shows that a valid approximation can be obtained by proceeding with subgraphs that represent Markov blankets of an initial set of items. This approach yields significant computing gains, while yielding better recommendation performance compared to the state-of-the-art represented here by variational auto-encoders.   ** Originality **  The paper presents original work on the topic with a new approach which generalises well to various datasets.  As a general comment, I am wondering whether taking into account the popularity bias makes sense in the approach and if the authors thought about it.  ** Quality **  I find this work to be of good quality overall. The claims are well supported by theoretical analysis.  The experimental results are well documented and use well-known and appropriate datasets.  Since the paper presents a new algorithm, I hope that the code will be submitted if the paper is accepted.  It would have been nice to see the code during review, although the description of the algorithm in section 3.2 is clear and detailed.  ** Significance **  The results are convincing in terms of performance and computing gains. There are benefits both in terms of recommendation performance and computing time.  The state-of-the-art used as a benchmark is valid (variational auto encoders).  The choice if 1,000 as a parameter (line 141) seems a bit arbitrary.  It might be useful to explain how this parameter was chosen and if it impacts the results significantly.  ** Clarity **  The method is presented in a clear and concise way.  The authors acknowledge the fact that there is no proof of convergence, but illustrate the method in details on several reference datasets. The paper is well organised and clearly written.    For the sake of clarity, it might be worth explaining how X is built early in section 2.2 as opposed to mentioning it only in section 5.
