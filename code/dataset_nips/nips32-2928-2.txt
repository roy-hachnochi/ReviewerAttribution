The paper is interesting and it is well-written. The methodology, algorithms, and results are easy to read and clear. My only concern is that this paper lack a solid theory. I believe that rather than yet another new algorithm that seems to work well, the community is mature enough for deeper theoretical results which are absent from this paper.
