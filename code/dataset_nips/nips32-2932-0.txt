The paper presents the outcome of reproduction efforts of 255 prior studies, analyzing the relation of success of reproduction and approximately 25 features (some quantitative, some more subjective/qualitative) extracted from these papers. The authors present and discuss the features that predict reproducibility significantly, as well as those that are not found significantly effective despite (authors') expectations (e.g., conceptualization figures, or step-by-step examples presented in the paper).  The paper is well written, and I found the discussion insightful.  The analyses of the data is based on traditional statistical testing. Despite some shortcomings (e.g., biased sample - also acknowledged by the authors), this is a rather large-scale study, and it contributes  to the ongoing discussion on replicability/reproducibility in the field. The main weakness of the study is the biased sample.  ------- After author response: Thank you for your response. Additional discussion/information suggested will improve the paper, and my "automatic text classification" suggestion was not realistic to incorporate in this paper anyway.    After reading other reviews and author response,  I (still) think that this paper provides valuable data and may stimulate important/useful discussion in the field. I believe it should be accepted.
