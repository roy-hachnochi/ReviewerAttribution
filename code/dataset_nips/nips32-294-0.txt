the technical novelty of the paper is moderate. I can see some small differences between the proposed method and conditional BN or dynamic filters. my concern is that there is too much engineering for this task in terms of finding temporal dimensions, feature types and hyperparameters. However, empirically, the method shows promising results on three datasets.  some related work are missing e.g.  Gavrilyuk et al. Actor and Action Video Segmentation from a Sentence.
