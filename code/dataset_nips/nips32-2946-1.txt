1. This may be a good idea, but the evaluation is too simple to meet the acceptance threshold. I think this may be a good technique, but without extensive evaluation, it is not convincing. All the experiments are performed on UCI/Synthetic datasets, instead of larger benchmarks like previous work, e.g., RCGAN.  2. In your main text, I do not see you explain what S and X is, and I need to guess. There are many unclear points in your paper, that I need to refer related works to figure it out.  3. The evaluation metrics are not convincing, with two trained models. This is a critical issue, please find a way to fix it.
