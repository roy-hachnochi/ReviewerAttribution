Quality: The overall approach proposed by the paper seems to be technically sound. One weakness of the proposed AGEM is that the result is sensitive to the sigma in the proposal distribution in MH-E step. I wonder if the authors tried other MCMC sampling algorithms, such as HMC, or adaptive MH proposals (such as Haario et al 2001). Overall, the paper did a great job of clearly stating the experimental details, make the results reproducible.   Clarity: The paper well-written and easy to follow. The details of the datasets and experiments are well documented.   Originality:  The proposed AGEM algorithm for simultaneously solving linear inverse problem and estimating noise level is novel to my knowledge.
