Originality: The primary contribution is a tighter bound. From skimming, this comes from using a bernstein style bound so when the variance is small, there can be a tighter rate.   Quality: The paper is reasonably well written and the claims appear correct. I did not check the proofs.  Clarity: The paper is reasonably well-organized. It is still difficult to follow because it requires the reader to be familiar with Zhou and Feng though it is concisely summarized.  Significance: Unclear. The primary contribution seems to be an improved boosting style algorithm that removes a sqrt. The experiments are completely unconvincing.
