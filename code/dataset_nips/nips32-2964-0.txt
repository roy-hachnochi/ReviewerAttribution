Update after reading the rebuttal and discussion with other reviewers: I feel my background knowledge is not enough for giving a strong support for this submission, therefore I decreased my score.  ------- I should admit that I am not familiar with this area.  Originality: Good. I think the notion of minimum supervision ratio is interesting and novel. Moreover, they can use a hyperparameter lambda to denote control the quality of the unlabeled data. And their results subsumes the cluster assumption, which is widely used by semi-supervised learning papers.   Quality: Good. I did not check the proofs in the appendix. But the statements look reasonable to me, and the logic flow is clear and convincing. The authors clearly discussed existing results as special cases of their result, e.g. the cluster assumption.   Clarify: Good. This paper is nicely presented and structured.   Significance: Good. Semi-supervised learning is widely used in practice, and it is important to have theoretical understanding of the algorithms and sample complexity. Therefore I think this paper is a nice contribution to this topic, and many people in the NeurIPS community will be interested.
