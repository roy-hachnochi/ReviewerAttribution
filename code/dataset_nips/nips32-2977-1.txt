This paper investigates the class of tensor decompositions in CNNs and demonstrates them with hypergraphical structures. The experimental evaluation is thorough and captures well the comparison of various methods. Overall, the paper is quite easy to follow. The text is clear and the figures help clarify concepts. Appropriate motivations are clearly stated in the introduction of the paper. I believe the paper will lead some perspective on tensor and hypergraph study. However, I have some concerns below.  1. Why not make comparisons of all methods in each figure? 2. What does the black circle mean in each figureï¼Ÿ  Minor comments: - In Figures 3 and 5, some symbol markers are not clear. I think the authors should plot them after black circles. - In page 3, line 93, "in a clearn manner" should be "in a clear manner".
