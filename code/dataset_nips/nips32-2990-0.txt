This paper studies an important problem, adaptive influence maximization, in social network analysis. This problem was first formally considered by Golovin and Krause but very few theoretical results have been found since then. The results provided in this paper are solid and may have a significant impact on this area.  First, the upper bound of the adaptive gap is the first result of this kind concerning the adaptive influence maximization problem. As a corollary, the approximation ratio of the simple adaptive greedy algorithm under the myopic model can be confirmed as at least 0.25*(1-1/e), which, as mentioned in the paper, solves the conjecture of Golovin and Krause. The proof is obtained based on a novel construction of an intermediate seeding strategy.   Second, the author also provides the lower bound based on sophisticated construction, which, more importantly, opens a question of how to fill the gap between the upper and lower bound.  Finally, the authors provide the upper bound of the approximation ratio of the greedy strategy under the myopic feedback model. The proof indicates that myopic feedback does not help adaptive greedy, or from another perspective, adaptivity does not fundamentally useful under myopic feedback. The results here immediately lead future research to investigate better feedback models.  I have thoroughly checked all the proofs and to my best believe they are sound.
