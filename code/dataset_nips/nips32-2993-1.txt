Originality:  I believe the quantization approach proposed in this paper is novel, and provides a new general framework to quantize sparse CNNs.  Quality:  The overall quality of this paper is good. The experimental results are detailed and provide solid support to the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, I think the experimental section can be further strengthen by considering more datasets.  Clarity:  The paper is very well-written. In particular, it shows the intuition behind the proposed method, and how the proposed method relates to existing machine learning frameworks such as minimum description length optimization.  Significance:  I believe the paper shows promising results on addressing the problem of quantizing sparse CNNs.
