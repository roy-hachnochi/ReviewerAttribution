- It is not clear to me why one should care about a problem introduced by this paper. The authors put no words on introducing the physical background of the markov reward setting. I think motivation is important especially when the setting is not something that naturally exists: the scalar-exponential-family-parameterized markov chain looks artificial. It would help if the authors can explain why such setting is interesting to study.  - It seems to me that given the concentration result in line 148, everything (lower bound, algorithm, and upper bound) directly follows [GK16]. It is not clear to me if there is anything interesting brought by the markov reward setting, regarding the problem structure revealed by the bound, challenges or techniques in the analysis.  - The writing structure needs improvement. The actual problem setting is introduced on page 5 and even after reading the setting it takes me quite while to figure out what are the arms and what are the rewards. That said, the writing of theoretical statements looks clear.   -------------------- update after reading the rebuttal:  The authors pointed out a contribution I missed in my initial review - the finite sample concentration result. Although I still think the motivation for the problem setting is not very convincing and the results are a bit unsurprising from a practical point of view, I appreciate the technical clarity of this paper and that the authors work through all the theoretical results in a new best arm identification setting. I have increased my score accordingly.
