     Originality     The work is in some ways similar to Yang and Wang but takes different approaches and derives different insights. Originality is good.     Quality     I find the quality very good; the work is thorough and the experimental results are appropriate to their purpose, which is to illustrate the theory rather than to provide state-of-the-art applied results.     l.119 "The best approximator..." - There are many definitions of a "best approximator." Please give some insight to the reader on why this particular definition of "the best approximator" was chosen.     Throughout: "Lem." and "Thm." are used inconsistently with inconsistent spacing. Just write them out.     l.150 - "minimizing ... and lower" - "minimizing ... and lowering"     l.298 "represent well action-value functions" - "represent action-value functions well"     The paper is very well written. I have a few specific comments.     Significance     As indicated above, I think the ideas will be influential in future work on limited-data RL problems.  *** I have read the author response and I appreciate their clarifications.
