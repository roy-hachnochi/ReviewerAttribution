Post rebuttal:  Thanks to the authors for their rebuttal.  Although the other reviewers raised some additional concerns regarding the description of the algorithm and impact of parameters, I think the rebuttal addressed them satisfactorily, and I'll keep my current rating.  Summary: This work introduces a loss that encourages topological correctness for image segmentation models.  It does this by comparing the persistent homology diagrams of a predicted probability map and the corresponding ground truth.  This requires finding the best mapping of the birth/death diagrams of each and computing the squared distance.  This results in a differentiable loss (given a fixed matching), which can be optimized during training.   Originality: This appears to be a novel application of persistent homology for a segmentation loss.  I believe it's nontrivial to translate homologies to a loss that can optimized with gradient descent, and a nice step away from per-pixel or heuristic losses for preserving topology.  Clarity: Overall, the paper does an excellent job introducing the basics ideas of topology and persistent homology though the text and Figures 2,3,4.  The figures are particularly good at conveying the concepts.  Significance:  This work leads to considerable gains in metrics related to topological consistency.  This should be of great interest to any segmentation tasks where per-pixel losses don't capture the structure of the task.  It will be interesting to see ways this loss can be extended in future work.   Some interesting directions for further exploration: 1) How well does this work if the cross entropy loss is turned off or downweighted?  What is the relative importance of the two losses, and how sensitive is the performance to the relative weighting? 2) Related, suppose there is misalignment (or other errors in the geometry) between the ground truth and training images.  Could the topological loss be used to be more robust to these geometry errors?
