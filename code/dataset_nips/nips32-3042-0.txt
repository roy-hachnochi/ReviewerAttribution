Originality: As far as I know, this is the first paper to study the theory of online Markov decoding rigorously.  Quality: The results our sound.  Clarity: The paper is well-written overall. However the lower bounds are in a form that makes it a bit hard to compare them with the upper bounds.  Significance: Markov decoding is an important scientific tool. Designing fast algorithms for this problem is imperative in my humble opinion.  --- Edit --- Lowered score following comments from other reviewers.
