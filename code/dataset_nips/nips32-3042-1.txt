The algorithm uses a discounted reward for lookahead observed tokens (of size L) and runs dynamic programming (similar to Viterbi) to decode the current state.  The discounted reward is the key to obtain the provable bounds, however, I believe the authors have not emphasized its importance enough and it is more implicit inside the proofs.  At line 228, authors mentioned beam search, similar to Viterbi, requires to compute the optimal path of the full sequence. Beam search is a greedy approach and for beam size of k, only looks at the k top recent paths for decoding.   In general, I liked the idea, but I guess the paper requires polishing and better presentation to deliver its message more clearly. The paper could benefit from having a clear algorithm (pseudo-code).  ======== I increased my score based on the provided feedback and other reviews.
