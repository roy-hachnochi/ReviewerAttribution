Originality:  This paper mainly proposes two things:  1. Generate weights of CNNs from the input semantic label for the generator.  2. Use feature pyramids throughout the network (i.e., in both generator and discriminator)  I think this combination is new for the semantic image synthesis task.  Related studies are well cited and the paper is different enough from them.  Quality:  The method is reasonable and the idea to use separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters makes sense. The proposed method is compared with previous methods and better results are reported.  One thing is that the author claims that their method is better than SPADE, but the comparison is done for the original implementation of SPADE but not for the idea. I think that it should be possible to estimate the scaling parameters instead of the CNN weights using the same network. It would be valuable to perform such experiments.  Clarity:  The paper is easy to follow and understand.   I personally prefer to see more explanations on each loss term. It is not always very clear what is actually used by knowing the name of the loss (e.g. perceptual or FM).  Significance:  The proposed method is reasonable given the current state of the arts and the combination seems novel. I expect that this will attract researchers working on similar fields.
