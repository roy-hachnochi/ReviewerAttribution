This paper propose a VAE-based model to learn disentangled representations based on user behavior, including both macro one and micro one. They model user representation as latent variable z, item representation as condition c, and user-item interactions as x. The whole paper is well-organized and well written. It is very easy to follow and understand. They compare MacridVAE with state of art collaborative filtering approaches, and demonstrate superiority of their method.  But, we can find too many assumptions in the paper, like independence and sufficient assumptions. It would be great if the authors can provide more insights about why such assumptions important. Since one item may fall into more than one categories.   Hierarchical recommendation algorithms are not new to the community,  it is not clear how such disentangled representation differ from them, and what the superiority of using disentangled representations. It seems that disentangled representation is just a two-level representation.  Another confusing thing is the setting of parameter K. Is it always set to ground truth value? What if we do not know the ground truth value?  I have read authors' response, and I tend to increase the score.
