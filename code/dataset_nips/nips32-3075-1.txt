Originality:  - The task is not new. The proposed approach is in line with some of the prior art, but the specific approach is new. Related work is fairly cited.   Quality:  - the technique appears to be technically sound. - claims are well supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results - this is a complete piece of work.   - Choosing the number of components K: May be I missed this, but I think the paper does not discuss how to choose K, what happens if the chosen K is way off from the actual K. Figure 2 and Figure 3 are with K = 7 which it appears is the number of ground truth categories for that dataset.  line 209: we do not constrain the dimension of user representations since they are not parameters. I am not sure I understand this / agree with this, especially when comparing different methods.    Clarity:  - the paper is well written and well organized.   Significance:  - The contributions of the paper are relevant and significant.  - the authors will also be releasing a new recommendation ratings dataset.   I have carefully considered the authors' response. The rebuttal looks fair. But my question was more like a clarification. So, it doesn't change my scores.
