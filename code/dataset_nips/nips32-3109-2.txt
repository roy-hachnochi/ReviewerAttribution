The paper shows why image inpainting (or more generally "co-generation", though the non-toy experiments in the paper are all about inpainting) is not straightforward using GANs. It then proposes a new optimization method to solve the inpainting problem and convincingly demonstrates that it outperforms a naive approach. The paper is clearly written and easy to understand, though slightly sloppy in some places (see details below). I believe the contribution is probably meaningful enough to be accepted.  My main criticism is that the paper only compares against a naive baseline, but does not adequately compare against alternative methods for inpainting. I'm not an expert in this topic, but googling "GAN inpainting" yields multiple seemingly relevant papers that this paper could compare against.  The writing is slightly sloppy and imprecise in places. Annealed importance sampling is misspelled on page 3. The experiments in section 4 compare against "SGD", but it looks like this is just (non-stochastic) gradient descent.  EDIT: following the reviewer discussion I recommend this paper to be accepted for a poster presentation
