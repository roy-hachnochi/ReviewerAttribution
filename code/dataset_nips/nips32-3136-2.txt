1)    This paper is well-written, the goal and motivation are well-clarified and convincing. Overall it is easy to follow.         2)    It is very nice to see that the methodology is strictly organized under solid theoretical analysis and discussion. Moreover, we see sufficient empirical studies as well, where we can observe some interesting results and visualization.  3) Last but not least, I have to say that what attracts me most is the insights this paper brings to me.  It does not merely give a new regularizer for leveraging heterogenous block diagonal structure. More importantly, it also brings a new wind by bridging the Laplacian-based structural learning problem with the optimal transport problem. In my opinion, this suggests that leveraging the expected structural sparsity could then be regarded as a matching problem across latent tasks and output tasks.
