The theoretical contribution of this paper (Section 2) is solid and neatly extends the work of Tsipras et al. (ICLR, 2019) to simultaneous robustness to multiple perturbations.  The empirical work about comparison of different attacks and simultaneous robustness of models to them is also interesting, and raises important questions (e.g., multi-perturbation robust models for MNIST and CIFAR 10).  The presentation is clear, and I personally liked the problem and their results.
