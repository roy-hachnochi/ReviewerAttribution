interesting approach to contextual bandits by combining Lasso type methods with doubly-robust technique to handle missing data.   The presentation of the paper needs some improvement, e..g, the relation between the sparse linear model used in Section 3 to the orginal bandit model (1) should be sharpened.   It would be nice to put the obtained regret bounds into context of fundamental lower bounds, e.g. obtained in the context of adaptive compressed sensing  E. Arias-Castro, E. J. Candes and M. A.
