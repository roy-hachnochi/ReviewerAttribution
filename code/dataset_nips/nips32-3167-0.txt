Originality: This model is primarily composed of two main modifications to the original Glow model. The first modification is what makes it "masked". Instead of modeling the entire image as in glow, MaCow creates a semi-autoregressive model by allowing dependencies solely within a specific area using masked convolutions. This allows more efficient inference (effectively O(h) or O(w), rather than O(hw)) than a completely autoregressive model and higher quality modeling than a completely non-autoregressive model. Additionally, they tweak Glow to have more output latent channels in every scale that is being modeled, as is depicted in Figure 2c. Besides these two modifications, the model and setup greatly resembles that of the original Glow paper for image synthesis.  Clarity: The paper is clear. However, the fine-grained architecture and the dequantization could be explained significantly more clearly.  Significance: This work describes an intermediate between fully autoregressive and non-autoregressive flow models. Autoregressive models tend to be better at density estimation, so somewhat naturally this model achieves better results on density estimation.
