The paper presents a new way to analyze multi-task learning algorithms in the online setting by analysing average regret-upper-bound. The authors introduce a two-level algorithm that runs a mirror descent algorithm for each task and adjusts the parameters of the mirror descent before each new task by running another online learning algorithm on the level of tasks. This task-level algorithm is designed to minimize theoretical regret bounds for each task.  The authors prove a general bound on the performance of the presented algorithm and show its corollaries for settings with static and dynamic comparators. A version of the algorithm for different task similarity measures is also presented, as well as, an online-to-batch conversion result for learning-to-learn setting with i.i.d. tasks. In the end, an empirical evaluation is presented that shows an improved performance when ARUBA applied to few-shot classification and federated learning settings.  Pros: * A new approach for multi-task learning by analysing average regret-upper-bound * A general performance bound (Theorem 1) that can be applied to a variety of settings * Interesting decomposition of (2) into two online learning problem that can be studied separately * Proof in the static environment case for non-convex Bregman divergencies * Interesting extension with inter-task geometry (Section 4)  Cons: * Complicated and overloaded notations: too many versions of regret and bounds with very similar symbols, the sequence of \psi_t for dynamic regret is not defined for notations of Theorem 3.1. * The paper is missing a detailed discussion/examples of the behaviour of V_\Psi, which makes it's hard to judge the sensibility of the proven bounds.  AFTER FEEDBACK: I had only minor comments and authors addressed them. My evaluation stays the same and I recommend the paper for acceptance.
