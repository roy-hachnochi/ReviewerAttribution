Originality: There is a lot of papers studying regularized RL problems (cited by this paper). Regularization can introduce many good properties to the solution of the MDPs. This paper proposes a generalized framework that includes most of the previously studied regularization based methods. This framework can lead to effective understanding of which regularizer is sparsity-generating. To my knowledge, I believe this paper contains sufficient originality.  Quality: I did not check the proof line by line. But it appears to be correct. The experimental results also make sense. The study is quite complete.  Clarity: This paper is well-written and is of publishing quality.  Significance: The paper gives a good study of the regularized framework of solving MDPs. It provides some interesting understanding of the regularizers. I believe it is sufficiently significant to be accepted.  Minor comments: * What does it mean by "multi-modality"?
