The authors propose a set of models and inference algorithms to model the evolution of topics over time. The proposed set of models are novel in terms of both the generative models and inference techniques. The novelty in generative models is achieved by representing a set of topics at a given time as a topic polytope and modeling evolution of topics as trajectories in the geometric space of the polytopes. The proposed inference approach is fast and scalable, and lends itself well to online learning and distributed computing. The authors describe the motivation for the generative process and the algorithms in sufficient detail. The supplement further elaborates on inference details and sensitivity to priors. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in perplexity and significant speed ups in run time. The major contributions are clear and significantly advance the state of research.
