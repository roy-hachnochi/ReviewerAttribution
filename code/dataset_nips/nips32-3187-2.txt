This is a very well written paper, both in style and substance. There are a few stylistic peculiarities that could surely be ruled out by thorough proof-reading. The authors present a nice introduction into the idea of modelling sets of topics, i.e. sets of points on a simplex, as the geometric structure of a polytope. They go on to describe, how evolution of such a polytope can be modelled over time by embedding a unit hypersphere into the simplex and modelling polytope evolution as random trajectories over this sphere. They further present a non-parametric hierarchical model for capturing polytopes with a varying number of topics and also multiple polytopes arising from different corpora. Their experimental section deals with two different data sets, a medium sized one (400k documents) and a large one (3M documents). While the sizes of the corpora are appropriate to demonstrate the performance of the inference algorithm, usage of more well-known corpora such as the NYT corpus would have been beneficial in terms of comparability to previous approaches to the problem. Also, vocabulary truncation to just over 4500 terms from 400k documents and 7300 words from 3M documents seems rather aggressive and needs further elaboration.  Although there is a case study for a certain topic, including probability trajectories for its top words, a more extensive qualitative assessment of model performance would be beneficial. Since topic models are primarily successful because of their interpretability by humans, it is often useful to demonstrate qualitative over quantitative results.
