The main novelty of this work lies in the proposed algorithm for selection of an optimal network architecture, given the pre-defined AL selection criterion. The advantage of this is that this approach can select on-the-fly a potentially less complex model under the same budget, while also attaining improved performance in the classification task. The authors also provide theorethical motivation for this approach using the notion of tight bounds for the VC-dimension of deep neural nets. Experimental validation on three benchmark datasets show improvements (sometimes marginal) over the fixed baseline architectures.   The approach is well presented and the paper is easy to read.
