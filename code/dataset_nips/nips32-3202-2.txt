This paper shows that a perturbed variant of gradient descent on Riemannian manifolds can also escape saddle points efficiently. The assumptions and the preliminaries are clearly described in the paper. The PRGD algorithm for Riemannian manifolds (analogous to PRGD on Euclidean spaces) involves taking one of the two steps: If the gradient is large, then perform gradient descent else perturb and take tau gradient steps along the tangent space. The authors should further discuss setting step-size, perturbation radius and no of perturbation steps in the context of different examples to highlight the practicality of their algorithm.  Post rebuttal: Having read the author's responses, I would like to keep my current score.
