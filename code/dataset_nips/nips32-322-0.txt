After feedback: I stand by my original review and think it's a worthy submisson.  The authors propose a novel lower bound on the ELBO for variational approximations defined by auxiliary random variables. The quality and clarity of the paper is high and the method is interesting. I however have a few comments:  - Lines 56-59, the discussion regarding maximizing the ELBO wrt both sets of parameters was a bit unclear. Maximizing wrt to the variational parameters does minimize the KL, but since the KL depends also on the model parameters it is not necessarily the case that you are maximizing the log-marginal likelihood. Perhaps this was what the authors meant? - Lines 62-65. The result on the connection between self-normalized importance sampling and the ELBO for a more flexible variational approximation was first proved in Naesseth et al. (2018): Naesseth et al., Variational Sequential Monte Carlo, AISTATS, 2018. - The legend in some of the plots is obscuring some information (Fig. 1) - Line 26, "on" -> "in"?
