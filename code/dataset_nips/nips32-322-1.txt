There are some minor issues that can be improved.  (1) The key idea of this work is not so clear.  If my understanding is correct, the authors propose to use an importance weighted  auxiliary variational distribution (See eq 1 & 4).  I ignore the data x for notation simplicity in the following expressions.  In Yin & Zhou 2018, a forward variational distribution is used such as  q(z|\psi_0) \prod_{i=0} q(\psi_i) (see eq 2). In this work, the authors would like to use a backward variational distribution such as q(z) \prod_{i=0} q(\psi_i|z) = q(z|\psi_0)q(\psi_0)\prod_{i=1}q(\psi_i|z) . However, computing q(\psi_i|z)  is intractable, the authors propose to use \tau(\psi_i|z) to approximate  q(\psi_i|z). (see eq 4)  I think the backward approximation (in other words \tau(\psi_i|z) should depend on z) gives the improvement over SIVI .      The key building block for using the importance weight is Thm 1 at Domke & Sheldon 2018, where Domke & Sheldon consider an auxiliary distribution for the model p while in this work the authors use a similar idea of Thm 1 in the hierarchical variational model q such as Yin & Zhou 2018, and Molchanov et al 2018.  (2) I think the proof of the Thm (C.1 in the appendix) in Section 3 is inspired by Molchanov et al 2018. If so, the authors should cite Molchanov et al 2018.   (3) The proof of Lemma C.2 in the appendix can be simplified.  I think it is easy to directly show that \omega (\psi_0:K |z) is normalized. The proof sketch is given below. Let C=  \sum_{k=0}^K q(\psi_k|z) / \tau(\psi_k|z).  We have  \int \omega(\psi_0:K|z) d\psi_0:K  = (K+1) \int  q(\psi_0|z)/\tau(\psi_0|z) \tau(\psi_0:K|z) / C d\psi_0:K  = \sum_{k=0}^{K} \int q(\psi_k|z)/tau(\psi_k|z) \tau(\psi_0:K|z) / C d\psi_0:K (due to the symmetry of these K+1 intergrals) = \int  \sum_{k=0}^{K} q(\psi_k|z)/tau(\psi_k|z) \tau(\psi_0:K|z) / C d\psi_0:K = \int  C \tau(\psi_0:K|z) / C d\psi_0:K = \int \tau(\psi_0:K|z)  d\psi_0:K = 1
