The paper introduces a new family of randomized Newton methods, based on a prototypical Hessian sketching scheme to reduce the memory and arithmetic costs. Clearly, the idea of using a randomized sketch for the Hessian is not new. However, the paper extends the known results in a variety of ways: The proposed method gets linear convergence rate 1) under the relative smoothness and the relative convexity assumptions (and the method is still scale-invariant). 2) The method works practically with all sketching techniques and 3) for any sketch size. These results also include the known results for the Newton method as a special case.   The related work is adequately cited, the similar approaches from the existing literature and their weaknesses are discussed in a short but concise discussion in the paper. The results are technically sound, and these results are explained in a simple and clear way.   The proposed method outperforms the state of the art. The experiments section is well-presented, and the results there support the theoretical findings. Empirical evidence is limited to a logistic regression setup (with a variety of real data). It could have been expanded for some other settings, either in the main text or supplements.   Overall, I enjoyed reading this submission. The paper is very clear about its focus and contributions, and all technical results and the figures are accompanied by discussions and take-home messages. The proposed method can be attractive to the practitioners since it is scale invariant (hence no tuning or preconditioning) and it outperforms the baseline. I recommend the acceptance of this paper.    Some minor comments:  - There is a typo in footnote 4 on page 5. - "n" is defined as the Newton direction in (5). It is also used to denote the number of data points in pages 6-7. Consider changing one of these to avoid confusion. - line 259: "out run" or "outrun"? - [12] and [13] are the same papers the bibliography  ========== After author feedback ========== I have read the author feedback and takin it into account in my final scores.
