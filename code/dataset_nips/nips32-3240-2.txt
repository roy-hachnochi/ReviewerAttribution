Originality: This paper is mostly about empirical analysis. Although there's not much originality in algorithmic proposals, it provides a critical view of the current methods. After all they also achieve SoTA on some alignment language pairs.   Quality: This paper looks at the current methods for embedding alignment with a critical eye -- to see what really works best using the same pairs of languages. The summary of related work is quite illuminating.   Clarity: The paper is very well written and very clear, at least for someone who are somewhat familiar with embeddings and word alignment.   Significance: I think researchers and practitioners will find this useful.
