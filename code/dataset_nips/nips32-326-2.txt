Overall I think this paper presents an interesting idea in improving exploration and stability of PPO. The idea is very well presented and authors include both rigorous theoretical analysis and rich empirical experiments.  Pro: 1. The idea for this paper is really well presented. The structure of the paper is well organized and the authors include simple examples and illustrations to help make the argument easily understandable. Starting by analyzing the shortcomings of PPO, the authors naturally introduce the improvement and thus make the paper easy to read.  2. The authors provide rigorous theoretical justification for the shortcomings of PPO and how the improvements in TRGPPO fix the problem. The authors also include intuitive explanation for all the theoretical results which makes the results easy to understand,  3. This paper also includes rich empirical evidence for the proposed algorithm. Besides reward performance, the authors also present analysis for some important metrics of the algorithm, which agree with the theoretical results.  Con: 1. Some mathematical formulae in the paper could be better formatted. Particularly, the expressions in theorem 1 and theorem 2 could be aligned.  2. While the paper includes comparison to PPO with a single large clipping rate in section 6, it would be interesting to compare to the performance of PPO with an optimal constant clipping rate.   The idea in this paper is well presented and thoroughly investigated. Overall I think the idea is novel and the contribution is significant. Despite minor flaws, I recommend publication of this paper.
