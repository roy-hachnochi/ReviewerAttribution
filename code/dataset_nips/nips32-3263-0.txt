This paper provides an interesting new method for neural network architecture search by encoding knowledge about constraints in IoT devices. As such the authors are able to search many more architectures than previous works because they do not need to train as many networks to find the best ones for the IoT use case, and they are able to find networks which provide higher accuracy under the same latency / memory constraints as compared to previous work.  This paper contains several typographical errors (35$ instead of $35), and some other errors, for example their definition of "half" and "float" in Section 3.2 is backwards. These errors are minor and do not significantly detract from the paper's content.  There are also some small issues with clarity. The last paragraph in Section 3.1 is one sentence, which makes it hard to read. Also, what exactly is the relationship between the manual and automatic workflows? How do they interact with each other? And within the automatic workflow, what is the difference between the automatic search and "random configuration" as shown in Figure 4? This figure in particular was hard to understand.  Overall, the paper is an interesting contribution, however I am unsure of the significance of the contribution, as it does not seem like that much of an improvement over the cited previous works.
