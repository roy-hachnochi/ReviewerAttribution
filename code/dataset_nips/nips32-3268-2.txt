Originality: The work proposes a new technique based on outlier scoring for robust estimation and it intuitively builds on the ideas of previous works. This can also be used for outlier detection. It also cites the related works adequately. Because of being the first (nearly) linear time algorithm, I think it scores well on originality.  Quality:         Experiments: I think there should be more experiments for robust mean estimation (see the improvements section for comments on this).        Proofs: The authors have provided proofs for their claims. I found a few typos (see the improvement section for comments on this). I also have one question for the authors - for inequality (b) in (21) how did you bound \|\rho\|_2 \geq 1?  Clarity: The paper is well written and well organized. However, because there are so many symbols and definitions, I would recommend a table pointing to definitions of terms like Goodness of Set,M, U. Also, it would be nice to explicitly define S_r and S_b ( I couldn't find them explicitly defined somewhere.)  Significance: The significance is high because this paper gives the first linear time algorithm for robust mean estimation and the technique used seems intuitive. Because this is linear in time and thus practical, it may benefit the robust machine learning research in a variety of ways.
