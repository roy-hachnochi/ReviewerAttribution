I think the self-adversarial attack observation is quite interesting but not very convinced that the proposed defense techniques are novel enough for the submission. Note self-adversarial attack is not a new observation(as the paper heavily cited), and both defense techniques (adding noise and adding pairwise discriminator) exist in the literature.  Pros: This paper is quite well written and properly summarized the related works. This paper shows significant effort in conducting experiments.  Cons: Novelty is not enough as most of the proposed solution or observations are already published.  Need more insight on the proposed solutions instead of similar to some other works.
