######################################################## After reading the author's response, I retract my concern about knowledge of the strong convexity parameter.   Regarding Figure 3, I am inclined to say that the wall clock plot doesn't seem to add anything to the discussion. Because b=1 is so slow, you can't see anything that is happening with the other lines, and in some sense this seems like an argument for why we should just ignore your paper and use any minibatch size we want as long as it's larger than 1. I would suggest either 1) removing the b=1 line from the plot so we can see what is happening with everything else or 2) removing the plot entirely.   ########################################################  This is a nicely written paper, which extends existing theory of SVRG to cover parameter choices that are commonly made in practice. The proposed algorithms are not a dramatic improvement over SVRG, and they do not claim to be. However, they are somewhat simpler aesthetically, they decouple some of the hyperparameter choices to be more flexible, and the theory applies to any parameter choices.  I see this paper mostly as reassurance for people who use SVRG that the simplifying choices they make (e.g. choosing m = n, sampling without replacement, etc) do not significantly hurt the theory behind the algorithm.   I am not convinced that the ability to optimize b and or m according to the theory would be terribly useful in practice, but it does give some general guidance to what you should do e.g. when Lmax >> L versus when Lmax \approx L.
