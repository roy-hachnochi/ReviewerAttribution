This paper is a joy to read: clear, insightful and well-written. EDIT: I'm happy with how the authors addressed these concerns in the rebuttal.  It is also not starved for space. Given that, perhaps it is a good idea to add a definition of what a uniform error bound is. Readers may have a wrong working definition of it. This is not too severe, as the theorems are rigorously stated and do not _use_ the definition of a uniform bound. However, they _are_ uniform bounds and it would be good to explain why.  In the experiments, you observe the dynamical systems with some noise at every time step, and do regression from one step to the next. This is very sensible, since in a dynamical system, the measurements are usually taken with the same sensors at every step. However, note that doing this violates Assumption 3.1. This is because now you are also observing the _inputs_ of your regression with noise. You observe x_i + ε_i, so you do not know x_i. In practice in the experiments the noise is so small that it does not matter: the bounds can still be heuristically applied, and will be only a little bit incorrect.  Regarding Section 3.3, why is it in the paper? Is it to show off the power of Theorem 3.1? It doesn't seem connected to the rest. As I mentioned earlier, it is unclear how to make sure the variance follows the decrease schedule O(log(N)^(-1/2-ε)). You state that it "depends on the structure of the covariance kernel". It would be good to add an example to this section, using something simple such as the RBF or linear kernel.
