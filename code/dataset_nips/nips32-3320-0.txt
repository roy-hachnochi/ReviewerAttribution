This paper revisited the conception of conditional GAN and proposed to make a deeper analysis of the discrepancy between the data distribution and the model distribution. They measured this discrepancy with the gap of log-density of them. Then they derived an approximated surrogate to implement the gap of log-density by quantifying the contributions of faked samples and labelled samples under the framework of ACGAN. This paper make a clear introduction of their work with some originality and quality. However, one of my concerns is the basic assumption, they choose the gap of log-density as a measure of discrepancy but why not others, for example the relative entropy or other generalized metrics.
