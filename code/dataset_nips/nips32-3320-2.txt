Clarity - The paper is very well written and very clearly structured - Experimental setup is clear and results are well explained  Originality While there are several related methods that use the discriminator for estimating likelihood ratios (e.g., [1], [2], and [3]), the proposed method is specific for the conditional case, and is applied in a new way for modifying training and active learning. The paper clearly states that for rejection sampling is an extension of a similar approach for the unconditional case. In terms of novelty, I think the paper passes the required bar.  Quality - The method used is sound. I think the paper does a good job in addressing the main issues that can arise in the proposed method, such as using sufficiently trained discriminators (line 132-133). - That being said, I think the paper should address better some failure cases, such as the effect of GOLD when training is unstable, e.g. divergence or mode collapse. - Experimental results are generally convincing. I appreciate that the paper applied example re-weighting on 6 image datasets and showed improvement of performance in all of them. - While the paper provides clear justification of using the "fitting capacity" for quantitative evaluation, I still believe that providing FID scored would strengthen results. - One main concern I have with using GOLD in re-weighting examples is that it forces the generator to produce samples that can "fool" a classifier to produce the right class rather than generating a more "realistic" example. I think the paper should address this issue in more detail.  Significance - The paper proposes a method can potentially improve research in conditional GANs  Minor issues: - The GAN loss in Eq. 1 is wrong. The code seems to be using minimax-GAN (i.e., BCE loss for both generator and discriminator).

I think this is a good paper, and I vote for accepting it.
