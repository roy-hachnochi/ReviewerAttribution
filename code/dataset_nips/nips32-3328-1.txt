The core idea is to measure the task relatedness via the similarity of attribution maps. The paper is overall well written and easy to follow. The method poses barely any constraint on the model architectures, requires no labelled data, and is several-magnitude times faster than taskonomy, which makes it very practical. Furthermore, the fact that it enables flexible insertion of new tasks makes the approach more attractive. Some experimental results are very impressive.   It will be better if the authors could show and analyze some bad cases, where two tasks are very related but the corresponding attribution maps are not so similar. The authors should provide more discussions on the rationale behind the fact that, the proposed method works well even the probe data are quite different from the training data of the trained models.   In the experiments, SVCCA seems to be working well. Whatâ€™s the advantage of the proposed method over SVCCA?
