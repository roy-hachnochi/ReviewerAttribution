The paper does a nice job at reviewing some of the existing work for improving image quality and stabilizing the training. The PA method is novel and surprisingly effective, with performance demonstrated over a wide range of datasets and is complementary to existing methods. The theoretical investigation of PA is a welcome addition. I am particularly pleased that the authors developed the means for automatic (metric based) scheduling of the difficulty progression. This is the kind of detail that is often left to a hand tweaked schedule which makes reimplementation and adaption much more difficult, the work spent here will definitely benefit future research.  The paper is to the point and easy to read. I expect that the method may even have applications outside of those investigated, where the gap in difficulty between the discriminator and generator is larger.
