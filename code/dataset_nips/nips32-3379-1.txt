I have read the author's response and appreciate the proof provided in this work. I updated my score to 8.  ================================  The paper is very cleanly written. Problem setup, proofs and convergence guarantees are easy to read. The main result is new.  The theoretical significance of this result is high as it provides a clean way to achieve   acceleration for constrained smooth/nonsmooth convex optimization problems. The empirical significance is limited but it's fine as experiment improvement is not the main claim of the paper.
