Overall, I think the result is nice and the analysis has some new techniques which I have not seen before. The only issue is that the authors do not consider the strongly convex case, which is more challenging. In the previous work, for example, the work by Guanghui Lan, achieving the uniformly optimal rate for non-strongly convex case is easy but for strongly convex case is much harder. I wonder if the authors can discuss the main difficulty of extending their results to the strongly convex case.  Another suggestion is to explicitly define alpha_t=t. I can only find alpha_t defined in Lemma 1 and have to guess that it is still  defined as alpha_t=t for the rest of the theorem and their proofs. Please define alpha just like how you define eta_t. If alpha_t varies with theorems, please define them separately.   ++++++++++++++ I have read the comments from other reviewers and the responses. I am satisfied with the responses and will keep my score still at 7.
