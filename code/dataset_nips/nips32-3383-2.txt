Originality: Conditioning on data for existing tasks to generate an unbounded number of tasks appears to be a novel idea. Quality: The paper is very well written. The idea is clear and well motivate. The idea could also be very useful to advance reproducibility in black-box optimization. The experiments are thorough and well executed. Clarity: As mentioned already, the paper is very well written. Significance: This work and in particular the tasks if released are bound to become useful benchmarks for folks working on black-box optimization.
