The paper proposes a new end-to-end method that can solve a range of combinatorial optimization (CP) problems. Although such RL approaches have been proposed before, a novel two-stage approach is devised in this paper and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.   Weakness:  1. The improvement of the proposed method over existing RL method is not impressive. 2. Compared to OR tools and RL baselines, the time and computational cost should be reported in detail to fairly compare different methods.  Comment after feedback: The authors have addressed the concerns of running time. Since the applying RL in combinatorial optimization is not new, the lack of comparisons between existing RL methods makes it less convincing.
