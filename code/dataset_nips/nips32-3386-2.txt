The paper studies properties of a language that emerges by solving communication task with a power-law distributed referents. The direction of studying implicit preferences of the recurrent neural networks from the perspective of emergent language is quite important and understanding such properties can improve existing models. The paper is well structured and contains a very detailed description of all performed experiments.
