Summary: The paper proposes two algorithms for scalable Tucker decomposition that are based on the coordinate gradient descent and sequential processing of data chunks. The convergence analysis is also provided. The experimental results show the the proposed method can decompose bigger tensors than competitors without compromising efficiency.  The strengths are 1 The proposed scalable algorithms for Tucker decomposition could be useful in large-scale real problems. 2 A complete theoretical results of convergence analysis are provided.  3 the paper is clearly written.   The main drawback of the paper is that the experimental results are too simple and seem not quite convincing. More experimental setting should be tested and more deep analysis of the results should be provided.  One question is, in the experiment, will the method still work if the dimension M exceed a certain number like 10,000?
