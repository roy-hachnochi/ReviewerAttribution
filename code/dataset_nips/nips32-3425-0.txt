POST-REBUTTAL UPDATE:  I have read the rebuttal and other reviews; my score remains unchanged.  =======================================================  Originality: The novelty of each proposed trick is limited. However, the combination is novel, well-motivated and supported by the experiments.  Quality: The paper is technically sound.  Clarity: The paper is very well-written and is easy to follow. The authors clearly pose the problems, provide well-motivated solutions for each of them, and then provide extensive experiments including an ablation study.  Significance: The authors test the proposed tricks on a broad set of tasks and outline several other fields that could also benefit. I expect these findings to have a large impact in practical applications.  My main concern is regarding the significance of the posed three problems: underestimation of the variance, trivialization of the variance (independence from x) and poor estimation for out-of-domain data (variance does not increase outside the data support). While all of these problems intuitively seem to be common, it would be nice to see a more thorough investigation. Right now these problems are illustrated using the toy data. The improvement in the ablation study can serve as an indirect indication of these problems, however, a direct study of these problems on several different tasks could provide better insight.
