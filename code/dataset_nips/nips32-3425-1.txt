This is overall a well written paper that highlights weaknesses in a widely used basic building block for building probabilistic models with neural networks: estimating the variance of some (Gaussian) observable.   The paper empirically shows that current approaches clearly underestimate variance even in very simple, low-dimensional cases. It also shows that this is true for approaches that otherwise have been shown to improve the “bayesianess” of neural network predictions. I think it is a strength of the paper that the authors concentrate on simple, low-dimensional problems to analyze the problem. Even though this issue has been occasionally mentioned before, I think this highly original work that focuses on this otherwise not sufficiently discussed problem.   The authors suggest three distinct approaches to tackle the problem and demonstrate that each of them provide improvements over the current state of affairs, at least in the investigated low- to medium dimensional cases. Each of these approaches is well motivated and described in sufficient detail (especially when considering the supplement).  Unfortunately I find the most effective method of these three proposed improvements a bit unsatisfactory because, as the authors point out, it requires significant additional compute resources and introduces complexity into the training. It is also a bit doubtful whether this approach works in cases with high-dimensional input data because it requires finding ‘nearest neighbours’. This aspect was unfortunately not investigated in the submission.   In general I think this work can be influential and encourage further research into this particular aspect of neural network modeling and training.
