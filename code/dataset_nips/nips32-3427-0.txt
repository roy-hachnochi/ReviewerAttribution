The paper is technically sound, clearly written and leads the reader through the steps required to understand the formulations.  The contribution is significant as it solves a difficult task previously avoided in the literature. The empirical section places the method as a strong contender in the learning stack of SPNs. A task that is increasingly difficult as there is constant progress evaluated on the same benchmarks. The contribution is original, the authors give clear references to previous work that is related to bayesian learning and region graph structure on SPNs.
