originality The paper proposes a novel method to compute distances between graphs, that can take into accound the node content as well as the global information repartition, using Wasserstein distance and OT tools, based on existing subtrees kernels. The fact that it can be applied to continuous attributes in nodes is a plus.  On that matter, I wonder if links could be done with kernels proposed in [1] (that can also deal with complex information on edges)?   quality: The proposed graph kernel is based on known technics thus the theoretical part is not large, it mainly concerns the notion of definitness of the produced kernel.  This point is well discussed and proven for the discrete case.  For the continuous attributes case, the author have insights but no formal proof. However since they chose to use KSVM as a safety guard in the experimental part, it's not a problem. They also note that results between KSVM and SVM are very similar, probably signifying that either the resulting kernels are indeed positive definite and if not, the negative part if neglectible.   clarity:  The paper is clearly written and polished. All required tools are described/defined. It's a clear improvement over a previous version I had the oppotunity to review. Associated with the provided code, this work can easily be reproduced and re-used.   significance; having efficient and accurate kernels for graph is definitively an important matter. I'm confident that this work is useful both for future research and for practitioners.  Remark : there are some arxiv references for papers that are very likely published, please check and update.
