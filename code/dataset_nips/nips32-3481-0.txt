While the result might be considered incremental, extending recent work by considering a more sophisticated class of algorithms, the paper still seems quite relevant. This appears to be a good next step in an overarching research project of bringing important results from dynamical systems theory to the context of non-convex optimization techniques applied to machine learning problems, what speaks for the originality of the work. Its significance comes from the considered extension being relevant and not trivial.  The paper depends on knowledge that many readers may not be familiar with, and for that reason can be a little difficult to follow. Bringing this knowledge to the field is precisely one of the best aspects of the paper, though. In many places it is quite intructional and easy to follow. In others not quite so. It is hard to suggest improvements, though. The authors cannot be asked to provide a complete introductory text on the required subjects. While that is clear, the text seems intended to different audiences in different parts, and could perhaps be made more homogeneous in that regard, improving its quality and clarity.
