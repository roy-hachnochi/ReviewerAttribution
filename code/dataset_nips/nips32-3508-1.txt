For decoding brain activity observed with fMRI, most methods require lots of stimulus-fMRI pairs. However, the experiments often yield insufficient data for end-to-end learning of the mapping from stimulus to fMRI or vice versa. This paper reports a clever idea, illustrated in Fig. 1, to train an encoder-decoder model with paired fMRI-stimulus data as well as unpaired or unlabeled fMRI or images.   - The use of encoder-decoder for fMRI decoding is not new. For example, Han et al., (2019) uses a variational encoder to encode/decode natural images, while linearly mapping the latent variables to/from fMRI patterns. The encoder/decoder is also trained with unlabeled images. The authors' model is perhaps similar, but assumes the latent representation to be identical to the fMRI patterns.   - What is novel here is that the fMRI data (without being paired to images) can be used to train the encoder/decoder as well, but reversing the direction of the computational graph. This is clever and inspiring. However, the results do not show any compelling advantage. It is sometimes hard to tell which methods are better based on the reconstructed images, which are nearly equally poor.   - Although the method is interesting and has novelty, the neuroscientific insight is limited.
