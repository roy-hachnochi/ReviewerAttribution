The authors propose a pipeline for decoding natural images from fMRI recordings. Their specific contributions is clever way to overcome the scarcity of training data in this setting, e.g., of pairs {images,fMRI recordings}. Specifically, they show how to adapt their model in an unsupervised fashion on natural images only and on (test) fMRI data only. They carefully evaluate the performance of their model and compare with the state-of-the-art.  This is one of the rare manuscripts where I really have nothing to criticize. The paper is very well written, the proposed model is novel and clever, and the obtained results are (slightly above the) state-of-the-art and critically examined. In my opinion, this is as good as fMRI decoding currently gets, and a clear accept.
