This is a good paper in general. It is well written and easy to follow. The motivation and insight is clear, the proposed method is reasonable and novel, and the experimental results are convince.   I have several small questions:  For the equation between line 135 and 136( why does it not have a equation number?): It says that z^{TD} is conditioned on z^{BU}_{>i}. However, it seems z^{TD} should only depends on the BU variables lower than it. Is it a typo?  The experiments stops on L=20. What is the performance if we keep increasing L to 30, 40, or 100, 200, 1000?  While the results shown in table 5 provides some insight, it would be good to understand more about the learned hierarchical representation. For example, what do z^1, z^2, .... z^L represent, respectively?
