There idea of leveraging duality has been applied in other contexts, but never in the context of CS/CG. The related work seems to imply (but I wasn't 100% sure if this was the claim) that even in the context of these other domains, the dual constraint on attention weights was new. Is that correct?  The idea in the paper is original and is well explained. The improvements over the baselines seem small but real.   One aspect of the evaluation that I did not like is that it dismisses approaches that take additional inputs, such as grammars. If the addition of grammars leads to a substantial performance boost, then this work is comparing against a sub-standard baseline, and given that grammars already exist for all the languages tested, requiring a grammar does not seem like a significant extra burden on the user.   Post rebuttal: So if I understand correctly from your rebuttal, you are making two arguments regarding the comparison with techniques that use grammars: a) your tool is already competitive with tools that use grammars (at least based on that one experiment reported in the rebuttal), and b) Your technique has a lot of room for improvement by using grammars, since a large fraction of what you produce is not valid code. I think these are important points to make in the paper, and adding the data from the rebuttal into the paper (or at least the supplement) would strengthen it considerably.
