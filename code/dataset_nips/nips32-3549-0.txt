The work is original and a result of high-quality research. The method is very clearly explained and supported with nice and easy to understand visualizations. The proposed method is achieving impressive results on time series alignment and on time series classification when used as a feature extractor. Furthermore, the method can be used to align unseen data, at a fraction of the computational cost of other methods. Thus, the work is significant, with an impact on both the research field and industry.
