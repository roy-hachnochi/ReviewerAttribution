The proposed method for performing weakly supervised instance segmentation is an original and novel contribution, extending the Mask R-CNN with a MIL loss term to enable learning of instance segmentation from only bounding box labels.    As far as quality, the experimental validation is thorough, including comparisons to two state-of-the-art baselines in weakly supervised instance segmentation as well as comparisons/upper bounds of fully-supervised instance segmentation methods.  Additionally, ablation studies are given to validate the use of box-level annotations compared with alternative baseline approaches, as well as to validate the different components of the overall proposed pipeline.  The paper is also well-written and easy to read.  Overall, given the above, this is a nice paper with significance to anyone working on object detection/segmentation.  ---  After reading the author response, I believe they have addressed both my questions and concerns raised by the other reviewers, and maintain my initial rating.  One comment based on reviewer discussion: In my initial read, Figure 1 was slightly confusing due to the illustration of positive and negative bags as being patches with greater than 1 pixel height/width.  Perhaps it would be worth adding a small note clarifying that the example bags are just for illustrative purposes, and that in practice single pixel horizontal/vertical lines are used as bags?
