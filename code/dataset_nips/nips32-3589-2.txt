This paper proposes a ASR framework, which adopts a regularization term over the posterior distribution. By this mean, the authors claim that the structures of images can be well captured to facilitate multi-objects generation. The writing of this paper is good and the organization is easy to follow. However, there are some concerns that need to be solved.  1) What does “structure” mean in this paper? “structure” has been mentioned many times, but I still do not understand its specific meaning. Does it mean the shape information? The authors need to explain it more clearly.  2) The novelty of this paper is somewhat marginal. The proposed ASR framework is mainly based on the AIR model, and the added innovation Posterior Regularization (PR) is also an existing method. It seems that the authors only combine the two methods (AIR and PR).  3) In line 141, the authors replace the prior distribution q(Z) with posterior distribution q(Z | X). The authors claim that this operation is based on [17]. However, [17] adopts q(Z | X) to replace posterior distribution p(Z | X), which is different from the operation of line 141. The authors should give a detailed derivation.  4) The meaning of the penalty in Eq. (10) is unclear. Why does the authors add this penalty and what effect does this term have?  5) The experiments are insufficient: - The lack of ablation study. For example, the effect of the operation in line 141 and the penalty in Eq. (10) should be verified. - The lack of parameter sensitivity analysis. For example, is the proposed algorithm sensitive to the parameter lambda in Eq. (10)? - It is highly suggested to conduct experiments on more datasets like [3] [11].
