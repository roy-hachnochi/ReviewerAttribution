Considering this is the first work to adopt NAS on searching the backbone CNN for the detection task and the proposed solution is clearly better than randomly generated networks. I would suggest a weakly accept for this work.  I do not suggest score better than a weakly accept due to the following concerns:  Main concern:  1) The effectiveness of DetNAS is mainly benefited from better search space rather than the proposed searching method. The proposed solution does not significantly better than randomly generated networks. As can be seen in Table 4 and Table 3, the “Random” Network is already significantly better than the baseline ShuffleNetV2. However, the gap between “Random” Network and the proposed DetNAS is marginal.  Minor concern:  2) Considering the search space is inspired by ShuffleNetV2 rather than ResNet. Only emphasizing the superiority of proposed DetNAS over ResNet in abstract is inappropriate and misleading.  BTW, next time, please remember to remove the .git folder from your code to follow the double-blind peer review rule. Otherwise, the author information might be leaked.
