** General comments The paper provides an original theoretical contribution which should have impacts at least in methodological developments. It is not clear to me to what extent the necessity to have access to a proximal operator (routinely) represents a serious bottleneck. How of a limiting factor is that?    ** Major comments/questions include: - the paper presentation could be improved, see remarks below. Some English mistakes too.  - however, the contribution is clearly mentioned, even though a more explicit presentation of the main results of [17] would be helpful.  At a technical level - how can bounds involving a random number of iterations be useful in practice? This is also a problem in Table 1 where those rv are not defined.  A remark on fact that \mu^\ast is compared to a random measure would be helpful.  Is that standard in the related bounds found in the literature (eg [17])?  - why are the KL bounds for convex F and strongly convex F involving two different stage of a SPLA transition? For convex F the KL is between \mu^\ast and the r.v. before the proximal step while for strongly convex its between \mu^\ast and an entire SPLA transition. An insight would be very helpful. - check below some proof-related questions. - for the application part: were the Author able to find an application of thm 1 and other corollaries by identifying the constants L, \alpha and C? Also, instead/or in addition of numerical results it would be more useful to compare directly the bounds of SPLA with bounds of other subgradient LA algorithm (if applicable).    ** Minor points Check the text around Eq. 1: the first part should be in the text do not use where in series.  l26 the proposed additive model for U offers and check the end of that sentence.  l54 rather than certain samples perhaps the proba. measures of a specific collection/or subsequence of random variables generated by our method.   l67-68 it would be useful to have this comment in a separate remark environment, to highlight this point.  l78 if more than one method, name it otherwise correct to ``methods that use''   l128 entropy is not well defined  l142 title, perhaps convergence rates instead of rate  l166 comments of this paragraph and especially the last part of it should be moved to a dedicated section as they bring the subtle part of the work.   l173 applies to  l378 =\int g d\mu not )\int g d\mu  l382 the statement is not trivial since in 17 Lemma 4 the inequality is for the function \mathcal{E}_{U} and not \mathcal{H}  check ref. [36]    Lemma 6, to reach \mu_{y_0^k}, isn't it required to take t=2\gamma instead of t=\gamma? Indeed, \nu_\gamma has the same law as z^k+\sqrt(\gamma) W^k which is not precisely the law of y_0^k. But this would change the inequality, with a factor 4\gamma instead of 2\gamma in [9]. Can you please check that?  l443 the factor \gamma^2 should be inside the sum if the sum also applies to the 2nd and last terms ; otherwise a sum is missing for the 2nd and last terms.  l449 Why is Lemma 5 required here?  l477 it is not clear how the measure \cal{F}(\mu_{y_0^j}) is substituted by \cal{F}(\mu_{\tilde{x}^k})    Application  l197 it could be useful to identify the functions f and g_i and the rv \xi of the expectations of functions F and G in this example. Esp. f\equiv f(x) and in this case there is no randomness.  l214 v and w are not defined, are they vertices?
