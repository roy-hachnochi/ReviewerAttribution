Due to the shortness of time, I only comment upon the expressivity results.  The expressivity results are interesting and novel. However, I found it rather hard to sort out the ``big'' picture of these results, and perhaps some additional general discussion would be helpful. It seems that in this part of the paper a kind of partial ordering between distinguishing classes is studied, where a class is larger than another if it can distinguish more pairs of distributions (classes can also be equivalent, and because of the parameters it is not clear how to formalize this precisely).   Theorem 4, for example, shows the superiority of using k=2 over k=1. The graph class is a single graph (an infinite bipartite graph encoding all finite subsets of one half by vertices of the second half). It is shown that for any finite-VC class there are distributions distinguished by the graph but not the class. In terms of ordering the theorem says that there is a class for $k=2$ (consisting of that single graph) which is not smaller than or equal to any finite VC-class for $k=1$. The term ``incomparable''is used at a few places and it is not clear in what sense it is meant. Also, as the ultimate goal of the work seems to be to find possibly simple classes which can distinguish many pairs of distributions, it would be useful to comment on what are the implications of such incomparability results towards this goal.
