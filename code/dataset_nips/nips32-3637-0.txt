The developments presented here for dealing with asymmetric DPPs make this class of model more useful when positive correlations need to be modeled in the sampled sets, making the models more powerful than traditional symmetric DPPs. The model, theory and experiments are clearly explained. Experimental results show the possible improvements provided by the nonsymmetric DPPs which can model positive correlations as well as their ability to learn negative correlations as is the case in traditional symmetric DPPs. Experiments on real data further validate the advantage of nonsymmetric DPPs in both MPR and AUC measures for recommended sets.
