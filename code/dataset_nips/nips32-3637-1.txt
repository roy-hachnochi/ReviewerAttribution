As mentioned in the previous section, this work proposes a solution to an important and interesting problem and the empirical results are convincing enough to establish this approach over the symmetric DPP approach for the tasks and datasets described in the paper. One major thing missing is the lack of other baselines apart from symmetric DPPs. What about simpler models for set selection like tasks which are less computationally intensive; these would establish the necessity for DPPs for the selected task. More egregiously, how does this approach compare to the one on learning signed DPPs (Brunel 2017), which has been cited but not compared against. The final method in the paper looks different enough to merit a comparison.
