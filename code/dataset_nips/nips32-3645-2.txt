3D Instance Segmentation is an interesting problem with a lot of possible applications. This paper proposes a single-stage, anchor-free and end-to-end trainable framework to address this problem. The bounding box association layer and the multi-criteria loss function are original designs, which might have a high impact on the research community. Unlike most of the instance segmentation works, which employ heavy post-processing steps, the proposed framework is able to give accurate predictions without any post-processing. The framework is novel and efficient, which might inspire more interesting works in this area.  Besides the originality and significance, the paper is complete work, and the writing and illustration is clear and concise.
