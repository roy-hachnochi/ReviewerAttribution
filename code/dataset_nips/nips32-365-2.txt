Thank you for addressing my comments in the rebuttal. I increased my score. -----------------------------------------------------   This paper proposes a tensor block model clustering method with applications to multiview clustering. They propose an optimization method for the clustering model using the least-squares method. The proposed method is supported with theoretical analysis on convergence. Furthermore, the paper is well written with supporting experiments.  I am not an expert on this topic, however, my judgment is that the paper borrows similar ideas from [15] and other papers and give an extension. Still, I feel the paper has certain among of novelty in the proposed clustering method and shows good performance. I feel that the paper makes a reasonable contribution.   Some issues in the supplementary section: What do the authors mean by A.2 in the second proof on page 1 of the appendix? Also, I did not understand this "Combining (A.2), (A.2) and (A.2), we have". In fact, some of the equation references in the appendix are confusing.
