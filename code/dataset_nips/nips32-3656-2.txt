The main contribution is to provide with an algorithm to learn sparse distributions and would benefit by improving  the way the methods are explained and the clarity is identified. In particular:  - Some statements could be commented more generally, for instance " Interestingly, $Dk included in Dk' included in P$ in general." (l.79), in particular if they are novel. Explain what the "QM-AM inequality" is.  - The resulting algorithm provides a further evidence that greedy algorithms are quite powerful at solving NP-hard problems, yet this statement is not completely falsifiable (are there other alternatives to using greedy methods?) and the novelty of this particular application to distributions should be justified. Indeed, it seems that most theoretical results come from extending this functional setting from vector sparsity (see supp l.408 for instance). As such, clarify the novelty of your results.
