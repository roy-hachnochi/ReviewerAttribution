While it is challenging to me to understand all the new properties of the proposed quantum Wasserstein GAN, The motivation and background knowledge on the Wasserstein distance and Wasserstein GAN are presented clearly.   The idea of applying the Wasserstein distance and its derived GAN model on quantum data sounds interesting and straightforward. It gives me the impression that all the used components including the regularization are studied well on regular data, and the paper seems to apply them to quantum data with some special designs.   The experiments look very insufficient. It only evaluates the proposed method on numerical experiments without any comparisons against relevant methods or their adaptation.
