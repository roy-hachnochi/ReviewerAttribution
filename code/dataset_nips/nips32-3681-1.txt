Originality: The authors propose original work, as they are the first to utilize normalizing flows for voice conversion.   Quality: The paper provided extensive experiments as well as ablation studies, and provided samples of the voice conversions. Despite the lack of baselines, the authors did a good job deconstructing which components of their model were important and also experimenting with other, non-trivial models such as StarGAN and VQ-VAE. One thing I noticed, though, was when the source and target voices were of different genders, the converted voice seemed to have more artifacts and noise than usual.  Clarity: The paper was well-written and easy to follow, which I appreciated.   Significance: There is not a significant amount of work in non-parallel music or audio conversion in general, so this work presents a step forward in opening up new research directions.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE: I appreciate the authors addressing my confusion regarding the forward-backward conversion section, as well as the additional experiment about the identity neutrality of the z space. I will keep my original score.
