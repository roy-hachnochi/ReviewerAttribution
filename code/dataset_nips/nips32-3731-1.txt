This work considers the multilayer neural networks with binary activation based on PAC-Bayesian theory. The main contributions include: 1) an end-to-end framework to train a binary activated deep neural network and 2) nonvacuous PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for binary activated deep neural networks.Some empirical studies are provide to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.  This is a theoretical submission, and I have some concerns as follows:  1) This work focuses on binary activation in neural network, while the authors does not present some real applications, as well as some motivations of such activation. As I know, most common-used activation functions are continous and lipschitz, such as sigmoid and Relu function.   2) In real applications, how to decide the prior parameter \mu, especially for deep neural network. This is very important to use the relevant theory. From a theoretical review, it is quite straight to obtain the theorem from the traditional PAC Bayes analysis wihout technical new insights.  3) The experimental results do not well support the theoretical analysis. There is no necessary comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithm on deep learning, and I do not find some new insights in experiments.
