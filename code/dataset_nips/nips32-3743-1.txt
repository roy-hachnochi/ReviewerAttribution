================================================== AFTER AUTHOR FEEDBACK.   I maintain my score. However, I'm not convinced by the author's response to my question on showing the derivation of the previous best run time.  They need to use more current algorithms for LP (for example, the one by Cohen, Lee, and Song) in order to compute how fast this problem can be solved. Without a derivation using these algorithms, it's unclear *how much* of an improvement this submission provides. Without a clear picture of this, it's unclear to determine the full contribution of the paper.  ==================================================  ORIGINALITY  See comment in 1. The paper recognizes and exploits some properties of the objects in the problem in a way that lets the authors improve the algorithm's runtime by orders of magnitude. This is an original observation/contribution.   However, I am concerned about the reported run time for the previous best interior point algorithm: in particular, in the supplementary material provided, in line 69 (paragraph titled "Low Theoretical Complexity"), the previous best run time is reported to be O(N^3 m^4), but there is no citation provided or computation shown for this claim.   In order for me to be convinced that the authors' work does have a significant improvement upon previous work, I'd like to request the following from them.   (1) an explicit computation showing how the previous best run time of O(N^3 m^4) is computed,   (2) applying the run times from some classical and contemporary results for LPs: papers by Vaidya https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01580859, Lee-Sidford https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6713, and current best LP result by Cohen-Lee-Song https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04447.   QUALITY - Overall, I found the paper to be high quality, with adequate citations for various results. However, I do have the following concerns:   I am confused why the NeurIPS paper by Cuturi is cited for Iterative Bregman Projection (line 249 in the supplementary pdf) when that paper doesn't even mention Bregman projections.   For Figure 2, I think the evaluation of SLRM and DLRM must be done against more recent solvers for normal equations such as those mentioned in the "Originality" paragraph above and also other interior point solvers which are more specialized (than the MATLAB solver which I'm not sure exploits the structure of normal equations).   CLARITY - Overall, the paper reads quite well. However, I think the clarity can be improved in the following places:   In line 115, the authors describe an LP and then all the vectors/variables/matrices in it; however, the vector c is not defined.   Also, it would help to clearly state, separately, the problem dimension and number of constraints at this point.   It would also greatly help if you gave the reader a "sense" of each of the m_i's, so that  the reader can get a better sense of m sum_i m_i + m and Nm + sum_i m_i + 1 (just as you have done in the section "Low Theoretical Complexity" in the supplementary material, where you say, let m_i = m).   In Algorithm 1, it would help to have caption or text saying that z(i) is the solution to which system; the way it's written now, I found it difficult to understand from the procedure alone that it's actually solving (bar_A D bar_A^t ) z= f.   Finally, the authors are using the cost of an n x n matrix inversion to be n^3, when this should be n^\omega. The current value of \omega is roughly 2.372927 (see Table 3 by Le Gall and Urrutia https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05622), so I think this should be made more clear.   SIGNIFICANCE: I think the formulation and use of the block structure is certainly novel for this problem, and anyone who tries to solve this problem can benefit from the authors' observations. However, as someone who has not worked on the problem of Wasserstein Barycenter before, I don't think I can judge the importance of the problem itself. I think the ideas of using structure could be used in other interior point methods for LPs.
