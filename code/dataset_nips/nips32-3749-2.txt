The lifting technique involves the disintegration of measure. The whole construction of MI and MK is quite simple, so we can say that it is a technically simple theoretical paper.  Quality of that approach is strongly dependant on how we choose E, so one chapter is dedicated to this issue. I could not find  experimental verification of that chapter's suggestions, especially of Algorithm 1?  Experiments with synthetic data seems informative, but semantic mediation etc are not convincing.
