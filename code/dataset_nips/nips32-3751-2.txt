=== after authors' rebuttal === Thanks for authors' response. After reading the rebuttal, I thank the authors answer my questions and would like to change my score from 4 to 6.  === === === === === === ===  This study proposed a SARAH-type algorithm, SARAH-Compositional, for solving non-convex compositional optimization problems in both online and finite-sum settings. The proposed algorithms can enjoy improved convergence rates comparing with the-state-of-art results, and the main technique of analysis is borrowed from SARAH. This paper is easy to understand and well-organized.   However, I have two major concerns. First, the novelty of this paper is limited since it only combines SARAH estimator with SGD. The analysis, in fact, is quite straightforward and trivial. Second, this paper didn't provide any numerical results, which are of great interest to many machine learning researchers.
