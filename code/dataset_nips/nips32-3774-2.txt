Thank you for your feedback. I though the proposed method has an extension over [20] such as a generalization of metrics. However, I don't think the strategy is reasonable. The optimization with two constraints, one of which might be introduced to make the optimization algorithm implementable by well known techniques, causes an underfitting problem. The feedback could not my opinion in my first review.  --- This paper considers the problem of robustness against outliers and then developed a new robust PCA. The proposed method optimizes not only low rank matrices but also a mean vector and a weight vector. To avoid the over-fitting problem, the regularization term is also introduced to the cost function. The empirical performance of the proposed method for benchmark datasets looks good. Thus, it would be effective. However, the method would be a moderate extension from related paper [20]. The methodological novelty might be limited.
