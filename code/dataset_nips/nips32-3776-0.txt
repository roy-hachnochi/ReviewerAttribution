Originality: Good Quality: Technically sound Clarity: Could use improvement Significance: Moderately significant  Weaknesses: -Trains with lots of images (50k); this seems to preclude the methods use in the fields, e.g. biomedical, where you'd like to train without ground truth data. -Only tests synthetic data. -Missing some related work that uses unbiased risk estimators to train denoisers without GT data. These methods already "reach similar quality as compareable models trained using reference clean data".  [A] Soltanayev, Shakarim, and Se Young Chun.

Minor: On first reading the text, it was unclear that the mean and covariance matrix were across the three color channels. This could be stated explicitly for clarity.
