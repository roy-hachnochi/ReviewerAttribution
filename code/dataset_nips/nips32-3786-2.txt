Originality:  1. The paper leverages a group feature extraction process, where the output group features is proved to be equivariant to transformations. 2. The paper designs a novel group feature embedding module with two group CNNs and bilinear pooling.  Quality: While I appreciate the authors' effort, one missing part is the motivation/rationale for using two group CNNs and bilinear pooling. A naive solution is to use one group CNN + fc layer to generate a descriptor. We could double the group CNN parameters to achieve a similar expressive power as the proposed group feature embedding module.  Clarify: The paper is well-written.  Significance: The paper shows improved performance on standard datasets. However, some important baseline comparison is missing. One baseline is to use one group CNN + fc layer, as described above. One is the Group Equivariant CNN, which is considered the most related work in the paper. Also, would a more advanced backbone feature network help, e.g., ResNet-101?
