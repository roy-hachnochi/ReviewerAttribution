i. Novelty and Significance: The problem formulation seems novel as multi-objective scenarios are quite relevant in practice. I am not entirely well versed on existing works on  multi-objective MDPs in RL, but authors claimed to have the first non-asymptotic sub-linear regret guarantee for the current setting unlike some prior works [28,34] which focuses on asymptotic convergence and work under more restricted assumptions on the MDPs.  ii. Writing: The paper is overall well written with properly introduced notations and the claims are easy to follow. I made a high level check of the proof techniques which appears to be reasonable.  iii. Numerical Experiments: This section could have been elaborated further (although more details are included in the Appendix). I would suggest moving some of the analysis of Sec. 4 to Appendix to include more experimental evaluations in the main text. In particular, the reported empirical results does not study any comparative performances with other existing methods --- I am curious to see how TFW-UCRL2 performs with respect to the proposed algorithms of [28] and [34], even under the setting of their restricted assumptions.  =================== Post Rebuttal ========================= I have read and understood the rebuttal clarifications. I keep my score unchanged.
