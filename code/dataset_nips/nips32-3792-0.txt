The authors of this submission present an algorithm for online prediction of graph labelings (in fact switching labelings). Their algorithm is based on using standard techniques from the literature to obtain a mistakes bound whose main component is a non symmetric cost of switching that takes into account only experts entering the comparator sequence.   The main original result of the paper seems to be in section 3.1., where the construction of the specialists and their updates and runtime is analyzed and the binary tree basis is introduced. It appears this is the main idea behind the improvements claimed in the paper.
