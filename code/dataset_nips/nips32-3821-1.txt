This paper introduces straightforward techniques for pre-training transformer architectures on monolingual corpora from many languages, as well as on parallel corpora: standard left-history conditioning for monolingual sentences, and BERT-style cloze masking for both monolingual and parallel (jointly-modeled) sentences. These techniques are combined with fine-tuning and applied to several tasks, with consistently positive results relative to SOTA baselines: cross-lingual classification (XNLI dataset), unsupervised and supervised MT, low-resource LMs, and unsupervised multilingual word embeddings.  The idea of taking advantage of data in many languages is natural and powerful. The results are extremely convincing, especially given the simplicity of the techniques considered, and the general lack of extensive tuning of hyper-parameters for different tasks. The paper is very clearly written, and for the most part does a good job with reproducible detail. The previous work section is excellent. All in all, this is a highly significant empirical milestone.  Some details should be specified in greater detail: Are language tags a la Johnson et al (or any other form of explicit language information) used? For MT, please be a bit more explicit about how encoder and decoder are trained, and how the final architecture comes together (eg, randomly-initialized cross-attention?). Why only show supervised results on En/Ro? Even if results werenâ€™t as competitive on some other language pair, this would still be interesting to calibrate and understand the limitations of pre-training. Given the apparently large effect of bigger batch sizes in table 2, it would be helpful to show the effect of this setting on all tasks.  Postscript, after author response: Thanks for the clear answers. Please do follow through on your promise to add supervised results for language pairs other than En/Ro.
