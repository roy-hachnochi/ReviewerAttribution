Quality : All the checked calculations looked good to me. Significance and Originality : As mentioned above, this paper provides a powerful tool to determine the sign of the bias in sequential sampling. While it is "folklore intuition" that UCB and co. have negative bias, to my knowledge, this rigorous proof is new (with inspiration from the cited papers) and should pique the curiosity of anyone involved with bandits. Furthermore, this subsumes this intuition as they also consider random stopping and choosing rules.  Clarity : Apart from some awkwardly chosen terminology (e.g., optimism, monotonically increasing), the paper was overall very well written and structured, with some welcome examples.   Post-rebuttal edit :  Nothing to add
