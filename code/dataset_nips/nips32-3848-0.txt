Originality: The work stems from an original idea but a better acknowledgment of the last 20 years of work on IRL would have provided a more honest basis for situating the contribution.  Quality: The paper is technically sound and the methodology for the results is well-founded however, it is unclear how the theorems apply to the presented work. It would be interesting to see the broader impact of the theorems by analyzing how other algorithms proposed for IRL are impacted by these theorems and how these relate to the experimental results proposed. A lot of the proofs could have been left to the Appendix, leaving more space for experiments and discussion.  Clarity: The paper is clearly written and good readability. It adequately informs the reader about some of the limitations of the method. A more in-depth introduction of the F matrix with respect to value iteration would make the paper more self-contained.  Significance: The theorems presented in the paper seem important to characterize the number of samples needed to achieve a certain bound in the Finite state space IRL case but it is unclear how this impacts current state-of-the-art algorithms.
