Summary: This paper first proposed a geometric analysis perspective for the IRL problem. Based on this observation, an L_1 regularized SVM formulation was proposed. Theoretical analysis on the sample complexity provided formal guarantees for the algorithm. The empirical performance was also tested.  Comments: Originality: The theoretical analyses in this paper, including the geometric perspective, the SVM formulation and the sample complexity analysis, are technically straightforward to some degree.   Significance: Although the technique in this paper is not that 'fancy', the work is important and valuable. The proposed algorithm is the first one with formal guarantees for the IRL problem.  Quality: I think the theoretical analysis is fine. Empirical performance is also evaluated in the experiment part.  Clarity: This paper is well-organized, and easy to follow.   Other minor comments: Please go through the paper again to make the notations consistent, like in Eq (2.1), the capital N is not defined before.   ========= Update after author response: The author didn't address my primary concern in detail, i.e., the technical challenges and novelty. But the theoretical contribution of their work is sufficiently significant for an acceptance. So I maintain my score.
