Originality:  1) The task of image animation is not new, but the proposed motion model is novel.  2) The clear difference between this paper and previous papers lies in the first order motion model. 3) Related work is adequately cited and compared.  Quality:  1) The submission is technically sound. The mathematical proof seems correct to me. 2) This is a complete piece of work. The authors conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed first order motion model. 3) Failure case analysis is missing. 4) What is the intuition of using first order motion model? Can the authors explain how this connects to affine transformation? Can we use a second order motion model? 5) What is the virtual reference frame? Does it represent a canonical pose for a specific object category?  Clarity: The method part is a bit unclear.  1) It seems to me that the zeroth order motion is the keypoint location. However, in Figure 1, T_{S<-D}(p_k) seems to be pixel displacement, which is different from the keypoint location. 2) Can the authors explain L161-L163 in more details?  Significance: This paper address a difficult problem in a better way than previous papers. It demonstrably advances the state-of-the-art. I believe it provides a good baseline for the following researchers to build upon and make significant progress.
