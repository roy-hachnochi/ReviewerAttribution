First of all, this paper is hard to understand.  Many important discussion and results are shown only in the supplemental material and the author does not specify in the main paper that which section in the Appendix we should refer.  I cannot follow how Eq  (11) and Eq (12) are derived under what kind of models. The author just mentioned that Eq (11) holds for "In this (and many other cases)", but I cannot understand what this sentence means. Also, there is no formal definition of kapper_j in the main paper (I found it in Eq (36) in the appendix).   The experiments are not enough. Although in the second paragraph of the Introduction, the author indicated that IWAE is not enough for large models, the experiments are only conducted on very simple models which IWAE works well. I think additional experiments in real-world data in large models are needed to verify the usefulness of the proposed method.
