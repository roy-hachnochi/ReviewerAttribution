The paper tackles the problem of predicting the outcome of an action chosen from a set of possible actions, The outcome is a function of the action, having a linear component, non-linear component and some additive noise.  The idea is first finding a linear function minimizing the deviation from the outcomes, for every distribution which is "close" to the empirical distribution (by the Wasserstein distance). Idea which was analyzed before.  The idea added in the paper is using the resulting linear-regression coefficient to build a metric upon samples from the same group and then produce prediction which is the average of the outcomes for the K-nearest neighbors. This way the prediction can leverage not only the private history of the specific instance but also the outcomes of "close" instances.  The paper provide bound on the resulting error under several assumptions.  The idea is interesting and seems novel. The analysis isn't trivial. The paper is written in a relative clear manner.
