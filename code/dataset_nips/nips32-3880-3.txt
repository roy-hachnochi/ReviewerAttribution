Originality: Moderate. This is an area of research that has received a significant amount of attention, as the authors indicate. But the specific investigation in this work regarding the sufficient conditions for certain structural properties to emerge is useful and novel.  Quality: Good. The approach appears to be technically sound. The claims are supported by thorough variation of the environmental properties involved.  Clarity: Good. The paper is clearly written and very well organized. One moderate weakness in the exposition is the treatment of Condition II regarding metric structure. If I understand correctly, the environmental conditions that are sufficient for this property to emerge amount to "dataset completeness" in the form of the agent observing transitions under a wide variety of environmental configurations. The structure learned under violation of this condition can be seen as "overfitting" to the particular environmental configuration (as it is static) and therefore is only topologically similar to the true state. This is somewhat subtle and could use further exposition.  Significance: Moderate. This is important work, and is likely to provide a basis for future researchers in this area to analyze and develop environments to investigate and encourage the emergence of spatial representations. The architecture proposed in this work is not a significantly useful contribution and the results are not immediately illuminating about any particular application domain, but the lessons learned will be valuable to future researchers.
