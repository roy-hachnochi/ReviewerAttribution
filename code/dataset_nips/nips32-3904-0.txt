The (seemingly novel) premise of the paper is that we can gain insight into voting theory by studying it through the premise of communication complexity (in addition to the standard desideratum of social welfare maximization). The paper presents lower bounds, families of new voting rules to provide upper bounds, and classification of previously-studied voting rules in terms of the communication complexity/distortion tradeoff. Overall, the paper seemed original with a comprehensive set of results for a carefully set up and clearly presented model for an important problem.  My main criticism is that parts of the intro were hard to follow, and Figure 1 summarizing the results was helpful but could be improved. The specific comments below are suggestions for how to improve Section 1 for readability.  - The intro seemed to indicate that the elicitation rule would project real utilities to rankings, which presented an overly narrow view of the range of elicitation rules considered in the paper and made it confusing to understand how to provide bounds on distortion if utilities could be arbitrary. This was clarified in Section 2, but it would help for clarification to come earlier. -Is there a reason RandSubset is not in Fig 1? It would help for comparison. -It would help to clearly classify each voting rule in the legend by deterministic/randomized elicitation/aggregation. -Fig 1 could be improved by adding pointers to the relevant section of the paper for each entry, and it would be nice to include a brief description somewhere of the rules from prior works. -The first par of 1.1 could improve by specifying the domain/range of each rule type. -The second par of 1.1 is quite hard to follow even when simultaneously referencing Fig 1.
