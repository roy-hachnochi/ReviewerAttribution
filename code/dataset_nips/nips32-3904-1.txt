The results build on a line of research in analyzing the ‘distortion’ of voting rules, which is the ratio of highest social welfare alternative to the selected alternative. This work takes the idea beyond analyzing popular voting rules and asks whether there exists any voting rule that can achieve a desired distortion while minimizing communication, or vice versa. Section 4 & 5 were a little confusing -- the results are organized by proof technique vs. what is proved, e.g. both sections have bounds for deterministic elicitation. Authors should make clear section 4’s results are more meaningful for low-communication voting rules. I have not read the proofs in detail from the supplemental pages, although the intuition conveyed in the paper seem sound.  The existence of PrefThreshold as a way to trade-off seems quite interesting and desirable as a voting rule, but as the authors acknowledge it may seem bizarre to ask voters to map their utility to buckets. Nevertheless I find this method to be original and novel.  Wrt related works, there may be relationship to complexity of active learning but I cannot articulate a direct relationship at this time. There is a paper seem to cover ‘threshold voting’: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/370218 this may or may not be directly related to PrefThreshold.  Overall the paper is well-written and organized. It does not get too cluttered in mathematical details and try to convey underlying intuition.  The biggest concern with this submission is lack of relevance to NeurIPS, which are typically papers addressing dynamics of learning. The problem and proof techniques are not really relevant to learning, and the topic is only of interest to a small community in AI, so this paper may not be appropriate for the NeurIPS audience.  ---- Update I raise overall score without considering relevance. Paper makes a great contribution to information complexity of voting.
