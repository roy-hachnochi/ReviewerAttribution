The authors present the first domain adaptation model for 3D point clouds. They come up with novel structures and modules to create their model. For this, they build on a variety of known and novel techniques, for example they use a PointNet++ encoder, but also introduce novel Self-Adaptive nodes and use a convolution similar to bilateral convolution (they call it deformable convolution) to extract features for domain alignment. The submission seems technically sound and the authors provide a theoretical analysis for their method in terms of the H\Delta H theory. Since I am not an expert in domain adaptation, I did not find conclusive judgement of their contribution on that end. The paper is clearly written, though I noticed a substantial amount of writing mistakes w.r.t. articles (the, a). The presented method achieves clearly better results than other methods undergoing domain transfer without adaptation. It would be interesting, though, to see the result of other methods fine-tuned with a small amount of labelled data to get an impression of the complexity of the domain transfer task between the different datasets. Also, even though there is an ablation study performed for the different proposed parts of the architecture, there is no discussion of the weaknesses of the method, which would be helpful. The approach together with the newly proposed dataset, could be a valuable contribution for the community.
