This paper presents a differentiable cloth simulation method. It formulates cloth simulation as a QP with collision handling as constraints and it follows [1][7] to compute derivatives of linear systems of KKT conditions, but finds the high-dimensionality of cloth simulation leads to a impractical solution.   --Originality  The novelty of this paper lies in that the authors uses dynamic collision detection to figure out a sparse size of constraints so that a QR decomposition is used to solve linear systems of KKT conditions efficiently, which makes it practical to use in optimization and learning.   --Quality The references are sufficient and evaluations are compelling.   --Clarity The notations can be improved. In Algorithm 1, M, f and a are not explained. In Line 117, it is better to say explicitly k = 1,2,3.  The whole description of differentiable cloth simulation seems to fall in parts. It is not clear to me how Algorithm 1 corresponds to the QP problem. Section 3.2 seems to be used to give an example of how one collision is handled, but its connection to the matrix formulation used later doesn't seem to be obvious.  In Section 3.3, it will be great to use exact (physically meaningful) notations to describe the linear system in stead of using general Ax=b.  The G and h also lacks of explanations of their physical meanings in Section 3.4.   --Significance The reviewer finds this work tackles an important problem in deep learning and provides a practical solution to it. The public release of its code will further improve the impact of this paper.
