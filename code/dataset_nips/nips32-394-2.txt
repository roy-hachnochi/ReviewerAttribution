Devising differentiable physics simulation has recently attracted many interests due to its potential to be combined with deep learning algorithms. This paper introduces a new type of differentiable physics simulation, specifically designed for cloth simulation. The key challenge in making cloth simulation differentiable is due to the complexity in handling external and self collisions. The paper proposed to solve this problem by formulating the collision handling as a constrained optimization problem and derived its derivatives using implicit differentiation. Furthermore, they leveraged the thin shape of the constraint matrix and used QR decomposition to accelerate the computation of the gradients. They evaluated the method on two applications: material estimation and motion control. The result shows that the proposed method can successfully achieve the given task and is more efficient than the baseline methods.  The paper is well written and in general clear. I do have a few comments about the proposed method, as listed below.  1. For the material estimation experiment, the real-world data from Wang et al. was used. I’m wondering how was the target physical parameters obtained? Since Wang et al. also went through an optimization process to obtain the simulation model that fits the real-world data, it seems more suitable to compare the proposed gradient-based method to Wang et al. directly in terms of the per-vertex error, instead of the simplified baseline. 2. The main challenge and contribution of the paper in my opinion is about collision handling in cloth simulation. However, the examples shown in the video are fairly sparse in collisions. The ablation study in 4.1 is more collision rich, but wasn’t used to optimize anything. It would be desired to see examples of material estimation or motion control that are collision rich. 3. How well does the method handle frictional contact? It is not discussed in the paper and is not reflected in the experiments.  ######################################## After reading the authors' rebuttal and other reviews, most of my concerns have been addressed. Thus I will raise my score for the submission.
