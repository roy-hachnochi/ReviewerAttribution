Archetypal analysis is a type of matrix factorization approach that is more interpretable but at the same time more computationally expensive. Finding coresets of this problem helps finding archetypes for large datasets more efficiently. The theoretical results presented in the paper are quite useful in that sense.  One of the concerns I have with the theorems is that archetypal analysis finds extreme points and is therefore more sensitive to perturbation than k-means. Take for example samples in one dimension coming from a bimodal distribution. k-means with k=2 should find the two modes of the distribution, and should be quite stable if we take a subsample of the data. Archetypal analysis on the other hand should find the minimum and maximum values of the samples, and therefore is sensitive to subsampling. The results presented in the paper only establish bounds on the residuals of archetypal analysis for using full dataset versus the using coresets, i.e, \phi(C,Q_C) versus \phi(X,Q_X). However, the archetypes found by the coreset and the original dataset can be different, and it will be interesting to have theoretical properties for |Q_C - Q_X|. This can also be shown computationally in the experiment section. Can the authors please comment on this?  In the experiments section, the uniform sampling works quite similar to coresets for covertype and ijcnn1 while it does not work well for pose and song. Can the authors comment on why this is so? Do the two former datasets have more uniformly distributed samples than the latter datasets? Since the author are reporting relative error, the y axis of the figures should start from 0.  lines 104-114 seem a bit out of place. I am guessing that the authors are trying to establish the link between definition 4 and theorem 2 where the RHS does not depend on the eps/2... term. This should be clarified.  in line 97-98, please state with respect to what the expectation is taken over, i.e., coresets
