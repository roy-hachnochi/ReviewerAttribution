Post-rebuttal: Thank you to the authors for submitting a thoughtful rebuttal.  The other reviews didn't raise any new concerns that would sway my original rating.  Originality: The main originality of this work is the observation that small perturbations in objects result in valid scenes.  This allows the method to solve a much broader problem than Remez 2018, without the need for object detectors and heuristics for where to position the pastes. While Remez is limited to generating object masks for object detectors (e.g. weakly supervised instance segmentation), this work is able to also consider   Quality, Clarity: Overall, I think think the writing is clear and the experiments are thorough.  Evaluation: The authors do a good job of validating the contributions with ablation studies and show that indeed this foreground shifting is essential to the performance of the technique.  I think evaluating with Mask R-CNN is a clever idea for a dataset without annotations, but it raises a greater concern:  Why not just train this method on a dataset with a labeled test set?  Does this method require very object-centric images?  Would this method work for MS COCO?  Does it matter that it doesn't work for MS COCO?   Further, how would this work compare to Remez in their experimental setting - i.e. how would your method work for learning to generate object masks from detections?  It seems natural to do this experiment given the similarity to Remez.  One important comment: This method is not fully unsupervised (line 62) -- a huge amount of effort goes into collecting a dataset that only contains the category of interest.  I think it's important to clarify this..
