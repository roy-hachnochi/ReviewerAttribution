Originality: This work is an improvements on existing methods. The originality comes from identifying various bounds that one can impose to prune the search space. It is clear how this work differs from existing works.  Quality: The work is technically correct. The experiments demonstrate the claims that the method is better at finding optimal trees than existing methods. The experiments seem thorough though there is no description of the weaknesses of the method.  Clarity: The paper has been written in a manner that is straightforward to read and follow.  Significance: There are two factors which dent the significance of this work. 1. The work uses only binary features. Real world data is usually a mix of binary, real and categorical features. It is not clear if the method is applicable to real and categorical features too.  2. The method does not seem to be scalable, unless a distributed version of it is developed. It's not reasonable to expect a single instance can hold all the training data that the real world datasets ususally contain.
