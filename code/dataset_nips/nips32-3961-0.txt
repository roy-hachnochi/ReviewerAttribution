Essentially the paper states an algorithm page 3 and the rest of the paper is based on explaining the "proof strategy", i.e., the authors explain the various results which are used to build the main convergence-rate theorem.  I wonder how many NeurIPS readers will be able to get anything out of pages 3-7 which describes results from geometry.  While the result might be of theoretical significance, the algorithm requires knowledge of the exponential map which is usually a very complicated operator. The main non-trivial manifolds for which the exponential map is actually known are the Grassmannian and Stiefel manifolds, hence I wonder if the authors should have just focused on these two manifolds which would considerably simplify the paper; and by specialising to these the results can probably be improved.  I personally don't see much point in describing more general results (unless it's aimed at a more mathematical audience or in the appendices) unless the authors can generalise their results to more general retractions, which would improve the applicability of the results.
