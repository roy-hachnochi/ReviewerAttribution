- The paper extends the unsupervised domain adaptation task for semantic segmentation to multiple sources. This seems to be the first paper that does that. - The paper is well written and sufficiently clear. - The results are sufficient and convincing. - The approach can be considered as reasonable extension of CyCADA to leverage multiple sources. There is also an improvement of CyCADA given by a new dynamic semantic segmentation loss. Besides that, the other major novelty is the introduction of losses to produce an adversarial domain aggregation. - The most important aspect of the paper is that it builds on solid previous work and goes into a new direction, which is to use multiple sources for adaptation of segmentation networks. - No major concerns, just that the Authors have not done much to describe the details of the architecture used. How are D_T and D_i defined? What network structures have you used for them and also for the generator networks? - In Eq(9) you may want to replace F_A with F.
