This paper proposes to leverage training data from multiple source domains to strengthen the ability of segmentation models on processing domain shift and dataset bias. It well reviews the literature of related work and clearly points out the differences between this paper and the prior ones. The presentation is good and the ideas are also interesting and original. Nevertheless, I still think this paper has the following issues that need to be settled.  1) The paper aims to handle the domain shift problem by leveraging multiple source domain datasets. Intuitively, this would definitely strengthen the segmentation ability of the resulting model compared to those trained on a single source dataset. Despite so, I think it is still necessary to experimentally demonstrate that multiple sources indeed assist compared to the case where only one source dataset is provided under the setting that all other configurations are kept unchanged. However, I do not see any results in this paper about this. In Table 2, the authors do list results based on single source domain but the experiment environment is different. I think this experiment would more convincingly explain that multiple sources help.  2) I suggest that the authors should re-organize the layout of Figure 1. It really confuses me a lot and I think this will also happen to other readers. It really takes me some time to figure out what all these arrow (in various colors and with different styles) are used for.   3) The adversarial domain aggregation part seems naive a bit. Loss functions for different discriminators are just simply linearly combined tegother. This is too straightforward in my view. I originally thought there would be some discussion on how to design this part and why doing so but no such content is found.
