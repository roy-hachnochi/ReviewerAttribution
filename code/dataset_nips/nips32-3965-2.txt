I am not entirely convinced about the validity of incorporating semantic alignment, based on the assumption that the aggregated domain image and the target image should have the same segmentation labels, which seems rather strong over a diverse source-target pair. It is unclear what exactly make a "feature" - this needs to be clarified so as to justify the proposed feature alignment.  Overall, the framework reflected by Eq. 9 is rather large, and it is unclear how costly it is computationally.  As for the experiment results, two questions can be asked: - Compared with the source-combine DA, the proposed MADAN framework gives only marginal improvements on most of the classes. Interestingly, for "Sky", source-combine DA performs much better. Is there any explanation?  On the other hand, poorly performing classes remain so with MADAN - is it really worthwhile to use such a complicated framework? - The ablation study results are not very convincing. Using SAD alone achieves the best performance on "sky"; further progressive additions receive poorer results. In fact, contrary to the claims made by the author, progressive additions actually degrade the performance, e.g. for 5 classes, SAD+CCD+DSC+Feat gives worse results compared with SAD+CCD+DSC. SAD+CCD gives the best result on "person", better than SAD+CCD+DSC and SAD+CCD+DSC+Feat. Although the addition seems to give growing mIoU indices, to me the often marginal improvements obtained by these algorithmic components may not be counted any significant contribution.    Section 4.4 gives some generalisation results. It could be strengthened by adding a progressive multi-source DA process, from GTA/Synthia->BSDS, to GTA/Synthia/Cityscapes->BSDS, so as to demonstrate a better case for "multi-source".   Some minor corrections:  - Eq.3, missing a half parenthesis after G_S_i->T(x_i)-x_i: should be G_S_i(x_i))-x_i - End of p.2, the claim "our method can be easily extended to tackle heterogeneous DA ..." seems too strong. By adding one "unknown" class won't solve the issue of having multiple new classes; same to training on "a specified category".
