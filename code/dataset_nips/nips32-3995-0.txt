Originality: although it is not groundbreaking, the paper is interesting to read. From the methodological point of view the originality comes from being the first paper showing how to perform regression with covariance matrices where the target is defined across persons. Information is missing on the difference from other techniques working with matrices for within-subject target and also comparison to Spoc is missing. Quality: the paper is quite easy to follow. I miss the following: 1) information on regression strategies within person and point out the differences to the method presented here. 2) a block diagram with the steps to be performed in each of the two cases they describe (for the covariance based approaches). 3) in case of rank deficient matrices: missing comparison between the method for rank deficient matrices versus methods for full rank matrices but using regularised covariance matrices. 4) significance results of the comparisons between methods. 5) comparison to SPoC. The paper states: "based on spoc method" but it is not clear if spoc could have been useful in this case nor how the methods would compare. 6) there is not clear claim about weaknesses of their approach. Clarity: the paper is clear, but some information is missing (see previous point). Significance: the paper is interesting for experts. It would fit the conference. It provides a new experimental approach. Clarifying its relation to Spoc might increase the significance of the paper.
