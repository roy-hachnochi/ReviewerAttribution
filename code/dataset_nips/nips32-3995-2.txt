The paper studies regression with rank-reduced covariance matrices from MEG data. Rank-reduced covariance matrices are an issue because they are the product of modern EEG/EMG artefact and noise reduction methods. The authors study two Riemannian approaches by projecting MEG covariance matrices into a tangent space: Firstly, the Wasserstein metric and secondly, a combination of linear projection and geometric distance. To evaluate the performance of the method the algorithm is applied to artificial data set and to the Cam-CAN dataset. Results of the proposed method are also compared to results of other state of the art methods. The results suggest that the proposed method is only outperformed by the complex biophysics driven source modelling.  The proposed framework is novel and based on the Riemannian Geometry, which is becoming a more and more important approach used for the MEG/EEG analysis. Related work is properly cited. The paper is well structured and clear. The authors reasoning and rationale is sound. The discussion of pros and cons of the method could be increased. Particularly, because the used cross-validation approach may lead to an optimistic assessment of the regression. The reviewer understands that the whole Cam-CAN dataset was randomly sampled and that authors used a 10-fold cross-validation to test the regression. For example, a leave one-subject out cross-validation would have made a more realistic assessment of the performance. Nevertheless, the idea and the results are significant and other researchers will build on this idea.  ======== Response to authorsâ€™ feedback: Thank you for the clarifications.
