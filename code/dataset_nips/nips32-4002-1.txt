Originality: This paper focuses on generating tabular data comprised of both continuous variables and categorical (discrete) variables. With some methodological ideas such as mode-specific normalization, and using conditional GAN to counter feature-imbalance, the proposed approach outperforms previous methods. In addition, related works are well cited.  Quality: It is rather difficult to assess the importance of the methodological contributions of this paper without any ablation study. It would have been informative if I could see how influential mode-specific normalization and train-by-sampling were. It is also a weakening factor that TVAE mostly outperforms TGAN, the main model of this paper, in most tasks.   Clarity: The paper is clearly written and easy to understand. Sufficient details are provided to reproduce the results with some effort. However, it would make the paper stronger if the source code and the benchmark datasets were publicly available.  Significance: There are demands for generating synthetic tabular data, and this work will clearly be a milestone in that effort. It is doubtful if the community will use TGAN, but it is likely that they will at least use TVAE.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- After reading the author feedback: I appreciate the ablation study. The argument for supporting TGAN's strength over TVAE is not unreasonable, but there is no empirical evidence to support the claim. Overall, I'm keeping the score to 6.
