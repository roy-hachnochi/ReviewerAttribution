Originality: The paper has several novel contributions on tabular data representation learning and generative modeling.   Quality: The technical contribution of the approaches are at a high level, although there is room for improvement when the connection with implementations is considered.   Clarity: The paper is overall well-written, the notations and explanations are easy to follow.  Significance: Tabular data is vastly understudied despite its popularity in real-world AI. Many fundamental challenges of tabular data learning are throughly studied in this paper, showing excellent results on generative modeling. I believe the topic of the paper is very important.  Further comments/questions:  - Reversible data transformation would be very important for discriminative modeling as well. Were they considered for critic models, for evaluation purposes? - How extensively neural network hyperparameters are optimized? Is there room for improvement through better hyperparameter optimization? More discussions would be valuable.  - I couldn't understand why VAE outperforms GANs significantly in some cases. Are there fundamental optimization issues?
