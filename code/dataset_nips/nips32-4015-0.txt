In this paper the authors analyze the trajectories of variables in ADMM, and make use of these descriptions to propose an adaptation of ADMM.  I really liked this paper.  The presentation of the paper is ok, in the sense of content and explanations, although there are lots of typos and weird sentences (see some below).  In the definition of partial smoothness, you need a function, a point, and a manifold M_x.  However in line 92, it reads "Suppose R \in PSF_x(M^R_x)", and the set M^R_x is not defined above (and the same for J)  I would have liked to see the trajectories in the experimental section as well, since Fig 1 seems to be for a toy example. Specially for the case not included in the theorems (R and J not polyhedral, but spiral trajectory).    Minor comments:  Please take a look at this sentence in line 50. "Given an arbitrary [...] converges faster to z*". It's missing a verb.  Line 19: "becomes" should be "became", and the use of "owing to" is weird. I would suggest something like "ADDM was first proposed in [13] and has recently gained increasing popularity due to [6]."  Line 118: depending the leading eigenvalue -> depending ON the leading eigenvalue  Line 125: when it failures -> when it fails  Line 128: The above scheme can reformulated -> The above scheme can BE reformulated  Line 144: implies -> imply  Also take a look at the sentence in line 167: "As E_s,q contains the sum ...". The verb is also missing in this sentence.
