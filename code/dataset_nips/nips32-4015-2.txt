The paper talks about the trajectory of z_k in ADMM under convex setup. Authors prove that, near the local stationary point, v_k = z_k - z_{k-1} equals to a rotation of v_{k-1} plus some smaller order terms. When objective functions are polyhedral, smaller order terms can be dropped off. Moreover, when either of objective functions is smooth and A is full-rank square matrix, the rotation matrix has real eigenvalues for large enough gamma. Under this result, authors show some examples that ADMM with inertial acceleration fails in. In particular, authors study the Lasso problem and show when gamma is small, inertial acceleration does not work out. Motivated from this phenomenon, authors further propose A3DMM to do extrapolation, which is also tested in experiments.   This submission has good quality and clarity overall. The analysis is also significant. But I have few concerns:  1, why do we focus on z_k, an intermediate variable of ADMM, instead of psi_k. If similar results can be proved for dual variable, and acceleration step is applied on either x_k (or y_k) or psi_k (which is usually the case), then it makes more sense to me.  2, for the theoretical analysis of z_k, I don't see when direction of z_k will be a straight line. The straight line should correspond to M = I, but this result is not discussed in the paper.  3, for Proposition 2.4, authors claim that if gamma is smaller than threshold, M has complex eigenvalues. but trajectory could still be spiral (or straight line? again, why straight line is not clear). How does this argument predict the behavior of inertial ADMM? I don't see the threshold of gamma distinguishes the behavior of z_k clearly.  Also, authors need explain why 2.4 implies straight line for large gamma. 4, It's not clear if the failure of inertial acceleration is due to the z_k-z_{k-1} term from the experiments. Authors should show some iteration trajectories on this term from figures. For many variant ADMM, it's common to have step size parameter before gamma, and analysis will impose conditions on step size. It's not surprising to see inertial ADMM fails for small gamma. To claim the failure is because of direction z_k - z_{k-1}, authors should provide evidence. 5, different from analyzing direction of z_k, it seems that some extra conditions are imposed on M when showing convergence of A3DMM. However, M only has existence argument in previous section. How those conditions on M reduce the function candidates is not very clear. The experiments also ignore the condition on M.
