The paper reads well, the content is very clearly presented. The stylized example and the application section provide a convincing illustration. However, the paper is not very original, not from a mathematical perspective at least. A reader may understand that the motivation for using a L-lag coupling rather than a 1-lag coupling, is to obtain `` sharper bounds'' [line 40]. First, it could be useful to provide some intuition behind this fact. Second, the authors should try to compare the convergence speed of the L-lag bound estimator with the corresponding 1-lag bound estimator. The examples show that the L-lag bound estimators are typically more stable but a quantitative analysis appears compelling. It would thus help a practitioner to know if the L-lag bound worths being used since for a replication of the L-lag coupling is typically much more computationally involved than an equivalent 1-lag replica. In the Application section, the Authors should mention if the assumptions 2.2--2.3 are satisfied.  Minor comment l106 N times independently
