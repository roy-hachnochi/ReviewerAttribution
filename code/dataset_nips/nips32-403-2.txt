This submission presents a number of modifications to simplify volumetric layers in networks for optical flow estimation. These not only improve the memory and execution time requirements, but also accuracy when compared to previous work. It is also demonstrated that the new networks are able to more effectively generalize to and be repurposed for other correspondence tasks.  Originality:  This is a new method for the visual correspondence problem, and addresses quite a few shortcomings or limitations of existing methods. Related work is adequately cited and used to contextualise the proposed work.  Quality:  The authors takes care to properly explain and motivate design choices, and back up claims with a sufficient amount of experimental evidence.  They are also successful in evaluating the strengths of the method, but could have perhaps put more effort into analysing its weaknesses.  Clarity:  The submission is written and organized well. I only found a few small typos, as listed under "improvements" below.  Significance:  This work does seem to be significantly new, with important results that can advance state-of-the-art research and practice of optical flow estimation. Tests show quite conclusive improvements over previous work.
