I think this paper is a very good read. It is both pedagogical and brings interesting food for thought on a very active topic. English usage is good and references are adequate.   Although it may be interesting to hint at how much the ideas could or could not be conveyed to more general nonlinear settings, the methodology is interesting and I particularly liked the core section 3 about dynamical analysis of the model output along iterations. The theoretical findings are supported by experiments.
