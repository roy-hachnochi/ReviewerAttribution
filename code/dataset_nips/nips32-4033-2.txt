Overall, I found this an extremely interesting paper. The paper is well written (though most proofs were in the Supplementary section), provides a good background (although this is also relegated to the Supplementary section), and makes an interesting contribution to our understanding of deep learning. I appreciated the approach as well, and at least to me, this was novel as well.  The paper is original, technically sound (as far as I checked---but I cannot vouch for all the proofs), well written, and significant.
