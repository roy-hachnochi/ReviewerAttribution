The key idea of this paper introduces a new deformable part model for 3D shape reconstruction. The key idea is to make the deformable model learnable. The approach is not brand-new, but it manages to put all the pieces together.   The paper also has a very good evaluation session, with very detailed components on baseline approaches and evaluation metrics, satisfactory results, and some analysis.   On the down side, the paper can be made stronger, by analyzing the proposed approach deeper. For example, it is still that clear why the proposed neural network model can learn good deformation model? It can benefit from a more detailed analysis.
