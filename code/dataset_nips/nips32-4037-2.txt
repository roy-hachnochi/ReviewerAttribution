Summary This paper proposes a pipeline, decomposing/modeling 3D shapes by learned elementary structures, which can be used in shape generation and matching. The authors build their pipeline based on AtlasNet, with elementary structure learning modules so that all the elementary structures are not fixed but learned from data. Two approaches are then introduced, one based on deformation, and another directly learns the translation for each of the points. The authors then discuss the design of loss function: if we have point correspondences across training examples, then we can use the trivial squared error; if not, we can use Chamfer distance as the loss. Finally, the authors demonstrate the performance of the proposed model, by doing shape reconstruction on ShapeNet dataset and doing human shape reconstruction and matching on SURREAL dataset.  Strengths -The idea of learning elementary structures from data is novel. By letting the model learn from data, with higher probability, the model will be able to learn some meaningful structures. -The results look impressive. As shown in figure 3, the proposed method successfully learned some meaning structures (e.g., tailplane in figure 3(b)).  Weaknesses -Need to improve the readability. For example, the notations and names of modules are kind of confusing. In figure 2, t_1 to t_K are bold while d_1 to d_K are not bold. In line 101, p_1 to p_K are called positioning modules while in line 144 they are called adjustment modules. Making all of them consistent would help readers to understand the paper more easily.  Comments after the rebuttal ************************************ Thank the authors for the rebuttal. The results in Figure 2 looks good, but still not particularly amazing. So I kept my rating.
