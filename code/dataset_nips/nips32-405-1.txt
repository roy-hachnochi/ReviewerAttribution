Overall  * this presented idea is interesting and well-suited for NIPS * the methods are well explained in general * the experiments are serious  Little information is given on training parameters and on the neural networks architecture, hence it is hard to judge how strong and efficient the solution is.    major -----  Having multiple templates calls for a (difficult) model selection step.  Also, it is likely that conditional templates are lower quality than unconditional ones: this should be investigated and documented. Overall I don't feel very enthusiastic about the idea about multiple templates.  Hyperparameters: gamma, lambda_d, lambda_a are apparently set arbitrarily: this is bad and typically limits the use of the method.  Fig. 6 is bad quality and labels are not readable  It is a pity that examples on digits are far more developed than experiments on T1 images. I would have been much more interested by a serious experiment on brain scans, involving e.g. age prediction.  minor -----  Awkward to denote A the Laplacian of the graph, as a stands for the template parameter.  l.30 "If the template does not adequately capture the dataset variability" but the variability is captured by the deformation model rather than by the template ?  l.59 I feel uncomfortable with assertions such as "For example, in studying disease impact, it is helpful to register scans to age-specific 60 templates rather than one covering a wide age range." is this true ? I think that this really depends on what your question is.
