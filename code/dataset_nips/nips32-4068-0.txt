The paper makes some observations about the word2vec and glove algorithms, specifically in light of their connection to factorizing the PMI matrix of co-occurrences. However it's not clear how the contributions are relevant, beyond them being a list of observations. Some sections explain the empirical relevance of these contributions, but the arguments are often convoluted (see contributions section).   I also believe the claim made in the paper that much is left unknown about word2vec/glove (specifically what is learned and why is it useful) is exaggerated and in fact a lot of subsequent work has answered these questions. In particular the success of pre-embedding, unsupervised distributional methods is not new at all (see, e.g. the overview paper by Turney et al, 2010)  Specifics: - Some parts of the paper simply re-iterate previous work, such as the beginning of sections 4 and 5. - How was the LSQ method in Table implemented exactly?  - Please clarify 4.2 and 4.3 including the use of terms similarity and paraphrasing
