Although the estimate of the computational order is limited to some simple problems, the authors successfully demonstrate when the existing approaches such as epsilon-greedy, R-MAX and interval estimation based exploration strategies result in poor performance compared with the proposed algorithm. The study is quite thought provoking and I believe it would stimulate the future research on this area.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- After reading the other reviewers' comment, and the concerns how to determine the demand matrix is fair. SoI will lower my score from 9 to 8.
