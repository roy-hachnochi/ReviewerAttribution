The paper introduces a transformation which is elementwise strictly monotone (a bijection, i.e. invertible in principle) as well analytically invertible. The goal is to improve the flow's flexibility without losing access to an analytical inverse---which then enables *both* sampling and likelihood assessment. The technique is compatible both with couplings and autoregressive flows.  The general idea is based on dividing a segment (say from -B to B) in bins by predicting bin widths (determined by ordered knots -- computed via cumulative sum of unordered predictions) and heights. Parameterising the transformation also involves predicting positive derivatives at the knots. This paper employs the parameterisation of Gregory and Delbourgo (1982).  For the parts the paper does discuss, it does so reasonably clearly. But the parameterisation itself (key to flexibility) and the inverse transform (one of the big selling points) are considered supplementary and only explained in an Appendix.   The empirical analysis shows a mixture of competitive results and state-of-the-art results, but generally never worse. In particular, density estimation shows clearer advantage for the proposed splines. The VAE setting was limited to MNIST and EMNIST -- it was unclear to me why not use all the typical benchmarks (Freyfaces, Omniglot, Caltech101), especially in light of a comment by the authors that suggest the datasets are too simple for their flow to shine. The authors also show results competitive with Glow in generative modelling (CIFAR and ImageNet) while using a rather compact model (up to 10x smaller parameter footprint).  Whether or not the proposed flow will be widely used will largely depend on practical concerns regarding implementation (and availability of code): for example, it was unclear to me what difficulties (if any) underlie the parameterisation and the computation of the inverse.
