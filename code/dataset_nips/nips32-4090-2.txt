This is a novel result on the MAB problem with limited switch cost problem. The authors show a intuitive method to reduce the switch cost in the unit swtich cost case, and then prove that their method is optimal.   They also show the constraint on the number of switches inside an MAB game. The regret is reduced a lot only when the budget of the switches has been larger by k-1, which is the minimum cost to try every arm in a period.   Then they generalize their result to the case that the switch costs are arbitrary. In this case, and propose the HS-SE policy. This policy is still optimal in a lot of kinds of swtich cost case, and near optimal in other cases.   This is a good paper that shows the relationship between number of switches and the culmulative regret. It is useful in some kind of real applications. The proofs are correct, and the writting is clear as well.
