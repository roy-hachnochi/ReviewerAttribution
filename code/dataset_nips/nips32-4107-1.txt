Major: What is the explicit objective function: reconstruction, information preservation? In what noise regime are we? input noise, output noise, large, infinitesimal? My understanding is that the objective function is information preservation in the infinitesimal noise regime for both input and output. The objective function should be stated explicitly, and the equations of the article should ideally be derived from this initial objective function.  Minor "In vision, the density of cones in the retina differs by several orders of magnitude  between the fovea and the periphery" => closer to one order of magnitude: see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4985666/  eq7: define a, gamma, x. where does the number of receptors appear?  eq8: how did you apply the Fourier transform? steps missing.  eq10: what is the unit of a? what is the number of receptors?  Do you assume that both regions have the same size (low density and high density regions)?  Possible discussion point: why are receptors arranged in an inhomogenous way in the first place?  clarity: OK quality: good. originality: havenâ€™t seen anything like this. significance: medium/high. implications for AI?
