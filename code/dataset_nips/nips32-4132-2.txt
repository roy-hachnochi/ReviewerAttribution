[Originality] This paper proposes a new task of generating 3D geometry of molecules. I think the task is original and important for computational chemistry. The underlying generative model is a variant of SchNet that expands the molecule one atom at a time along with its distance to previous atoms. In that regard, the model is similar to GraphRNN (You et al., 2018), but operating over point clouds instead of graphs.  The related work is mostly complete, but I think the author should discuss how is their method different from Mansimov et al., 2019, which is also a generative model for 3D molecular geometry. AFAIK, Mansimov et al.'s model only generates 3D geometry, while GSchNet learns to generate both the molecule (atoms and bonds) as well as their 3D geometry (distances).   [Quality] The submission is technically sound. The experiment covers both conditional and unconditional generation tasks. Overall the experimental results support their claims. It compares against CGVAE in terms of how well the learned distribution matches the training set (number of different atoms, bonds, etc.). It would be better to also compare the distribution of chemical properties (logP, QED, etc.).   [Clarity] Most of the parts are clear. What is unclear to me is  1) what is the relaxation procedure and why it is necessary for evaluation. 2) The advantage and disadvantage of the proposed method compared to Mansimov et al., 2019.  [Significance] The paper developed a novel method addressing a important task in chemistry. I think other researchers will be interested in using the method for future research.  ===================================================================================================================== Here is my response to the author rebuttal: 1) It is good that the authors provided comparison with Mansimov et al., 2019 (a very important baseline). The result shows that G-SchNet achieves better performance. It would be helpful if the authors can clarify more on the setup of Mansimov et al.'s model. 2) The authors explained about relaxation procedure. I think it would be better to provide some examples to illustrate how this would impact the performance (RMSD) in the future (e.g., in the appendix) 3) I agree with the authors regarding the novelty of the task (generating 3D molecular geometries). Based on these points, I will keep my original scores.
