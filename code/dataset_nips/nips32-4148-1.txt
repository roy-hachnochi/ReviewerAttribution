(Originality) The authors claims the novelty lies with the construction of a novel epsilon-corsets with k-median and k-mean objective. The constructed corsets which is of smaller size than the full set is used in existing fair clustering algorithms. This construction is very similar to that proposed in [25]. Originality seems minor.  (Quality) It would be more meaningful if the corset construction was conducted  with k-center objective.  (Clarity) Well written and relatively clear- better if there were illustrations. (significance) Empirical error that is  superlinear with increasing epsilon. How is  this a concern?
