> The BiGAN image predictions seem noisy along the grid. This might be the result of suboptimal architectural choices (low model capacity, filter size etc).  > This approach seems quite similar to "Neural Rerendering in the Wild" (Meshry et al)  at CVPR 2019. This paper uses a similar approach of using point cloud representations in the context of multi-view reconstruction. How are these methods related?   > It would be good to get clarity on how different this work is from Meshry et al. before evaluating contributions in this paper. I hope that the rebuttal clarifies this.
