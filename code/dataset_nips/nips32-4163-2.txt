I thank the authors for their response, and would like to maintain my overall evaluation.  =====  The paper is generally well-written and addresses a fundamental problem. The proposed algorithm seems sound, although I will let other reviewers comment on its novelty as I may be not familiar with the most recent developments in second-order methods. The appendix is quite comprehensive, but I have not gone through to verify the proof details. The experiments (Section F in the Appendix provides more details) appear to confirm the theoretical claims, although it may be helpful to discuss or compare with the Newton sketch of [24] (same as [25]).  A couple questions regarding related work:  - I'm still unclear how the proposed method compares to the Newton sketch of [24]/[25] both theoretically and empirically, in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.  - As the authors noted in Section 1.1, methods based on sketching and sub-sampling are essentially independent of the condition number. In this case, what are the advantages of the proposed approach?
