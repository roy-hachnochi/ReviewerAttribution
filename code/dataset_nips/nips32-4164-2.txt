Originality: Unsupervised continual learning treated in this paper is challenging and quite important  in the context of continual learning and lifelong learning. The proposed algorithm has several desirable properties including dynamic expansion and mixture generative replay, and can deal with both unsupervised and supervised continual learning problems.  Quality:  Although the authors do not provide the theoretical guarantee for the algorithm, the numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the algorithm. The authors seems honest about evaluating the proposed algorithm and other state-of-the-art algorithms as long as I see Table 3 and table 4.   Clarity: This paper is totally well-written and the explanation for the proposed model is intelligible. Moreover, the authors provide adequate information about related work.   Significance: The problem settings treated in this paper is quite significant in continual learning and the proposed algorithm has several interesting properties. I believe this paper inspires various ideas for readers.
