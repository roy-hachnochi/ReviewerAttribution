[Originality] The authors present a parameterized complexity analysis of CPS, which seems to be motivated by the recent success on Matrix Completion. The results systematically explain the tractability and the hardness when CPS is parameterized by # algorithms, # tests, length, algorithm failure/success degree, test failure/success degree, failure/success cover number, which are extensive and clearly original. [Quality] * This paper demonstrates not just positive side (i.e., fixed-parameter tractability) but also negative side (e.g., W[2]-hardness), which strongly reveals when (and why) the exact solution of CPS is hard or easy to find, while the intuitive statement that the success relation governs the computational complexity is convincing. Some of the proof techniques are technically complicated as far as I have read in the main paper though based on fundamental paradigm (such as DP). [Clarity] * I was confused with the proof of Theorem 7: in the deformation from Line 337 to Line 338 in page 7, the authors removed the "\log(n+m)" on the "4" in the runtime; however, the factor 4^{(2tw+5) log(n+m)} seems to be poly(n+m)^(2tw+5) for some polynomial function and it is not FPT (but XP) if so. Please clarify the deformation from Line 337 to Line 338. * Also, including the concrete deformation from O^*((log(N))^k) to O(f(k)+n) for some k in Line 339 (instead of just referring to [19]) makes the paper more self-contained. [Significance] Overall, I thought this is a good paper devoted to the systematic complexity analysis for FPT of the CPS problem, which is motivated by applications. [Minor issues] In proof of Proposition 1, $t$ is used to denote test and destination of the DAG (e.g., Line 155 and Line 158), which should be revised.  ==== UPDATE ==== Thank you for providing the feedback. The modification to DP tables makes sense and the fixed-parameter tractability of CPS[failure treewidth] sounds correct.
