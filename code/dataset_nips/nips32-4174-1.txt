This paper proposes the MEHC complexity measure. That MEHC is used to obtain a tighter bound in the context of UCRL2 by a relatively simple modification to the original derivation. To the best of my knowledge, this is an original result. The paper is well-written and provides an interesting insight on the fact that the reward function in itself should ideally be taken into account in complexity measures.   The paper might possibly be improved by considering different usage than for improving UCRL2 bounds.  The definition of the MEHC depends on r_{max}, wouldn't it be more consistent with the diameter to define it irrespectively of r_{max} by using a scaling factor (i.e., dividing it by r_{max})? ---------------------------------- UPDATE: After reading the author's rebuttal, I see that the authors have provided an interesting discussion based on our suggestions. I have chosen to maintain my score and I believe that the paper is a good paper that should be accepted.
