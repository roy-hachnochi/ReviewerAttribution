Originality: The theoretical contributions are largely based on well-known ideas (Sipser and Spielman, 1996). However, the adaptation of these ideas to Hopfield nets is interesting and original.   Significance: While associative memory networks are certainly interesting objects in their own right, as a submission in the neuroscience track, I could not say that I took away concrete neuroscientific insight from reading the paper. Indeed, the paper spends hardly any time on this except for a brief paragraph in the discussion. I feel like the paper will be much stronger with more discussion on relevance to the neuroscientific community.   Quality: I did not check all the proofs in the supplementary material in detail, but the work appears to be technically sound and supported by simulations.  Clarity: I feel like too much of the actual results and concrete details have been relegated to the appendix. For example, the main paper does not even include equations or much detail about the energy function, dynamics or learning of the proposed architecture. Oddly enough, the equations that are included are not of the main model.  Minor: please include a legend in the panel in Figure 2c. ________ I've read the author's feedback. Thanks for your response and expanded discussion on relevance to neuroscience.
