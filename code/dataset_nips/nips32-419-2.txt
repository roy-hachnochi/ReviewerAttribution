The definition in (2) seems quite important for the analysis, e.g., the proof of Lemma 7. But the original definition of Orlicz norm is slightly different from (2). That is, in (2), the equality is strictly hold and the $Â¥alpha$ should be unique. I'm not sure the whether (2) and the definition of the Orlicz norm is equivalent or not. Please make sure the relationship between these two.  The authors mainly focus of the regression problem in the article. However, classification or non-linear regression are also important in practice. Could the algorithm extend to such a more general problem?
