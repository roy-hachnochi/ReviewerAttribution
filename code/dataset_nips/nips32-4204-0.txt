The result is not that surprising, but to the best of my knowledge its statement is novel and it could be an interesting addition to the literature on implicit bias. It appears that the analysis mostly leverages the results of Soudry et. al. [2018], i.e. the authors make appropriate transformation to AdaGrad iterations and relate them to "induced" GD iterates. Also, event-hough simple, I find the small examples in Section 3.3.1 quite enlightening. On the other hand, not so convinced about the value of Prop. 3.1.(especially after seeing the stringent assumption of Lemma A.6)
