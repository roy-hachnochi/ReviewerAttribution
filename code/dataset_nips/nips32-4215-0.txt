Update: Thanks for the detailed feedback. I appreciate the theoretical and methodological exploration and improvements, but I hope the presentation can be made more clear to eliminate possible confusions.  ======  I believe the quality of the paper is good, as the technical development and proof are sound and theoretical concerns are widely covered. I am not satisfied with the presentation. I cannot distinguish clearly the novel contributions from existing results, e.g., I cannot tell if Theorem 1 has new results or is a known result listed for a modern proof, if it is a novel idea to use the multivariate orthonormal polynomials in EZ, and if Section 3.1 contains novel results. I also expect more details on the methodological modification over BH for the proposed sampling method for multivariate Jacobi ensemble. I expect at least one experimental result is provided in the main context for each of sections 4.2 and 4.3. Based on the confusion, I cannot tell precisely the originality and significance. But I think a modern analysis on an old method in parallel with a recent one aligns important methods in the field, providing more connections and comparisons of the two methods, and making a foundation for more methods and analysis in the field.
