this paper is well-written and intuitive. the approach sounds technically correct. the novelty is moderate. The paper doesn't aim for a significant technical contribution. Instead, it tackles the valid problem of video recognition using a limited computational budget. the related work is short and some works are not covered: -SlowFast Networks for Video Recognition -Skip-RNNs in terms of results, it shows the benefit of conditional gating for processing fine features. the experiments are relatively convincing but its improvement is not significant I believe.  - in Table 1, the results for the UNIFORM method is shown for 25 uniformly sampled frames, which results in almost 2x GFLOPs compared to the proposed method. However, Fig.2 shows that to obtain the same accuracy, uniform sampling needs slightly more frames than the proposed method (~1.3x).
