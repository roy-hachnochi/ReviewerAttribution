Originality:   The task is not new, as the authors mentioned in the related work section, many previous literature have worked on this problem. The proposed method is very similar to this paper (Low-Latency Video Semantic Segmentation, CVPR 2018, and other literature as well). Hence the novelty of the paper is limited.   Quality:   I have one concern about the gating mechanism. How to justify it is really working? The gating mechanism is a one layer MLP, outputting the probability of whether to extract fine details of the video frames or not. Maybe it is just doing a random selection. The performance gap between the proposed method and the uniform baseline is really small, which is hard to justify its effectiveness.   Another thing is, for video classification, usually we pick Kinetics, UCF101, something-something as the evaluation dataset. This submission choose FCVID and ActivityNet, which is hard to compare to previous approaches. And again, it is hard to justify the method's effectiveness.   Clarity:   This submission is well written and easy to understand.
