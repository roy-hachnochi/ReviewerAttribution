The conditions of main Theorem 3.1 are quite technical and hard to interpret. It is not clear to me what this result actually implies in practice (also, on the original problem) and how it can be helpful in analyzing or understanding better the training of neural networks. Although this is motivated earlier in Corollary 1.3, again, the conditions there are quite technical and the results does not seem to say much about the properties of local minima of the original problem.
