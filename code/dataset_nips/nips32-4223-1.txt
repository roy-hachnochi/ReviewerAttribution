The paper introduces a method of applying back propagation for fitting parameters of spiking neural networks. The approach relies on firing rates of spike trains to define the errors and uses what seems fairly similar to standard backpropagation with some exception for the recurrent case.  I find two main issues in the paper: 1. In event based processing, you typically want to treat events dynamically. The proposed algorithm treats a chunk of data at a time since it needs a history of spikes to define the error and therefore is not really event based.   2. This point is probably rephrasing the former in some way. Essentially it appears that the algorithm is not a new back propagation algorithm but rather a new model for spike data that allows for processing with standard back-propagation (except maybe in the recurrent case). Therefore, in terms of separating data model from optimization/fitting method the work is not presented clearly.  Questions: You cite the paper [23, 38, 4, 33] for providing competitive performance using a similar approach to yours however it appears that you do not compare with any of them. Why is that? Please clarify or modify.  Minor Comments: Probably the exposition of your algorithm can be simplified by some restructuring so as to avoid superscripts/subscripts. It just seems too verbose at the moment.   Update after review: The rebuttal clarifies considerably both in terms of a comparison with BPTT and for the event based processing. I will modify the score accordingly
