- The authors verified the effectiveness of latent variables in SRNN for speech density estimation. They point out that the performance advantage of F-SRNN could be entirely attributed to implicitly utilizing the intra-step correlation. Their experimental results show that under the non-factorized output setting, no benefit of latent variables can be observed, the straightforward auto-regressive approach demonstrates superior performance. The authors performed a thorough analysis and discussion on the problem setting and give reasonable assumptions. They carefully conducted the empirical experiments and the results are convincing.  - The paper offers some meaningful recommendations such as: besides capturing the long-term temporal structure across steps, properly modeling the intra-step dependency is also crucial to the practical performance.  - I was surprised at the massive increase in the auto-regressive results in column 2 of Table 4. Therefore, it is somewhat uncertain to determine the difficulty and importance of these improvements.  - Overall, this is a well-written paper. The language is easy to understand, and its results are highly reproducible. Therefore I recommend accepting for publication following minor revision.
