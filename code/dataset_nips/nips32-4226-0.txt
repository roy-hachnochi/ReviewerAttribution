Originality 3/5: Given the PESMO and MES work, this is a straightforward direction of work.  Quality 5/5: There are a few places that could use some clarification: - Algorithm return statement: How is this Pareto front constructed? Should it not also return the Pareto set, which is probably of greater interest to a practitioner? How would the set be constructed? These are not immediately obvious to me. - Line 259 and equation 5.1: How do you compute this "ideal" Pareto front? Especially for the real-world problems.  Clarity 5/5: Very clearly written paper. Structured in a way that is very easy to follow. Conclusions from experimental results are nicely summarized.
