The paper provides a nice generalization of SVGD. It does this by optimizing the KSD over a different unit ball of functions--instead of using the direct sum of d copies of an RKHS with scalar-valued kernel, it considers the unit ball of vector valued functions that arise from considering an RKHS associated with a matrix valued kernel. This allows one to better capture local information in the density functions, as evidenced in the experiments. The authors also point out how this variant of SVGD reduces to many other variants of SVGD as a special case.  L102: There looks to be a typo. Do you mean to say the vv-RKHS is equivalent to the direct sum of d copies of H_k? Experiments 1 & 2: Is there any way to compare the algorithms on CPU time rather than iterations? The matrix valued SVGD will take longer per iteration, and it would be nice to see how these approaches compare as a function of time.  Originality: The paper produces a generalization of SVGD that captures many other already known variants. It also provides a computationally feasible version that is useful in the experiments shown.  Quality: The paper appears to be correct.  Clarity: The paper is very well written and easy to follow. It was a nice read.  Significance: The paper is a nice contribution to the topic of SVGD and provides some ideas for incorporating more information about the score function.
