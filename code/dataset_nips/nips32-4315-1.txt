The paper is well written. The problem is well described and formalized. In some points the theory is a bit hard to follow even becouse some proof/explanation are postponed to the supplementary, but this is of course due to the space limits.  The aim of having 'one' deep architecture that can accomodate multiple learning tasks which benefit from reciprocal transfer even beyond their specific differences is challening and of large interest for the community.
