The content of this paper is dense at times but the clarity and writing quality is good for the most part. The main contribution is quite interesting as the paper proposes a new framework MUiR that can share parameters across different tasks even when the architectures used are different. Nice analysis of the algorithm time and complexity are also provided in section 3. Where the paper falls short for me is in the theoretical and empirical comparisons with prior work.   For the synthetic results MUiR is compared to some multi-task learning baselines. The experiments seem to indicate that other algorithms can achieve similar or better performance. For the cross-modal results MUiR achieves good performance, but is not compared to any relevant architecture selection models. I still lean towards accept because of the nice framework and algorithmic analysis. However, the paper could be significantly improved by providing some more competitive multi-task learning baselines as part of the the cross-modal results for context.
