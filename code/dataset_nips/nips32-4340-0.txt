The listing of 14 references in the first sentence (without providing any information about them) is unnecessary.   “For supervised dimension reduction, we perform SVM on XW using 10-fold cross validation after learning W” This is a clear problem in the experiments. The generalization of the DR method should be tested on out of sample data.   Since the final mapping is a linear projection Z = X*W, comparisons should also include linear subspace learning methods.  Comparisons should also include the use of kPCA (or approximation using Nystrom method) for the data projection.
