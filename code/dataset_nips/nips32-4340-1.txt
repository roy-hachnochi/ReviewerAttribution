The paper extended the theoretical guarantees of ISM to a family of kernels beyond the Gaussian kernel. The paper also showed that a conic combination of ISM family of kernels stays as a valid ISM kernel.  Pro: 1.  ISM can be utilized as an efficient solution to a variety of IKDR learning paradigms.  2. Experiments on both supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms and for a variety of kernels showcase the generality of ISM.  3. verify the improvement in speed offered by ISM as an optimization algorithm for solving IKDR compared to competing methods and with better or comparable accuracy.  Cons, the novelty seems not high.  1. the method and algorithm seem straightforward.  2. experiments are more toy
