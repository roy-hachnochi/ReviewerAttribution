Originality: This paper applies approaches in Maximum Inner Product to the problem of quadratic regression in order to reduce the time and space complexities. It is also interesting that convergence analysis can be established for such methods.  Quality: Although theoretical results have been established for the proposed methods, the strength and optimality of the established results are unclear. Furthermore, the numerical simulations do not show the trade-off between statistical and computational efficiencies.  Clarity: The paper is basically well-written.  Significance: The problem is not really well motivated, so it is hard to evaluate the significance of the proposed method.  -----------After rebuttal---------- Given my previous concerns are mostly addressed, I changed my rating from 5 to 7.
