There are other previous methods that can generate valid molecules. For example, the relationship with the following paper is not clear. Hiroshi Kajino: "Molecular Hypergraph Grammar with Its Application to Molecular Optimization", ICML-19, Long Beach, CA, 2019. The authors in the above paper insist that most generated molecules are chemically valid.  Did the authors compare with the method in the above paper?  The detailed of the proposed method should be provided. I understand the page limitation.  I would appreciate if the authors could provide the detailed explanations on the proposed method in the supplement.  How did the authors use the method in the following paper? Marwin HS Segler, Mike Preuss, and Mark P Waller. Planning chemical syntheses with deep neural networks and symbolic AI. Nature, 555(7698):604, 2018.  Data used in this paper were not provided, so the code did not work. There is no README file. Please provide data and the README file that describes how to run the program. Otherwise, it is impossible to evaluate the reproducibility of the proposed method.  There are several typos. Line 98: we hope gives Line 128: has has Line 248: a target molecules
