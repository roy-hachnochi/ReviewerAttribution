This paper considers the problem of DP data releasing. Suppose there is some data set, the task is to release the "profile" of it in a DP way. This problem is important in DP and has several applications, e.g., discrete distribution estimation problem. This paper proposes an algorithm which runs in polynomial time and achieves almost optimal l_1 loss, which makes sound theoretical contribution.  Their algorithm is based on the following nice observation: there are at most \sqrt{n} different profiles. It loses linear in n (or even worse) by purely releasing profiles or counts, since you have to output all n items in the worst case. But if combining these two in a smarter way, only \sqrt{n} needs to be lost.  This paper is well written overall. The writing is generally neat and there are only few typos.
