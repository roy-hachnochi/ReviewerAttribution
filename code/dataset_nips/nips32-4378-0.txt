- This paper considers the online forecasting problem for non-convex machine learning methods. It first introduces a new concept to measure the regret of the online learning algorithm. It then proposes a method with sublinear regret (under the new regret definition). Experiments are not very comprehensive, but sufficient for a theoretically inclined paper.   - The problem being studied by this paper is important and interesting: non-convex machine learning with gradient-based optimization. The proposed concept for dynamic regret is simple and intuitive. The theorems and results are clearly stated and proved.  - The proposed technique of using exponential weights is sound, but seems rather straight forward and incremental compared with Hazan et al.
