Originality People have tried local search for some combinatorial optimization problems before, but I could not find any references to boolean satisfiability in particular. Doing curriculum training when there is a measure of difficulty, is not new.  Clarity I found it clear.  Quality The authors do the first step in replacing CDCL SAT Solvers, by having a model that decides which variable to flip next. The findings support the claims, although the evaluation could have been on slightly more difficult instances (e.g. that WalkSAT doesn't solve)  Significance The value of SAT Solving is finding solutions to problem in the real world (plus human modelling), industrial instances were not evaluated or trained on, so it is diffcult for me to measure this.
