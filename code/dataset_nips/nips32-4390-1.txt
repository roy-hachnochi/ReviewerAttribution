This paper proposes a new approach for graph compression by optimal transport (OT). Specifically, it adds a l_0 norm constraint to the LP programming induced by OT and relaxes it to the projection into a simplex. The final problem can be solved by a customized mirror prox method. Empirical studies on are also shown.  Following are my concerns:  1. Theorem 4 presents a condition under which the relaxation can recover the optimal solution of the original problem. It seems better to give some more discussions, .e.g., the mildness of the requirements.  2. Figure 1 claims the high efficiency of the proposed method, but the experiment settings and the implementation details are missing, so whether the comparisons are fair is not clear.
