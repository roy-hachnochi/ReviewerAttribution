I regard the contribution as novel and exciting. First of all, from the methodological perspective. I appreciate the clarity and high technical quality of the submission.   Nevertheless, I have a few technical questions/concerns:  1. Experimental setup, and Table 1. All experiments were provided for sufficiently small and very sparse graphs. For better understanding the value and the limits of the approach, it would be great to have more experiments over larger datasets. If larger datasets are available, do you have experiments with a higher compression ratio? What are the results?  2. For DHFR dataset, the results of different methods are almost the same. Do you have any insight regarding that? Is there anything unique in this dataset?  Update after the authors' response:  Many thanks to the authors for addressing my concerns. I have no more concerns regarding the paper.
