Although the experiments are not sufficient, I like the theoretical analysis part of this work. I have one question in the experimental part: How to obtain the theoretical bound in Fig. 2 (a)? If it is directly computed based on Eq. (19), how to decide the constants B and C?  Typos: Line 5: “dons” Eq. (11): “N” -> “N x N”
