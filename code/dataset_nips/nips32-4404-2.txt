Overall the paper is clear and well presented. The intuition of the algorithm is also explained. I only have minor comments on the results.   1. Can we make Theorem 6.1 in a more general setting, maybe under some assumption on the error checking oracle or has the number of this oracle been called in the bound? 2. As pointed out by the authors, the proposed algorithm is not optimal. This can be seen from a particular setting: stochastic bandits. It may also help the readers to better understand the algorithm by discussing its behaviour on a stochastic bandits setting. In particular, in order to identify the best arm, Algorithm 2 line 6-8 is not optimal. Have the authors tried to improve this part? 3. Can the results on Lemma A.4 be generalized to other setting rather than linear approximation? ============== After rebuttal: I have read the rebuttal and other reviews. My score remains the same.
