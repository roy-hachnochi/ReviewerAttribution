This paper presents the novel Chirality Nets where pose symmetry (chirality equivariance) is directly built into the networks. The proposed method has fewer trainable parameters and lower computational complexity. Extensive experiments on three different tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed method.  The idea of parameter sharing is not novel, however, this paper designs a series of novel variants of the standard building blocks. The idea of built-in chirality equivariance is well motivated and interesting. Chirality equivariance for human pose regression is of great importance and interest to the community. Extensive experiments on various tasks show the wide range of potential applications of the proposed method. The paper is reasonably well-written and easy to follow. The authors also provide codes to ensure the reproducibility.  Questions: (1) Will parameter sharing cause a loss of model representation power? Table 1, 2 and 3, it seems that the proposed Chirality Nets will (slightly) outperform the test-time augmentation baseline. Why? Can parameter sharing be viewed as a kind of model regularization to reduce overfitting? (2) The reviewer is also curious about the 2d human pose estimation performance of the proposed method. In the 2d human pose estimation tasks, there exist large in-the-wild datasets (MSCOCO and MPII dataset), where the overfitting problem is not significant. Will Chirality Nets achieve good results in such cases?  =================UPDATE==================== After reading the comments and the author responses, most of my concerns are addressed. Overall this is a good paper. I will raise my rating from 6 to 7.
