The paper proves that deep ReLU networks can approximate smooth functions defined on low dimensional compact manifolds where the number of neurons depends exponentially on the dimension of the manifold instead of the dimensional of the ambient space.   Given a function f, the network consists of three main subnetworks: (1) a subnetwork that given a point returns the chart it belongs to (2) a subnetwork that approximates f on this chart and (3) a pairing subnetwork that combines the results of the first two networks.  I like the motivation and the research question that is raised in this paper. The main motivation for considering this problem is the fact that many important data types (e.g. images, text) are believed to occupy only a low dimensional manifold in the ambient space. Previous universality results imply that the size of the network has to be exponential in D in order to get a specific approximation bound. Nevertheless, many networks with significantly fewer neurons perform very well. The theoretical result in this paper can be seen as a possible reason for their success since it shows that good approximation can be obtained by a network that whose size is exponential in d, which is often much smaller.   The clarity of the paper varies. Section (1-3) are very well written and easy to follow. The informal version of the theorem on page 2 helps to understand the main result of the paper. The figures are also very helpful. On the other hand, I found the main technical part (section 4) very hard to follow. I was not able to verify all the mathematical details.  A few concrete questions/comments: Step 3: there is an ambiguity in determining the chart to which a point belongs to, how this is solved? Step 4: Taylor approximation has local error guarantees in general, in contrast to the L infinity approximation used in this paper. Can the authors discuss this early in the paper?  Information theoretic bounds - can the authors elaborate? This part was not clear as well.  To conclude, I think that this paper targets an interesting question and provides a very nice result. My relatively low score is due to the fact that the technical section is very hard to read. I think that in its current form this paper might not be accessible to a lot of people in the community.  ************************** Post Rebuttal: ************************** After reading the other reviews and the author response I stay positive and decided to raise my score to 7.  I still think the paper presents an important theoretical contribution and I trust the authors to do the best they can in order to make it more accessible. In addition, from my perspective, the fact that there are no experiments is not problematic.
