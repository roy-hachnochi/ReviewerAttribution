The paper is well written but the notions of atlas, chart, reach may be arcane to most readers here. I don't know what is the best way to simplify this but a short paragraph with simple informal descriptions of these terms would go a long way.  The result is nice and also introduces several important concepts from Manifold theory, but the proof idea is pretty much as one would expect given the assumptions of bounded reach giving a bounded atlas and continuity of several order of derivatives allowing a taylor approximation within each chart.  Of course any intuition about why any such functions (even with additional assumptions) may be learnable by gradient descent would be much more interesting as that is the bigger mystery of deep learning.
