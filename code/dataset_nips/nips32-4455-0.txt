After reading the rebuttal and other reviews, my score remains the same.  ========  Overall the submission presents a novel, simple-yet-non-obvious change to existing approaches that can yield substantial improvements. The change is well-motivated and accompanied by appropriate supporting theory, which is correct to my knowledge. The experiments are appropriate: the authors show improved performance, and also study the sensitivity of performance to the choice of the constraint \epsilon (showing of course that there is a tradeoff to optimize). On the whole it is a solid paper and I recommend acceptance.  Some small comments: - There is a minor typo in the displayed equation after line 376 around the $s$.  - It would be good to explain the identity in line 378. - Please be specific about what part of [31] is being referenced in line 166.
