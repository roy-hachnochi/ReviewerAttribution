Comments and Questions:   Originality: The paper presents a constrained version of the \psi function for minimizing the sum of submodular set functions. As far as I know, I  did not see this technique before.   Quality: Experiments support the fast convergence of proposed algorithms. For the theoretical results, can you get a faster  rate than previous algorithms, say, [15] and [17]? Meanwhile, is it possible to give oracle complexity in terms of either discrete minimization  or function value evaluations? This would be a good way to theoretical justify the advantage of your algorithm.  Clarity: Overall, the paper is well-presented.   Significance: Submodular minimization is well applied in segmentation and constraint satisfaction, this technique would be a good  way to accelerate the SFM process.   - The choice of \epsilon depends on diameter of the base polytope D. Is there an efficient method to estimate  it?   - From the experiments you observe a tradeoff of choosing \epsilon, do you have some heuristic method to choose it.   - Do you see a hope of applying this technique to minimizing submodular functions over continuous domains?   Minor comments:  - line 68: loop to the solve -> loop to solve -line 196: less than less -> less than
