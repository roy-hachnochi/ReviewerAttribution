[Edit after the author feedback]:  I thank the authors for addressing my comments during the author feedback. I have read the authors' response as well as the other reviews. The authors' response addresses my concerns on the simplicity of NQM. Overall,  I think this submission is interesting and provides a different direction to understand neural network optimization. I am happy to raise my rating.  ==========================================================  Summary:  Motivated by recent various batch size phenomena in neural network training, this paper proposes a simple noisy quadratic model (NQM) to capture/predict the features of several optimization algorithms with different batch sizes in neural network training. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of predictions of NQM on image classification tasks and the language modeling task. Also, the experimental results are consistent with previous studies.  Pros: - The proposed model in this paper is well aligned with various phenomena in deep neural network training, which could be an interesting direction to study the role of batch size in training deep neural nets. - Empirically, this paper provides detail and importance analysis on the connection between NQM and different optimization algorithms. - The experiments are extensive, clear, and well designed, which characterize the key features of the batch size effect.  Limitation: - Although the proposed NQM agrees well with previous empirical results (i.e., Goyal et al. [2017], Shallue et al. [2018]), as the objective function in (1) is convex and the quadratic form is diagonal, I think the model is not powerful enough to explain those phenomena in neural network training.  Questions: - As shown in Eq (1), the objective function is very simple. Could the authors provide more explanations to justify the problem setup? As the problem is much easier than training deep neural networks in real applications. - L95, 'we assume without loss of generality that the quadratic form is diagonal'. Could you explain more on the diagonal quadratic form?  There is an omission in the related work on large batch training: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05011 https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00962
