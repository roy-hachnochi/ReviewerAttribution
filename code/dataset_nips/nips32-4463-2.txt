- This paper proposes a novel text embedding approach in the spherical space and develops an optimization algorithm to train the model. - The claims in this paper are well supported by theories and their derivations. - The results on text embedding applications look pretty good. It shows the model can learn text embeddings in the spherical space effectively and efficiently.  Weaknesses: - The paper is well organized, however it might be hard for the readers to reproduce the results without the code, especially in Section 4. A step to step illustration of the optimization algorithm would help. - The authors did not show the possible weaknesses of the proposed model.
