This paper proposes a new approximated search method which improves a recently proposed graph-based maximum inner product search (MIPS) method. The idea is to use Mobius transformation to convert an inner product problem into a l^2 problem, and then use HNSW to solve it.  This idea is simple yet ingenious. In this way, the advantageous components of HNSW, an approximation of l^2-Delaunay graph, can fully function in the IP setting. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-art methods.  The writing is clear and easy to follow. A good paper.
