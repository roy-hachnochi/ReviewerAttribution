This paper studies the Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem. MIPS is vital for various machine learning tasks such as Recommender Systems and multi-label classification. This paper proposed a new graph-based index for fast MIPS.  The main idea is to apply Mobius transformation on data and then construct a l2 distance proximity graph (on transformed data). Then MIPS is conducted by greedy search on this graph.  The authors provide theoretical analysis for the proposed method. They prove that the construct proximity graph in l2 on Mobius transformed data is an isomorphism of the IP-Delaunay graph on original data, which is the theoretical foundation of conducting MIPS on graph-based index.    Strong points: (1) The idea of processing data by Mobius transformation is impressive and make sense for the MIPS task. After transforming, MIPS answers (those with higher norms) would be near to 0. So, the additional data point, 0, provides good initial nodes for the greedy search.  (2) Comparing to the previous graph-based MIPS method, ip-NSW, this paper provides more solid theoretical analysis for the proposed method, which is also a key part of this paper's contribution. (3) The proposed method is evaluated by extensive experiments on various public datasets. The baselines are all state-of-the-art methods for the MIPS problem, published in recent two years. The improvement is significant in most cases.  My suggestions: (1) The disadvantages of ip-NSW explained in Section 2 are validated by experiments in Appendix G, this is good, but I would suggest to move part of related experimental results to Section 2 from appendix. This part is important for readers to understand the previous method ip-NSW and motivations of the proposed method. (2) Typos. I found in some figures of Appendix, the proposed method is referred as 'Mobius' but as 'Mobius-graph' in other figures.   After the authors' response: All my questions are well answered. I would not change my score.
