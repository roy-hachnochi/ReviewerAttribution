This paper presents an original re-framing of the error classification as performed over a random class of classification problems, a re-application of existing methods in a new context to solve it, and an empirical analysis to justify that analysis.  The key concept, of re-framing the classification task as being random, represents a novel intuition and they immediately pull fruitful analysis from it.  The quality is high; the technique and proofs appear to be sound, the experiments are clear, and the supporting code appears well organized (though I haven't run it).  The clarity is high, with clear notation and writing. It is easy to follow, despite a rather abstract problem formulation.  My only nitpick is the font sizes and reliance on color in Figure 2.  The significance is moderately high; the approach is an intuitive improvement as a fairness metric, and the provided code increases the extensibility.  I expect this will be an important comparison method for future approaches to generalizable fairness.  After review of the author's/authors' rebuttal, I still believe this is a top 50% paper.
