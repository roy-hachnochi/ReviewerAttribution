Clarity: The paper is a pleasure to read. The motivation is clear and the problem is well situated with respect to other work in the literature. The paper is self contained and in general, flows well. Due to space constraints, some of the content such as simulation results were deferred to the appendix.  Quality:  The approach and derivations shown in the main paper appear to be sound and correct. That said, I did not scrutinize the derivations given in the appendix.   Clarifications needed:  (1) It is claimed in the introduction that the problem of finding the optimal EoP can be done in polynomial time by performing binary search on \xi. Does `polynomial’ here include being polynomial with respect to the true optimal (1/\xi)? If not, could one possible construct a particular set of payoffs which has arbitrarily small \xi, that is, when binary search is applied, could take arbitrarily many iterations.  (2) The setting in section 6 is unclear to me. The motivation behind the QR policy is allowing for a continuous set of attacker types. On the other hand, the model being considered is strictly more general than in previous section (allowing for randomized commitments), and is reported to obtain better utility than the “perfectly rational” agent. In this setting, is the attacker aware of the bounded rationality behind the defender? If so, is the optimal report of the attacker (assuming the attacker type is the space of all possible attacker payoffs) still one that makes the “fake” game zero-sum? Furthermore, is there any particular reason why the authors selected the QR policy (other than convenience?). There are other models for bounded rationality that result in randomized outcomes  Originality: The problem setting and the contributions listed earlier are novel to the best of my knowledge.   Significance:  The paper shows the counterintuitive that a manipulative attacker is incentivized to report payoffs which make the game zero-sum. The EoP metric is sensible and could be of interest to the game theory or multi-agent communities, in particular, those who work on deception. The setting of a manipulative attacker featured here is (to the best of my knowledge) fairly novel.  Other comments: (3) There appears to be a typo in Example 1: the payoffs should be r_A = 3 and r_B = 1; in the text, these values are swapped. (4) It is known that stackelberg games may be reformulated (albeit in a clunky fashion) as an extensive form game (see the manuscript “On Stackelberg Mixed Strategies” by Vincent Conitzer). It appears (correct me if I am mistaken) that the problem setting considered in this paper could be given the same treatment. This conversion to extensive form games could also be performed for the setting with randomized defender policies. Could the authors provide some insight here?  =============================== Post rebuttal: The authors have addressed my concerns adequately. That said, I maintain that section 6 is poorly written and should be significantly improved, alongside the other recommended changes. As such, I am keeping my score unchanged.
