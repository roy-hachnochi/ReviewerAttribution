This paper presents a hybrid algorithm (learning-in-the-loop optimization). This algorithm is tested on different robots in 2D and 3D. Although learning-in-the-loop optimization is not new in itself, the way the authors use it is interesting. The  convolutional variational autoencoder is used to reduce the dimensionality of the robot, which is a very common control strategy. Instead of using the classic control theory, the surrogate observer seems a promising or good alternative way given the increasing power of modern computation. While close loop learning and optimization is promising, it does shows the problems such as stability and convergence. Another drawback of this method is it may works for robot that is with regular shape. The examples shown in the paper are all block-based robot which might not represent the real-world robot well. Also, representing the robot in 2D grid seems over-simplified. The methods relies on a fullly differentiable simulator, which may be another limitation as not many differentiable simulators are available.
