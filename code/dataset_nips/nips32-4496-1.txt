This paper addresses the unsupervised 3D shape generation problem by using the implicit surface function. The paper is well written and easy to follow. My biggest concern is that while the experiments show the implicit function can achieve better results than explicit representations, the training time and inference time are not shown and compared. And how the authors infer the 3D shape at evaluation and what resolution they adopt can be described in more details.  Another question is how the support region radius affects the prediction.
