Post-rebuttal: Thanks for the response. Would be great to include the rebuttal discussion in the final version of this work. >>>>>  This paper proposes a new framework for certified robustness of graph neural networks. The task under consideration is node classification and the threat model allows for addition and removal of edges under local (node-specific) and global upper bounds on the permissible perturbations. Under this threat model, the paper derives efficient algorithms for obtaining robustness certificates using a suitably designed MDP. The margin formulation can further be used to derive robust losses for training.   The problem is well-motivated and significant, the writing is clear for most parts, and the theoretical contributions are excellent! The robust training algorithm and experimental validation further lends support to the proposed framework. I haven't checked the proofs in great detail, but overall I enjoyed reading the paper and believe it is a significant contribution to the field.  Some comments/questions for the authors: - The theoretical exposition crucially hinges on the fact that the GNN logits for the pre-final layer (and consequently the margin) is linear in the propagating vector (e.g., PageRank scores). This is not true for most GNNs used (e.g., GATs, GCNs). Could the authors shed light on the difficulties in analyzing robustness of non-linear propagation schemes under similar threat models? - The experiments for robust training are done in a transductive setting, i.e., when the full graph is visible. How would the robust training results look for inductive semi-supervised node classification (test graph contains more nodes and edges than train graph)?
