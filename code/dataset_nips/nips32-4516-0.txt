The paper is reasonably well written, but all proofs and technical details are left in the appendix.  Some higher-level ideas are provided tho.  I did not get to check the proofs.  One question that I have is that the theorems make reference to global optimizers, but in the discussion, it appears that global optimizers are those in a restricted domain, namely in [0,1)^n.  See lines 208 and 286.  So, the question is whether these points are actually global optimizers or optimizers in the specified domain.
