The proofs are complex and mostly given in the supplementary material. Though I understand the main ideas behind the proofs and find them technically correct, I admit that checking them in detail would take me many days and I did not do it. I have only minor comments:  - 66: "a natural to" is a typo, a word is missing  - 117: "linear time algorithm" could be confused with linear convergence rate, which is nto the case here. Please, be more precise perhaps (we can epsilon-approximate the functional in time O(1/epsilon).  - In eqn (3), the variables x of the MF functional take values {-1,+1}. But e.g Lemma 2.1 speaks about critical points on (0,1]^n. Did I miss something? Please explain.  - Section 3.1: Is the "dual" Bethe free energy really derived already in [34]? I did not find it there, please perhaps refer to a concrete place in [34]. This (or similar) "pseudo-dual" to Bethe free energy is proposed also in [T.Werner. Primal View on Belief Propagation. UAI 2010].  - Perhaps, section 2.3 could be omitted. This result is known and not needed for the rest of the paper.  POST REBUTTAL: The rebuttal and the other reviews did not change my view on the paper, which I consider very good.
