The major contributions of this paper are that it proves the global convergence of BP(Theorem 1.3) and VI(Theorem 1.2) on ferromagnetic Ising model with a specific initialization, i.e., to initialize variables to be 1. The proof of Theorem 1.2 is based on the fact that the mean-field free energy function, i.e., \Phi(x) is concave on the set S obtained by the update rule, and then we can use Holder’s inequality to expand the \Phi(x*) - Phi(x_t) and get the upper bounds. The proof of Theorem 1.3 is based on the fact that the norm of \Phi(v)’s gradient is less than 1(Lemma 3.2), and the properties of variable \mu sandwiched between v^0 and final v^T(Lemma 3.5 and Lemma F.1). Other minor contributions include that it provides examples to empirically show the convergence(appendix G) and it shows how to use ellipsoid method to optimize the beliefs(appendix H).  I have to admit that I am not familiar with this area, so can only go through a part of the proof, and I am not able to evaluate the originality and quality of this work.  Pros: 1. The paper is well organized and the proof is solid. 2. The proof shows that initialization is important to the convergence of BP and VI, which is a very interesting discovery. 3. The proof of BP’s global convergence is important. I think it should be helpful to future works on proving convergence of BP on more general MRFs.  Cons: There are some minor problems. 1. I did not see the definition of \phi(v)_{i \to j} in the main paper. I think it is important so should be moved from the appendix to the main paper. 2. I can kind of understand the difference among x_t, x_i, and x_{t,i}, but I think the definitions are not clear enough, and it is useful to use a better way to define them, e.g., x^{(t)}, x_i. 3. In line 575 of appendix, I don’t quite understand the definition of T(v,i,j). That is, what’s the difference between v_{i \to j} and v^{(t)}_{i \to j} 4. In line 622 of the appendix, I don’t quite understand how to get the inequality. In line 626 of the appendix, it is hard for me to derive the inequalities via Lemma 3.2 and F.1, so I think it would be better to add more details of this proof.  ======================================== I have read the authors' responses, and other reviewers' comments. I did not change my score. The main reason is that I am not quite familiar with this area, so cannot evaluate the significance of this work. I do not want to overestimate the value of this work.
