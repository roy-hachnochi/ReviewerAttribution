Originality =========== The paper extends previous analysis for the population version of policy gradient algorithm for LQR to the actor-critic algorithm with GTD critic. In addition, previous analysis only considered deterministic dynamics and deterministic policies, while the current one studies ergodic system with Gaussian noise and Gaussian policies.   Quality =========== The paper seems theoretically sound. The proofs in the appendix are very well detailed, although I have not checked them carefully.  The authors put their results in context with previous analysis, like the nonasymptotic analysis of GTD due to [17].  It is not clear how Assumption B.1 can be ensured in a model free setting, with no knowledge of A, B, Q or R. Numerical experiments illustrating the analysis even for simple MDPs would have strengthened the paper.  Clarity =========== The paper is generally clear and well organised.  Some notation is not properly introduced in a few occasions.  Significance =========== The paper considers the LQR with Gaussian policy and dynamics, a model that has proved successful in several robotics applications. The contributed analysis can potentially shed some light on whether a model-free actor-critic algorithm is the right approach as opposed to learning the model dynamics. The techniques used for the analysis might be useful for other algorithms with similar linear updates.  On the other hand, the authors claim that their analysis may serve as a preliminary step towards a complete theoretical understanding of bilevel optimization with nonconvex subproblems. However, the proposed techniques seem quite specific for the linear update setting, and I haven't found clear evidence that supports this claim in the text.
