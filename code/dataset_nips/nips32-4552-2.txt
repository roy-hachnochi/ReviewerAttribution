This article deals with multi-category pattern classification in the framework of universum learning. The authors introduce a new multi-class support vector machine which is an extension of the model of Crammer and Singer. For this machine, they establish a bound on the generalization performance and a model selection algorithm based on an extension of the span bound. Empirical results are provided. They are obtained on three well-known data sets.  This contribution introduces a relevant solution to the problem addressed. It seems to be technically sound, although I could not check all the proofs in details. Regarding the originality, it is noteworthy that other multi-class extensions of the span bound can be found in the literature, for instance in the PhD manuscript of R. Bonidal.  The major choices made should be better justified. For instance, the M-SVM of Crammer and Singer is not the first option that comes to mind since its loss function is not Fisher consistent. The choice of the capacity measure (Natarajan dimension) is also unusual. Indeed, one would have expected to find a scale-sensitive measure, let it be a Rademacher complexity, a metric entropy or a scale-sensitive combinatorial dimension (fat-shattering dimension of the class of margin functions...).  Some minor corrections should be made. For instance, The notation for the Kronecker product is used at line 145 but introduced at line 200. Below is a non exhaustive list of typos. Line 42: natarajan -> Natarajan Line 47: propostion -> proposition Line 110: the the -> the Line 247: Table 2 show -> Table 2 shows Line 249: upto -> up to  *** Update ***  I appreciated the answers to my comments.  RÃ©mi Bonidal's PhD manuscript can be found at the following address: http://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2013_0066_BONIDAL.pdf  I think that the paper of Maximov and Reshetova is not technically sound (to say the least).
