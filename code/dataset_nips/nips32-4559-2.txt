UPDATE AFTER REBUTTAL: Thanks for your responses. I would appreciate if you could incorporate the reposes from the rebuttal into the paper (in case of acceptance). Especially,  -better highlighting of the contributions (moving some of the cited auxiliary results to the appendix might  also be worth considering) -discussion of stochastic updates -for the promised discussion on alterative approaches: please check again if all primal-dual methods really require a 'star-topology', and not just a connected graph; and include references to the literature; similar with the comment on gossip averaging: the literature discusses already many variants (respective 'orders' of averaging/update steps); so please check again there as well. ---  Clarity: Overall, the paper is well written and easy to follow. However, I would encourage to highlight contributions w.r.t. to previous works more clearly (e.g. pages 4-5 consists of a host of theorems cited from previous work, the transition to the new contributions is a bit vague, and also most results look like trivial extensions of these cited results, so commenting on this would help guiding the readers to the novel points). Quality: The theorems all look sound; however, only asymptotic results are provided. Further, comparisons to alternative baselines (instead of DSG) would strengthen the paper. Originality & Significance: As outlined above, the significance could potentially be estimated more favorably if discussion/comparisons to strong baselines could be added.  Related work: With many recent advances on the matrix completion problem, such as e.g. also [Matrix Completion has no Spurious Local Minima, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07272.pdf], the results here might not come as a complete surprise (though it is for the decentralized setting). Could the authors comment to connections to this work?
