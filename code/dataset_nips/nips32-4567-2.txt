Con: Sentence structure and terminology is a bit unclear in some cases [e.g. line 69, 79] Some measures of comparison are not explained fully [e.g. Xilinx FPGA slices] Figure 3 is not very well explained [e.g. what was the sampling process, how many samples?] Could indicate best result in each row of Table 1 Pros:  Novel approach  Clear outline of the data set used for benchmarks Well-structured sections Good background section, well explained theory and mythology The experiments and comparisons made to other systems were well reasoned  Motivation of the project was clearly outlined and justified Results reported show great decrease in computational complexity while achieving a better accuracy to similar models.
