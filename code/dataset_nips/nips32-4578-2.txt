This paper proposes a regularity condition together with an adaptive mirror-prox algorithm aiming to solve VI problem with possibly singular operators. They recover the optimal rate of $O(1/T)$ in the deterministic case by replacing Lipchitz continuity with the proposed one, both for MP and AMP. Also, they prove the $O(1/\sqrt(T))$ convergence rate of AMP in the stochastic case. The paper presents nice results but some are not surprising.  Some issues in details:  1. The idea of Lipchitz-like condition is proposed by other works. Also, the Bregman parts are not novel.  2.  The stochastic result $O(1/\sqrt(T))$ is basically mirror-prox under the proposed condition. The analysis of AMP covers the deterministic case only. So the statement Line 13-15 is kind of misleading. At the same time, the theory parts are not too strong.
