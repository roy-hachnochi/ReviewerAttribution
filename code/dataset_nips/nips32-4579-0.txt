Originality: This work introduces a novel featurization of graphs, with focused application in chemistry. I feel it is an important contribution in the field, and I would read this paper all the way through if I read the abstract in another context.  Quality: This is a complete work with careful empirical validation. There are error bars in one plot, but no mention I saw of what they indicate. Error bars in the tables would be appreciated to ascertain whether small differences are significant or worth considering further. I am unqualified to critique the theory portion of the paper, so I hope another reviewer can comment on its validity and impact.  Clarity: The paper is overall well-written. The field of graph neural networks is large and growing, but I feel the work is adequately cited.  I have a few typographical nits: - line 38 "supervisedly" is awkward - line 56: "that has not parameters", typo - line 76: improper use of "entails" - line 112: "now it suffices", awkward phrasing  Notationally: - between line 78 and 79, the notation for V is confusing to me. Shouldn't there be a third index, e.g. V_{i,0,C} should be the {0,1} value indicating if atom i is a carbon? Otherwise, it should be made clearer that V_{i,0} is a vector.  Significance:  I believe this work is significant, as it opens a route for CBOW-like methods for graph classification and regression problems.
