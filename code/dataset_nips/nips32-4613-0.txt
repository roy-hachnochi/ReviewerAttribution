I really liked this paper. However, as someone not yet familiar with the attribution method, I found the algorithmic details quite sparse. I would like a description of how the attribution *algorithm* works, and not just the mathematics underpinning it.  For example, from Eq. 2, it looks to me like attribution could be done by using regression between r(t) and the W*s convolution, to find G_{cxy}. Is that what the authors did? Was there any regularization to that regression? How were the regularization parameters chosen? These details matter for readers who might want to use this approach in their own work.  It would also be nice for the authors to share their code; I'd like to mess around with these methods myself, and I suspect the same will be true of other readers.
