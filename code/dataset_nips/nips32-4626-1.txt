I think the paper is in a very interesting area but feels unfinished. The paper is reasonably well structured, though some parts felt repetitive (e.g. lines 45-75 in the introduction). Some definitions were difficult to find (typos + small comments are at the end of this section), but overall the descriptions of the background and model were easy to follow.  Ultimately, the experiments appear inconclusive. The paper only shows results for SpiCe challenge 0-3, where challenge 1-3 are synthetic examples (simplest) and challenge 0 were not a part of the competition scoring. So, it is unclear how the model will scale. The Tomita experiments were also small and inconclusive. It is also unclear how the RNN hidden size is chosen and how it will affect the WL and WFA algorithms.  It would also be helpful to understand how different hyperparameters of the model affect results. The variation tolerance $t$ matters a lot. It would be interesting to understand why t=0.1 is chosen, and what the effect is in altering $t$ for all experiments. The table expansion time and the random seed probably also affects performance.  I am curious about some design choices. For example, what is the significance of using total variation vs other distance measures (e.g. KL divergence or cross-entropy)? Also, in the experiments, it’s not clear whether Step 3 (answering equivalence query) is ever used. What should be done if the hypothesis is not accepted?  Typos and small comments:  * The notation $w^k$ in line 108 should be (I think) $w_{:k}$ * The colon in line 28 should be a comma * I didn’t see an explanation for what the contents of the observation table $O$ is -- with the exception of lines 182-183, which states that the observations are tokens and not distributions. But the following line 184, along with the rest of the paper, discusses the comparison between *next-token distributions*. (Are you using RNN prediction probabilities for comparison or the empirical probabilities from the samples?) * The notation $q^i$ doesn’t appear to be defined. I assume it is referring to the initial state. Maybe use the notation $q_0$ instead, to since $i$ is often used as an index? * In line 125, the definition of the last token probability, the equation should be $\frac{P^p(w \cdot s)}{P^p(w)} * In line 193, “prefix weight” does not seem to be defined * The Tomita experiment results were difficult to find. Maybe a subsection heading or a simple figure would help
