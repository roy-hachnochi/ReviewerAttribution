Originality: this paper is a straightforward extension from Hewitt and Manning (2019), with more detailed analysis (attention probe, geometry of embeddings, word sense analysis) and interesting discovery. It would be a nice contribution to help the NLP researchers to understand how BERT works and inspire further exploration. Quality: the mathematical arguments of embedding trees in Euclidean space are sound and important to help analyze parse tree space. Clarity: this paper is well-written and easy to understand. Significance: the discoveries of geometry for syntax and word senses are quite important and will be very useful for NLP research.
