my main concerns about the paper are: (1) Note that the authors considered d properties instead of one in previous research with the complex feasibility constraints. This makes the problem rather challenge and practical. However, the method the authors adopted for the d scenarios is relatively simple due to an independent assumption on the d properties, which may weaken the contribution here.   (2) Is it meaningful to provide a bound on the minimum possible number of retained items? (See line 16)  Is this a typo? In my opinion, it is more practical and meaningful to provider a bound on the maximum possible or expected number of retained items.   (3) How to set the number of considate items, k_1, k_2, ..., k_d with regards to each properties in the first stages? And also, how to set the total condidate number k here?    (4) In line 113, the notation for the edge (l, r) is legal, where l \in {1,2, ..., k}, r \in {1,2, ..., n}. However,  the notation for v_l(r) represents the value of item r associated with property P_l, where l \in {1,2, ..., d}. There exists inconsistence.  (5) In line 196-197, Assume towards contradiction that T retains an item cj \notin S..., should it be "reject" instead of "retain"?  (6) The paragraph for "Formulation as bipartite matching" seems redundant here since it is no longer referred in the later part.
