Originality: While the methods used in the paper exist already, I think the way in which they have been combined is sufficiently novel and interesting.  Quality: I think the idea is theoretically sound and is evaluated sufficiently. I agree with the intuition that encoding logits according to a Hadamard matrix provides sufficient separation between logits, which presumably makes it harder for an adversary to misclassify and input. I assume that when the authors say `white box attacks`, they reveal the Hadamard matrix and final layer to the adversary. The idea of using an ensemble of networks where each network predicts two bits is well motivated.  Clarity: I think the paper is very well written and could possibly be reproduced by others.  Significance: For me the most significant part of the paper are Tables 1, 2 and 3. I think the reported robustness and improvements over Madry is a convincing result.  Clarifications/weaknesses: 1. When the authors say `white box attacks`, I assume this means that the adversary can see the full network with the final layers, every network in the ensemble, every rotation used by networks in the ensemble. I would like them to confirm this is correct. 2. Did the authors study numbers of bits in logits helps against a larger epsilon in the PGD attack? Because intuition suggests that having a 32 bit logit should improve robustness against a more powerful adversary. This experiment isn't absolutely necessary, but does strengthen the paper. 3. Did the authors study the same approach on Cifar? It seems like this approach should be readily applicable there as well.  ---Edit after rebuttal--- I am updating my score to 8. The improved experiments on Cifar10 make a convincing argument for your method.
