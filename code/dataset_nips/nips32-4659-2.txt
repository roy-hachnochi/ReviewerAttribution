The presentation is good overall, but sometimes a bit hard to follow due to the level of technicality and the number of different settings/results. - As a non-expert I had a bit a problem following the presentation, sometimes an intuition could help, e.g. for fee or the balance (it becomes more clear later though).  - And sometimes it would be nice to also have a formal proof for prop3.1 (e.g., that (BI) in fact holds). (Even though it may be trivial, it would be nice to see it explicitly.) Similarly, for the two main Theorems of the paper. I was surprised that there are not proofs for them. I guess it trivially follows form the lemmas but please (easily) save the reader some time here. - This being said, the paper overall, incl. supplement, looks rather good and polished.  In terms of originality/significance, they do seem to strongly build on previous work in this direction, but seem to have enough interesting own contributions.  - In particular, from how it looks, they build on Mirrokni [2019]. Mirrokni also treats non-clairvoyant mechanisms (i.e., future type (=valuation) distributions are unknown), but Mirrokni does not *learn* the (current) type distribution.  In terms of quality, in the proofs they seem to be knowing what they are doing, but I didn't check the details. Looks interesting though.  This is a purely theoretical paper without experiments but this is fine with me.  After author response: Thanks for the response!
