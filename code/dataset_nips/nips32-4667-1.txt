Originality:  The work contains new analytic results for the spiked matrix-tensor model (in a limit in which they specify -- e.g. high-dimensional signal vector to be recovered) governing the transition to a "gradient-flow easy" regime. The analytic results are  in excellent agreement with the numerics. Analysis of the Hessian at a certain subset of stationary points reveals the mechanism by which gradient-flow is able to find good solutions in this intermediate regime (before landscape trivialization), despite the presence of spurious local minima.  Quality:  The work appears to be of high quality. The authors consistently specify which theoretical techniques and results are rigorous and which are based on physically reasonable guesses. Additionally, results which have appeared in prior work are carefully cited. The agreement between the theory and numerics is excellent, and the authors use multiple approaches to check that their results and intuitions are consistent.  Clarity:  The text and figures are easy to understand.   Significance:  The analytic results and resulting intuitive picture for this particular model is of interest to theorists working on high-dimensional inference. The intuition, and possibly some theoretical aspects, may carry over or be generalizable to other settings such as neural networks. There are relatively few semi-rigorous results on the behavior of gradient flow in a nonconvex optimization landscape, so this work appears to make some notable contributions.
