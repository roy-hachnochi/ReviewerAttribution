The reviewer has the following concerns:  1. Though the phenomenon of avoiding meeting exponentially many spurious local minimizers is interesting, running gradient flow dynamics from random initialization on this model seems artificial. A spectral initialization of the spiked matrix can already give an estimates that has non-trivial correlations when $\Delta_2$ is smaller than $1$. Why should one consider gradient flow from random initialization rather than gradient flow from spectral initialization?  2. In terms of technical contributions, early works already calculated the complexity and CHSCK formula, where the landscape and AMP threshold was given. The numerical computation of GF threshold was also given. The formula of GF threshold in this work was extracted from algebraic analysis of the complexity formula and CHSCK formula. This is an interesting analysis. However, it is hard to say if this contribution is enough for NeurIPS.   ------- After reading the authors' response and discussion with other reviewer, I increased my score to 6.   My concern was that, most of the hard works are already done in the previous papers, and the matrix-tensor model may not be interesting enough.   Now I think the heuristic Hessian analysis and perturbation argument for CHSCK in this paper is interesting. Moreover, since the matrix-tensor model is accepted by the community as an example to study computational complexity, it is good for people to have a better understanding about this model.
