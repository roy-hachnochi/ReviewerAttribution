The main weakness of the paper is its relatively low experimental results. It seems the proposed method is helping weak baselines, however, results are quite below the state of the art. As actions and scenes are correlated in current datasets, one way to demonstrate the advantage of the approach could be action classification and detection in untypical scenes. It would be good to see the evidence that the method improves strong baselines in such settings.
