The paper is clearly written and easy to understand.   The paper addresses an important problem in semi-supervised learning where the graph edges and weights in a graph-based method might come from noisy sources. The proposed GAM method predicts the probability that pairs of nodes share the same label. The output of the agreement model is used to regularize the classification problem. To account for the limited labeled data, the classification and agreement models are jointly trained.   Since the method can learn edges between datapoints, it addresses the issue common in cases when the graph is not provided, or the provided graph is incomplete in terms of having nodes that are disconnected from the graph. The experiments are thorough and explore the two settings of a given partial graph and having to learn the entire graph well across a variety of datasets.   The key advantage of this method in constructing graphs comes from better predicting label agreement than using a distance metric between the nodes. Since the GAM uses the features of the nodes, which is generated by an encoder, the quality of the encoder is crucial to the performance of this method. Exploring how the quality of the encoder and noise in the features affects the quality of the GAM and the overall jointly trained model.
