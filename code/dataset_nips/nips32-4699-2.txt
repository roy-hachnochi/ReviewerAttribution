This paper proposes a new label-propagation method based on deep learning. Instead of propagation the labels directly from the graph, it learns another function which determines whether the edge is connected for same-label instances or not. The labels are then propagated according to the new determined connecting same-label edge. The learning classifier and propagating labels execute iteratively.   Originality The limited novelty of the paper is mainly on the algorithm part. It first proposes to learn another function to determine whether the edge should connect two instances of the same label. Another is they use deep neural networks as base models for both tasks. The idea of using neural networks for semi-supervised learning has been explored for many years. Thus, the paper leads a small step to the deep-learning-based label propagation method. In the semi-supervised community, it has been discussed from long ago how to label the unlabeled data in a safe way instead of labeling them directly by classical semi-supervised methods. In this way, this paper can be counted as one in this trend and proposes a method to solve it, which simply learn whether two nodes should be joined or not.  Besides, the paper studies a well-defined semi-supervised problem, without any new insights or problem setting.    Quality One contribution of the paper is that they propose a training algorithm that resembles the co-training algorithm. However, the proposed method is not co-training. In co-training, two classifiers should both produce some data to feed to each other.  In this proposal, only one classifier is generating data, and the other classifier is used only to update the graph. This is more like self-training instead of co-training. Other parts are technically sound and the experimental results are good.  Clarity The paper is clearly written.  Significant The paper may be of practical use since the empirical results shown are good. However, it only adds a small modification to existing algorithms, and replace all the classifiers by a deep learning one. In this way, the paper does not give too much new information (new problems, new insights, new assumptions) to the community and it has only limited significance.  ===================================================== After the rebuttal, I will increase my score.
