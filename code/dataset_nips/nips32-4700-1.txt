The theory presented in this paper is solid and can provide basis for further research in this area, nevertheless the experiments section can use more exploration. Scalability is not mentioned for instance. It would have been helpful to understand how does this relate to real world graphs as well.  Upon looking through the author(s) response, my confidence is increased in the theoretical findings of this paper, and its ability to serve as a building block towards more complex models -- but I still think a more extensive experiments section could make the paper much stronger.
