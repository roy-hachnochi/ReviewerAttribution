The paper indeed proposes and discusses two specific Functional Neural Process models, with detailed model formulation. Although the context is highly technical, I can basically follow the information flow which demonstrates certain level of the clarify. In some sense, the idea introduced in the paper is one step moving forward from the existing literature such as [14] and [36] by considering vectorial latent variables etc. It seems to me the model is extremely complicated so not sure how efficient it is in practice although the experiments show some comparable results while no efficiency performance has been shown.
