This paper is well written, and presents a novel idea of pairwise image registration using RNNs that can be trained in an unsupervised manner. Registration performance  is on par with the B-Spline Image registration method and  is much faster than the latter. Authors have described their approach very well, and the provided convincing results as well as supplementary material that was helpful for the review.
