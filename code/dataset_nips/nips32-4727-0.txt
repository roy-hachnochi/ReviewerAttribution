* Update after Author Response * I think Reviewer 2 brings up valid concerns about the quality of the benchmark dataset presented in the paper. In my view, the creation of this benchmark is the main contribution of this paper, so it is important that it has high value to future researchers. The authors respond to the concerns and made improvements to the dataset. In light of this, I still believe this is a good submission and worth accepting, but I am revising the score to 7.  * Original Review * Overall this paper was very well written and a pleasure to read.  The strongest part of the paper is the presentation of the new benchmark task as well as the experiments based on it. Unfortunately, the experiments and the benchmark are built on Atari games, which have little interest in the real-world; it would be nice to see attempts at different tasks.The proposed state representation approach doesn't appear to particularly novel, but it is helpful to see its performance as compared to other approaches. There is no theoretical work here, but the experiments appear to have been executed well, and the discussion of the results is illuminating. Overall, I think this paper constitutes a decent contribution to the literature.
