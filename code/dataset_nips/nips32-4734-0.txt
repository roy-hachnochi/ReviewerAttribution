-The proposed objective function sounds like a reasonable idea except that the unlabel data is assumed fair. This seems like a critical limitation of the proposition.  - It is not obvious how to gather unlabeled features having the law of D^’, which is essential to use the semi-supervised learning algorithm. In practice, testing the fairness condition for real data can be more helpful. - All experiments were conducted using synthetic data, and there is no analytics for real datasets.    - Used examples are not good and somewhat confusing. For example, in NLP, the difference in modern past and present data can be caused by time-varying distribution. However, the authors regarded this selection bias only.        - To strengthen the paper, many measures of AI fairness should be considered. -This paper does not provide downloadable software Minor points: - Page 3, Background, line 5: Maybe replacing ‘protected dimensions’ by ‘protected attributes’ is better.   - Page 4, formula (1): p(y|x) -> p(y|x,w) - Page 6, Data generation, line 13: Where -> where    - There are no captions to the Figures 1 and 2, and the example to illustrate a hypothetical situation is very difficult to follow.
