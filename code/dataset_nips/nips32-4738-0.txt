The paper proposes to a KL-minimisation method based on the ratio q/p by a parametrised "ratio" model constructed from the Stein operator which automatically handles the constraint leading to a concave maximisation problem for the ratio.  Consistency results are given but these assume the parameter space is compact  (and other not so simple to check assumptions) which do not seem to hold in the numerical setting. The authors also show asymptotic variance converges to the inverse Fisher information, though this further assumes a (fairly strong) condition of uniform convergence which is hard to check. Nonetheless I think the contribution is quite significant as it provides a method to minimise the KL divergence without knowledge of normalising constants.
