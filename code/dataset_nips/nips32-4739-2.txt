 The paper is well organized, and mostly well-written (except for many spelling/grammar mistakes, which I've pointed out below together with a correction). In my opinion, fixing these would increase the quality of writing. The studied problem is original, and of significance in practice. The authors provide a clear statement of the problem formulation as well as their contributions.   I quickly checked the proofs in the supplementary, and they appear correct to me. Let me mention that I did not check all the details in the proofs.   Detailed comments:  1- There is one sentence that I do not agree with (see line 52 and further). It says: "On the other hand, in the Bayesian setting, we assume that the mean is a random variable M (...), distributed according to a known prior denoted \Pi_0."  That is not correct. A Bayesian agent believes that the mean (vector) takes a single value. However, the Bayesian agent does not know this value, and therefore she expresses her belief about this value in terms of a probability distribution: a prior, and therefore, the mean is treated as a random variable distributed according to the prior \Pi_0. It could be fixed by replacing the sentence above with:  "On the other hand, in the Bayesian setting, an agent expresses her beliefs about the mean vector in terms of a prior \Pi_0, and therefore, the mean is treated as a random variable M (...) distributed according to the prior \Pi_0."  2- Furthermore, you might want to add in line 76: minimizing the reverse KL divergence is to some readers better known under the term "information projection", you might add "(information projection)" between brackets after "reverse KL divergence", or in the footnote.   3- Below I list the grammatical and spelling error Iâ€™ve spotted as well as some minor errors in typesetting formulas, just because it would be nice if everyone who will read this paper will not be distracted by the grammatical mistakes.  line 20: with theoretical -> with a theoretical line 54: regret over the prior -> regret under the prior line 82: bandit problem. -> bandit problems. line 84: time-step -> time-steps line 92: is the prior means -> is the vector of prior means line 94: co-variance -> covariance line 95: KL divergence between 2 Gaussian -> KL divergence between two Gaussian line 102: Z_t are both larger -> Z_t is in both cases larger line 137 (and elsewhere in the manuscript): the 2 statements -> the two statements  line 165: never pick the -> never picks the line 214: be such that \sum_{t}^{\infty} -> \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} line 271: in details in -> in detail in line 278: the constraints -> the constraint line 308: it seems there is a capital missing in this reference line 401: 1/r then it picks -> 1/r, it then picks line 422: m2^* -> m_2^* line 437: M_2 are independent -> M_2 be independent line 440: full stop after the sentence (i.e. (...) constructed in Eq. 10. line 442: full stop after the sentence line 453: always pick arm -> always picks arm line 460: all time t -> all times t line 467: goes to \infty -> go to \infty line 472: comma after the equation in 471, and: Then for any -> for any line 476: full stop after the sentence line 483: that make the -> that makes the line 498: Proof.

The Multivariate line 498: vector random variable -> random vector line 500: vector random variable -> random vector line 516: \sum_{t}^{\infty} -> \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} line 583: Q_t is sub-linear -> Q_t are sub-linear line 589: model is k-armed -> model is a k-armed line 603: sub-set -> subset line 606: of model M - > of models M line 612: between 2 Gaussian -> between two Gaussian line 612: distributions are -> distributions is line 617: co-variance -> covariance line 621: full stop (period) after the sentence. There are many full stops (period) missing after sentences ending with an equation. In particular, full stops are missing before the following lines: 55, 384, 389, 390, 392, 396, 404, 405, 441, 443, 446, 461, 462, 465, 466, 470, 475, 498, 506, 509, 510, 511, 550, 553, 556, 570, 571, 572, 574, 580, 581, 594, 613, and the end of 621.   -- Update (after author feedback) -- I have read all reviews and authors' reponse. I believe the paper arguably appears to be among very few works studying such a problem in TS, and the authors provide nice and interesting results, which would pave the way for further research in this direction.  The paper requires some polishing. Yet, I believe that this will not pose a significant workload, and can be accomplished within a single revision.  In view of all these, I maintain my score (7), yet increase my confidence to 4.
