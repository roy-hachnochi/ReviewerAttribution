This paper presents a novel deep network based partial-to-partial point cloud registration method named PRNet, which outperform the recently proposed DCP [2]. This paper is technically sound and the experimental results are convincing. The manuscript is well organized and well written.  3D deep learning is a hot topic in recent years, this paper goes beyond DCP and proposes a partial-to-partial registration network, which is interesting. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves good performance in registration, keypoint correspondence, and transfer learning.   Small issues: Can this method be used to real point cloud acquired with LIDARs mounted on mobile robots or self-driving cars?  The abstract says the proposed method outperforms PointNetLK, however, the experimental results didn't include the comparison with it.
