- The paper builds on ENCODE, formulating the connectome decomposition problem as a tensor product of \Phi and \D, where \D is a dictionary of dMRI signal predictors. Though this framework is taken from a previous publication, it would be nice to include at least a brief introduction and summary of this D -- how was it constructed, what do its elements represent, and what's the intuition behind it?  - What is this dimension N_{\theta}? It first appears in Section 2 with no definition.  - How was the regularizing parameter \lambda chosen in the empirical example? How sensitive is the algorithm to choice of this parameter?
