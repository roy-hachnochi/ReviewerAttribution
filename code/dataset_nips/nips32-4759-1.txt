The authors propose AdaPart, an adaptive partitioning scheme for a rejection sampling strategy for estimating the permanent.  The novelty over existing work is the introduction of a greedy method to build the partition trees on the fly (empirical verification shows that this approach is quite effective in practice) along with an application of a tighter upper bound (which reduces both the practical and theoretical cost of this type of sampling scheme).  The paper is well-written and careful to place its contributions with respect to existing work on permanent approximation.  My only criticism, really, is that the approach seems to be much more applicable than just a strategy for computing the permanent and it would have been nice to see some experiments on different types of partition function estimation tasks.
