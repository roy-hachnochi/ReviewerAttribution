The paper proposes a graph neural network based method to solve the retrosynthesis prediction problem, that is the identification of the reactions which lead to a particular target. In particular, the proposed graphical model exploit ideas from graph neural networks, in order to learn informative representation. Furthermore, expert knowledge from chemistry rules can be integrated in order to consider known restrictions and to provide interpretable solutions.   The paper well describes the background and task of interest. However, I find the notation and model derivations to be hard to follow. The results show very promising performances, but could be more comprehensive and I find the methodological contribution to be limited.   Detailed comments are provided below.   1) Overall, I found the model design choices to be not properly justified. I would suggest to clarify the arguments and formula derivations in section 4, in order to make the text smoother and easier to follow.   2) I would also recommend to properly introduce the notation and definitions before presenting the model.   3) Graph Neuralization. The design and model choices seem to be arbitrary. Could the author(s) discuss further on it?  4) Since the paper seems to be heavily focused on the application and the strong experimental results, I would suggest to explore additional options for the update operator of the graph neural network (additionally to structure2vec). This would validate the actual benefit of the learning component.   5) Using only one dataset is restrictive in order to assess the generalisability of the method. I would consider to validate the model on additional real and/or simulated datasets  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Thank you for your rebuttal and for answering my concerns. I found the new experiments and arguments provided to be convincing.
