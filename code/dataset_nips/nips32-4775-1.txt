This is a theoretical paper extending Structured Procrastination to make it anytime. The paper is easy to follow, but I'm unfamiliar with the related work that it builds on and therefore I'm ill equipped to judge the merits of the paper in the context of existing work (e.g., novelty of the proof techniques).
