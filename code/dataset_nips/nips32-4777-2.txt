Originality: The results of this paper unifies and generalizes previous works on this topic. Through drawing connections between online learning and differential privacy, this work makes it possible for scholars in either of these two communities to exploit readily available results in the other community for their research. The paper does a good job comparing and contrasting its results with previous works which highlight the significance of its contributions.  Quality: All the claims of the paper are well supported by sound theoretical analyses. This paper is indeed a complete piece of work and it opens up a lot of future research directions to build upon results of this work. I made a high-level check of the proofs in the supplementary file and they seemed to be technically sound.  Clarity: This paper is well-written overall. However, I think it's necessary to provide more explanation and intuition for the Obj-Pert and GBPA algorithms in the paper. Currently, it might be a bit hard for someone not familiar with the literature to fully understand the algorithms.  Significance: The main contribution of this paper is to draw connections between online learning and differential privacy. Researchers could build upon the results of this work and pursue further research directions in either of these topics. Additionally, the paper provides a unifying framework to analyze a number of different problems that were studied separately in the earlier works.
