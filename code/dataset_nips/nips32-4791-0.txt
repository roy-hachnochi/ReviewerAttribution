- The novelty of this work lies in the insight that perspective points could serve as a better geometric constraint for 3d object detection when used as an intermediate representation as opposed to 2d bounding boxes which were used in prior work. Although such a representation has been utilized in applications such as pose estimation, it is still interesting to see it being applied for 3d detection.   - Also, in this work, the projective points are inferred as a mixture of sparse templates instead of dense heatmap-based predictions for each point independently. It has been shown to be more effective with an ablation study. The perspective loss also was defined under the assumption that each 3d bounding box aligns with a local Manhattan frame. These choices made in system development has been presented well with clear writing, related work and supported with experiments.
