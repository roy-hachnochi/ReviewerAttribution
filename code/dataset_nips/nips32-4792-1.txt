This is a nice paper, potentially giving very important improvements for certain models.  Can the ideas also be implemented in a backwards-sampling implementation of the SMC algorithm, rather than ancestor sampling?  Is there any understanding of how the degeneracy of the sufficient statistics (as reported in various previous attempts to marginalize out static parameters) affects the algorithm? Is it that this is essentially mitigated by the ancestor sampling?  Having read the authors' response and the other reviews, I remain of the opinion that this is a nice contribution. There are always unanswered questions from good papers, especially when they are necessarily short, so it is not surprising that there are some here as well.
