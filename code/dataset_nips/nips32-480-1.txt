Originality: my feeling it that the proposed neural network has some novelty, but the authors did not position clearly the paper with respect to the related work. The proposed architecture includes many components (such as the Memory-oriented Spatial Fusion Module, The Memory-oriented Integration Module ) and it’s not clear if they are original or not. I’m not an expert in the field, but I see some similarity with [29]. The originality of each component, and of the overall architecture, should be discussed and compared with similar ones.   Quality: yes, I think the paper is technically sound, the method justified enough. The proposed method is supported by the results. I would expect the authors to highlight the limitations of their approach, which is not the case.  Clarity: the paper reads well, even if it’s very dense and sometimes hard to follow (due to the density). But on overall, I think all the elements given in the papers can be understood, and they cover the proposed neural network well.   Significance: the results are very good on the task of SOD for Light Field images, I have no doubts about it. But what about other areas? Does it also give good results on hyper spectral images? Competing papers have shown their approaches can be successfully used in several domains, in this paper only one domain is used, which limits the significance of the paper.
