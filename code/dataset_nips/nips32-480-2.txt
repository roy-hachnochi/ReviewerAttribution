Originality: Moderate. Previous methods have demonstrated the light field image can improve saliency detection. So the main novelty in this paper might be using a deep network to solve this problem. Using the ConvLSTM to fuse features from different focal lengths and different levels of VGG is interesting, but not a significant innovation.   Quality: High. The demonstration of the method is clear and related works seem to be complete. Also, there ae comprehensive experiments for ablation study and to compare with previous state-of-the-art. The experiments results are convincing and thorough.   Clarity: The paper is easy to read and well organized. Figure 2 demonstrates the network structure clearly and concisely. All necessary details and explanations have been included in the submission.   Significance: Given better performance compared with previous works, as well as indicated release of the dataset and code, his paper may be of interest to other researchers working on similar topics.  Minor issues: On line 185, is t-1 equal to 13?  The intuition of using H_t-1 in SCIM is not clear.
