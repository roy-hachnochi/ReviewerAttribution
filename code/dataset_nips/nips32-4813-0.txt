To summarize the basic idea: by assuming a low-rank representation of CPTs, it becomes possible to identify the leaves, and their parents.  One can then iteratively learn the structure from leaves to roots.  The low-rank representation of a CPT could be viewed as a mixture of a set of CPTs with a bounded number of parents.  The paper would be improved with some experiments that support the claims.  There are some preliminary results provided in the supplementary material, but the plots are noisy and don't really support well the claim that the algorithm recovers the true structure as the amount of data/queries increases.  On the plots: rather than vary C on the x-axis, it would be more straightforward to plot the amount of data/queries, which would be more direct and easier to interpret.
