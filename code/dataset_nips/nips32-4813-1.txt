 The paper studies the problem of learning Bayesian network structures from data under a particular setting as specified under Assumptions 1 and 3 and assuming all variables are binary. It presents an algorithm that correctly recovers the true structure under Assumption 4, and provides the sample and time complexity of the algorithm.  Overall the paper is clearly written. The results are nice under the setting studied in the paper. My main concern is with the motivation of the problem setting. Why is this problem setting (Assumptions 1 and 3) interesting or useful in practice?  What does a CPT being rank 2 or low rank mean in practice?  The paper claims that the proposed method can be easily extended for any rank k CPTs. Can you provide a discussion of how this can be done? I wonder whether Assumption 4 becomes less likely to hold when k becomes larger.  How strong is Assumption 4? Under what situations will Assumption 4 be violated? Perhaps an example situation where Assumption 4 is violated will be helpful.  The paper assumes all variables are binary. Are the results extendable to any discrete variables?  -line 35, the citation entry (D., 1996) should be fixed.  -line 195, “unifromly” -> uniformly  ---------------- Comments after author response: Thanks for providing a motivation to the problem setting. I still have concerns over Assumption 4. It looks to me Assumption 4 could easily be violated. I wonder its impact on the correctness of the algorithm.
