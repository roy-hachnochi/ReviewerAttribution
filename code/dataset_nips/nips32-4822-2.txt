Summary This paper proposes Generative Multisensory Network, a multisensory 3D representation learning algorithm. The authors first formalize the problem, writing it in the form of maximum log-likelihood estimation. A scene representation variable is then introduced, and the authors mention that modeling the representation variable prior by using the existing method Product-of-Experts is limited due to limited computational and storage resources. So the authors present Amortized Product-of-Experts to address this issue by using only one model, taking the modal-encoding along with its modality-id as inputs. The paper also talks about how to conduct inference on the proposed model by using some approximations.  Strengths -The formulation of the problem is novel and general. As illustrated in section 2.1, it unifies different modalities so that it can be applied to 3D scene or even more general cases. -Modeling 3D scene by a generative query network is novel. 3D scenes are definitely difficult to model, and it is an interesting way to model it by a generative query network, which takes in observation parameters and generates observations. -The paper is clear. The authors write most of the contents in formulas, which are concise and clear.   Weaknesses -The testing 3D scene is synthetic and simple. From my understanding, the scenes only contain a bunch of cubes of different colors. Testing on the simple and synthetic case is a good start, and it would be great if we can later test the model on real and/or complex scenes.  Comments after the rebuttal ************************************ Thank authors for the rebuttal.Â  After reading reviews and rebuttal, I decided to lower the score to 6, as I noticed something not satisfying of this paper. 1) I first thought modeling a 3D scene by a generative query network is pretty novel, but the idea is actually from GQN paper. This is not a deficiency, but I previously mistook this as a strength of the paper; 2) The comparison between PoE and APoE in the rebuttal is not satisfying. For small |M| like 2, APoE is (almost) not saving time or space. For larger |M|, we need a performance comparison with PoE. I strongly recommend adding PoE result.  That said, I still think this paper is marginally above the acceptance threshold since it has the potential to be a good paper as the authors address the concerns from the reviewers.
