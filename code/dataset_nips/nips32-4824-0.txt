The main problem with this article is that the mathematical formulation of the settings of the problem is not sufficiently precise to understand exactly what is done later in the paper. For example, the paper is not clear about what is called the "entire parameters of the systems". What is P^{active}, and P^{passive}?  What is X_j in formula (1)? There were $X_{t,A_t}$ with two indexes, is it the same thing? What is the difference between a "true parameter" and a parameter... etc.  The experimental part is unreadable: even with the maximum possible zoom, it remains very hard to read. Furthermore, several of the curves are plotted without true explanations on how they were produced precisely: e.g. how many runs. Why the curve on Figure 3 left, is like that? (jumps, no smoothness...)
