Originality: The specific algorithm and ergodicity results are novel (however, as pointed out by the authors, it is a special case of the sequential substitution framework proposed in [11, 12].    Quality/clarity: In my view, the manuscript is well written and the methodology is presented in a clear and sufficiently rigorous manner.   Post-rebuttal edit: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The authors' rebuttal provides further (empirical) support for the idea that the proposed MCMC kernel can work well even in higher dimensions. Furthermore, as already mentioned in my review, the presentation of the methodology in the paper is clear and there is substantial amount of theoretical support. The same cannot be said for most other NeurIPS submissions that I have seen this year. As a result, I am happy to raise my recommendation from 6 to 7.
