See above. This work seems to be original and well written, and offers an interesting theoretical and experimental exploration of a simple version of several methods often proposed for computation-constrained applications.  Edit: The authors have provided avenues for extending the results in the rebuttal. More importantly, they have provided evidence that the trends they observe hold for non-quadratic activations. I have thus incremented my score.
