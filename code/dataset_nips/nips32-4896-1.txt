Overall, this is a very strong submission.  It is well-written, timely, clear, and includes several significant and novel contributions.  The technical contributions are well-developed, and it does a very nice job addressing a challenging problem in meta-learning.  Although the novelty is high, it is related to several papers on online MAML and MAML with task-clustering that appeared in ICML 2019.  Although I know the timing is very tight between these, so it isn't reasonable to expect empirical comparison, those works should at least be cited and compared qualitatively in related work.  I would like to see more in the paper addressing the tension between the ability to fit the meta-parameters to each task clusters and the ability to generalize.  This has a nice interpretation in the Bayesian setting that could be called out further.  The clarity of Section 3 would be improved by adding a plate diagram or illustrative figure showing the relationship among the variables.  POST-RESPONSE Authors -- thanks for your clear and engaging response.  Please do add the plate diagram back in, at least as supplemental material, but preferably in the main paper.
