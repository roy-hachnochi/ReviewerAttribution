Having read the authors' feedback and other reviews, I am increasing my score from 5 to 6.  If the paper is accepted, I would ask the authors to dedicate more space to worked examples and to differentiate their work from the existing literature in more detail.  --------------------------------------------------------  In terms of novelty over previous works on equivariant CNNs, this paper is a mild step forward, bringing in sections of associated vector bundles for feature spaces and allowing for general representations there.  The clarity of this mathematical language is admittedly nice and I think it will help researchers think about general equivariant CNNs in the future.  However, Section 8 did not do a sufficient job of clarifying what the new theory does that previous papers could not, in terms of relevant examples.    The main theorem is a classification of equivariant linear maps between such feature spaces.  The organization of the paper is probably not optimal for NeurIPS, with the body of the paper Sections 2-6 reviewing general mathematical constructions. Some of this material could presumably be relegated to appendices, e.g. the proofs in Section 6, leaving more space for improved discussion.
