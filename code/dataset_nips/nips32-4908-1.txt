This paper studies a parametrization technique, which is called trivialization, for transforming a Riemannian manifold optimization problem to an equivalent problem in the Euclidean space. Algorithms used for Euclidean setting can then be used to solve this problem. Two useful trivializations are proposed: Riemannian trivialization and Lie trivialization.   My main concern is the practicality of the proposed approach. It is not clear how to use the proposed trivializations to some common and simple manifolds: sphere and Stiefel manifold. Moreover, the computational cost of the trivialization seems to be still high, given that matrix exponential needs to be computed/approximated. Furthermore, what is the benefit of converting the manifold optimization problem back to Euclidean space? This ruins the possibly nice structure of the manifold, which may leads to gains on dimensionality reduction etc.  ======== After reading the authors' rebuttal and other reviewers' reports, I am willing to increase my score, as some of my concerns are addressed appropriately.
