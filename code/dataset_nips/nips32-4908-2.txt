This work provides a new way of optimization on manifold through combination of parameterization and Riemannian gradient descent.  The paper is very well written and the organization is clear. The experimental section is convincing and the references are adequate.  The methods and proofs are technically sound. The paper also made sufficient connections and contrasts with the existing methods. The code is included in the submission for reproduciblity check.  Significance: The paper proposed a more general framework for optimization through parameterizations than the state-of-the-art method and showed improvement in several numerical experiments.
