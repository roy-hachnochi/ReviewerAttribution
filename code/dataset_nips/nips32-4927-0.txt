This line of work is very promising, but it seems like a small variation from existing work in the area. As an example, how does this paper compare to [Tian et al. 2019] that has a very similar approach and similarly examines 3d graphics?  As far as the method itself. One area of confusion is in the reward signal. Page 3 line 129 claims that the reward signal is 1 if the partial program satisfies the spec. Clearly that cannot be entirely correct, because it must give some reward to partial solutions. Indeed, Page 6 line 177 states that IoU is the measure used. It would be useful to be more clear exactly how this works.
