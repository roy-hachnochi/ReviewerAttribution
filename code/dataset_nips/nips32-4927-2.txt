The proposed idea of partial program evaluation based on a REPL seems to be based on a careful design of the evaluation mechanism and is specific to each of the two domains targeted.  Even for the domains considered in the paper, like the graphics domain I think different evaluation mechanisms may have different effects on the synthesis outcomes.  The proposed way of generation of a program starts from the bottom of the syntax tree and generates the terminals (individual shapes), which can be evaluated quite well, but if we follow the grammar and synthesize the program top-down from the non-terminals then the partial evaluation is not as easy.  I feel some discussion on the effect of different possible evaluation mechanisms and different designs of the sequential decision process can be helpful.  The RL loss in eq (3) is somewhat non-standard, I wonder if the authors have tried more standard value estimation losses rather than the cross-entropy loss.  The paper is well written and clear.
