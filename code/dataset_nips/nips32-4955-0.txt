Originality: To our knowledge, the idea of reformulation of the problem and the proposed benchmarks is new.  Quality: While a contribution is the speedup, there is no result about the time complexity.  Clarity: The paper is well-organized and easy to understand the problem setting, but the descriptions of the reformulation and the proposed algorithm are not so easy to read.  Significant: While the problem setting is for a limited setting, two-player and no chance move, the proposed algorithm and benchmarks are important. The results, however, seem to be suitable for the game theory community rather than the machine learning community.  In what follows, I have the detailed comments w.r.t the significant, the quality, and the clarity: -My main concern is that the machine learning community may not be interested in the work. The proposed benchmarks are interesting for the game theory community. The author should describe the reasons why finding an EFCE is interesting for the machine learning community, or proposes other benchmarks that is suitable for machine learning tasks.  -The main difference of the proposed algorithm from the previous work [Von Stengel and Forges, 2008] is the efficiency. Thus, the author should describe about the time complexity of the proposed algorithm.  -Is there any theorem about the convergence property or the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm?  -The authors should denote the setting of two-player and no chance move in the title.  -The readers may easily understand the proposed algorithm if pseudocodes are given.
