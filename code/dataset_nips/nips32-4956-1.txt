         The authors propose a model-agnostic approach for explaining GNNs prediction. The problem they are addressing is novel, and they use a simple but effective approach to address that. The paper is well written and most of the details are clear. Their approach is novel in finding important subgraphs for the prediction. They evaluate their method across mulitple synthetic and real world dataset.          A more detailed explaination on synthetic dataset and how they generate the labels would make the experiments more reproducable.          quantitative analysis on the real world datasets in addition to the synthetic datasets would be beneficial.
