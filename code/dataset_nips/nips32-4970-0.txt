The paper explores video compression learned end-to-end, which is relatively unexplored in the literature, and likely to be impactful for real world applications. The proposed method is an extension of the model proposed in [1] to the video setting. The author propose to add a global variable that captures the information about the sequence of frames in the video. Local (frame) and global (video) variables are trained by well-known techniques in amortized variational inference by recurring to parametric function approximators. The method is well executed and experiments show that the global variable helps in achieving, in the datasets presented, lower distortion for any given compression rate.  The paper is well written and clear and it is overall enjoyable read.  Pros:  + The paper deals with a relatively unexplored domain. + The set of baselines is rather complete and experiment show the superiority of the proposed approach.  Cons:  - The methodological novelty is limited as the model is a straightforward extension of [1]. - The datasets are rather simplistic and the model is evaluated on videos long only 10 frames (which is quite short). Standard codecs seem to work better than the proposed model when applied to longer videos. In general, the experiments don't give a good idea of the applicability of the proposed model to more realistic settings (longer or higher resolution videos).
