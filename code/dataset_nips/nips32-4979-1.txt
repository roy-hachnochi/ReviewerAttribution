Overall, the paper is very clearly written with a unusually high level of mathematical sophistication and quality (e.g. compared to the usual NeurIPS submissions).   I don't feel that the actual method is too novel, as Frank-Wolfe on measures have been considered previously. The strength and significance of the work is rather the particularly rigorous treatment, which puts such ideas on more firm theoretical grounds.   **after rebuttal** My concerns mentioned in the "Improvements" sections were clearly addressed by the rebuttal, and I still vote for accepting the paper.
