This paper studies a number of versions of the correlation clustering problem.  One is given a (not-necessarily complete) graph G(V,E+,E-) with positive and negative edges, and seeks a partition of the vertices that minimizes the \ell_q norm of the "disagreement vector" --- that is, of the vector having in position v (for v \in V) the number of positive neighbors of v that are not in v's cluster, plus the number of negative neighbors of v that are in v's cluster.  The usual correlation clustering problem minimizes the \ell_1 norm of the vector (that is, the total number of "mistakes" made by the partition). The \ell_q generalization of the correlation clustering problem was introduced by Puleo et al (2016). Currently, the best algorithms known (i) for complete graphs, general q, is a 7-approximation, (ii) for general graphs, q = \infty, is a O(\sqrt{n}) approximation.  This paper gives: - an approximation algorithm for the non-complete graph version of the \ell_q generalization of the Correlation clustering problem. The authors show a O(n^{1/2 - 1/(2q)} \polylog n) approximation for each constant q --- in particular, in the case of q = 2, the authors give a O~(n^{1/4}) approximation; - moreover, for the case of complete graphs, the authors give a 5-approximation for general q; and - a better approximation algorithm for another variant of the problem introduced in Ahmadi et al.  The algorithms are based on convex relaxations of the problems. The first algorithm then uses a metric space partitioning lemma to round the convex relaxation. The results are interesting to me.  Minor comment: - it would be useful if the authors commented on the polynomial time (non-integral) solvability of their convex programs.
