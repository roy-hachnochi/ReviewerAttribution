Overall this is solid theoretical work but the results are hardly too surprising. Given that the results for l_1 and l_\infty were previously known the results in this paper give a careful interpolation between the two regimes for l_q with q>=1. The paper is fairly well-written but will probably only be of interest to experts in the field. Given that no code or experiments are provided, I believe that this paper will be a much better fit for a standard TCS conference. Furthermore, I am not sure how well will presented algorithms perform on large datasets given that polynomials in the running times are quite substantial.   Editorial remarks: -- Definition 1: disjoint set -> disjoint sets -- Definition 2 is very difficult to parse. What is \delta, does the property have to hold for all \delta? What is D, should it be a part of the definition as “D-separating padded decomposition” similar to what is used below in the paper. -- Would be helpful to give more intuition upfront for why \max is required in the objective.   Minor remarks: -- Change “x approximation algorithm” to “x-approximation algorithm” everywhere and use hyphenation consistently throughout in other places as well (e.g. l_q-norm, polynomial-time algorithm, etc.)
