# originality Even though metric elicitation itself has been proposed by Hiranandani et al. (2019) in the context of binary classification, there is still a large gap between binary and multiclass classification. I claim that there still exists novelty in terms of multiclass analysis of metric elicitation such as restricted Bayes optimal classifiers.  # quality Although I could not check every detail of proofs, the proposed algorithms seem reasonable to me. On the other hand, I want to confirm one point. Why do you query four points in both algorithms 1 and 2 although those algorithms are based on binary search? I have read Appendix A and found that you mentioned this is because it would successfully escape from flat regions. However, I guess we can still construct pathological cases that do not work for algorithms querying four points. For example, assume that we query four times and find that m^a = m^c = m^d = m^e = m^b. Even so, there might be a peak in between, say, m^a and m^c. I guess that phenomena would be difficult to avoid no matter how many query times we increase, as long as the target metric parameterization is pseudo concave. Could you clarify this point?  # clarity - Definitions 1 and 2: I still did not get the intuition on why the norms are different. Is it due to the different parameterization of confusion matrices? - In "Parameterization of upper boundary" (l.149): I would prefer adding \nu: [0,1] \to \partial\mathcal{D}^+_{k_1,k_2}. The same to the parameterization in LPM (l.183). - l.242: It would be better to add "1-Lipschitz with respect to the confusion matrices." In addition, why does this hold with high probability, not with probability 1?  # significance Multiclass metric elicitation would have a practical impact because it gives one way to choose an appropriate performance metric, which is intuitively quite hard. The extension technique to the multiclass case may help further extensions of metric elicitation to more complicated tasks, such as multi-label and structured predictions.  ========== After feedback ========== Thank you for responding to my questions. On the first answer, claiming the unimodality has great importance. In addition, it is interesting to look at Figure 10. However, I still have a concern that we cannot detect the modal no matter how many queries we use, given the illustration in Figure 10. For example, take a look at Figure 4 (right) in Appendix. If we obtained this kind of oracle responses, we are still not aware that the modal is located in between m^a and m^c, or between m^c and m^d. Anyway, since I love the idea presented in the current paper, I hope this part can be made clearer in the future version. Here, I will not change the score.
