Overall, I think this is a good paper.   Originality: This paper combines the work of two previous algorithms. Yet such combination does not seem to be trivial. So I believe the work is somewhat novel.  Quality: The proof looks right. One comment is that the paper claims that convex CDF function would satisfy the condition of equation (3). CDF is bounded and therefore can not be a convex function on R if there is no further clarification. And some concrete examples of this claim would be nice.    Clarity: It is easy to follow and understand the motivation.  Significance: The paper gives a hybrid of the previous two algorithms LORD and SAFFRON and empirically shows that the new algorithm has inherited the advantages of both algorithms. In my opinion, it is interesting. However, I could be wrong since I am not an expert in this field of literature.
