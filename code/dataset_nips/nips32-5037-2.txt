The paper makes an interesting and timely contribution in investigating controlled dataset collection, and the impact of different axes of variation on object detection.  In general, the community agrees on the importance of these questions, but there is very little work done to provide answers.  As such, the originality and significance of the work is high.  Clarity of the paper is also good, and release of the dataset and code should help with reproducibility.  *** Post-rebuttal comments After reading the other reviews and the rebuttal, I am more convinced that this paper should be accepted.  The rebuttal addressed concerns in a thoughtful and concrete manner.
