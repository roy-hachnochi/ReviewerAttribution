This is an application paper that motivates well the design choices  (i.e. model and framework) within the realm  of cyber security applications. The paperâ€™s main contribution is a result that states how the problem being studied can be decomposed and restricting to a type of strategy profiles is enough. This result can impact on the design of tractable algorithms for this problem.      With this in mind, the relevance of the work within the AI community touches those interested specifically in cyber security, and more generally, to those interested in adversarial decision making. Unfortunately,  the authors make some design choices (e.g. two phases, one-stage strategies) that makes the results hard to transfer to more general adversarial  settings.  What worries me most is the lack of formal analysis of the two phase assumption (i.e. that the learning problem is divided into a learning and deployment  phases). Specially, the problem being tackled involves non-stationarity (i.e. the unknown parameter to the defender, theta, changes in time), rendering any deployment strategy (i.e. one that does not involve learning and therefore remains fixed) moot for such problem. A more careful analysis of this situation and a more thorough experimental section could go a long way in clarifying this point. However, I would still feel uneasy on this algorithmic approach for non-stationary environments.
