Originality. As far as I understood, the paper proposes an extension of [15] for the distributed setup. This requires careful analysis, but not so many new ideas. I think the comparison with https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8675539 should be added.  Quality. The numerical experiments seem to be convincing. I didn't check the proofs thoroughly, but the high-level intuition is not clear for me. As far as I see, the method uses the inverse of individual Hessians H_i,t, but not the inverse of the full Hessian H_t. I don't understand, why this works in the light of the fact that H_t^{-1} != \sum H_i,t^{-1}. Also, it is not clear for me why the considered three cases are mutually exclusive.   Clarity. Here I have the same questions as in the quality part. It would be nice to provide more explanations. At the same time, I very much appreciate that the authors give some intuition and illustration for their quite complicated assumptions and their connection to the standard assumptions.  Significance. I think the method can be useful in practice. Especially since it has smaller number of hyperparameters, wider range of applications including non-convex functions.   ===========After rebuttal============  I can't say that the authors addressed all my questions from the review. Especially the ones in the quality part. But, I found some answers in the GIANT paper. So, I leave my score unchanged.
