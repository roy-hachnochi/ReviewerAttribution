It is a very meaningful topic to use the real biological stimulus to help neural network training. This paper proposes an interesting idea on regularizing NN by preserving the feature distance measured by mice's brain. If it is the first paper on doing this, I really think it would be an interesting paper to appear on NeurIPS.   However, the paper does have many drawbacks. First, this paper does not have a related work section and does not provide enough survey on the prior work on this domain. It leads to another issue of the paper, not stating the contribution clearly. For example, does this paper is the first to use the mice brain's stimulus to regularize NN?  For the technique part, some design is not well motivated.  1. Why use grayscale images instead of RBG images? Is it because mice not recognize color? 2. Why need 'oracle images'? This part is very confusing. Why some images have quality predictor? How do you pick those 'oracle images'. Please explain.  3. The design of the similarity of convolutional features is also tricky. Why the linear coefficient (equation 10) to combine the similarities in each layer is trainable? What if I just take the average of the layer similarities as the convolutional feature similarity?  Minor comments:  Although it is an interesting method, it seems not very scalable since I have to show images to animals to get regularization data.  Also how the amount of the regularization data affects the regularization result.  What if I use more data, will the result be better?
