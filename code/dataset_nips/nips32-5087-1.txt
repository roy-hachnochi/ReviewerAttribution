The authors present a very interesting new extension to random partition type priors with an appealing inference scheme. I think it is a solid extension of existing work. Numerical results suggest that it can perform just as well or better than existing random partition models, though I'm curious about the comparison of runtimes against various methods. One other thing I noticed is that you choose the particle with the highest weight after the SMC procedure. It seems like prediction would be improved by using an average of the prediction from each particle with respect to the particle weight. Is there a more principled reason as to why you do not do this? I think a discussion of your method with in comparison BART type methods would be helpful, as many people are more familiar with BART than the Mondrian method, and could help the reader unfamiliar with this literature.   After reading the author rebuttals and the other reviews comments, I am inclined to vote "accept" for this paper. I think the idea is quite novel and well written. I think the addition of comparisons, even in the supplementary materials will help strengthen this paper. Also, please add standard errors for the results in Table 1.
