After reading the author feedback, my review stays the same and in particular, I still think this is a good submission. Thanks to the authors for the thorough response! I realized that there was an additional point of discussion I didn't mention in my original review that could be helpful to discuss: you benchmark against standard Euclidean embeddings, but what about hyperbolic embeddings? Hyperbolic embeddings could encode trees and I suspect that they can handle hierarchical clustering structure like what is analyzed in Theorem 4.6. This could possibly be an interesting direction of future research.  * * * * * Original review below * * * * *  I found the paper very clear and easy to follow. The key ideas for limiting the number of queries (symmetry in Q(i,j) and Q(j,i), triangle inequality, concentration inequalities) are quite straightforward, and at some level much of the paper reads off as doing diligent bookkeeping with the lower and upper bounds in updating the active sets as to keep the query cost low while maintaining accuracy.  My comments are minor:  1. Perhaps some discussion on whether the theory could be extended to recovering k-NN graphs would be helpful, along with what the technical hurdles are in doing so. It seems like we could use a best-k-arm strategy per node.  2. In Algorithm 1's "Require" line, there is a reference to Algorithm 2 that should probably say something like "SETri (Alg. 2)" or "SETri (Algorithm 2)" rather than just "SETri, 2". There's a similar issue in Algorithm 2's "Require" line in referencing Algorithm 1.
