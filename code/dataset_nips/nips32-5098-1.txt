This work introduce a differentiable renderer based on rasterization. Different from previous differentiable renderers, DIB-Renderer supports texture maps as well, which enables the existing 3D object reconstruction methods to predict the texture of the object. DIB-Render is based on rasterization. It interpolates the vertex's attributes for each foreground pixel. It also softly assign vertex to background pixel so that it can back-propagate mesh attributes. The renderer also supports three different lighting models: Phong, Lambertian and Spherical Harmonics.  The author also shows different applications for the renderer such as single image 3D reconstruction and estimating geometry, texture and lighting condition. Extensive experiments prove the purposed renderer is superior to the existing differentiable renderers and achieves plausible results on the applications they purposed.  The paper is well-written and structured clearly. The purposed renderer can be put into use for future 3D reconstruction tasks. The current 3D reconstruction put more emphasis on the geometry than textures partially due to the lack of a differentiable renderer that supports texture maps. This work could result in more realistic 3D reconstruction.
