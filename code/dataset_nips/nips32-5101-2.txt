I feel the treatment in this paper is somewhat contradictory to its setup. It is assumed that the density of X is uniformly lower bounded. This reduces the problem to standard linear/nonparametric regression and all these rates are somewhat known. The fact that A is unknown is, I feel, not a big deal because this A is "global" in the sense that all movies should suffer if A is large and vice versa.  What is really interesting, which I think the authors correctly set up, is when some movies have many more ratings compared to the other movies. In this case, we have an extreme form of heteroscedasticity (i.e., V(x_i) ~ sqrt{N} * V(x_j), for example) and things become interesting. The following form of estimation error might be expected (e.g., for Lipschitz smooth functions): err(x_i) ~= 1/root{n_i} + n^{-1/3}, where n_i is the number of times x_i is reviewed, and n is the total number of reviews in the movie data base. Such results would be more interesting. The bottomline is that pointwise error asymptotics needs to be understood, because there should be a difference on estiming ratings of well-seen and less-seen movies.
