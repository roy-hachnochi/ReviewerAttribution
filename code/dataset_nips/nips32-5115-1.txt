This work builds on the Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) algorithm and adapts it to make it more sample efficient and able to use expert demonstrations. To the best of my knowledge, the work is original.  The paper is well presented and polished. Notation is clear. The prose is easy to understand and I could see no obvious typos.   The article is clear and well organized. The supplementary material is quite thorough at presenting information that could be used to reproduce the experimental results.  I believe that this is an important work in the field of meta learning for reinforcement learning. Improving sample efficiency is key to make those algorithm useful in practice and this paper makes a clear contribution in that respect.
