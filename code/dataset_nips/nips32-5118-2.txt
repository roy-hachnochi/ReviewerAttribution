Originality: From my personal knowledge I think the method is new, though the author has pointed out they borrow the related idea from [Liu et al., 2018a] that accumulate distribution over state, but the approach is different (Liu's paper mainly focus on continuous setting and use function approximation to learn a weight function, while this paper is mainly focus on tabular setting and approximate using empirical statistics).  Quality: The theory part is sound with clear explanation and detailed discussion. For the experimental part, since no code is provided and I couldn't check the details, I will ask the author several questions for the comparison with other baseline, especially the SSD-IS method. The main concern is why MIS perform even better at time-invariant environment where SSD-IS should have more data to use when estimating the density ratio. To be more concrete here are two questions I would like to ask: 1. In Figure 2 and 3, why DM and SSD-IS method works well in ModelWin but perform very bad at ModelFail? For me it is surprised in time-invariant environment SSD-IS method perform worse than MIS method. Any explanation? 2. In Figure 3 (b) and (d), why the curve is not smooth even after 128 repetition?  Clarity: The paper is well written and easy to read.  Significance: I like the idea of the paper and OPE problem become more and more important in research area.  Overall: I think the paper is a good paper but I will remain below borderline until the author answer for my experimental problems.
