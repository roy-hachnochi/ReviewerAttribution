Comments: - The paper is incredibly well written and very concise (one of the clearest papers I have reviewed). -  In Table 2, do the results corresponding to  [11] and [12] involve pre-training? If not, it would make them the best architectures without pre-training. I wonder if pre-training would further improve their performance. - It would be nice to have a slightly more detailed explanation of the alignment-based features used in this work. - Does pre-training help if you use alignment-based features for the secondary structure and contact prediction problems? Right now, it is unclear which rows involve models with pre-training and which rows do not. - A further investigation of why pre-training reduces the performance for the contact prediction problem would be interesting.
