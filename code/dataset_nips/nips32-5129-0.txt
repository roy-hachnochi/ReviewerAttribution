This paper introduces a Bayesian formulation of Theory of Mind with a focus on conformity. The model is able to represent multi-level reasoning processes in multi round games. The experimental results confirmed that the model provides a better fit to data compared to previous works.   The manuscript is very well written and it was a pleasure read. The ideas are well described and motivated (except one section which is mentioned below) and the experiments are well conducted. I have two concerns about the paper. My first concern is about the extent of contributions. It seems to me that the only novel part of the paper is section 2.3 and the rest is very similar to reference [23] cited in the paper. Based on this, it would be important to make this point clear in the paper that the formulation is based on reference [23] and clarify the extend of the contribution in this respect. My other concern is about the implications of the work. The paper shows that the framework can better predict choices of subjects – which is interesting – but the psychological implications of this is not clear in the paper. One potential implication could be inferring the level of reasoning in these kinds of games, but in the last paragraph of the discussion the authors point out that it is not possible to determine the level of reasoning from fit to data. It then would be important to highlight the implications of the model beyond action prediction. Having said this, overall, I think this paper would be of interest to the Neurips audience and I support its acceptance.   Some other comments:  - In line 154-156 it is a bit unclear why the policy of *others* is assumed to be deterministic (unlike the policy of the agent). Under the non-deterministic policy, the expected next state will be (\lambda \alpha + (N -1)\pi_{k-1,t}(a1) + 1, \lambda \beta (N -1)\pi_{k-1,t}(a2), t+1), which is different from when the policy of others is assumed to be deterministic. It would be good to clarity this part. A similar question is with respect to the reward function defined in equation (5), i.e., instead of using either zero or N-1 for m, the expected number of a1 actions could be used in equation 5.  - I was not able to follow lines 162 to 173. It would be great to add further explanations to this part.   -In line 69, Bernoulli -> Binomial  - Lines 134-137: Please add information about the method used to supplementary materials.  - I might have missed this, but please define \pi^* (optimal policy) if it is not defined. ======================================== After author response: Thank you for your response to my comments. My understanding of the author response is that the framework in Ref 23 is indeed similar to the framework in this paper and has used a similar POMDP structure. Given this high similarity, I find it inappropriate to cite this closely related paper (Ref 23) only after page 7 and not to discuss its relations to the current work in terms of the mathematical framework. It should be made a lot clearer that the framework is built upon ref 23 (in sections 2.1, 2,2, intro). From the author response it does not seem that the paper will be revised accordingly in the final version, hence I've changed my score.
