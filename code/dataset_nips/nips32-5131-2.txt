Originality: One of the novel contribution of this paper is the proof of a lower bound of the sample complexity of the NTK, which requires to explore the following observation mathematically: NTK could not focus on the informative signal of the inputs.   Quality: I think this is a high quality paper, which contains a lot of contents. In my opinion, Theorem 2.1 alone together with some additional experiments would suffice to make an interesting paper.   Clarity: The paper is very well-written. Thought it is quite technical, the authors make some effort in explaining the intuition and ideas behind some of the technical proofs.   Significance: I think this is a good paper that helps us better understand the NTK and its limitation.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update: I will keep my score.
