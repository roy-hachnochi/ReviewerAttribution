Please, see comments in item 1. A couple of other comments are below.  The numerical implementation of the proposed method requires computing all the quantities stated in Proposition 3.2 (in my  opinion this is quite cumbersome). Moreover, one might converge in fewer  iterations but it is also necessary to compute more gradients and several other quantities. Thus, the number of iterations is not totally representative of the computational complexity.  The numerical experiments illustrate a trivial case, quite far from real problems encountered in machine learning or statistics.  Finally, this paper does not make due justice to several other recent papers on the topic, which are not even mentioned. For instance, I suggest the authors check recent papers from: Jordan, Attouch, Franca,  Vidal, Cabot, etc. (to cite just a few).  ==============  post authors response:  "We respectfully disagree with this comment, as we include the work by 9 the authors suggested by R#2, see [3], [22], [23], [28] and [29]." Obviously, I wasn't referring to these papers which are already cited.  An exhaustive literature review is not what I mean. I just wanted to point out that some consideration to existing literature may be appropriate.  Replacing the Hessian by the mentioned approximation, $\nabla f(x_{k+1}) - \nabla f(x_k)$, introduces another source of error in the discretization. I cannot judge whether this is meaningful in this case without seeing the proper derivation.  I agree that the idea of the paper is interesting, and deserves explorations. However, in my opinion the current results of the paper are insufficient.  Moreover, I don't see any benefits compared to much simpler, elegant,  and so far more efficient approaches.  Let me stress another point of concern. There are many methods in ODEs literature to implement discretization designed to preserve some given quantity, such as the energy of the systems for instance. One can simply use any discretization and project the solution. It turns out that such approaches are much inferior since they are considerably more unstable than simpler methods  which do not preserve the same quantity. Thus, I'm not so sure that just because  one can force the discretization to preserve the decaying of the Lyapunov function,  this automatically will lead to a more efficient method. This has to be justified  through stability analysis.
