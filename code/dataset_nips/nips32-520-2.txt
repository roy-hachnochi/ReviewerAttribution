Good Points: 1) Fairly organized. 2) Solid Experiment. 3) Ablations studies.  Question to the authors: 1) Authors argued that two different networks learn different cues for AU recognition in Fig 1, however did not provide any solid evidence of their intuition. i.e., feature visualization or examples which can be correctly classified by one but not by the other because of different cues learned and utilized. 2) Authors argued using orthogonal weights for the last layer makes the feature generator conditionally independent. Why?  3) What is the baseline for table 1 and 2. If it is a single network, I am not convinced it is a fair comparison. The baseline should have comparable number of parameters with the proposed method, may be two resnets trained separately. 4) More supervised methods could be added in the tables 1,2 along with JAA-Net, which will give readers a better idea on the effectiveness of semisupervised methods. 5) There are some typos, e.g., in line 261, donated --> denoted.
