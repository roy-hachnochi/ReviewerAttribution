The paper studies relaxed verifiers and argue that the LP-based verifiers can all be modeled using their convex-relaxation based framework. It then shows that convex-relaxed based classifiers (both based on primal relaxation and dual relaxation) cannot find tight bounds. This is shown empirically by comparing with PGD-based heuristic and MIP-based exact method.  The paper is well written and seems to cite related work properly. In terms of methods, it does not seem to propose anything significant however it does a nice job in relating many of the known verifiers which is important as it then illustrates that the bounds they produce are loose.
