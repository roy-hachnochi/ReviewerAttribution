This paper addresses a timely topic very well and gives us a better understanding on the quality of layer-wise convex relaxations. It is well-written, convincing, and covers the topics discussed in a lot of detail. The discussions included in the paper are interesting and provide a lot of context, which makes the paper readable to someone with a passing interest in the topic.   [ Update after author feedback ] In my opinion the authors have sufficiently responded to the concerns of the reviewers.
