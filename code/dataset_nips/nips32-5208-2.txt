This paper proposes Neural Jump Stochastic Differential Equations, a general framework for modeling temporal event sequences. We demonstrate the state of the art performance on prediction tasks.   The paper is well written and model is interesting. My concern lies in the experiment section. The model does not show performance improvement on MIMIC dataset, and on stackoverflow the improvement is incremental, and it is questionable if it is statistical significant. Another evaluation metric is event time prediction, see the experiments in [20]. This evaluation metric will also demonstrate the predictive power of the proposed model.   a relevant paper that should be cited: [1] A Stochastic Differential Equation Framework for Guiding Online User Activities in Closed Loop, Wang et al, AISTATS 2018  The derivations in section 3.1 should mention [1], where same equations have been derived.   ---------------------------- thanks the authors for your response, and it addressed my concerns. I changed the score accordingly.
