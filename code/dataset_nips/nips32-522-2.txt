The paper presents a mathematical framework that estimates uncertainty of dense correspondences from noisy labels. The underlying framework models the distribution of residuals obtained by comparing a target vector encoding the correspondences and other properties and its prediction. The underlying model considers three sources of noise: a general noise affecting all dimensions of residuals, noise affecting the dimensions encoding the association of pixels to a human body part, and directional noise modeling directional errors. All three sources of noise are modeled with Gaussian distributions. I think the framework is solid given the assumption of Gaussian distribution. However, I have a major and a few minor concerns.   1. My major concern is that the submission is missing other baselines on human dense correspondences in the experiments. The only baseline is based on [13]. However, there exist other recent methods (e.g., Dense Human Body Correspondences Using Convolutional Networks by Wei et al.). The experiments indeed show improvements over [13] but it is unclear if the paper is advancing the state of the art by including the uncertainty model. In sum, I think the paper should include other CNNs for dense correspondences and include the proposed framework to it and show if the benefit is consistent across other models.  2. A minor concern has to do with the lack of justification of using Gaussian distributions to model the uncertainties. Although I understand that a Gaussian distribution typically  simplifies the math, I don't understand why a Gaussian distribution is a good model for the residuals dealt with this problem.   3. A third minor concerns are a few typos and grammatical errors.   a) In line 67: "The recent method of [17] proposes a frequentist *methods* ..."  -> "The recent method of [17] proposes a frequentist *method* ..."  b) In line 85: "In order do [...]" -> "In order to [...]"  c) In line 88: I think you mean E_q[\delta] = 0 (i.e., the expected residual is zero); or am I missing something?  d) In line 99: When defining \sigma_2, what is u? It was never defined.  e) In line 105: "In oder to [...]" -> "In order to [...]"  f) In line 126: I think Eq. 7 is just floating around w/o any introduction first. I would suggest gently introducing the Equation in line 126.   g) Eq. (9) is missing a period.  h) In parts of the text, the Equations are note properly references (e.g., line 216 and line 218). Please clearly refer to them as Eq. (X) in the text.  Post Rebuttal:  The rebuttal addressed my major concern which was the lack of comparisons with other baselines. The new results clearly show a marginal advantage, and they should be included in the final paper. However, I would encourage the authors to discuss why a Gaussian distribution is good for modeling the errors. Just stating that it is good because it is unimodal is not a good argument. There are many other unimodal distributions (e.g., Laplacian distribution), and I think it would be nice if the paper shows a histogram of the errors and the fit of a Gaussian to them.
