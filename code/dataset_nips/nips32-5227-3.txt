* The addressed problem is of theoretical and practical interest in transfer learning. Starting from the definition of transfer exponents, a notion introduced in [1], the paper proposes several theoretical results on bounding the excess risk over the target domain under different settings (sampling cost minimization, source data re-weighting, choosing from multiple sources). These results are established for any classifier from a class of functions with some VC dimension. My feeling is that the assumptions and the obtained results are meaningful and reasonable, at least from conceptual point of view of transfer learning benefits.   * All results heavily rely on the relaxation of covariate shift assumption. Do  the established results still hold if the covariate assumption is strictly enforced that is P_Y|X = Q_Y|X. If not, how the rates change?  * The related work to this submission is the paper of Kpotufe and Martinet [1]. How the obtained results contrast with the ones presented in [1]? Discussion and analysis on this point may be of interest to the reader.    * Usually, sampling labels for target data may be much costly than for source data. From Thm 4, what are the transition regimes for $n_p$ and $n_Q$ w.r.t. sampling costs $c_P$ and $c_Q$? Under which condition sampling few target labels is sufficient to attain the desired excess risk.  * All learning procedures proposed in the paper rely on probabilities $P_D(h \neg h')$. How these probabilities are evaluated in practice without explicit knowledge of source and target distributions? To turn these procedures into practical algorithms, an instantiation on a family of classifiers (linear model, k-NN or others) may be interesting and helpful.    Minor comments ------------------- * Lines 141-145: the text is hard to read. * Line 249 (learning procedure): parameter $\tilde C$ is defined at line 0 and is not applied afterwards. Lines 2 and 4: parameter $C$ is undefined. Line 7: can the paper provides an intuition about the upper bound $\epsilon/4$ used to select hypothesis $\hat h_{S_P}$?
