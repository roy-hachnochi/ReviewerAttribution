This paper presents a meta-learning method for learning heterogeneous point process models for short sequence data with a relational network. A hierarchical Bayesian mixture Hawkes process model is proposed to incorporate relational information. The method has been tested on both synthetic and real data. The Bayesian model captures the underlying mixed-community patterns of the relational network. Meanwhile, the model enables knowledge sharing among sequences and facilitates adaptive learning of individual sequences using the model agnostic meta learning technique. A stochastic variational meta-EM algorithm is also derived. My major concern is the performance of the proposed method. In the experiment, the performance of HARMLESS (MAML) is lower than 2 baselines for StackOverflow data. Also, the performance of the 2 HARMLESS methods (FOMAML and Reptile) is much lower than HARMLESS (MAML) for LinkedIn data. The performance of proposed method could be further improved. Moreover, it will be useful to discuss the computation complexity of the proposed method.
