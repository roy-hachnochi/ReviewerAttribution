The paper is clear, well motivated, well written and overall very pleasant to read.  The proposed method is new and interesting and will probably remain as a baseline for future work in the topic of deep learning on set functions.  Some remarks:  - l95 are defined cut and association score but they are not used in the following of the paper. - What is the norm on s:2^N -> R (used e.g. l 99-100)? - l194: the sentence "hypergraphs are represented by their weight set function (with unit weights)" is unclear - l232: two different models are proposed and benchmarked, a discussion about their difference would be very welcomed - l232: it would nice to have the number of parameters for the different proposed models - l302: "(i.e. Fourier sparse)" instead of "(= Fourier sparse)". - In the case of set functions, the complexity of the related algorithm may become an issue, how does the proposed algorithm compared time wise with the other benchmark methods? An in-depth discussion about applicability of the algorithm would be welcomed.  * Bibliography: many references are incomplete, e.g. [4] is COLT 2012, [12] is ICLR 2018, etc.
