         With my limited familiarity with the area, I found the paper to be easy and enjoyable to read and follow. The authors did a good job of outlining the motivation, existing work, and limitations. The work seems like a strong combination of an interesting theoretical finding, which requires a neat extension of the union bound as explained in Section 3, and an assessment of its empirical impact. The problem addressed -- namely, quantifying the effect of test set overuse -- is very timely, and the result that model similarity provably increases the number of times one can re-use a test set is quite interesting.          Given the complex expressions in Theorem 2 and Corollary 4, it would be helpful to either also provide a simplified form (under further assumptions) or analyze the results for some interesting special cases for which the expressions become simpler and dependencies on parameters more apparent.          For the adaptive classification case (Section 4), the analysis using (n+1)^{k-1} as the maximum number of queries seems quite conservative. Could you comment on its tightness / usefulness in practice?          For corollary 4, it seems the way the parameters (alpha, eps, etc.) are stated may not be the most natural or useful. It is not clear when the corollary provides a useful result. E.g., as stated, eps is a function of alpha, eta is a function of eps and alpha, and N_eta is required to be bounded by a function of alpha. This makes it difficult to assess simple things like whether alpha has a positive or negative effect on the result. Would it help to re-state the result in terms of (only) the largest alpha that satisfies the bound on N_eta?          The Naive Bayes assumption that comes towards the end of page 6 is left mysterious till that point in the paper. I would suggest alluding to it (or at least its textual interpretation near line 237) early on in the paper.
