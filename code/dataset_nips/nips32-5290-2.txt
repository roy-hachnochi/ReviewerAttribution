The work addresses the issue of how grid-patterned spatial activity in medial entorhinal cortex might arise as a function of learning using hippocampal place cell inputs in simulated random-walk experiments.  This is not the first work to do so, but does take such efforts significantly forward in comparing and contrasting multiple approaches and providing a key means by which such networks can be generated to produce hexagonal versus square grid patterns.  The work is presented quite clearly and in detail.    In terms of significance, it would seem that the entire field of researchers working on this problem fail to consider that grid-patterning in medial entorhinal cortex is not "learned" during random explorations of the environment, but develops in the absence of any significant such behavior.  Furthermore, even if such patterning were "learned", it would almost certainly involved many more sources of information (e.g., head direction cell input and egocentric border cell input).  While my comments call into question the value of the work in this field to neuroscience, it seems that the authors have done an admirable job of addressing the questions as they stand and the work may prove useful to non-neuroscientific applications.
