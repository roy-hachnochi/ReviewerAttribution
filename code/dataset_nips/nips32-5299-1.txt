In my opinion the paper has minimal novelty in terms of techniques used and much of it is "obvious" to the homomorphic encryption community. The main contribution is using the TFHE scheme to get around the challenges of other arithmetic circuit based schemes. While this approach indeed works as the authors hope it to work, it comes with a massive cost in terms of message expansion. It seems unrealistic to use hundreds of megabytes, or even gigabytes, to store a single sample to classify. Due to the large size, this technique seems useless in an online setting.  Overall I like the presentation of the paper. The performance analysis is quite detailed and compares to multiple prior works. I would think that these tables and benchmarks will be used in the future as reference points. However, I would like to point out that the comparisons are not exactly fair. Different papers and implementations use different security level, and some optimize for throughput rather than latency. It could be good to make this very clear in the paper.
