strengths:     -introduces fast new implementation for homomorphic encrypted neural networks     -first paper to implement LSTMs with homomorphic encryption     -good comparison with previous works. weaknesses:     -no consideration for approximate number schemes in related work.     -no support for float numbers.     -At many points in the paper, it is not clear if unecrypted model is a model with PAA or a model with ReLU activation.     -what is TCN? the abbreviation is explained way too late into the paper     -Tables in chapter 5 are overloaded and abbreviations used are not explained properly.     -Figure 3a does not highlight that the shift operation is cheap.     - Although the authors claim they implement ImageNet for the first time, it is very slow and accuracy is very low; "SHE needs 1 day and 2.5 days to test an ImageNet picture by AlexNet and ResNet-18, respectively" and accuracy is around 70%
