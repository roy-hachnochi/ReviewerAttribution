Originality: * The approach seems novel. * Related work seems adequately cited.  Quality: * The method seems technically sound though the architecture details should be presented in the main paper. Some issues:   - l. 223, it is not clear if the RNN cells have memory/hidden states and this affects the ability to alter the prediction by changing the keypoints. Please add an explanation why it can work.   - Eq 1, rhs should be negated for a loss.   - l. 191, the larger diversity of quality of the samples is a shortcoming of the proposed method. Apparent from Fig. 3 left is that the proposed method can perform significantly worse for some samples than other sota methods. A plot also showing mean/std dev for the variants might be insightful, please add. How to choose good samples at test time? Please discuss. * Sec 5.2, a more finegrained evaluation would be interesting here, if the learned keypoints can capture all objects in the scene, or if it chooses to represent only a few and which. Does the prediction error contain outliers for some objects? * Please define or revise the term "object structure" in the title. The title is too generic, please mention keypoints in the title.  Clarity: * The paper is very well written and easy to follow. Technical details about network architecture should be included in the main paper.  Significance: * Latent dynamics representations of video are highly relevant for video prediction and planning. The proposed approach is interesting, since it suggests a way to add structure or inductive bias by predefining that the learning algorithm needs to use a number of localized keypoints for describing the video content.
