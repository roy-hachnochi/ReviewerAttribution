Specifically, by setting the architecture as an adversarial network the idea is that the predictor (in this case the discriminator) is trained to not only see good explanations, it is also exposed to counterfactual examples and can better tell the difference. This is a valuable and original use of adversarial models in the area of transparency.  This submission is a game theoretic submission but the game itself is a very simple one so I would suggest that this paper be classified more under transparency as that is where it has the biggest contribution to current literature.  Additionally while the 3-player game was very well modeled and explained at the end the implementation was reduced to a 2-player game with a generator and a discriminator. It would have helped if the authors had made this explicit and simplified their formulation. That said I would say this is a great contribution to the transparency literature and I enjoyed reading this submission.
