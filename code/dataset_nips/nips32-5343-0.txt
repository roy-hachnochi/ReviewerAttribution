I have a few major questions about the paper that  should be addressed in a published version of this paper. * Does the sensing model interact with the new choice of norm? * Compare to the literature on matrix sensing as formulated in [1]. Why do recovery results for matrix sensing not apply to this problem setting? The sensing matrices A would have only one nonzero column each... * Why do you call this model "decentralized"? Recovery still requires localizing all the measurements to a single master node (to solve the SDP). And it is easy to implement more general matrix sensing so it is equally decentralized: just add up the measurements from each column to form the measurement of the full matrix. (Perhaps the matrix sensing approach to decentralized sketching requires more measurements?) * Does the mixed norm have an interpretation as a spectral function, or is it not equivalent to any function of the spectrum of the matrix? * The experiments should be improved. In particular, the authors should also compare with max norm and other more exotic norms such as [2] (or explain why they are inferior). How were the parameters chosen, such as the radius R? * Please say more about what elements of your proof are standard, and which elements are new to adapt to either the sensing structure or the mixed norm.  and a few detailed comments: * line 135: consider citing [3], which explores tensors norms of this form in detail in the context of matrix estimation problems. * line 139: I found the notation for injective vs projective norms distracting.
