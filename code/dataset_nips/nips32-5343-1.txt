The critical part of the algorithm/analysis seems to the notation of the mixed norm defined in Eq. (4) and so the traditional recovery approach can be adapted to a carefully defined set of data matrices depending on the max ell_2 column norm and the mixed norm. The algorithm is just to solve a least square minimization over that set of data matrices. Is it true that the measurement matrices need not be of Gaussian entries and can be any symmetric subgaussian entries? A key entropy estimate is Lemma 2, which lacks a proof, not even in the supplementary.  The paper seems to be written in a rush and is clearly not proofread. It is infested with writing problems, particularly seriously concerning the definition, and thus impedes understanding. The following is not an exhaustive list: Line 48: say ‘Assume’ instead of ‘It follows’ Equation (2): what is the inner product? Equation (3): the subscript field of ‘max’ on the right-hand side should be j = 1,\dots,d_2 Equation (4): What are the dimensions of U and V? Arbitrary matching dimensions? Line 131: maybe just say X is a map from (R^{d_2}, ell_p) to (R^{d_1}, ell_q), which is a cleaner expression. Equation (9): What is the use of u? Is it ||Xu||_q? Is the dimension of u correct? Line 143: what is the *-norm? Trace norm? Line 144: What is the infinity-norm? Maximum absolute column sum?
