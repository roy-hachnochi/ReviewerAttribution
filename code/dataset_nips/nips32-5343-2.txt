The paper is very clearly written. I particularly appreciated the simplicity of the exposition both in the main paper and the appendix.  The quality of the presentation is high. The authors clearly outline their techniques at multiple levels, and also discuss possible obstacles along the way and how they resolved them.  The techniques seem original. The main component seems to be the use of the new mixed norm as a regularizer in low-rank matrix recovery. This is not altogether surprising, since earlier papers by Lee, Srebro, and co-authors also proposed similar norms in the same context. However, such an approach to the compressive PCA setting is to my knowledge not very common, and gives improved (for-all) guarantees in contrast with earlier work by Negahban and Wainwright.  Compressive PCA is a somewhat more challenging problem than regular low-rank matrix recovery from affine measurements, because of the tensor-product structure of the linear observation model. To my knowledge, most existing theoretical results for low-rank matrix recovery do not quite cover this setting. The results of this paper fill this gap.  ===  Update (after reading rebuttal/reviews): thanks for the response. Consider adding real-data experiments, as well as incorporating other suggestions by the reviewers.
