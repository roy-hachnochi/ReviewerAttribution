This paper introduces an algorithm to obtain a low-rank reconstruction of a nxn matrix under the L_1 loss, with provable guarantees under mild assumptions on the distribution of the noise.  My main question for the authors relates to their parallel submission #3303, which was flagged as a potential dual submission (allowing reviewers to ask questions as if the other work were already published). My reading of both papers does *not* suggest that these works are too closely related to be both accepted. However, I would appreciate the authors providing a comparison of the results of both contributions.  - Assuming the necessary conditions for both papers are met, Thm. 1.2 of #3303 for the L1 loss states that we can in O(n^2 + n poly(d log n)) time find a subset S of size O(k log n) s.t. ||A_S X - A||_1 <= O(k log k) ||Delta||_1 w.p. 0.99. (My apologies for the inline math). Am I understanding correctly that the contribution of this paper allows a tradeoff in the computational time to obtain a better approximation by way of the epsilon parameter? - More generally, how do the bounds you derive in this paper compare to the ones that would be obtained when using the L1 loss in #3303 (with all necessary assumptions)? Are there specific scenarios where the bounds from either paper should be preferred? - You mention in Section 3 that taking the median performs better in practice than taking the average. It might be worth showing this empirically. I would also be curious to know how the compared algorithms performed on average and the order of magnitude of the standard deviation for all reconstruction methods, as the authors only provide a comparison between the best results of each reconstruction algorithm.  Minor comments:  - I believe the left hand side of Eq. (3) of the appendix should read \int_0^n rather than ^\infty.   ******** Post rebuttal comments ********  I am satisfied with the author's response regarding the use of mean vs. average. However, if the paper is accepted, I ask the reviewers to include their experimental results for the average, as it is the method suggested by their theoretical analysis.
