This work includes original ideas and empirical findings. The formulation of weight sharing and using Lasso to find sparse solutions is quite neat and the implementation trick to include weak learners into the existing model is also clear and clean. The study of the effect on the initial model has been ignored in the NAS field and this work brings the importance of it back to the table which we all should pay attention to.  The quality of the work is quite good. Related work are carefully reviewed and understood. Many choices in the proposed method are justified either by previous works or the ablation studies in the appendix. The experiments are extensive and informative with round results.  The paper is written clearly and I believe this will be an significant work in the NAS field.  One minor question for me is the stopping criterion for the experiments: are the experiments run up to 5 days and then report the best? Is it possible to develop some early stopping for NAS?
