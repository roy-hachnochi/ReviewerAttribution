This work studies optimal pricing is repeated posted-price auctions. They consider the scenario in which a single seller interacts with a single buyer whose patience is different than that of the seller. The main contribution of this work is designing optimal pricing algorithms to maximize the revenue of the seller. They consider two different cases which are selling to a buyer who is more patient than the seller and selling to a buyer who is less patient. They show that the former case is simpler and they provide an algorithm called the "big deal" algorithm for that. To get this result, they first show how in the case of equal discounts (patience) Myerson's well-known result can be used to obtain the optimal revenue. Then, they use it to solve the case of a less patient seller. Further, for the case of a less patient buyer, they give a more complicated algorithm and to obtain that, they use a reduction to the optimization of a multivariant function.  Strengths: --- 1- An interesting problem that is not studied before 2- A well-written paper 3- Paper has a good technical contribution and authors verify some of their claims using practical evidence.   Weaknesses: --- My main problem is with the assumption that the seller has an accurate estimate of the buyer's discount and with the fact that it is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. This specifically concerns me because the "Big deal" pricing algorithm seems to highly rely on this assumption. As I understand if the seller underestimates buyer's patience and uses this algorithm, it might lead to a zero revenue for him.
