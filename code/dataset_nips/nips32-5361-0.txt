Quality Proofs of the theorems seem correct, to the best I can judge. In the experimental part, the results are given in average but no information is given about the variation of these results  Clarity The paper is well organized and clearly written. The goal of the paper as well as the results are clearly presented.  Significance The paper makes a significant contribution to the study of the identifiability of PL models, even if the identifiability cases are rather limited and therefore difficult to use in practice. Moreover no experience on real data is proposed.
