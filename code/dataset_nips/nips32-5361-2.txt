Originality, quality, and significance: Models that are able to address multiple types of ranking data simultaneously are important, and in that regard, I consider the first steps taken by this paper to be original. Some of the identifiability results presented here generalize known results for special cases, and the authors are honest in their comparisons with related work. This line of investigation is interesting, and likely to be built upon.  Clarity: The writing is clear, and the proofs are correct as far as I can make out.  Overall, I think that the paper makes a nice contribution to our understanding of applying PL models to multiple types of partial orders. The theoretical results are interesting, and serve as a nice first step to understanding these models. I vote to accept the paper.
