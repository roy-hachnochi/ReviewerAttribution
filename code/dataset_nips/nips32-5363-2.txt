This paper studies the performance of certainty equivalence principle, i.e., fitting a model from given data and designing a controller using the fitted model, in Linear Quadratic systems.   Originality: The results rely critically on the extension of an existing result in perturbation theory of discrete Riccati equations. The bounds reflect explicit dependence on system level parameters, unlike previous literature.   Quality and Clarity: I have checked some of the proofs and they seem correct to me. The paper is easy to follow, and the statement of the main results make it clear to follow the next steps.  Significance: I feel that the contributions are reasonably significant to be published at NeurIPS. The main reason is that it connects seamlessly to past work on system identification.
