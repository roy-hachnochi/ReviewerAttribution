The authors describe a method of denoising of optical membrane voltage recordings using the rSLDS as a proxy for membrane currents in the standard membrane conductance model. They leverage inference techniques pioneered in the rSLDS literature and demonstrate that their method is both reasonable to the “eyeball test” but also quantitatively out-performs the state of the art.  The paper is exceptionally well written, easy to follow, technically sound, and the experiments were well designed to progressively illustrate the performance of the method. The model is novel and makes good use of both statistical and biophysical models. Clearly, it would have been preferable to demonstrate their method on real data as well, but this should not be disqualifying.  I should note that the reproducibility checklist answers indicated that the authors have downloadable code but I was not able to identify where that code was.
