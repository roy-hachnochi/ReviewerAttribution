MINOR COMMENTS:  Page 3, line 85. "low communication without sparsity assumptions". Please add references on such results. Page 3, line 99. "much faster than computing the gradient of the conjugate[..]". I agree with this, but it also shows that the comparison is not quite fair, since e.g. MSDA was not designed for finite sums on each node. Page 5, line 165. "generalized version of the APCG algorithm". I believe it is worth at this point to be more precise on what generalizations have been included in this algorithm, and why they matter.
