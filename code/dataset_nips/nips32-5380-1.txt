The paper proposes to use elliptical distributions for adding perturbations to achieve differential privacy (DP)  in infinite dimensional and multivariate settings.       This is a significant and original contribution; an understanding of how to achieve DP in these settings has been lacking.        The paper is has important theoretical contributions, but is entirely theoretical.  There is no motivation of a real use case provided.  In what practical statistical or machine learning problems does the need for this arise?        While the paper is fairly readable, it is really directed to a reader well-versed in measure theory.   Many parts of the paper could improve with explanations or intuitive descriptions approachable by a more general reader.  Understanding why current methods do not achieve DP is important, and the authors do address this.  However  this is not presented in an easily understandable manner.       More clarity is needed in the section on the impossibility result.   The jump from Theoreom 4 to Theorem 5 is not clear -one is an impossibility result, the other gives a result on achieving DP.       Further, the paper abruptly ends in the middle of a section.
