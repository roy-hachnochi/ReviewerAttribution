I find the results of this paper interesting both in the theoretical bounds they allow to achieve and in the practical applicability of the proposed mechanism to multiple classical statistical problems. Even if the main result (Theorem 3.2) is rather simple, it has important consequences both theoretically and experimentally, as shown in the rest of the paper. I find also interesting to see that the considered class of functions allow one to go beyond what the general exponential mechanism can achieve. Finally, it is interesting to see the relations between this method and objetive perturbation. One aspect that I find questionable in this work is the claim that it is introducing a new mechanism. The proposed mechanism can be seen as a particular instance of the exponential mechanism with a weight function based on the gradient of the objective function, rather than a new mechanism per se.   Pros: -the paper identifies an interesting class of weighting functions for the exponential mechanism. -the proposed method can be applied to a quite large class of examples.  Cons: -calling the proposed mechanism a "new" mechanism is questionable.  Comments after rebuttal ---------------------------- Thanks for your answer. Concerning the "new" mechanism, I don't want to open up a controversy since this is really a minor point but some of the paper you mention, e.g. the K-norm paper, acknowledge that their mechanism are an instance of the exponential mechanism when they introduce them. I am not claiming that you should not give it a new name. I don't think that your contribution would be weaker by acknowledging this.  More importantly, I encourage you to include the more technical discussion on the comparison with the exponential mechanism and the lower bound by Awan et al. in the paper.
