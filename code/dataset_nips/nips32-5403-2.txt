Clarity: The writing in the paper is clear.  The presentation of Anderson acceleration and the proposed bound on the iterates is also clear.  Originality: The contributions in this paper appear novel and past work is appropriately cited.  Significance & Quality: The performance benefits of this method are not sufficiently clear from the chosen experiments.   As presented in this paper, the key idea in Anderson acceleration is to use the iterates in a contraction to move faster towards the fixed point. The performance benefit over the baselines in Figure 1 appear small.  These benefits could be  conflated with other factors such as the choice of step-size, and the optimizer used. The experiments do not disentangle these conflating factors.  In particular, common deep-learning  optimizers (ADAM, RMSProp) contain momentum terms that could (weakly) mimic some of the benefits of Anderson acceleration in combining information across iterates for faster convergence.  There should be experiments that examine this.
