The rebuttal addressed my concerns on the baselines for the text classification task.  ------  The idea of TFiLM is novel, and the formulation of the module makes a lot of sense. I would give a higher score if the rebuttal can address the following concern on experiments.  In the experiments, there is a lack of proper baselines. I am not an expert in audio super-resolution or genome sequencing. That said, at a glance, the audio super resolution only includes self-contained results produced by the authors. It is therefore hard to evaluate the relative significance with respect to that literature.  The baselines for text classification seem quite weak, especially for convolutional networks. Also, for text classification it has been shown that beating a bag-of-words model is quite difficult, and the paper did not include benchmarks on them.
