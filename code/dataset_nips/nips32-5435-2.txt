This work primarily introduces the methods of adaptive subspaces to the standard continuous control benchmarks through a BBO scheme. This introduction is particularly useful as these search methods have been proven competent in this setting; more efficient methods can open up new doors in related fields such as meta-learning, etc. The authors are through in their introduction of the method as well as their theoretical discussions and clearly discuss the active subspace methods, accurately relating it to previous work.
