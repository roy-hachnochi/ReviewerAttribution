Post-rebuttal: After reading the authors' response and further consideration, I am downgrading my score to 7 from 9. While I am still very excited about the new perspective this work brings, I now realize that there is still a lot of work remaining in order to tie the theoretical results to real-world phenomena. Regardless of whether the paper gets accepted, I'd ask the authors to make the gap clearer and to lay out more clearly an agenda for future work that address the various issues discussed in the rebuttal, e.g.: approximation, empirical notions of filling, etc. ===============  ORIGINALITY ===========  The paper considers the functional space of polynomial networks as an algebraic object. They use tools from algebraic geometry to analyze the dimension of the Zariski closure of this space.   This perspective greatly generalizes previous work on two-layer networks with quadratic activations. The paper is highly original in relating recent results from algebra to basic issues about neural networks.  QUALITY & CLARITY =================  This work tackles head-on the problem of analyzing the functional space of polynomial varieties. It gives a clear overview of the model and an understandable interpretation of the technical results. The proofs deferred to the appendix use some high-powered recent results from algebra, but the main text does well in giving a high-level overview and extracts meaningful results such as Theorem 19 about bottlenecks.  I did not have the background to verify all the math but to the extent that the quoted results in the cited papers apply, the main bounds claimed in the theorems are correct. The work is clearly of high technical quality.  SIGNIFICANCE ============  This paper offers new insights how the architecture of a network corresponds to its expressive power. It substantiates common wisdom about the widths of the network being unimodal for expressive networks.  It also shows that if the width becomes too small at any level, it can choke the expressivity of the network.  It is highly significant to see rigorous justifications of these intuitions. The only drawback to the work is that it only considers exact expression and not approximation. Is there a way to talk about approximation using this language, perhaps using something like Proposition 5 to relate it to the exact case?
