        The paper studies adversarial bandits with feedback graph and switching cost among arms. Both the feedback graphs and switching cost for bandit learning have been extensively studied, but combining two aspects together seem to be only covered by one recent prior work Rangi and Franceschetti [2019].          The main technical merit of the paper seems to be connecting the regret upper and lower bound with the dominance number of the feedback graph, denoted as \beta(G). Prior studies only connect regret bounds with independence number \alpha(G), which by definition is greater than or equal to the dominance number. This seems to be a useful advancement in the study of feedback graphs with switching costs. However, the technical result given in the paper is not really a technical improvement of the prior result, because the result of Rangi and Franceschetti [2019] show a regret upper bound of $O(\alpha(G)^{1/3} T^{2/3})$, while the current paper only shows $O(\sqrt{\beta(G)} T^{2/3})$ upper bound. Therefore the term $\sqrt{\beta{G}}$ does not beat $\alpha(G)^{1/3}$ technically, and the authors only conjecture that some adaptation of the algorithm could achieve $\beta{G}^{1/3}$ but was not able to realize that.         This could be viewed as a technical limitation of the paper.         Besides the above limitations, I also few that some other limitations of the paper prevent it to be more impactful.          One is on the motivation. It looks to me that combining feedback graphs with switching cost is more from a theoretical curiosity in extending our knowledge on various bandit algorithms rather than from demanding application scenarios. I do not see a compelling argument in the paper on why this is particularly useful in practice. From this aspect, perhaps the paper would be appreciated more in a more theory oriented conference such as COLT or AISTATS.         Another is on the technical novelty of the paper. It looks like both the upper bound and lower bound analyses are based on existing techniques, such as mini-batching and corralling algorithm for the upper bound, and multi-scale random walk for the lower bound. I do clearly see the technical novelty of the paper.         The third issue is on empirical evaluation. Given the above limitations, I would feel that some empirical evaluations of the proposed algorithm and comparison with prior work would compensate the incremental nature of the work, but unfortunately the authors do not provide any empirical evidence of the superiority of the proposed algorithm.         Overall, I feel that the paper has some interesting theoretical advancement in the theoretical study of bandit algorithms, but I have some reservation on its overall impact, and thus gives the current marginal acceptance score.
