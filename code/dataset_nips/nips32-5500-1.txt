Update after authors response:  Authors addressed my concerns regarding strength of the attack in their response.  ---------------------------- Original comments:  Originality: Authors propose novel adversarial attack which recolors all pixels of the image in the same way using function f(x). Authors also propose to combine multiple adversarial attack to build stronger adversary.  Quality: Overall paper is technically sound. One piece of critics is following. It seems like proposed attack is actually much weaker compared to other attacks (as could be seen from table 1). However this could be compensated by the fact that proposed attack seems to be less noticeable visually and also could be combined with other attacks.  Clarity: Paper is clearly written.  Significance: Moderate significance. Authors propose interesting new technique for crafting adversarial perturbations which in most cases visually less noticeable compared to L-infinity ball restricted perturbations.
