This paper would be more interesting if it could do more than just adjust the brightness on each channel independently. Would he approach work taking a tripple of values <r,g,b> (or <h,s,v>) and perturb those functionally also be effective using this definition? How much more power would that have?  The proposed approach is interesting. New threat models are generally useful and help expand the space of valid attacks. I was especially happy to see a discussion around the color space. (However: I was missing a definition of CIELUV --- was it defined anywhere?) It would have been nice to see more discussion around this point, and in particular setting different bounds per channel. For example, it's well studied that humans are more sensitive to changes in green than blue (and so standard compression will compress blue more than green). Can the same be modeled here?  My main concern with this paper is it is not technically deep: there is not much novelty gained on top of the basic idea. However, it is evaluated well and clearly presented. There are no major writing issues.   Two minor comments: - I am relatively well-versed in the literature, but even I don't know what function "f6" is from Carlini & Wagner [2]. - In 5.1 using the word "transferability" is somewhat confusing as this is often the terminology used for adversarial examples.   Reply to Author Response: Thank you for the clarifications and experiments. I am increasing my score as a result.
