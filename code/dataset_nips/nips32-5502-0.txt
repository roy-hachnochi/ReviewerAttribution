1. The computational-statistical tradeoff shown in this paper is novel, which seems a significant contribution to understanding the single index models. 2. The paper is highly technical, and it is difficult to understand every single piece of the proofs. Therefore for the main paper, I would like to see a more gentle description of model (2.6) and the associated hypothesis testing problem. In the current flow of the paper, it is hard to gain much intuition into why we are interested in such a model and how the lower bounds of the hypothesis testing can imply the lower bound for parameter estimation.
