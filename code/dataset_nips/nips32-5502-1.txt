The paper first introduces first-order and second-order Stein's identity and then defines two function sets, C1 and C2, characterized by the covariance between f and X^T\beta^*.  Further, authors define a common function set C(psi), which includes all link functions such that the second-order Stein's identity does not vanish under transformation psi. Then, authors propose a mixed model in 2.6 using two link functions f1\in C1\cap C(\psi) and  f2\in C2\cap C(\psi). This model is finally used to derive lower bound. This is reasonable since true beta with link function f1 is easy to estimate (using first-order Stein's identity), while true beta with f2 is indistinguishable. The minimax rate is established in Prop 3.1. Analogously, the paper also discusses the computational minimax rate via oracle computational model in the second part.  The paper is not in a good quality due to many typos. But my main concern is about the significance of this paper and contribution. 1, Stein's association in 2.1 is more like a proof technique, which is used to define the function sets and further define the mixed model. The usefulness and necessity of a general transformation psi are not clear. One only need very specific psi and also specific f1 and f2, e.g. psi(y) = y^2, to derive lower bound. It would be better if authors discuss the importance of generalization of psi in Def 2.1, otherwise the this directly comes from [42].  2, Why we need normalization constant \|beta^*\| in C1, instead of directly assuming \|beta^*\| = 1 (the constant can be absorbed in f).  3, It seems the mixed model defined in 148-150 is closely related with [16]. Authors should distinguish this work from [16]. What's the main difference (and difficulty) for using this mixed model to derive lower bound. Are these two works basically solving the same problem?  4, In the main paper, authors emphasize the lower bound only, without upper bound. So writing the contribution paragraph need be careful. It seems the upper bound has different conditions as lower bound (A.2). It would be better to clarify this in main context.  5, Comparing with proof in [16, 53, 62], I don't get the significance of two lower bounds in paper, which I thought are main contributions. Is the proof same as [62]. Although we have index model here but we can always choose specific link function when showing lower bounds. Thus, as my understanding, the problem will reduce to mixed linear regression, studied in those related work.  6, minor things:  23: has--> have 84: second method --> The second method 98: estimate --> estimates  103: Stein's identity comes from Stein's work, not 58, 59. 148: redefine f1
