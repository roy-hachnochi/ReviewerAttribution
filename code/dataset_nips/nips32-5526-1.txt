This paper proposes a new method for learning a robust network by penalizing the local predictive power and forcing it to focus on global features. To penalize the local predictive power, as a regularization, a new network is build upon the features of early layers and adversarial training is adopted to make these early layer features not able to correctly predict.   However, there are still some concerns about the method and the experiment.  1. The compared baseline method for domain generalization setting is not state-of-the-art. Some recent methods such as JiGen [1], Feature-Critic [2] and Epi-FCR [3] should be compared. 2. As we can see from the experimental results, the performance of the proposed method and its variants perform differently on different datasets. For MNIST, PAR_M seems to be the best, for CIFAR10, PAR and PAR_M perform better than PAR_B and PAR_H, but for PACS, PAR_H performs best. So how should we select which one to use in realistic applications?   3. In page4, it is described that the method is tested on CIFAR10 under domain adaptation setting, but in section 4.2 it seems for domain generalization. Besides, it is not clear which Resnet is used for the experiments on Cifar10 dataset.  4. The claim that “the proposed network is forced to discard predictive signals such as color and texture” is not well validated. What is the prediction accuracy of the patch-wise classifier?

I am leaning towards accepting the paper.
