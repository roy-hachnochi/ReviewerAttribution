The study proposes two alternative mechanisms that do not need weight transport as used in backprop to mimic biologically plausible learning. The authors introduce the two mechanisms, mirror weight and Kollen-Pollack (KP) algorithm, in an way that is easy to understand, while providing sufficient mathematical details. The experiments show that, both methods, particularly the KP one, provide lower test error on imagenet task with smaller resnet, compared to feedback alignment, sign-symmetry and backprop, while with larger resnet feedback alignment clearly wins. Both weight mirroring  and  KP were found to be successful in terms of aligning the forward and backward weight matrices. Although the results are preliminary and more experiments are definitely needed to establish these alternative mechanisms, I find this a nice piece of work, which demands attention and further investigation from the community.  Minor comments: On line 168, it was mentioned that sign-symmetry did better in other experiments  - but they were not shown. I would encourage authors to include additional experiments in SI.
