For me, the regrets they introduced seem unnatural. In their feedback settings, the best arm identification framework is more appropriate. Show some cases in which the introduced regrets are more appropriate.  [comments after authors' feedback] I understood that their regret definition is a natural extension of the popular dueling bandit regret. However, I still think that regret minimization setting is unnatural considering real applications.
