This paper propose a new method for sampling in the procedure of choosing an arm to pull in both stochastic setting and non-stochastic setting. Their algorithms reduce the oracle complexity a lot, while maintaining the regret upper bound the same.  The method is a good approach, and as the authers mentioned, it can reduce the complexity a lot. However, I am not sure whether it is an important problem. In this paper, the authors does not list lots of references about this. I think there need to be more explainations.   I do not check the proofs in detail. I can understand the analysis from the intuition idea they provided, and they seems to be correct.     In the rebuttal, the authors show more related works about this problem, and lists why their work is important. I think such explanations are convincing, and I suggest the authors to add these explanations into their paper, so that their contributions are clearer to the readers who are not so familiar with this problem.
