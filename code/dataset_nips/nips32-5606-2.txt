This paper gives the first algorithm that has O(\sqrt{T}) regret and linear oracle complexity for non-stochastic setting and sublinear oracle complexity for stochastic setting.   Originality: It extends the cutting-plane approach from full-information setting to bandit setting using the well-known relations between linear optimization, seperation and decomposition on convex body.  Quality: The proofs are reliable.  Clarity: This paper gives a thorough introduction about the known method on this area and gives a clear comparison between the known ones and the one they propose.  Clearly written.  Significance: The algorithm in this paper is important because it maintains a low regret and it is efficient, unlike other known low regret algorithms which are inefficient to apply.
