It is a well-written paper with clear structure, easy to follow. It contains adequate discussions of related work, and the proposed approach is experimentally validated.   Regarding novelty, the paper follows the footsteps of Wydmuch et al., 2018, but the extension is substantial, as it covers a much boarder range of reduction techniques and the discussion on recall in Wydmuch et al., 2018 is not explicit.  The authors also call for caution in interpreting the produced probabilities scores of the reduction techniques. But isn't it rather trivial? It is not a criticism; I'd just like to point it out in case I've missed something.
