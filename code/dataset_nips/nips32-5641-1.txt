Originality: To the best of my knowledge the proposed algorithm as well as the analysis has novel insights/contributions. Quality: The submission is technically sound. The claims are well supported by theory and experiments. Clarity: The paper is very well-written. The introduction and the related work section provide a complete survey as well as comparisons with previous work. The proof section is very well done. Significance: This paper studies an important problem and improves over previous results in several directions. However, the Gaussianity assumption is very restrictive compared to the symmetry assumption in the Convotron paper. Therefore, the algorithm is not likely to have much impact in practice since the analysis heavily relies on the Gaussianity of the input.    %%%%%%%%UPDATE%%%%%%%%%% After reading authors feedback, I am happy to increase my rating from 6 to 7. Overall, I vote for accepting this paper.
