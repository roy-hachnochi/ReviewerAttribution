The approach presented in this paper is interesting and  it seems that the portfolio selection approach naturally fits into the selective classification network. The paper is well motivated, well-written, clear, and self-contained.    The reason I chose this score (marginally below the accept threshold) is because of the following two reasons:  1.The approach you suggested (adding a new class) is very similar to the selectivenet approach, and as we can observe in the experimental part,  your approach leads only to marginal improvement.    2. Your approach is indeed simpler than selective net. However, the table on page 2 is a bit misleading. The gain of selective net, as explained in their paper, is due of the fact that for a given coverage the net needs to be retrained.  Summarizing the above, the  contribution over the SOTA (selectivenet) is marginal.
