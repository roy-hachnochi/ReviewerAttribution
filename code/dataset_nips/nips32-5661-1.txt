This paper tackles an important problem; methods aiming to improve the models' ability to express uncertainty are of high importance to the field. The proposed method is simple, flexible and seemingly novel.   The method does not cover/evaluate the regression problems which might limit its impact scope.  Even though the obtained results are not outperforming the state-of-the-art, this line of research on incorporating the portfolio theory to the confidence estimation is interesting and can inspire future studies. The paper is sometimes difficult to follow and presentation quality of the paper and its clarity can be improved.
