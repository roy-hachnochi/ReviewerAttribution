To my knowledge the proposed analysis about two time-scale TDC under diminishing step-size and constant step-size is novel. However I need to acknowledge that I am not familiar with all related work in this area and I did not go through the proof details.  Later, an blockwise diminishing step-size method is proposed to combine the advantage of constant step-size and diminishing step-size. However, to me, it looks like this ideal property need an careful choice of blocksize, and Thm 3 seems verified that. I have some concern about how to set the blocksize properly here without prior knowledge and how robust the algorithm is with respect to the blocksize hyperparameter.  === After Rebuttal === I'm glad that the authors could show the algorithm performance is very robust to the blocksize. The author's further explanation addressed my concern. So I will change my score accordingly.
