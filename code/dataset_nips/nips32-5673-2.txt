I would consider Theorem 1 and analysis behind it as a main contribution of the paper. Even though, the bound has too many "moving parts", the trade-off between relevant quantities seems to make sense. One caveat is L2 norm of the weights: when inequality ||Γ||_2 <= sqrt(N) ||Γ||_∞ is tight (for sufficiently large N), the bound of Theorem 1 appears to be vacuous (it is multiplied by the term of order sqrt(N)).  Line 182: "...||Γ||_∞ << 1/N_T, which implies that transfer learning has a faster convergence rate than single-task learning" -- this is not entirely true, as the bound is also controlled by the discrepancy, which can be large enough for any source sample size.  == post-rebuttal reply  I agree with the authors (and raise the score): the rate seems to be fine (the crucial point here is that ||Γ||_2 is squared). One additional note: the bound seems to hold only for a fixed Γ. It should be okay for a general intuition, but to for the design of an algorithm which minimizes the bound simultaneously in h and Γ simultaneously, we should have a bound uniform in Γ (or at least a union bound). Authors could discuss this in a final version.
