The paper studies the problem of robust sparse Mean Estimation, and robust sparse PCA in the strong-adversary model, i.e. an adversary inspects your samples, and can replace a constant fraction of them. In this setting, the authors get near optimal bounds, along with near-optimal sample complexities, in particular, the sample complexity scales only logarithmically with the dimension p.  The main benefit of this proposed algorithm is that it escapes doing sparse-eigenvector computations, which was a bottleneck in previous works. The authors achieve this by carefully exploiting the problem structure, namely, using the knowledge of true covariance matrix, to construct a simple test to identify outliers. The proposed algorithm only requires eigenvector computations, and hence is a practical algorithm. Moreover, the authors do a good job at testing out their proposed algorithm by conducting extensive simulations.  The paper is clearly written, and the authors have done a good job at giving an intuitive explanation of their algorithm.
