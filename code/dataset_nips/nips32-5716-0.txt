This paper proposes a Semi-Implicit VI extension of the GraphVAE model.  SIVI assumes a prior distribution over the posterior parameter, enabling more flexible modeling of latent variables.  In this paper, SIVI is straightforwardly incorporated into the Graph VAE framework.  The formulation is simple but possibly new in the graph analysis literature. It is easy to understand the main idea.  The proposed model shows good records in link prediction experiments.    Fig. 3 is not reader-friendly in several aspects (i) the panels are simply too small.  (ii) we can observe the posterior distributions learned by SIG-VAE is multi-modal.  But the readers do not know that the posteriors of five nodes ``should be'' multi-modal.  In other words, the SIG-VAE's variational posterior is closer to the true distribution, than that of VGAE?  Are there any solutions that can answer this question more directly?   I cannot fully understand the meaning of the result of graph generation experiments.  What is the main message we can read from this result?   I have a few questions concerning the result of the graph node classification experiment.  (i) what kind of data splitting is employed in the experiments? (train/validation/test sample splitting) Data split has a huge impact on the final score. The split is the same with the standard split used in the Kipf-Welling's GCN paper? (ii) The performance of the proposed SIG-VAE is not so much impressive, compared to naive and simple GCN. Why is that?  (iii) I think GCN is a strong baseline but not the best one to claim SOTA. In general, the [GAT] works better in many cases, including the cora and citeseer datasets. Please see the experiments in [Wu19].  [GAT] Velickovic+ ``Graph Attention Networks'', in Proc. ICML 2018 [Wu19] Wu+, ``Simpplifying Graph Convolution Networks'', in Proc. ICML 2019  + A combination fo Semi-implicit VI and graph VAE is new + Formulation is concise and easy to understand - Some unclear issues in Fig.3 and graph generation experiments,  - The node classification result is not SOTA (too-strong claim)  ### after author-feedback ### The authors provided satisfactory answers for some of my concerns.  Considering the other reviewers' points of view at the same time, I raised the score.
