In this paper, the authors propose InteractiveRecGan to utilize offline data and build a recommender agents with model-based RL algorithms. They integrate a user behavior model, an agent model and a discriminator together. The paper is well written and easy to follow. The proposed model is verified by theoretical analysis and experiments with state-of-art baselines.  I have read authors' response, but my mind did not change.
