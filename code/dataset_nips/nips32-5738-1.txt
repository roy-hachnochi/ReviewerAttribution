Originality and significance: In my opinion the direction this paper is exploring is very important and worth investigating. It is hard to judge the significance of this paper since the comparison with other methods in the experimental evaluation is very brief and no conclusion can be inferred based on them.  Quality:  * I don't think that provided experimental evaluation is enough to establish the paper contribution over the prior work. For R-FCN detector SSM [8] approach demonstrates significantly better performance. It would be beneficial to see SSD + SSM comparison with the proposed approach. Given that the code for SSM is public, it should be possible to conduct such experiments. * In the paper the authors claim that using COCO images that contain only 20 Pascal VOC categories is beneficial since they have the same distribution as Pascal VOC. I do not agree with this claim. Pascal VOC certainly has objects from the other 60 categories in it. They simply do not have annotation for them. Filtering out COCO like this one uses additional supervision by supplying images that has objects from these 20 categories and do not have objects of other 60 categories. In my opinion, the paper's claim should be refined or the experiments with COCO subset should be removed.  Clarity: The paper explains the new approach clearly. I think it would be possible for me to reproduce paper's results.
