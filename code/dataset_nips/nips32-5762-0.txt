This paper a new cross-modal correlation learning with adversarial samples. However, this paper still suffers from the following problem:  1. The proposed method aims to learn the minimum perturbations. A major concern is that the two perturbations for two models are learned jointly or separately. A key point for cross-modal learning are the cross-modal correlations, while the proposed scheme seems to learn the optimal perturbations separately. 2. CMLA aims to learn the perturbations which do not change intra-modal similarity relationship. An alternative way is the perturbations can be learned to enhance the robustness and stability in both the cross-modal correlations and the intra-modal similarity. It seems two adverse ends. 3. I cannot see the remarkable difference between adversarial example in the context of cross-modal and single-modal? what the unique properties of cross-modal is adopted in your method and why it is important to cross-modal analysis, esp, considering limited development in single modal adv example? In other words, it may make the paper seeming like a combination of cross-modal analysis and adversarial example, thus reducing the novelty of the paper.   4. The experiments seem insufficient to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially with only two baselines and two datasets. It is expected to show the performance of other challenging cross-modal tasks. In fact, I prefer to see more experiment specifically designed for adversarial example. 5. The notations are confused and unclear, especially for the o_i in problem deÔ¨Ånition part. In addition, though we can understand the meaning in the retrieval background, it is still expected to specify the full name of T2T, I2T, I2I, the meanings of different shapes in figure 1, and explain the NR carefully.
