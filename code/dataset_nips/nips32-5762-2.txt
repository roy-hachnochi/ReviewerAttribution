1, The idea is interesting and it works according to the experimental results.  2, The objective function in Equation5 includes some equality constraints, I was wondering how to keep this constraint during error back-propagation. And this part has to be carefully studied in the experimental section.  3. The authors stated "In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Modal correlation Learning with Adversarial samples, namely CMLA, which, for the first time, presents the existence of adversarial samples in cross modalities data." But actually, there is some other works that also explore using adversarial loss to generate addition sample for cross-modal learning.  4. There are also many works on image and sentence matching, which are closely related to your work and should be cited and compared: 1, Look, imagine and match: Improving textual-visual cross-modal retrieval with generative models, In ICCV, 2017. 2, Learning semantic concepts and order for image and sentence matching. In CVPR, 2018. 3, Stacked cross attention for image-text matching. In ECCV, 2018.
