Update after reading the author response =============================== The feedback helped me to appreciate the contribution. I changed my scores accordingly.     The paper considers the challenge of private distribution testing. Previous results considered "testing samples" approach. This paper considers the flattening samples approach which is more challenging in terms of privacy preserving. To overcome this difficulty, the authors suggest a method that look at all possible permutations of the samples in order to eliminate the sensitivity caused by the flattening process.  Overall the suggested algorithm gives an adequate solution for DP in the context of distribution testing.   It took a lot of effort from my side to understand the contribution of the paper. The presentation goes back and forth between preliminaries and novel parts, and also between various settings of the problem. I wish that the author presented the setting and the main results in a more concise manner.
