Additional Comments after feedback period: I've changed my score.  I also edited my comment on the typo in line 154-155. ---------------------------------------------------- The paper has a number of typos and should be proofread carefully.  Some of them are described below.  Overall, though, the paper is written clearly.  Since I do not know the literature in differential privacy, it is difficult for me to asesss the originality of the work.    Some of the typos in the paper: Line 25: "the 'far'" should be "they 'far'" line 83: "and output" should be "and outputs" line 93 missing right paren line 101: missing citation (?) line 120: typos in definition of Lap(x:gamma) line 128: S and S should be S and S' line 154-155: doesn't parse, needs to be corrected.  In the expression in line 154, in the theta notation, the quantity max(||p||_2, ||q||_2) should not be in the denominator.  The expression in the footnote also needs to be fixed.
