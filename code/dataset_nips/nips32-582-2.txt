Originality: This paper presents a general PIAG algorithm an inexact extension of previously proposed exact PIAG from [1]. The paper analyzes convergence properties of this algorithm under different assumptions of convexity of the component functions. This is an extension of [1], [2] where linear convergence was proven under strong convexity. The paper also adds a dimension of line search and proves larger stepsizes than earlier. The Lyapunov function based proof technique has been used earlier in [1] and [2], however, the perspective of convergence in  expectation, almost surely, and semi-algebraic property is a new addition.  Quality: The paper contains high quality results and proofs. Although, the primary focus of the paper is on theory, the quality of numerical section and the figure can be much improved.   Clarity: The paper is overall well written and the contributions and organization are explained clearly upfront. However, there are few places where concepts or quantities are used without defining them clearly. For example,  * Line 132: can be explained better or add citation to the result if taken from somewhere else * Line 150: the assumption on sigma_i’s can be explained better with some discussion/note (since inexactness is the main difference in the algorithm between this paper and [1])  * Line 191, Lemma 2: uses a quantity ‘t’ without defining it * Line 210: uses “coercivity of f” without defining it  * Line 439, Theorem 5: uses incorrect solution of quadratic equation, the inequality should be LHS <= 0.5*( \sqrt(H^2+4H) - H)  Significance: This paper extends the existing work on convergence of PIAG and related methods to non-strongly convex and nonconvex areas. The extension with line search makes this algorithm more applicable to real problems when convergence times (vs. theoretical rates) matter more.
