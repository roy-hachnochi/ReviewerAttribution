Background ======== The paper considers the important challenge of generalization theory for dependent variables. Dependency graphs provide a natural and convenient method for capturing such dependencies where two subsets of RV are independent iff they are non-adjacent. Several previous results included generalization of Hoeffding's inequality that is useful in the context of bounding the deviation of the average of (dependent) RV from their mean.   Main result ======= McDiarmid-type are more general and allow analyzing the deviation of any Lipschitz function from its mean. The main contribution paper is a McDiarmid inequality for graph dependent RV in terms of the Lipschitz constants corresponding to the dependent RV.    Application ======== Stability bounds provide a great motivation for McDiarmid-type inequalities. The authors suggest high probability stability bounds for dependent variables and illustrate the applicability for learning in m-dependent data.  Overall I find the contribution significant and interesting.
