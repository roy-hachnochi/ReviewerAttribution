Originality: This paper extends the cycle-basis [22] to the cycle-consistency basis, more specifically, defining the condition number of cycle-consistency basis and minimizing the condition number. Both the problem and the algorithm are novel.  Quality & clarity: Theoretically, the paper provides thorough definitions/derivations for cycle consistency bases. It also clarifies the differences with path-invariance bases on directed graphs and draws connections to cycle bases. Technically, the paper jointly optimizes the objective via the 3-step method. Experiments are conducted in a principled manner. In general, the paper present high quality in the three aspects. The paper is also well written.  Significance: Since cycle-consistency is very commonly used in computer vision and the other areas, the paper has the potential to benefit all the related algorithms.  Post rebuttal: The rebuttal has addressed my concern w.r.t the scales of the networks, the possible overfitting problem, and the testing strategy. I thus would like to keep the original rating.
