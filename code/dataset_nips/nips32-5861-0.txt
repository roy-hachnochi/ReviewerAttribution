As described, the paper makes some strong contributions to the knowledge of GCNs. However,  some parts of the paper are not clearly written or organized. As an example, the discussion and numerical results around Figure 1 are difficult to understand. Additionally, some figure and table captions and some mathematical derivations are not clearly expressed, and should be revised.    The proposed architectures are evaluated and compared to 3 common datasets (all for classification of scientific publications into one of several classes), and the results on these problems are fairly convincing. However, it would be more convincing to expand experiments and interpretation to different families of problems (with diverse data structures), as well as to compare the time and memory complexity associated with these approaches. Apart from the number layers, it is not clear from the paper and its experiments what factors are critical for the performance of the proposed architectures. What key factors can affect the accuracy and complexity of the proposed architectures?
