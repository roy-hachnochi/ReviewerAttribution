The choice of the exponential family is the same for all the local parameters, so I am assuming the method is suited to independent partitions of the data?  When I first started reading the paper, I was expecting some sort of aggregation of different methods on the same data and in that case, we may be dealing with completely different parameters and different distributions.  Possibility of such extensions should be discussed.   I think the idea of sharing global parameters in Q_j is quite restrictive.  For example if Q_js are moderately high dimensional, it may be desirable to only share only a few coordinates while keeping the other coordinates distinct, much in the way of the Local partition processes:  https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/96/2/249/249850?redirectedFrom=fulltext   In the simulation study, the authors may also consider comparing with Chinese Restaurant process based clustering which does not require the true value of L.
