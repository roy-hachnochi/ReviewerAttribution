This paper is very clearly written, providing a thorough review of previous works and appropriately contextualizing the current work. This paper also does some important bridging work: in addition to proposes new measures of explanations, the work shows how these measures relate to previous understandings of explanations, and thus providing a thorough and more unified understanding. The empirical experiments are thorough and the human evaluations provide a good validation for the measures proposed.
