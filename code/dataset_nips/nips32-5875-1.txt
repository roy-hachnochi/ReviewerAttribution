# Originality  This is an original approach to MLE of exponential families based on a representation of the intractable log partition function using Fenchel duality. Fenchel duality introduces a dual sampler that needs to be optimized, resulting in an "adversarial" max-min problem. The authors propose to estimate an augmented model inspired by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which allows them to design dual samplers generated by Hamiltonian dynamics in the original space or an embedding space.   # Quality  The quality of the paper is quite good but could be improved. For example, references need to be fixed in the main paper and the appendix. Tests reporting MLEs for some common exponential families would be useful.   # Clarity  Most parts of the paper are clearly written. Personally, I think that the fragmented style splitting the text into remarks perturbs the flow of the text.   # Significance  I think this is a very nice and flexible framework for MLE of exponential families that should result in powerful estimators and provide a starting point for further algorithmic developments.   What about exponential families defined on discrete spaces?
