This paper starts from introducing max-min formulation of MLE by using Fenchel dual of log partition function. Authors focus on providing a better solution of min part (i.e. dual sampler). They first construct augmented model by introducing an auxiliary momentum variable. The essence is to incorporate the model with an independent Gaussian variable, see (6). By this construction, the min problem is equivalent to (8). They further conduct T HMC-based steps, (13), to approximately solve it and show how the output approximates the density value and helps with max problem. They compare the proposed scheme with SM, CD etc to show superiority.  The paper is readable and has good quality overall. The experimental results are significant. But I have some brief concerns:  1, the significance of the paper need to be clarified more clearly. In particular, the max-min problem is from plugging the Fenchel dual of log partition, which is standard. For the augmented MLE, since later authors use HMC to represent dual sampler and HMC has natural augmented interpretation, (6) is more likely proposed due to the specific HMC scheme adopted, instead of an original work.   2, the finer analysis of Algorithm 1 is lacking for study. Specifically, is it possible that SGD for max problem would blur the precision of HMC such that the inner iteration number T need to adapt with outer iteration suitably. The theorem only shows HMC is able to well approximate exponential family, which I think is standard, but the combination with SGD for max problem need to discuss as well.   3, for the experiment, instead of using fixed number of steps, using CV to select for all methods is preferred. I don't see why T = 5 for ADE corresponds to T = 15 for CD. Also the setup of leapfrog stepsize is not mentioned in the main paper.  4, minor thing: should it be log(Z(f)) in (7)?
