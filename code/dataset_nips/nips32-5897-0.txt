Originality: While the PML estimator was proposed in prior work and analyzed in a series of papers, this paper is the first to analyze it in such generality. Results for estimating specific properties also seem to be state-of-the-art, and connections to prior work are well discussed.  Clarity and quality: The exposition is clear, and while I did not check all proofs in detail, the ones I did check seem to be correct.  Significance: The PML estimator is a natural estimator for these problems, and providing a unified view of its properties is significant. This work also raises interesting algorithmic questions regarding the approximate PML that could be the subject of further research.
