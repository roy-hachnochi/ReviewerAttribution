The paper is fairly clear. Experimental results show promises of the proposed architecture and the module along with its inference/reversed inference seems simple enough to be practical.   However, the main reasons for my borderline score are: (1) significance and novelty of the proposed method: existing works such as Flow++ is already using similar idea and achieving better results (the authors mention Flow++ treat the output is discrete, but the gap is quite significant).  (2) experimental results: the qualitative results are not too impressive and ImageNet only is up to 32x32. Appendix mentioned CelebA but no results.   Additionally, the math proofs in Appendix (i.e. Thm1) is classic linear algebra results. The authors can simply cite e.g. Matrix Analysis, and give a re-phrased proof in context for clarity.   I raised my score to 6 on the author's promise to release code.
