****** post rebuttal ****** I have read the authors response. I'm not sure I'm convinced regarding the level of novelty of the arguments used, nevertheless I think this is a solid and nice contribution and I would like to keep my score. *****************************    The authors revisit the problem of distributed stochastic k-pca, where m machines each have an i.i.d. sample of size n. The authors consider a one-shot aggregation protocol, where each machine computes locally on her sample and sends O(kd)-size summary to a central node. The central node then aggregates these individual summaries to extract an estimate for the top-k components of the covariance of the underlying (unknown) distribution, with the aim of achieving statistical accuracy as if these estimates were directly computed from the entire m*n sample of all machines combined.  While previous works [6,7] focused only on extracting the top k-dimensional subspace (i.e., an orthonormal basis for the span of the top k eigenvectors of the underlying covariance), here the authors consider estimating the exact top-k decomposition, including the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (if they are unique, otherwise some basis to corresponding eigenspace).  While [6] proposed that each machine sends its top-k eigenvectors computed over the sample (to estimate only the subspace), here the authors consider a natural extension, in which each machine sends the eigenvectors, each scaled by square-root of the corresponding eigenvalue.  Sinne, as in previous works, the estimation accuracy depends on the eigengap between the k and k+1 largest eigenvalues, the authors also show a procedure that using rank of k_1 they can extract the decomposition for any k<=k_1 depending on the kth-eigengap. This is useful when we do not know exactly for which k the gap is large enough.  In terms of technique, the authors rely heavily on results established in [6]. In this aspect, the work is somewhat incremental and I do not identify highly novel ingredients. It would be great if the authors can emphasize the technical difficulties and novel solutions.  Overall this is a nice result that has a solid contribution and, to my taste, worthy of publication in NIPS
