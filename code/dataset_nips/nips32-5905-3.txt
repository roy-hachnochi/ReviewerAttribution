I still think the contribution is incremental so I maintain my score. ------------------------------------------------------ The new algorithm let each machine sends the square-root of the local covariance matrix to the server in contrast to previous works that let each machine sends eigenvectors.  This new method does make sense because sending only eigenvectors will create additional bias during the local estimation step. The analysis and proof in the current draft do reflect it. Furthermore, empirical experiments do verify it.  I think this paper makes contributions to the distributed PCA problem. However, I feel the contribution is limited as it only corrects the sub-optimal estimators in previous work.
