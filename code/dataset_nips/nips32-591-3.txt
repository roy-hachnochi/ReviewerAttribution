 Strength:  Architecture seems to be novel. Introduction of spatial transformer to represent perspective with a VAE as well as the use of perspective inference to better obtain disentangled appearance.   Weakness:  -Experiments are performed on two datasets: MNIST and SMPL. Both datasets are toy-like and quite different from typical images. The MNIST task is too simple.    -Experimental results are somewhat promising but not convincing. More complex / diverse datasets would provide evidence that this is good method to disentangle appearance and perspective.   -Fails to achieve high quality disentanglement on one baseline.  Comments:  -In C-VITAE the encoder for z_A explicitly depends on z_P, so it is a little confusing how it can be that conditioning can help with disentangling z_A from z_P.  Since the prior for z_A is not conditioned on z_P (for C-VITAE), it will have the effect of minimizing mutual information between z_A and z_P. Is this important to achieving disentanglement?  -Typo: DLR -> DRL twice on page 2.  Originality: Architecture is original.  Clarity: Very clear.  Significance: Unclear as the experimental results are not 100% convincing.
