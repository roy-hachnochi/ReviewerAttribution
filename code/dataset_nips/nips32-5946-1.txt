Originality: The intuition of the model is similar to existing curriculum base model (e.g. MentorNet), but the approach to estimate the weight of each example is new. In this paper, the authors proposed to learn the weight of each instance/class with a gradient descent. The related work section is clear and explain the difference with existing approaches.  Quality: The proposed dynamic curriculum learning framework is validated on image classification and object detection tasks. In particular, the proposed curriculum based approach outperforms existing curriculum based approaches like MentorNet. The model is also accurate when it learns with noisy labels because it learns to ignore noisy training examples.  Clarity: The submission is clearly written and well organised.  Significance: A lot of approaches have been proposed recently to speed-up the training of deep models. I think that using curriculum based models is an interesting direction to speed-up the convergence. I also think that designing models that are robust to noisy labels is an important problem because a lot of real data contains noisy labels.    --------------------------------------------- The rebuttal addresses my concerns and I think it is a good paper.
