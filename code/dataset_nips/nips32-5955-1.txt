1. The main concern with this work is that the benefits of using RMI are not presented well in this paper at all. I am not sure why practitioners would like to use the RMI loss in practice for semantic image segmentation, given only marginal improvements at a more complex computational cost. 2. It is not clear if the assumption (11) holds in experiments for semantic image segmentation. There are no experimental results to support this. 3. I appreciate the details of the equations to explain the proposed RMI loss. However, given the equation 16 and equation 13, how would one to implement it in an efficient way is not very clear after reading the paper. It is also not very clear if the proposed approach would work well with end-to-end training with deep neural networks at all. 4. It is not clear if the proposed loss would give improvements with other base models, and how much this would give compared with the other tricks, such as atrous convolution, various up-sampling modules.
