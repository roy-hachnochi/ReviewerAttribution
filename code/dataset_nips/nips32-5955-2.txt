- Originality: I think many people have thought of different ways trying to model the relationships between pixels, e.g. (as the paper mentioned) CRF. The current proposal of using region based loss is both novel and intuitive to me.  - Quality: The paper is written in a decent quality. The overall style is biased toward being "technical", with clean mathematical definitions and down-to-earth practical details. The only thing missing to me is qualitative results for experiments, which is very essential to me as the paper is focusing on the qualitative difference between a model that takes into account the correlations between pixels vs. a model that does not. - Clarity: Although I haven't check the mathematical formulations, the paper is clear enough in delivering what is the intuition for the solution, and what is the results. - Significance: Judging from the quantitative results, I think the performance improvement is significant enough for a paper. I do find several things lacking: -- The results are reported on the val set for VOC 2012, instead of the test set; -- Qualitative results are lacking; -- It would be nice to include more SOTA comparisons (I am not up to date on this, but is DeepLab v3+ still the state-of-the-art?); -- Another important experiment to analyze is to verify the performance of 1) RMI + CRF; 2) CRF + Affinity; 3) Affinity + RMI. This is to see if RMI has already done the job that CRF/Affinity is doing, or vice versa -- how much of RMI's contribution can be done in CRF/Affinity.  -- Another baseline I can think of is to have a "pyramid" of losses, e.g. using the same CE loss or BCE loss, but apply it a pyramid of downsampled predictions. Will that help performance? Will that replace the functionality of RMI?
