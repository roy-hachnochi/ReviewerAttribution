The authors present a highly original approach for using layered neural networks to learn the function of a continuous time dynamical system while ensuring that the system is stable. The authors leverage recently introduced "input convex neural networks" (ICNNs) and automatic differentiation to simultaneously learn a Lyapunov function to ensure stability as well as train a neural network to approximate a dynamics function.   The work is a creative use of ICNNs and automatic differentiation applied to a broad, general problem and one of great significance (learning stable dynamical systems). The approach appears to be a significant improvement (although see below) over previous approaches (which only ensure stability over the data training set). The method itself is clearly presented, with all of the necessary background provided to clearly understand the method, and all of the presented technical material appears correct.   The principle weakness of the paper is the clarity and the completeness of the empirical results. The originality of the approach compensates for this weakness, however, the paper would have undoubtedly been scored even more favorably if these results have been more clear and complete. See below for critiques of the clarity fo the empirical results.
