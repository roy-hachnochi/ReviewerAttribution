Originality: The paper describes a formalism to learn lyapunov stable dynamics functions. this is, as acknowledged by the authors, not the first attempt to solve such a problem. However previous methods have either focussed on learning dynamics models linear in embedding space and explicit stability guarantees as a loss. Alternating optimization based methods which use projection constraints have also been used. However this paper proposes a method to learn functions by restricting the function class to lyapunov stable functions with ICNNs -- which is indeed novel and exciting.   Overall this would qualify for a novel contribution, of it can be supported amply with experimental evaluation.   Quality: The paper presents the methods, formalism and analysis in a convincing manner with sufficient detail. The topic and the contribution is both interesting and non-trivial, even in hindsight.  However the results in the experiments section are left a bit wanting. The current results in the paper involve only toy domains, which are not sufficient to convince a reader -- either an expert or a practiioner to adopt this method.   Clarity: The paper is written clearly, jumps to the problem statement without much ado and does a good job explaining the background and challenges in the dyanmics learning with stability guarantees.    Significance: The results are interesting in particular because of their theoretical value and potential applicability. However the experimental validation is rather insufficient with no baselines.
