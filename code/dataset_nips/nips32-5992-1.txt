Originality:  It is an interesting work by casting the sequence generation task as two iterative tasks of insertion/deletion. I think the formulation is new that is coupled with the training procedure based on imitation learning with two policies, i.e., deletion and insertion.   Quality:   The proposed model and its training procedure seem apt and well designed. Experiments are carried out carefully with consistent gains when compared with SOTA, i.e., Transformer, with faster inference speed.  Clarity:  This paper is clearly written, though I have a couple of minor questions regarding technical details. See the details in "Improvements" section.  Significance:  Given the inference efficiency and its reasonable quality improvements, I feel this work might have potential to impact future research.
