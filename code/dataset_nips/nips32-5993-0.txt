Originality - it's the first time that semi-supervised techniques are shown to effective in the robust learning regime, both theoretically and empirically.  Significance - robust models require more samples in order to generalize. Showing that unlabeled data alleviate this problem is crucial because it is much easier (and cheaper) to collect. Quality and Clarity - the paper is well written. The claims and methods are clearly explained.
