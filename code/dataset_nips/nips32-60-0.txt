Please find my concerns for this approach here:  1. There are too many strong continuity assumptions in the proof of Lemma 1. In reality, such assumptions may prove to be somewhat acceptable for simple datasets, but may not generalize to more complex scenarios. I would like to see a simple frequentist study showing how many times these assumptions are violated in reality. One such approach could be simply randomly evaluating the assumed continuities in a real-world setup.   2. Complementary to the above, the paper would be more impactful if authors study a real-world complicated task and show superior performance of their approach. Furthermore, study of failure cases would also be greatly appreciated. Table 2 shows an extremely saturated task, which only leaves the reviewer in doubt. Aside from a task already in 95+ performance, I would like to see the proposed model be challenged in a more complex setup.  3. What is the optimizer for MAML in Table 2?   4. Authors highlight that MAML may have gradient instabilities @274 which naturally the reader connects that to continuity of the gradients and the inner loop, but then wouldn't this also break your claims about continuity? What would happen if the assumptions are not true in your approach? Methods like MAML are desirable since they will work regardless of the exact complexity of the data and continuities across the optimization path.   5. Line 172 needs citation. It is not clear why line search methods would in fact fail.
