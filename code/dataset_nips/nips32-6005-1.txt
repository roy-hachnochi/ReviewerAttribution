I would like to provide weak points of this paper. 1. The statement "Given the imputation algorithm, the forward RNN only encodes complete sequences, while the backward RNN needs to deal with missing values." is too short of making the proposed forward-backward encoder from a bi-directed RNN. Fig. 2 seems to feed all data to f_f and f_b encoders. 2. Based on the result of MaskGan and GRUI, the PEMS-SF traffic time series might be too small to train deep models requiring more than ten thousands samples. Other non-linear but straightforward interpolation methods, such as bicubic spline, would make the author's argument more concrete. Table 1 and 2 report the L2 loss for checking the interpolation accuracy, but somehow, Table 3 does not. Moreover, does Linear showed smaller errors than NAOMI on Path Lengths, Step Change, Path Different, and Player Distance?
