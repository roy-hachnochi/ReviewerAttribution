The topic of the paper is interesting. The paper seems technically sound and generally well-written.  However, it is quite difficult to read in my opinion. I have only one suggestion for avoiding confusion.  - Similar names can generate several misunderstandings and confusion. The name/title "Layered Importance Sampling" recall me the following Monte Carlo sampling approach,  L. Martino, V. Elvira, D. Luengo, J. Corander, "Layered Adaptive Importance Sampling", Statistics and Computing, Volume 27, Issue 3, Pages: 599-623, 2017.   I think you should clarify that your framework is different.  More generally, "importance sampling" in the Monte Carlo community has a clear  different meaning (referring to a specific algorithm).
