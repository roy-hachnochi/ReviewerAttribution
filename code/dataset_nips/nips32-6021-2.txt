1) This paper proposes a new paradigm that casts the generative adversarial learning as a goodness-of-fit (GOF) test problem.  However, the following paper (published in UAI 2018) already proposed this paradigm. http://auai.org/uai2018/proceedings/papers/356.pdf  It is not clear what new contribution this NeurIPS 2019 paper has made, compared to the UAI 2018.  BTW, this paper does not cite the UAI 2018 paper.  For the above reason, the originality of the proposed GOF paradigm is in doubt.  2) The quality of the paper is good.  3) The proposed technique is clearly described.
