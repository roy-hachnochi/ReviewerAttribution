The paper considers a new pure exploration problem where the target criterion is a linear combination of the mean and the conditional value at risk. While the algorithmic framework is the usual Successive Rejects (the fixed budget setting), the newly proposed estimator and its concentration inequality enables the algorithm to be agnostic (=oblivious) to the type of the distributions (up to very mild assumptions). The empirical results are compelling, and it suggests that the theory might be tightened up.  Overall, a well-written paper. The key novelty is in the new estimator and concentration inequality that is not restricted to bounded random variables. The idea of setting b value as a function of n and enjoying guarantees when n is large enough seem like an interesting idea though similar concepts appear in the literature. I think the paper is in a good shape.   It took me some time to appreciate "where" the distribution-obliviousness comes from, since the SR algorithm has been distribution-obliviousness, I thought (e.g., we don't need to know the variance when the arms are sub-Gaussian). However, I realized that it becomes interesting in the heavy-tailed distribution / CVaR regime where the estimator itself would require some knowledge on the distributions itself. I don't think the authors said anything incorrect, but maybe they can avoid confusion by adding more explanation.  - "MAB formulations consider reward distributions with bounded support, typically [0, 1]. Moreover, the support is assumed to be known beforehand, and this knowledge is baked into the algorithm. " attacking this is quite weak, since many times you can relax this to \sigma^2-sub-Gaussianity, and for SR you don't need to know \sigma ahead of time. It'd be nice to address this case as well.  - It might be helpful to explain that the sample average in used in the standard SR does not serve the purpose in heavy-tailed distribution / CVaR problems anymore, and naÃ¯ve applications of existing techniques would require information about the distribution."  # minor comments  - Note the authors are not using the correct formatting for the submission, so there is no line numbers in the submission. This makes things a bit difficult.  - I am pretty sure the definition of v_\alpha(X) should have ">= \alpha" rather than "<= \alpha". Otherwise v_\alpha(X) would be -\infty.  - It would've been easier to define CVaR as E[Y | Y \ge VaR_\alpha(Y)] then say it becomes c_\alpha(X) defined in the paper since that's easier to understand the meaning. I myself had to track down the reference to dig it out.  - In section 4, first paragraph, I think (\xi_1, \xi_2) = (1,0) for the first appearance rather than (0,1).  - Figure 2 (a), b_m must be q_m?  ==== [after rebuttal] I stand by my score. It'd be great if you could make the paper more accessible to nonexperts by adding definitions/explanations/references on the basic concept such as CVaR.
