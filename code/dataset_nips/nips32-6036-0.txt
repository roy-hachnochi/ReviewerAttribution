Originality: although similar in spirit to past works on approximating black-box models with interpretable surrogates / performing symbolic regression (which it does a good job citing), this work seems to go several steps further and contribute something novel both in framing the problem and solving it. (It doesn't seem like past work on symbolic regression use Meijer G-functions.)  Quality: the work seems technically sound, though it makes a number of arbitrary choices and I think it could do with more experiments. I'll elaborate on these points in the improvements section.  Clarity: the paper is very clearly written and its results are nicely presented.  Significance: I think this paper has the potential to become very significant, with immediate practical applications in medicine and accelerated science and many areas for follow-up research.
