After reading reviews and author feedback I raise my score to 7. The authors responded to my concern and I think this submission is a good contribution.  -----------  **tl;dr** The ability to learn interpretable meta-models with gradient descent is a good contribution. Some more empirical evidence would make the paperâ€™s claim stronger.  **Summary** The authors propose an elegant way to create an interpretable, symbolic model via regressing the target model's function. By using Meijer G-function they are able to learn the structure of the symbolic model via gradient descent, in contrast to prevailing genetic methods.  Building on the constructed meta-model the paper shows how these models can be seen as a unification of two branches of the interpretation literature: feature importance estimators and local additive approximations.  Finally an empirical evaluation on synthetic data and a real world dataset is provided. The use case on cancer data is very interesting.  **Originality** The original contribution of this paper is to show a way to learn symbolic models via gradient descent rather than with genetic methods.  **Quality** The overall quality of the paper is good. Yet a larger/better empirical evaluation is needed: * When does this approach not work anymore? E.g., how about input with a large feature dimensions? models that create rich internal feature representations? * Which results are reached by competitors on the given example on breast cancer? Is there a runtime benefit compared to genetic models? * Cancer data result: Did you reach to this result at every experiment run? What is the variance due to gradient descent of your approach? * What is the influence of the hyper-parameters m, n, p, q, r?  **Clarity**  The paper is well written and easy to read.  **Significance**  The significance is medium. The original contribution is there, but it seems the application is limited (or at least it was not shown that the method works on more complex models/input data for which such a method is needed most).  **Questions** * Genetic models can build trees of symbolic expressions, your approach seems to be limited to additive meta-models. Is this right? Is this a limitation? * SHAPE also unifies the same branches of the interpretation literature, can you please set this into context?
