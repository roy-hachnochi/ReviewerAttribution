Originality: The paper is innovative. Disease progression modelling is a very timely application, and not many papers that present experimental and clinically meaningful machine learning results exist.   Clarity: The paper is very clearly written. It was my pleasure to read and review it. As complimented above, the authors have excelled in conceptualising a problem, composing it as a machine learning task, and writing and referencing the related report in a way that is meaningful and engaging for both the computer science/engineering and health care/sciences communities. It is very rare to see a paper that delivers so well to such a diverse audience. Also findings are presented and visualised (as Tables and Figures) in a mature, meaningful, and comparative way.   Quality: Although many of the methods are perhaps unsurprising and perhaps not as inspiring to machine learning method developers, they are well justified, compared, and related. The contribution of this paper really is that it puts machine learning into practice in a way that is meaningful to clinicians.  Significance: The authors consider a societally significant problem of modelling disease progression in way that is clinically meaningful by providing actionable insights to inform their clinical judgement and decision-making. It is important that studies of this kind are presented in NeurIPS to attract more people to contribute to this important topic of medical informatics.
