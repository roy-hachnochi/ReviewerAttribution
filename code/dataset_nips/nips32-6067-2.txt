For every mark (#), please refer to the comments of (5. improvements)  * Clarity: The overall contribution of the paper is clear. The theoretical analysis and technical proofs are sound and easy to follow. The structure of Section 3 however could be improved (#1).  * Quality / contribution  The authors followed [BJKS18, Qua19] to write the Kantorovich OT problem as a positive LP problem which is shown to be equivalent to an l1 regression. The l1-linfty duality is then used to write the OT problem as a min-max problem. The dual extrapolation framework yields a bilinear saddle point problem. Adding a strongly convex regularizer (entropy + a term (#2)) allows to use the results of Sherman, 17 to derive the 1/eps convergence.  Writing the OT problem as a positive LP and combining the work of [Sherman, 17] with entropy regularized OT is novel and interesting and could lead to promising subsequent results on regularized OT, besides the O(log(n)/Îµ) complexity (#3) However, (eventhough [Shu17] is carefully cited throughout the paper) since Shu17 already states the O(1/epsilon) convergence of a broader problem, the relative theoretical contribution of the paper should be made more explicit.  Regardless of the obtained results, the empirical comparison is superficial and was not designed to reflect the theoretical findings (the linear convergence rate 1/epsilon vs 1/epsilon^2 for Sinkhorn for instance, nor the dependance on the dimension n). Moreover, the experiment consisted of only one computation of the Wasserstein distance on one single pair of downsampled MNIST images (14x14) which is not conclusive (#4).
