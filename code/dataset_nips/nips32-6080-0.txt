Post-rebuttal: The authors' response addresses my concerns. I don't have any further comments. *********  ORIGINALITY ===========  The question of smoothing logical circuits (negative normal forms) in subquadratic time is regarded as an important open problem in the area of knowledge compilation, and this paper makes progress on it. The approach of representing the problem for structured decomposable circuits as a range sum computation problem is the main novelty of this paper. It is a simple connection but a powerful one, as it lets them use previous work in data structures to improve the running time and to prove a lower bound for smoothing algorithms. The improved algorithm for All-Marginals also uses this connection crucially.   QUALITY =======  The paper is mathematically sound, and the proofs are straightforward to verify.   The experimental section needs to be improved. The experiment in the "Smoothing Circuits" subsection doesn't seem interesting to me. It simply confirms the runtime analysis and is very much expected.  For the "Collapsed Sampling" subsection, it plugs in their algorithm for All-Marginals into an existing algorithm for collapsed sampling. They run the modified code on the "Segmentation-11 network". No details about what the overall problem is or what the Segmentation-11 network looks like is provided. Is it a structured decomposable circuit? Are inputs for the collapsed sampling problem usually structured decomposable?  CLARITY =======  The paper is reasonably well-written, and the paper is nicely organized in terms of sections. It would be better though if the authors spent more time on motivating structured decomposability and why it's important.   SIGNIFICANCE ============  Structured decomposable circuits have been identified as a useful generalization of OBDD's. This work gives nearly optimal smoothing algorithms for them, which has been a longstanding open question for general logical circuits. It also shows that these circuits enjoy a fast algorithm for the all-marginals problem (provided the assumption on the weight function holds true).   As an outsider, I don't know whether structured decomposable circuits are widely used in the community and so, how impactful the new smoothing algorithm will be. However, I like the fact that advances in data structures (though 30 years old!) are being brought to bear on knowledge compilation.
