Originality? This work makes new observations and exploits intimate knowledge of convex optimization unseen in prior work I'm aware of.  Quality? The claims are theoretically justified and experimentally validated in small models.  Clarity? The submission is clearly written and easy to understand.  Significance? This work solves the problem of Lipschitz constant estimation of DNNs in a convincingly superior way to prior work. The output of LipSDP comes with an upper-bound certificate and returns accurate approximations in the proposed experiments. I believe this work adds great insight and advances the SOTA in its area. The primary limitation is that the method currently only applies to small, feed-forward fully-connected networks.
