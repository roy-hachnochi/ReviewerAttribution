The current paper is mathematically well written, but lacks explanations. The results are established using a compilation of techniques from several articles (Kleinberg [15], Audibert and Bubbeck [2], and Garivier et al [11]).  However, even if it seems sound, and can be followed line by line, it sometimes lacks explanations about global intuitions. For example, I believe that the proof of Lemma 1 is not mandatory (and its statement is anyway very technical), and it would be better to focus on global explanations of the methodology.   As an example, Algorithm 2 (MeDZO) is helpful to discretize the continuous interval: it would be good to explain why this algorithm? Why this selection of the parameters p, K_i and Delta T_i is done in that way works?  The horizon T is assumed to be a prior knowledge. This should be stated and commented (if this is indeed the case).  In the current form, the proofs are postponed to very technical statements at the end, but the article would really benefit about shorter sketch proofs, with key ideas and explanations. Why this algorithm, and not another one?  The current audience of this article, in its current form is for a specialized audience, but not for a large audience corresponding to NIPS.
