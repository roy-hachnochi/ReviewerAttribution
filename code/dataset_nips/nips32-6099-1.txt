Originality: The application of the compression and momentum to the parameter server is fairly original. The theorems established could be further adapted to other communication settings, including non-server ones such as binary tree allreduce or ring allreduce.  Quality: Ideas and theorems are thoroughly well-explained. Experiments are done at a reasonable scale, though the number of repeat trials is too small to establish reproducibility, and it would have been nice to see more deep networks and datasets. Overall above average quality, but experiments could be more thorough.  Clarity: The paper was well-written, very clear, and easy to follow.  Significance: As mentioned in my earlier comment about originality, I think this paper lays stepping stones towards analyzing how compression and momentum can benefit communication settings beyond parameter server. High significance.
