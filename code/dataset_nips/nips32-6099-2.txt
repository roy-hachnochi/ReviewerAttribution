The novelty of this paper is limited and some important experiments are missing to support your claim. 1. Some citations of this paper are not proper while some important citations are missing. For example, when you review DNNs' success in different field, why [22] is cited? And you should also cite the following relevant papers: [1] Povey D, Zhang X, Khudanpur S. PARALLEL TRAINING OF DNNS WITH NATURAL GRA-DIENT AND PARAMETER AVERAGING[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.7455, 2014. [2] Chen K, Huo Q. Scalable training of deep learning machines by incremental block training with intra-block parallel optimization and blockwise model-update filtering[C]//2016 ieee international conference on acoustics, speech and signal processing (icassp). IEEE, 2016: 5880-5884. [3] Chen J, Pan X, Monga R, et al. Revisiting distributed synchronous SGD[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.00981, 2016. [4] Chen C Y, Choi J, Brand D, et al. Adacomp: Adaptive residual gradient compression for data-parallel distributed training[C]//Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2018. 2. Is it necessary to compress gradients passed from sever to worker? Since dist-EF-SGD is a synchronous algorithm, all_reduce can be used instead of reduce&broadcast. Leveraging all_reduce operation, every worker can play the role of server, and there is no need to send gradients from server to worker anymore. Have you compared the performance difference of these 2 implementations? 3. Your blockwise compression is based on the claim that "...gradients in a deep network typically have similar magnitudes in each layer". Can you provide experimental evidence of this claim? 4. Dist-EF-BlockSGD should be compared with Dist-EF-SGD to show the effect of blockwise compressor. 5. The introduction of nesterov momentum is one of your claims, but the experimental results show that dist-EF-SGD can benefit little from momentum, can you give an explanation?
