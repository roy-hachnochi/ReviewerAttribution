It's a novel combination of well-known methods.  The submission is technically sound. However, it is not very well written with a clustering of notations and difficult to follow all the equations and algorithms. The paper is not very well organized without conclusion. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the newly introduced datasets. Not sure  it is a fair comparison with the baseline methods as other published methods are not specifically designed for these tasks as well.
