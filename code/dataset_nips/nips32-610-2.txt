1. Originality: The framework proposed by the paper is a novel model (GPN model) based on the prototypical network. The prototype embeddings are refined iteratively through the current presentation and neighboring prototypes from similar tasks using a gating mechanism. The refinement process is similar to the multi-head mechanism but is new and unique.  2. Quality & Clarity: The paper overall has a clear and concise description of the methodology, which is empirically supported by the experimental results.  3. Significance: The paper has compared the proposed GPN model with several state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods including the prototypical net baseline. The evaluation process on ImageNet is reasonable which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method on both closely-related and distant tasks. However, as the data are created by the authors and not released, it may be hard to reproduce the results based on the current information in the submission.  Minors:  1. In Line 173, the authors mention it is possible to use the history prototypes for better training performance for GPN model. I am wondering how this general technique can be applied to and influence other baselines?
