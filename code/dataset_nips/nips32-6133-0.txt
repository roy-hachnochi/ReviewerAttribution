I like the paper, and support to accept it. The major contribution is that the authors define a new measure of stability, which is both necessary and sufficient for generalization. Understanding specialized necessary and sufficient properties for restricted classes of queries and distributions is an interesting direction for future work. Lifting the condition that the mechanisms need to be sample accurate is not covered in the current formalization,  and is an important direction of further research.      Writing style: The paper introduces a lot of notation and jargon, and I found it to be very hard to read. Simplifying the paper in the final version will definitely increase the accessibility and is strongly recommended.   Post feedback: Thanks for the feedback. I am happy that authors would invest time in improving the writing style of the paper. I still support to accept it.
