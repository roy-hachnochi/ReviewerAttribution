This is a technically nontrivial paper about ordinal embedding with novel and interesting results and ideas.  Unlike most of existing work on ordinal embeddings that focus mainly on investingating the number of comparisons required, this paper aims to reduce the computational complexity of calculating the embedding for large numbers of items. As a consequence it does require a larger number of comparisons, but the gains in computational efficiency seem substantial.  The paper is rather dense, and might perhaps benefit from moving some of the techincal description to the appendix and using the resulting space for a more high level overview. (In concrete this could be done by expanding the 1st paragraph of Section 4.) However, even as such the paper reads fairly well.  Minor detail: Should there be a reference to some particular part of the appendix on line 144?
