The techniques are fairly original, the problem is well-motivated and the paper is well-written, thanks to a consistent (though very cumbersome) notation. Apart from some typos (e.g. line 136), I didn't observe major issues in the writeup. I would suggest, however, to give more English descriptions of the mathematical expressions in Section 4, and if possible include some figures (as Figure 1) to explain the algorithm. The result is significant in the sense that I think it will find many applications.
