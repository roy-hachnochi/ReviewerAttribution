The paper focuses on an interesting and useful problem (significance), and it provides a novel theoretical contribution (originality) that seems technically correct (high quality). As mentioned in the previous section, it extends the previous work from (Jaber et al. 2019) in terms of conditional causal effects, providing an algorithm that is sound and conjectured to be complete (the lack of this proof is possibly one of the few negative points of the paper). In terms of clarity, the paper seems quite well-written, although I do wonder if a beginner in causal inference would be able to read it.    Minor details and typos: L65: not sure about the “semantical” framework, possibly rephrase  L121-126: could be improved in terms of clarity, possibly with an example? L272: there existS a potentially causal path
