Originality. This work provides a novel algorithm for sampling from a DPP, showing empirically that it is a fast algorithm and also providing a strong technical analysis.   Quality & clarity. This paper is well-organized and the content is technically solid.   Significance. Algorithms for fast exact sampling from DPPs are of interest to the machine learning community to enforce diversity or to perform batch Bayesian optimization. I think many researchers will be benefited from the contributions of this manuscript.
