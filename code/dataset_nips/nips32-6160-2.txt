This paper studies the problem studying complexity of sampling from of a detrimental point process and proposes efficient algorithms significantly improving state-of-the-art. The paper is very well written. The comment I have is regarding the readability of the paper: may be discussing a use-case and some motivation early in the introduction will make this paper more accessible to a non-expert audience. It may also be useful if the authors discuss other more efficient repulsive point processes based on Poisson Disk Sampling (PDS) methods: 1)Zhang, Cheng, et al. "Active mini-batch sampling using repulsive point processes." arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.02772 (2018). 2)Kailkhura, Bhavya, et al. "A spectral approach for the design of experiments: Design, analysis and algorithms." The Journal of Machine Learning Research 19.1 (2018): 1214-1259.    ************************ Response to the rebuttal****************************   I thank the authors for their rebuttal.  I am happy with the authors’ response on my suggested changes—motivation and citations.  However, I will also encourage authors to include at least one experimental comparison with DPP on the real data.
