Originality  I think this is very original, and is an elegant way of adding the known physical process of image formation to the deep learning setup that GQN proposes. This is a natural yet original extension.  Quality  This submission is high quality. The problem is well presented and explained, the link to epipolar geometry feels very smooth and the way that it is incorporated in the system is clean. This works is self-contained, and well presented.  Clarity  The paper is well written and all the concepts are very clear, I have nothing negative to report on clarity.  Significance  This is quite significant as it proposes a tool that incorporates epipolar geometry to a deep learning architecture, and it applicable beyond the scope of GQN. If the camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known in a multi-view problem such as the one presented in this paper, I do not see a reason why this technique should not be used.
