This paper proposes a new approach to approximating hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) by requiring that at each round, only a gamma-best merge be performed (gamma being the multiplicative approximation factor to the closest pair). Two algorithms are introduced to approximate HAC - one for Ward and one for Average linkage. In both cases, the algorithms rely on using approximate nearest neighbor ANN as a black box. In addition, a bucketing datastructure is used in Wards algorithm and a subsampling procedure in used for Average linkage to guarantee the subquadratic runtime. This is a new contribution to the theoretical literature on HAC, a provable subquadratic algorithm for (an approximation to) HAC cases other than single linkage. The paper demonstrates the performance of Ward’s approximation on real and synthetic datasets.  The paper is well organized. There were parts where clarity could be improved. Specifically, here are some suggestions / typos: -59 fist -> first -95: Meaning of epsilon not clear. E.g. How does epsilon trade off with accuracy. Role of epsilon vs gamma becomes clear later, but it might help to explain this here (or simplify to a single parameter) -223: follows -> can be computed -Parts of section 3.2 seems to overlap  with section 2 - e.g. description of general HAC procedure -Concept of merge value explained twice in sections 2 and 3 - can be combined -272/273 - resolution parameter alpha not defined / introduced, this part is unclear. -Explanation of the average linkage approximation algorithm was hard to follow. Pseudocode would be helpful  Regarding the experimental section, the range of parameter tuning (3 combinations of epsilon, T, and L) does not seem comprehensive. Furthermore choosing a single combination as ‘best’ for evaluating the runtime does not seem fully justified. Finally, the speedup of 2.5X (on n=20K points and d=10) does not seem that impressive.
