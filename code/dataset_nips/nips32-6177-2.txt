The authors present sub-quadratic algorithms for hierarchical clustering. In particular they present an efficient version of the average linkage algorithm and of the Ward algorithm.  The main idea behind the algorithm is to slightly relax the decision principle used by these algorithms in every step and then to show that there exists efficient algorithms for the relaxed version of the problem. Interestingly, the authors also argue(via a reductions to closest pair) that it is unlikely to obtain fast algorithms without relaxing the decision principles.  The main idea behind the algorithm is to use LSH to compute approximate nearest neighbors and to then use LSH to obtain fast algorithm. Unfortunately, LSH cannot be applied directly so the authors carefully design algorithms to obtain good theoretical guarantees. I found the results for average linkage particularly interesting.  Minor comment: - ln. 189 and 191, I found confusing to use i for both indices - I find unmerged cluster a confusing name because the set may contained merged clusters - ln273, where is defined \alpha_{C_1\cup C_2}  - ln.483, 488. It is odd to point to the appendix in the appendix
