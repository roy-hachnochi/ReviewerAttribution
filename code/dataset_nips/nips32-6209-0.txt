The paper presents nested gradient based approaches for zero sum LQ-games (where the system evolves linearly as a function of agents’ actions, and quadratic costs). The authors highlight several challenges associated when using policy optimization (PO) methods for such games such as nonconvexity wrt agents’ policy space which in-turn affects the stability of PO methods. To alleviate this, the authors present nested gradient based approaches which mitigate non-stationarity of learning in such games. The resulting approaches are also shown to have good convergence properties, they converge to the Nash equilibrium.   The authors highlight that several value-based methods exist for solving zero-sum Markov games, similar to the problem setting addressed in the paper. However, empirical section does not seem to contain any comparisons against such value based methods. Such a comparison would highlight what is the benefit of the policy gradient methods developed in the work.   The notion of projection (line 189, Eq4.7) needs better explanation. If the algorithm theoretically requires projection, then one can design instances when not taking the projection would make the approach not converge. The authors’ empirical results are not exhaustive enough to establish that projection is not required for most problem instances. Some discussion, and development of a case where projection is necessary can provide further insight for the approaches.
