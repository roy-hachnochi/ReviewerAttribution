This paper  emphasizes that uniform convergence is inherently problematic for explaining generalizaiton of deep learning, as even the algorithm-dependent application would fail â€“ casting doubt on post-Zhang et al. [31]  algorithm-dependent approaches.  The whole paper is well written and the related results are important.
