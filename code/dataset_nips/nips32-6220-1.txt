This paper proposes a new algorithm for graph structure learning, which has broad applicability to a number of fields. The proposed method seems sound, with potential applicability to non-trivially structured data. At a glance, the chief claims, lemmas, and convergence seem correct. It would be nice if Algorithm 1 and/or Figure 9 from the supplementary material fit in the main body of the paper, but it is understandable if it does not.  Overall, this is a solid paper and I have no real criticisms or concerns - my only wish is that the full supplement could fit in the main body of the paper, which is clearly outside the authors' control! The supplement really adds a lot more context to the main paper. More experiments in the main body of the paper would always be nice, but given the focus of the paper, and the rigorous description of the algorithm and its properties, it is understandable why the experimental section is relatively limited or relegated to the appendix - given the R code is directly included and will be released, it should be straightforward for practitioners to apply this method to their domain of choice. Given the importance of other related methods in practice, I think this paper has potential for high impact in a number of domains.  POST REBUTTAL: The rebuttal is clear, and addresses concerns brought up by one of the other reviewers, while also adding further context and nuance to the work. Thank you to the authors for such clear explanation. My score remains unchanged largely because my original comments still stand - I like this paper, the method proposed seems very useful, and the code release is a huge plus.
