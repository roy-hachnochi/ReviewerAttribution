Originality:  This is the first paper to study the implicit regularization of large learning rate training theoretically and rigorously. Constructing a simple task that can rigorously show that larger learning rate training outperforms small learning rate is highly non-trivial.   Quality and clarity: I did not check the math of this paper. The paper is well-written and the authors spend some efforts to help the readers to gain the intuition behind the paper.    In my opinion, this is a very novel theory paper. I believe many researchers will explore their ideas in depth in the future.     Update: I thank the authors' respond and will keep my score.
