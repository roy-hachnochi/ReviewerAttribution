This paper proposed a learnable kernel-based framework for node classification. To efficiently learn the kernel, the paper proposed a mechanism for node feature aggregation and a data-driven similarity metric employed during the training phase.  The problem and solution are both interesting, however the experiments are conducted on three datasets.  What's the time and space complexity of this method?
