Update: I thank the authors for addressing my comments. I increased my recommendation from 6 to 7 as a result.  Originality: Perhaps the biggest problem with the paper. The point it is making is a good one –– one that needs to be heeded by researchers in the field. But it is not a *new* contribution. The paper seems to ignore previous work on the topic in the statistics literature (Cook, Shadish and Wong 2008; Zhao, Keele and Small 2018... just to name a few). There are a number of references in the statistics literature that make a similar point, with more details.  Clarity: the paper is well generally clear and well written.   Quality: the paper makes good points, but has a somewhat limited scope. In particular, it does not provide any guidance for how to conduct a convincing empirical evaluation. This limits the potential impact of the paper, in my opinion. It would have been great if the authors had dedicated a couple of pages to reviewing some of the methods for empirical evaluation, or case studies of empirical evaluation done right.
