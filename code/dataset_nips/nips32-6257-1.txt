Instead of of the existing work where the error bounds depend on the model dimensionality in analyzing low-precision training problem, the paper proposes a new analysis that is dimension free. This removes the undesired reliance on d in analysis where practical d value could be as large as 10^8. The idea is interesting and potentially it could have good impact. Meanwhile there also a few issues.   *Presentation.  **It could be good to present the main results early as in Table.1 at page two. It however also seems quite out of the place as the notations are used without being defined or introduced at that time. In fact, parameters of Table 1 such as sigma_1 (and T) are otherwise first defined at page 4 (and page 5).   **Some parameters are mentioned without setting down their values. For example values of the parameters kappa and kappa_1 mentioned in Theorem 1 are not defined (at least from what I can see after multiple read). There also lack explanations on why some parameters are necessary in Theorem 1, 2, and 3. For example, sigma_0, sigma_1 and sigma are mentioned in Theorem 1&2 but it is not clear what specific role each plays and why we need these parameters here. There are in fact many parameters introduced in the paper, while there are quite a number of them are either not properly defined or explained.  *Technical development  **The paper is entirely about analyzing the LP-SGD algorithm developed in [17]. It is unclear how the proposed analysis could be suitable for other existing or new low-precision training algorithms, such as [4-7], [15,16, 18, 20, 22, 23].  *Experiments  **Many internal parameters are introduced in the paper. Empirically it is unclear how sensible these parameters are with respect to the possibly broad range of problem settings. for example, In the experiments mentioned in page 8, the parameters L, L1, sigma, and sigma1 are set to 37.41, 685.27, 2.38, 29.11, respectively. Why these specific values here, and what if a different set of values are used here? It would be helpful to discuss and clarify.  Post rebuttal: Thanks for the response and I tend to keep my current rating.
