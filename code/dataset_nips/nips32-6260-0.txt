Originality: the main sources of originality here appear to be Prop 2, as well as the use of properties of the Wasserstein distance to get sharper results (across all the contributions); I have some more comments on this point, later on.  Quality: the quality seems good.  I skimmed the proofs and they made sense.  Clarity: the paper is reasonably well-written; I have some more comments on this point, later on.  Significance: the paper seems like a good step forward in terms of giving concentration inequalities for spectral risk measures.  The main result(s) are not all that surprising, and the math involved behind-the-scenes doesn't appear to be exceptionally difficult, but the results still seem valuable/worthwhile.
