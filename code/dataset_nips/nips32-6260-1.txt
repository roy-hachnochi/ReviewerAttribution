This paper is clearly written and easy to read. However, I have some questions about the contribution of this paper.  I’m wondering why it is a significant problem to evaluate the estimation error by the Wasserstein distance. While the CVaR is a very important measure, it is no clear connection with the characteristics of the Wasserstein distance. The authors just mention “it is interesting to know” (line 38), but it is very insufficient to describe the importance of their goal.  Also, technical contributions seem less. With the known formulation of the CVaR in (6), the bound for the error is obtained by a simple application of the concentration inequality of sub-Gaussian random variables. To improve technical contributions, the authors should investigate theoretical aspects of the error bound such as a convergence rate, adaptivity and so on.  ====== UPDATED AFTER REBUTTAL ====== Thanks to the rebuttal by the authors, I understood that there are some connections between the risk measure and the Wasserstein distance. Thus, I updated my score from 5 to 6. However, I feel that it is not easy task for readers to understand the connection from the main script. Though it is always difficult to describe all in short space of conference papers, I'll be glad if more intuitive description is provided.
