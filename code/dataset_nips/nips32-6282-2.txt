This work aims to resolve the off-policy problem. Authors discussed a variant of value  iteration operator which is induced by a set of constrained policies. They further identified two kinds of errors and showed that a trade-off between them can improve the performance. Finally, they leveraged the intuition to develop a practical algorithm.  Their observation is very interesting and the solution makes sense.  Clarity: the bootstrapping error is a central notion in this work. However, authors didn't give a  definition of bootstrapping error before discussing how to deal with the bootstrapping error in line 127. Though I understood their results through their theorem, I didn't figure out what is bootstrapping error exactly.   Empirical evaluation: the proposed algorithm seems to work well in practice. But two baselines is not very sufficient, which hurts this work somehow.
