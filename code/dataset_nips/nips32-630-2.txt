The authors present a nonparametric model for regressive PP based on GPs, where the GPs are used as a prior model for the intensities of the PP.  My research field is GPs and I am not familiar on PP to fully assess the novelty of this work. However, to the best of my knowledge this work is indeed novel, it connects with sufficient material in the literature to justify itself and provides convincing theoretical analysis and experimental validation. It is a novel, sound and well written work.  I have a couple of suggestions to further improve this work detailed in the next answers
