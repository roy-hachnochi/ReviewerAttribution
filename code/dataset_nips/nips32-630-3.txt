Originality: The work proposed in the paper is original in a way that they propose a GP for modeling PP where the kernel of GP is a function of inter-arrival times instead of the absolute time of the event in the sequence. They further develop a methodology to learn the GP based on latent points in an efficient manner.   Clarity: The paper is well written and easy to follow mostly apart from some discrepancies as suggested below in improvements. Most of the differences from existing work and novelty in the paper are well laid out. Still paper puts a huge burden on the reader to go through a massive amount of supplementary material to fully understand the working of the learning procedure, it is the main contribution and at least be intuitively explained how is it derived. The experiments section clearly explains the parameters used for competitive methods and the proposed methods to the extent that the reader can infer them after looking them in the code provided.
