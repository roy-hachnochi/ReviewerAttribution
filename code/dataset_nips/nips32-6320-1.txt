The paper is very well written; it is clear. The statements proved are useful and move forward a highly active area of research. I cannot comment in depth on originality as I'm not confident I would know of other overlapping work.  The main drawback of the paper is that it is essentially a longer technical project that has been shoehorned into a 10-page paper, with many threads tied to the supplementary material. For example, both of the theorems are left unproven in the paper itself. The paper consistently touts having connected logistic regression to eigenspace overlap, but this connection is made entirely in the supplementary material. I'm not sure of what I would change here, but there is a sense that if I read "the paper" (the 10 page version), then I know "the stuff the paper is about," and this paper + supplementary material is somewhat pushing the boundaries of that distinction for me. At the same time, these are great ideas and fit well in this conference.  I'm including detailed feedback in the improvements section below.
