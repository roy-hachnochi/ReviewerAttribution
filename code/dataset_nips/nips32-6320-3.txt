Originality: The metric is a new take on what creates good generalization bounds. Although in many ways, this paper is a natural generalization on the paper which introduces PIP loss, I think they still prove some novel bounds.  Quality: The quality of the paper is decent. They have provided some theoretical justification for their work. However, the experimental section is rather weak -- the comparison to show downstream embeddings seems to be very narrow. I would have liked to see a broader comparison.  Clairity: The paper is well written with few grammatical mistakes and typos. They have also explained their methodology and experiments clearly and in a manner that will help reproducibility.  Significance: Although, the paper introduces a potentially important idea, it is largely similar to the ideas in the paper on pairwise inner product similarity. Nonetheless, the authors give rigorous justification for their ideas, which is always welcome.
