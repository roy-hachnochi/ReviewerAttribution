This paper is generally well-written and makes an interesting contribution by combining modular meta-learning with GNNs. The key comparison is with Kipf 2018's NRI, and for 1 edge cases their performances are roughly equal, and for 10 edges and for train set size efficiency, this approach is better.   This work is a good next step beyond the Alet modular meta-learning work, and (if I understand correctly) at least 1 of the BounceGrad improvements (learned proposals) would also apply to non-GNN modular meta-learning.
