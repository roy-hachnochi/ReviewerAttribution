After rebuttal: ============================================================ Thank you for responding to all the comments!  I think the rebuttal makes the contributions of the paper more clear, especially emphasizing the importance of learning the proposal function, though I think there is a line of work that also learns how to optimize the loss functions for meta-learning (e.g. [1, 2]). Nevertheless, learning a structured loss function should be insightful enough for the field.  I hope in the future revision, the authors could conduct more thorough experimentations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, e.g. on a more realistic dataset, and restructure the paper in a more organized and clear way.

Before rebuttal: ============================================================ This paper builds neural relational inference upon the modular meta-learning framework, which can capture the dependence among edges instead of modeling different edges independently. Moreover, the method also uses meta-learning to meta-learn a proposal function with self-supervision, which greatly improves the efficiency of the algorithm.  While the paper is novel and tackles the problem that the previous variational neural relation inference doesn't address, the paper is poorly written and hard to understand. The authors fail to provide clear justification of their method in Sec.4 despite an algorithm summary provided in the appendix, which is also a bit hard to grasp without detailed explanation.   Moreover, the experiments are also not entirely convincing. While the edge type prediction accuracy demonstrates that the proposed method is able to classify edges much more accurately than the previous NRI method in the charged particle setting, the authors should provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Section 5.2 is also written in a confusing way with pure text. There is Figure 4 but not referenced anywhere in the paper. The authors should provide more detailed explanations on how they add the new node and how their method compares to the baselines in the unseen node setting.  Overall, this paper shows an interesting combination of NRI and modular meta-learning that leads to effective joint edge inference but lacks clarity and enough experimental support.
