The paper feels a bit unprincipled. It combines three ideas. But how general these ideas are beyond RPMs is unclear to me. For example, perceptual inference usually means something rather different outside of RPMs. I read the paper a few times, mostly coming from the cognitive and DL field and it just did not feel overly enlightening. I am a bit unclear to which level RPM meaningfully can be described as reasoning with pictures. Above all, the solution produced by the authors does not feel like it has much of a reasoning flavor.
