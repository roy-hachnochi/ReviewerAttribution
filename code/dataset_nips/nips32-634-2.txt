This paper was a pleasure to read and I very much recommend acceptance.  Orginality: The work is original.  It contributes a novel model which takes a ranking rather than classification perspective on the problem; a nice derivation of a NCE-loss variant; and permutation-invariance.  It compares to the related work e.g WReN.  Quality: The technical exposition is excellent and clear. I didn't see any issues.  Clarity: Very well-written and enjoyable to read.  I particularly appreciated that they author's presented their model (e.g. the object-level contrastive module) somewhat narratively, describing what they tried and why it didn't work and had to be adjusted in various ways.    Significance: Pushes the envelope on this kind of analogical reasoning so a very strong contribution.
