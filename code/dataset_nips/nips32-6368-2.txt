The paper considers adversarial robustness for models with random noises added, and provides some theoretical insights to understand the improvement in robustness under this setting. The main theorem in this paper basically says that: if the output of a deterministic function f(.) can be bounded by \Delta when the input is perturbed within a ball of radius \alpha, the Renyi divergence (a generalized K-L divergence) of the output of the network, plus some exponential family noise, are epsilon-close even under perturbation. In the Gaussian noise setting, robustness is in proportion to the minimum singular value of the covariance matrix of Gaussian distribution, which makes sense. The authors also conduct experiments using different noise distributions in exponential family.  Several questions:  1. The authors defined d_p(y)-(\alpha,\epsilon,\gamma) robustness in a probabilistic manner.  However it seems the main theorem actually gives a deterministic bound (the probability \gamma = 0).  Is it possible to improve the main theorem to a probabilistic version, and uncover the relationship between gamma and epsilon?  2. The theoretical lower bound on accuracy under attack of Theorem 2 needs the entropy term. It can be estimated using a Monte Carlo method however there is no guarantee that the sampled entropy is close to the true entropy, thus there is no real guarantee here. The derived bound thus cannot give any provable robustness certificate for a given network.   Overall, this is a good paper that proposes something promising to explain the robustness improvements from randomization. I recommend to accept this paper, however the authors should make sure to address the issues above.  *************** After reading the rebuttal, my first question has been addressed. However I still have concerns with the sampling method to obtain the entropy - although theoretically it is asymptotically converging but it might need a large amount of examples, especially the experiments were done using only a few samples. Overall, I am okay to recommend accepting the paper, but this paper certainly has some limitations and still has room for improvement.
