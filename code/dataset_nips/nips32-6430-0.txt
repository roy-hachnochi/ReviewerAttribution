The paper presents a Bayesian framework for causal inference in observational studies, in the potential outcomes setup. When studying the average treatment effects, results based on Gaussian process priors may be biased and the paper proposes a correction.   I have the impression that the paper does not pursue a fully Bayesian approach since \pi does not seem to be estimated and its prior distribution is never defined. In particular, contrary to a standard Bayesian approach, it is separately estimated and its estimate is plugged-in the estimation procedure for m(x,r). A comparison with a fully Bayesian approach is missing.   The bias the authors want to correct is said to exist, but neither a reference nor an analytical prove is given.   I think one of the advantages of this approach with respect to a fully Bayesian approach is computational efficiency. A comparison of the computational times would be useful to compare the methods in the simulated and semi-simulated examples.   A description of the organisation of the paper is missing at the end of the Introduction.   Table 1: I am a bit surprised that the coverage of the proposed method is larger than other methods, but the size is similar of the credible intervals is smaller than other methods with low absolute error: the credible interval coverage should be similar to the frequentist level (since the credible intervals are of level 0.95, the coverage should be around 0.95), a larger coverage should mean larger intervals. I think a better explanation of the Table is needed.   Line 103: saying that f, \pi, and m are independent under the posterior is imprecise, because they are conditionally independent (for example, they all depend on X).   Line 106: since the posterior distribution on \psi depends on the full posterior distribution, which, I believe, is approximated by using full conditionals, I think you still need to define a prior for \pi, as it is also shown by Equation (4).
