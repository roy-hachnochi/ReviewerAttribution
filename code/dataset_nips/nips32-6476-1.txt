Originality: This paper develops asymptotics theory for high-dimensional regularized logistic regression (LR). The paper meaningfully generalizes the work in [1] from unregularized LR to regularized (any separable f). The main result of the paper (Theorem 1) is proved for any locally-Lipschitz function \Psi which then in special cases provides asymptotics for common descriptive statistics like correlation, variance, mean-squared error. Special case results for L1 and L2 regularized LR are also derived and quantities highlighted in 1 above are derived. The paper also demonstrates that the numerical simulation results align with the theoretical relations.  Quality: The paper contains high quality results and proofs, the notation and setup is well defined in section 2 before the main results. The proofs are well organized except for the proof in section 6.2 where (a) the paper appeals to [2] on multiple occasions including an instance of flipping order of min-max; (b) the paper defines series of new variables and corresponding Lagrange multipliers where it is hard to keep track and the rationale is not clear -- both of these can be explained better.   Clarity: The paper is very well written and theorems, lemmas and corollaries are clearly stated and explained. However, the paper can be improved by providing intuition at couple of places. For example, (a) when the 6 nonlinear equations are defined, it is not clear what to make of any of those quantities (\alpha, \sigma, \gamma, \theta, \tau, r) and where the come from; (b) the convergence of numerical method although mentioned in Remark 2, does not provide any intuition on why it works or cases when it does not work.   This relates to lines 508-509 where a discussion/insight on whether a solution for (67) always exist? When can the solution be at the boundary where \alpha, v, r, or \tau = 0?  Significance: The generalized result as well as special cases of L1/L2 described in the paper are significant in extending the theory to regularized LR which is widely used in practice without understanding the new theory for high-dimensions as pointed in [1].
