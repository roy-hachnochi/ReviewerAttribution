The paper is well structured in presenting the results in a clear way. The results presented are novel. Some questions for clarifications below:  1. Is there an interpretation of the optimal lambda to that of the model parameters and the regularizer chosen ?  2. Any comments on the assumption of the uniqueness of the solutions for (6), which are being used for Theorem 1?  3. Do the results extend to the settings where the data X has correlated predictors ?  Possible typo: Theorem 1, line 156. Possible typo (Should have been \beta \in \Pi) ?
