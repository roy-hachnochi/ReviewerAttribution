The main idea of the proposed model is to introduce an intermediate feature space between the image space and the latent space. The image and feature spaces are linked by an intervertible neural network. The authors formulate the ELBO of a VAE between the latent and the feature space, and forward it to the image space using the change of variable formula. By considering the expected posterior in the feature space, the resulting architecture allows efficient sampling, which permits to add an adversarial loss in the image space.  - Originality and significance: This paper is novel and impactful. Bridging the gap between GANs and density modelling networks and taking the best of both worlds is an important contribution. - Clarity: Writing is very good and clear. - Quality: The paper clearly demonstrates the importance of its proposition. Ablation experiments and comparison with other networks on multiple datasets are compelling. In particular, both the Inception Score and Fr√©chet distance are at least as good as the state-of-the-art on all tasks, up to a slightly larger bits per dimension score.
