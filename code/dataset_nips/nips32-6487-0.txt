This work investigates combinatorial bandits (where actions are a subset of the corners of the boolean hypercube) both in the nonstochastic and stochastic settings, where actions are assumed to have exactly k bits equal to 1. In the nonstochastic setting, the lower bound recently proved by Cohen et al. is improved on by removing a spurious 1/sqrt{log T} factor, thus obtaining a tight regret bound of order sqrt{k^3dT}. This is achieved by generating correlated binary loss vectors, in contract to the approach followed by Cohen et al. in which correlated Gaussian losses were used. In the stochastic setting, the authors prove an upper bound of sqrt{k^2dT} (excluding log factors) for the case of losses with independent components in [0,1].  The paper is well written and the technical parts are generally clear. The trick used to shave the 1/sqrt{log T} factor is simple and elegant. The techniques of Cohen et al. are extended to handle sums of correlated binary random variables. The upper bound for the stochastic case appears to be a simple extension of Lattimore and Szepesvari.   The contribution is solid and technically sound. However, its significance is unclear because neither the results nor the techniques are particularly surprising in the context of previous works.  AFTER AUTHOR FEEDBACK I appreciated the feedback provided by the authors to my comments. However, I will stand by my score which I think is the most appropriate in the context of NeurIPS.
