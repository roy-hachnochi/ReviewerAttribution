The paper has several new results on bandit combinatorial optimization. There are a few different ideas, but the main unifying theme is a new construction of hard instances for bandit combinatorial optimization. Mainly the paper is refining the results of Cohen, Hazan, and Koren (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.07539.pdf).  First, this construction is used to refine a previous lower bound of Cohen, Hazan, and Koren for general bandit combinatorial optimization which used Gaussian noise to construct a hard instance. The authors turn it into a binary {0,1} distribution. This allows the authors to save a sqrt(log(T)) factor in the general bandit combinatorial optimization problem, since Gaussian noise must be divided by a logarithmic factor to almost surely stay bounded. The resulting lower bound is tight up to a T-independent log(d/k) factor for general bandit combinatorial optimization.    The authors also prove that bandit combinatorial optimization becomes easier by a factor of sqrt(k) - for k the number of arms picked per round - with independent arms. The main point is to construct a distribution over actions ensuring a low variance observation whenever the losses of the coordinates are independent. This can be done by a direct use of the Kiefer-Wolfowitz theorem.  Finally, there is an improved lower bound for online max matching in the symmetric K_{n,n} case. The previous Alon/Hazan/Koren work gave a lower bound which applied for K_{n,k} with k<n/2 but there was a gap for k=n. This paper gives a simple modification which works when k=n.   The results of the paper are essentially small refinements of previous work, but achieving these refinements required some nice ideas. Bandit combinatorial optimization is a basic problem so figuring out how to remove a sqrt(log(T)) is great to do. The distribution used to remove this factor is clever and can probably be used to refine lower bounds for similar high-dimensional bandit problems; the authors mention that this is the case for bandit PCA. The other two results seemed easier in my opinion but are definitely solid contributions.  I think the writing could be improved. In particular, I found reading this paper confusing because there were several different results, and the introduction kept skipping between results and proof ideas/intuition and descriptions of new problems and so on. I think for this paper it might be better to first clearly list out all the problem types that will be considered, then list out all the new results, and then finally say a bit of proof summary/preview. To me at least, it seemed like all the results were of about equal importance and rather similar in flavor, so it makes sense to present them in parallel.     A couple small things I noticed:  Theorem 2 says "mutiple" The definition of \hat{\ell} isn't really given, it's just implicit that \hat{\ell} corresponds to \hat{a}. Better to be explicit.    =========   Thanks for the authors for their response. My score for this paper did not change.
