The paper deals with the problem of counting the number of optimal solutions in weighted CSPs. In order to solve it without requiring to enumerate these solutions, they map the cost functions into pairs (cost,count) and therefore reformulate the optimization problem within Semiring (R^2,x,+). They show how to adapt bucket elimination and AND/OR Branch and Bound to this semiring. Finally, some experiments highlight the effectiveness of the method.  Although optimization in semirings is not novel and the formulation provided by the authors is not very surprising, the methodology is interesting by itself. The experiments are convincing on the set of algorithms compared. However, there exist in the literature other methods whose purpose is specifically to count models, e.g., the weighted model counting algorithm used by Chavira and Darwiche, but also sum-product networks in which MPE-like queries can be computed efficiently. Why don't the authors compare their algorithms against them in the experimental section?
