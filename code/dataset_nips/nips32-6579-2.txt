The core contribution of this paper is the discrete coupling layer for discrete variables. This layer can be seen as a variant of the continuous coupling layer in Real NVP or Glow. That is, they are designed in a similar way that splitting the input into two parts, and using the first part to generate parameters for the second part. The main difference is that the discrete coupling layer uses the rounding operation to round the bias. The paper designs a discrete flow model based on the proposed discrete coupling layer. The model uses DLogistic as the distribution for latent code. The paper uses the proposed discrete normalizing flow to do lossless compression, and outperforms the current methods.  Pros: 1. The paper is well written and easy to follow. 2. The proposed discrete coupling layer is useful for discrete variables. 3. The application is new, since the previous flow models are all applied to generate synthetic images. 4. The experiments are good and prove the ability of the model to do lossless compression.  Cons: 1. I don’t quite understand why we should split the input to 75-25 parts. It seems that it is just arbitrarily set, so I think it needs to be discussed more, or some empirical results to prove it.  2. I think a better way to compare the proposed model with other flow models, e.g. Glow, is to compare the generated samples, and use larger images, e.g., 64x64, 96x96 or 128x128. The images in Figure 7 are so small that cannot prove the model’s ability of image generation. With only the NLL on small datasets, it is hard to say that the discrete flow performs as well as the state-of-the-art continuous flows, e.g., Flow++ and Glow. 3. Maybe I missed something. To generalize the discrete flow to continuous flow, I think we need to compute the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, but I did not see the authors mention it.  ================================= I have read the authors' responses and the other reviewers' comments. I did not change my score. The reasons are as below. 1. The authors did not answer my question about why we need to split the variable to 75-25. 2. The authors did not provide an example of 64x64 generated image in the author responses. So I am not quite sure how good the generated images can be.  3. Overall, it is a good paper, and I tend to accept it.
