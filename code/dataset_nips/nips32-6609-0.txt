This paper proposes, based on a theoretical analysis of a simple statistical setting, two strategies for improving adversarial generalization via unlabeled data. The method presented, UAT++, attempts to combine these two strategies and improves adversarial generalization significantly using only additional unlabeled data.  Overall, the paper is well-written, easy to follow, and has solid yet simple theoretical grounding. The experimental analysis is thorough and all confounding factors (e.g. network architecture) are correctly ablated. The paper compares to a variety of state-of-the-art methods to prove that unsupervised data can indeed improve adversarial robustness.  The paper could be improved by addressing what happens to UAT-OT in the Gaussian setting of Schmidt et al (either via a Theorem or intuitive explanation, or even an explanation of why the algorithm is harder to analyze). It would also be interesting to see whether the same algorithm can also improve L2 robustness (one would guess so, but if the phenomenon is limited to l-infinity this would be independently interesting).  Minor comments: - [1] and [2] are the same citation - The graphs are somewhat hard to read (e.g. the red is hard to tell apart from the orange after printing, and the violet lines are rather faint). Using a different colorscheme/formatting would improve the readability.
