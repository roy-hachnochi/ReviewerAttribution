Minor comment: -Probably a naive comment -- In (7), there may be some trivial \Theta, (say \Theta=0 in some settings) which enforce all f_\Theta(y) to be equal so that all the data points will be assigned to one cluster. In practice, a random initialization of \Theta and an iterative gradient algorithm may result in a reasonably good \Theta, but the problem in (7) is not what is being solved?  -In experiments, is it possible to include a tweaked version of [59] as another baseline?
