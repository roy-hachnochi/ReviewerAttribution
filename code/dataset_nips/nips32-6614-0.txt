Originality:  The paper proceeds in a direction somewhat orthogonal to recent literature in the area, by swapping out the full-planning strategy for a one-step greedy strategy. As such, it opens up potential new research approaches along with providing an improvement on the SOTA.  Quality:  The argument is well-developed, and extensive proofs are provided in the supplementary materials or referenced in existing literature. The greedy approach is directly applied to two existing SOTA full-planning-based algorithms, suggesting it is a generalizable alternative.   Clarity:  The paper is generally well-organized and clear; the paper gives an intuitive sense of the results, although the bulk of the proofs are confined to the supplementary material. Several scattered clarity issues are described in the detailed comments below.  Significance:  The paper provides both a direct theoretical contribution to the field of regret analysis. More generally, challenging the assumed supremacy of full-planning-based approaches may have ripple-on effects beyond the specific problem domain (tabular finite-horizon undiscounted MDPs).   Detailed comments:  Abstract: I think it's important to point out that the results apply to undiscounted MDPs.  Table 1: Why is the Regret bound for UCLR2 listed in terms of the horizon H and not the diameter D, as in the original paper?  Line 124: It's unclear here what is former and what is latter; I would state "since \bar{V}^{k-1}(s_1^k) >= V*(s_1^k) >= V_1^{\pi_k}(s_1^k)".  Line 212 and Algorithm 2: Algorithm 5 in the supplementary materials requires updating the lower bound variables after action selection, and therefore seemingly can't be used as a drop-in replacement for ModelBaseOptimisticQ as suggested. Ideally Algorithm 2 should include an additional line to be fully general to both UCRL2 and EULER, or it should at least be mentioned in a footnote.  Line 263: Prioritized sweeping, particularly prioritized sweeping with small backups (van Seijen & Sutton 2013) should be referenced as a highly efficient full-planning approach.
