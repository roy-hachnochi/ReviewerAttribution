The paper presents an original and novel contribution that is of interest to the field. However, the paper is not very accessible and makes little effort to summaries the found results in an intuitive manner and why the results are true. For the NeurIPS audience, the writing of the paper should put far more emphasis on building intuitive examples that explain the theoretical findings, rather than just stating them. Including a proof sketch into the main body of the paper does not help the overall presentation.  In Sec. 4, why are the model-based algorithms optimistic (as stated in lines 177)? According to my understanding, Alg. 2 builds an approximate model (rhat_k, phat_k,...). Couldn’t approximation errors bias the model so that the algorithm is not strictly optimistic? Regarding Lemma 1 and line 109: Isn’t lemma 1 a re-statement of the proof presented at this link: https://m.tau.ac.il/~mansour/rl-course/scribe6/node4.html
