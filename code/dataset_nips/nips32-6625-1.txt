There are some related works on preference-based or interactive multiobjective optimization. The novelty of the work is not very high. From my point of view, the main algorithm in Section 4 is not clearly presented. To access the preference-based approaches, the measurements are quite important. However, this issue is very subjective. The paper did not discuss this issue. Therefore, it is hard to judge whether the found solutions are good or not.
