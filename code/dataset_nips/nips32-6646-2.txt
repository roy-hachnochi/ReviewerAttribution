This paper studies the practical algorithm that computes alpha-ranking for a pool of agents in MARL. The setting is broad, covering multiplayer general-sum game, while Elo-score only intends for two-player and cannot deal with intransitive agents. The proposed algorithm is based on graph bandit, which is useful when it is intractable to construct a full payoff matrix based on empirical game outcomes. The proposed algorithm would lead to an efficient way to leverage the game outcomes and assign the computation budget for what games should be carried out. Finally, it is beyond a pure evaluation method, in the sense that any MARL based on player-pool-sampling can potentially benefit from the proposed algorithm.
