This paper describes a family of optimal transport metrics that are efficiently computable. In particular, these are 1-Wasserstein distances in which the ground metric is tree-structured. The paper gives a closed form for the distance whose computation scales as the number of edges in the tree. Several facts about this family of OT metrics are presented, including negative definiteness. Empirical results investigate a "tree-slicing" scheme, in which multiple trees are constructed and the resulting distances are averaged, showing favorable tradeoffs between computational cost and performance in several statistical tasks.  Overall I like this paper and believe it should be accepted.  Strengths: 1. The paper is written fairly clearly and is easy enough to understand. 2. It is a nice idea, exploiting tree structure in the ground metric, and yields an efficient algorithm. 3. The empirical results in Section 6 demonstrate the utility of tree-slicing.  Weaknesses: 1. It appears in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 that the tree-sliced Wasserstein distance outperforms the original optimal transport distance, which is surprising. Could you explain why this occurs? 2. The proof in the main text of Proposition 1 looks more like a proof sketch, particularly as the existence of a function f having the property you claim isn't immediately obvious. Could you include (in the supplement, at least) the full proof?  ---  UPDATE: I have read and I appreciate the authors' response. I will not be changing my score.
