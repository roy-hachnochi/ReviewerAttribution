Originality: As far as I know, calibration by modeling parameters in the Dirichlet distribution is novel. The authors also provide very useful analysis of its properties (e.g. equivalence of different parameterizations) and in relation to other calibration families.  Quality: The work is solid and convincing. The authors evaluate their calibration algorithm in many different settings in comparison to other algorithms. One aspect that could be improved upon is the evaluation of matrix scaling. Using ODIR, the authors show that matrix scaling can be as effective as vector scaling (and better than temperature scaling) in many settings. However, with sufficiently high regularization strength, off-diagonal values in the matrix could be reduced to 0 and the method becomes identical to vector scaling. Indeed, in Tables 3 and 4, their performance appear to be very similar in all settings. This would contradict the claim the authors make about matrix scaling being effective despite its large number of parameters.  Clarity: The paper is well-written and clearly presented, and is in general a smooth read. One minor issue: the average rank in Tables 3 and 4 appear identical. Is this correct?  Significance: The topic of multi-class calibration is certainly significant and the authors make an important step towards defining and solving this problem. I can foresee several follow-up papers that expand and improve upon this work.
