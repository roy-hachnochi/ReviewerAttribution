This paper has no major flaw. The main reason I don't vouch for this paper's acceptance is because the method seems limited in both practical usefulness and enlightenment to the reader. It is yet another family of calibration maps, slightly more involved than the simple alternatives of, say, matrix and vector scaling. From reading the exposition and the empirical evaluations, if I wanted to calibrate my models on a new dataset, I'm not sure I would want to switch to this new method. The interpretations seem rather difficult and not clearly beneficial.  I appreciate how the authors are quite upfront about these shortcomings. There are some enlightening small pieces worthy of a wider audience in the paper; for example, how temperature scaling fails at multi-class calibration (figure 1). The regularization method also seems clearly beneficial.  Overall, I think this paper is borderline, interesting but somewhat incremental.
