This paper studied the robustness verification problem for tree-based model. Although formal robustness verification is NP-complete, they give a more precise complexity characterization. For general problems, by exploiting the boxicity of the graph, they develop an efficient multi-level verification algorithm. The idea is novel and interesting. The proposed algorithm can give tight lower bounds on robustness of decision tree ensembles, while allowing iterative improvement and any-time termination. Experiments on 10 datasets show the superior performance of the proposed method. This paper is well written and easy to follow.
