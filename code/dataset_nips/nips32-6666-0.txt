The paper is clear and well-written. Appendix and provided video are also quite helpful to obtain a better understanding of this work. The attention mechanism idea is not quite novel but its usage (considering the modification) in the RL domain is interesting and novel. In my view, Interpretability is the most important aspect of this work. Presentation and the depth of the analyses make this work a good submission and candidate for acceptance.
