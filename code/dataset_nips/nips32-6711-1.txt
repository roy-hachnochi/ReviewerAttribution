This paper has an interesting algorithmic idea and the properties related to such an algorithm is well investigated. This idea and algorithm should be interesting to the readers. The paper is well written and easy to follow. My main concern of this paper is that it is missing experimental results. As a paper with algorithm invention as its core contribution, I believe experimental results should be crucial to demonstrate the possible future impact and would be important for many readers to understand and follow the work. Any result should be very helpful.
