***AFTER REBUTTAL*** After reading the response from the authors and the other reviewers' comments, I increase my score from 7 to 8. ***END OF COMMENT***   SUMMARY: The paper proposes an online stochastic learning algorithm to solve the non-convex problem of PCA. The proposed approach employs Krasulina’s method, which is generalised from vector to matrix representation. The idea is to demonstrate that the generalised Krasulina’s method is a stochastic gradient descent with a self-regulated gradient that can be tailored to solve the PCA problem. In addition to presenting a new application for Krasulina’s method, convergence rates are derived for low-rank and full-rank data. The derivation of the exponential convergence rate for low-rank data, in theorem 1, highlights that the convergence rate is actually affected by the intrinsic dimension, or number of components, and not by the dimensionality of the data.   ORIGINALITY: The proposed method combines and tailors an old technique for a new purpose. It advances the research on online learning solutions to the PCA problem in the sense that the state-of-the-art approach, that combines the classic Oja’s method with a variance reduction step, is not an online algorithm because it requires a full pass over the dataset. The previous work in this field is well-referenced and accurately presented.   QUALITY: The theoretical presentation is complete and justified with proofs. The empirical evaluation is performed in terms of a simulation study and two real-world experiments. In the real-world data experiments, the proposed algorithm is evaluated against the variance reduction augmented Oja’s method. In the simulation study, theorem 1 is shown to hold in practice. In the real-world experiments, the proposed approach is shown to converge faster before the competing method reaches a full pass.   CLARITY: The paper is clearly written and well-organised. The results can probably be reproduced with the help of the pseudocode.   SIGNIFICANCE: For practitioners working with large datasets, the presented method can be useful to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
