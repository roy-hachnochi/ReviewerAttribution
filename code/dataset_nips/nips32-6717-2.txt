Novelty over [8,10] is limited. They too use a single backbone to learn a detector and descriptor which influence each other. Losses for repeatability and reliability are interesting, though. In balance, those are sufficient advances for the paper to add to our knowledge of keypoint detection and description.  The "peakiness over patches" objective in Sec 3.1 is reminiscent of bucketing in SFM, where it has empirically been known to ensure a good distribution of keypoints for accurate pose estimation (for example, see "Visual odometry" by Nister, or ORB-SLAM). There might be a connection to explore here, or to state in a discussion.  In Fig 2, use “confidence”, not “confidency”.  Perhaps notation clarity: S’_U is the saliency map in I’ warped by the inverse of U.  A dense descriptor is leaned by [6] using contrastive loss, not triplet loss as stated in Sec 3.2.
