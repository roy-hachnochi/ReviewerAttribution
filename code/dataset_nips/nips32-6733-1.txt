The paper studies two open questions in the PML framework - approximately calculating the PML and showing the optimally of PML based estimation for a larger accuracy range - epsilon.   For the problem of support estimation, it is shown that an approximate PML is sample optimal in the entire range of epsilon. For the problem of entropy and distance to uniformity, the authors devise a new generalization of PML, called the Pseudo PML. They do so by defining the S-pseudo profile, using the S-PML estimate for the 'light' elements and the empirical estimate for the 'heavy' elements. Using this, they derive sample optimal rates for these problems in the entire range of epsilon.  The results are interesting and resolves some intriguing open questions in [ADOS16]. Pseudo PML is a natural extension of PML and I find the general framework of Algorithm 1 elegant and right in principle.  I'm overall satisfied with the writing of the paper, and the authors provide a good sketch of their proofs. I'm also satisfied with the citations of relevant work. I think the paper is interesting and vote to accept the paper.  Post Rebuttal: While the authors have addressed some of my concerns, I'm maintaining my score. The authors have to adequately address how PseudoPML is efficiency computable. At least some experimental evaluations that suggest that it is possible to do so.
