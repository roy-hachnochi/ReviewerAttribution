The paper deals with distribution learning for a spatial field in the context of mobile sensors but location-unaware. As far as I understand, the paper resorts to the standard empirical cumulative density function as a tool for learning.   The paper seems technically sound and clearly written.   The empirical cumulative density is an usual estimate of the distribution. The paper proposes a specific study of its properties in the considered context. To this end the inter-sample intervals are modeled as a renewal process. It could be interesting to explain why this model is a realistic one.   I must add that I am not able to check the proof because they are out of the scope of my research.   Regarding the experimental study of Section 5, it is correctly described but the analysis ans comment lines 210-211 must be developed.
