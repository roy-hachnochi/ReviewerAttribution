UPDATE: Thank you for the thoughtful response, those changes should improve the things that were unclear to me.  There is a rich recent literature on identification criteria for linear structural causal models, but most of the recently proposed criteria largely ignore the question of efficient computability. This paper answers important questions in this area by given efficient algorithms for some criteria, while showing others to be NP-complete. The paper is original and generally clear and of high quality.  Minor comments: l100: double "a" l104: the equation you refer to is in the supplement, which should be mentioned here. There should also be a general mention in the main paper informing readers about the supplement. Figure 2a: some labels are right between two nodes, making it hard to see which they belong to. Definition 3.1: "for each s_i ... are in the set T_j" is extremely hard to parse. I suggest: "any path from s_i \in S_f to t \in T \setminus T_f has an intermediate node in S_F \cup T" l149: You didn't mention yet what "this problem" is; I believe it is finding a maximal match-blocking? (Where "maximal" is inclusionwise?) Theorem 3.1: Also hard to read, in particular the precedence of the "... and ... or ..." at the end is ambiguous. Maybe the "there exists ... and ..." could be rewritten to "for all ... such that ..., we have ..."? Algorithm 1: After the while loop, T will contain only nodes that participate in the flow, while S may not (e.g. for the graph s_1 -> t <- s_2). So the line after the while loop should modify S, not T. (BTW, these match-blocks seem related to the Edmond-Gallai decomposition, though I believe that is defined for undirected graphs. You might want to check if you can find literature for a more efficient algorithm, or theoretical results. For example, I would guess that all maximal match-blocks have the same T, and so as a corollary, all maximal match-blocks are maximum.) Supplement l445: period missing
