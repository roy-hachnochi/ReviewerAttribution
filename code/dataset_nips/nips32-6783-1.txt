Originality: the approach is original and interesting. The related work is cited adequately.   Quality: theoretical part seems sound but the experimental part has some flaws and can and should be improved.   Clarity: paper is well written and easy to understand  Significance: there is no doubt of the importance of work, e.g if authors actually demonstrated that they indeed lean multi-sense embeddings, that would be very useful. But given current state of experimentation it is unclear if the technique actually works the way authors claim.
