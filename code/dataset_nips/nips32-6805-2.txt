This work  showed a way to bound the gap between performances of a policy on a learned model and the true model. It furthur showed how to leverage this bound to develop a practical model based algorithm.   It is a very interesting work. The solution makes sense and the empirical evaluation is sufficient.  weakness: this work relies on the bound in Eq. (1). However, this work doesn't discuss how tight is this bound. If the bound is not tight, how to improve it? If the bound is tight, why? I think the authors should provide more insights into the bound.
