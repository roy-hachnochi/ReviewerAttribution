The paper proposes a constraint-based method for selecting causal features for a given target variable in an neuroimaging context.   Theoretical results are provided which result in an algorithm that requires only one independence test with one conditioning variable per possible causal feature and a weaker notion of faithfulness.  Empirical results on simulated data show low false positive rates and relatively low false negatives for small to medium numbers of variables. Empirical results on real data area encouraging.  In general the paper is well written though the section on empirical results on real data could be improved to be more clear.  The method presented is novel and sound.  This may be significant as causal discovery from neuroimaging data is currently a popular area of study. However, it is somewhat difficult to determine how strong these results are since they are not compared to any baseline.  It would be helpful if the paper spoke more about the fact that the conditions are only sufficient, but not necessary and the likely degree to which it may fail to identify causes (either characterize this theoretically or show empirically).  The false negative rates do not appear to converge in the simulations. It would be interesting to know if they do (eventually) if the samples are increased or if this is a result of the fact that the method fails to identify some causes and the degree to which this increases with n.
