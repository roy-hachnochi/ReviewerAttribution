My main concern for the paper was the lack of comparison with other methods. The authors explained in their response that the reason was that the dataset was collected anew, and they are going to release the data. The conclusion drew from the analysis is in accordance with the general consensus on the neuroscience problem, which serves as a weak validation of the method. One reviewer does point out that the authors made some efforts to compare their methods with existing Lasso variants on synthetic datasets. Thus I am inclined to raise my score to a weak accept  It will be great if the authors can be more clear on the advantages of their methods, comparing to other methods. In my opinion, I think it is better explained in the response than in the paper.    ---------------------Before Rebuttal---------  This paper presents a series of simplifying assumptions for causal inference and proves that only a single conditional independence test per candidate cause is required in such a regime.    However, it is not very clear how the assumptions required for the algorithms are relaxed compared to existing algorithms -- only causal sufficiency is removed and only the PC method requires this assumption.  The major drawbacks of this paper are due to the lack of comparison with existing methods. Itâ€™s not very clear whether under the constrained conditions if other methods are applicable.  In Figure 2, it appears that the large number of false negatives are okay, however this would only make sense if the method was only designed to capture direct causes. However, the method should capture both. It would be nice to see an explanation of why these false negatives appear.  Figure 1 is rather small, but important for understanding the type of DAGs assumed by this method. It should be made larger.
