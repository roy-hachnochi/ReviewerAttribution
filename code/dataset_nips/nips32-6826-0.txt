To the best of my knowledge the idea of using either the Riemannian normal or the wrapped normal in a VAE is new and worth of attention. The paper is excellently written and very clear.   1) Line 48: "We show that a VAE endowed with a hyperbolic latent space will be more capable at representing and discovering hierarchies than traditional VAEs that use a Euclidean latent space". While I do understand what you mean I feel like this line is a bit misleading. It is true that your VAE samples from a hyperbolic space and that a standard VAE samples in a euclidean space but there is no guarantee that the resulting latent spaces are respectively hyperbolic or euclidean. Would it be possible to change this sentence?  2) In table 1 you measure the negative test marginal likehood with L_IWAE. But you never define what L_IWAE is. Could you define it properly?  3) Could you move figure 5? It is refereed a whole page after been introduced and it is a bit confusing. You cite figure 6 before 5 in the text.  4) Line 183: "Derived earlier in Eq 8 and 11". The derivation is in the appendix, could you change this line to make it more clear? It is a bit confusing right now.  To summarise, this is an excellent paper that introduces a theoretically sound modification of the standard VAE and achieves state of the art results on a series of baselines.   --------------------------------------------------------------  Post rebuttal:  The authors agreed about fixing my main complain therefore I will maintain my overall score and argue for acceptance.
