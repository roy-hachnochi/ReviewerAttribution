 The paper extends Catalyst approach for general stochastic optimization. The paper is very well written and easy to follow. The authors are aware of relevant literature and are citing appropriate papers. Although I did not go through all proofs, the obtained results are believable and reasonable.     Experiments -- it is not clear how the dropout is exactly used -- do you see the objective as one layer NN and use dropout on top of it just in order to have a stochastic objective? Is there some evidence that dropout helps for such shallow models in terms of generalization?  Personally, I would appreciate explicitly stating what is h_k/H_k in the considered special cases (this partially overlaps with the latter point) somewhere in the appendix. Now, the reader has to guess for example what is the setting in the table from sec. 4.2 and why SGD is faster than SVRG/SAGA/MISO (I guess the reason is that the variance reduced methods assume general each f_i to be an expectation with the same bound on variance as the SGD objective).      Lastly, the legend is missing in Figure 1.    All above-mentioned issues are minor. The only real concern I have is in terms of the significance of the contribution, which is why I find the paper to be borderline. I do not find the results to be very hard to get but at the same time, the work is filling blank spots in the optimization world. In particular, the most important thing the method can do is to accelerate variance reduced methods with noise; however, as the authors pointed out, it is not the first method to do so (SVRG is already done, and one does not need to pay extra log factor there). Further, it is a community consensus that the Catalyst approach does not perform as well in practice as directly accelerated methods -- thus I do not see this work to have a significance for the practitioners (experiments (especially in the appendix) somewhat confirm slight superiority of accelerated SVRG). However, that is the price for the great versatility of Catalyst. Similarly, I do not believe the method will have a significant impact in the future nor it presents surprising results. On the other hand, the paper presents, to best of my knowledge, the most universal framework for the acceleration.   I would strongly vote to accept the paper to the slightly lesser venue, however, at this moment I am rather indifferent.    ========================= UPDATE =========================  All of my minor issues were addressed in the rebuttal. I am still not completely convinced about the practicality aspect and the high significance of the contribution, although that might be admittedly subjective. For this reason, I have decided to keep my score as it is (6). However, I believe that some discussion about the practicality of catalyst similar to what presented in the rebuttal would improve the paper -- it is both good to fix community's misconceptions (shall the authors believe it is a misconcepton) and it also makes the better motivation for the paper's results.
