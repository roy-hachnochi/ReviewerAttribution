I enjoyed reading the paper immensely-thank you very much for the effort made to provide intuition and to link your work to both recent results as well as to classic techniques (like the ODE method).  I have very little to ask here. As a question of more academic nature: the Gaussianity assumption makes perfect sense, and the explanation provided in 117-126 is more than sufficient. It is also great that intuition via the smoothness of the objective is given as the reason as to why an "algebraic" relationship exists between the rate proofs for the discrete and continuous cases.   That said, I believe that it could be possible to make both of these concepts precise, i.e., establish a form of "mean field limit": scaling n, b, and h jointly one may be able to show that the resulting rescaled discrete trajectory converges to the trajectory of the SDE in a precise manner. Such "mean field" results exist for the ODE method (see, e.g., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peva.2008.03.005 and   https://doi.org/10.1017/S0143385798097557). I do believe that this may be a whole lot lot of work to prove something that one is already inclined to believe (in the limit, the LLN kicks in!), and this sense this effort may not be worth it-and I am not advocating that this is needed for the present submission. It may be however a future direction worth pursuing even in a simpler setting than MB-SGD or SVRG, that  could potentially make the link between the discrete approach and the continuous approach both formal and airtight.
