Originality: To the best of my knowledge, the paper main idea is novel, and I find it very interesting.  Clarity: The paper is clear, well structured and well written.  Quality: The initial motivation and  the description of the method are sound. The derivation of the upper bound seems correct, and very useful. The experimental evaluation is well designed and provides a fair assessment of the method. One missing experiment/information in my opinion is the time cost for the estimation of the covariance matrices. Another interesting experiment would be to reduce the number of training samples and see if a smaller sample with a strong regularization by ISDA can achieve (close to) state-of-the-art results.  Significance: The experimental results show that adding ISDA to state-of-the-art models improves significantly the results. It also outperforms the data augmentation state-of-the-art method. When applied alone, Dropout has a better performance, but the combination of the two regularizations gives the best results. Moreover, the ablation study shows the importance of using the full covariance matrix for the computation of the loss.
