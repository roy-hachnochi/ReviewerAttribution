I see the main significance of this contribution in the following: a) it re-establishes a regret bound of O(sqrt (Phi * T)) which had previously been invalidated due to results in prior work having been shown as incorrect. It provides a somewhat simpler (subjectively) solution to the problem in terms of UCRL2.   Regarding originality, this paper draws upon explored techniques, making this more of a refinement paper than a groundbreaking one, however, the novelty is still sufficient for a decent conference submission.   The paper is very clearly written and easy to follow, and the ideas are presented in a natural way. I did not very the results thoroughly, but there to the extent that I did, there were no obvious red flags.
