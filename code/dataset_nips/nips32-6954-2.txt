The authors proposed Feedforward Bayesian Inference (FBI) for aggregating crowdsourced annotations in binary tasks. FBI follows the one-coin DS model, but adopts a streaming variational Bayes approach. It has two variants, namely Fast FBI and Sorted FBI. Fast FBI could run as fast as majority voting, while Sorted FBI archives better performance but runs slower. Bounds for the asymptotic accuracy of the two variants in both non-adaptive and adaptive settings are provided. Empirical results validates the bounds and show the efficiency and effectiveness of the two variants.  The paper is well-organized and easy to follow. Efficient/real-time truth inference for crowdsourcing is an important and relevant problem. The proposed FBI algorithms are novel and are suitable for streaming settings but donâ€™t achieve the best performance on average when all labels have been collected.  Some questions: In practice, the prior distribution q may not be known in most cases. How will it affect the FBI algorithms if q is not known? How does Sorted FBI work in the streaming setting? From Algorithm 2, it seems that the Fast-FBI algorithm is only called when all labels have been collected (because the call is outside the t loop). What would Algorithm 2 look like if the t loop is the outer loop?
