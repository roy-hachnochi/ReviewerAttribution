Originality: In terms of causal inference, the paper is highly original, as there are few works devoted to developing new simulation systems that can provide realistic evaluations. However, the related work section is somewhat sparse and it's not clear to me how novel the system is in terms of the application domain. In general, the related work could be improved.  Quality: The paper clearly articulates a gap in the literature, introduces a seemingly sound simulation system, and presents well thought out evaluations. I was especially pleased to see evaluation with domain experts.  Clarity: The paper is very well written, and the methods are well-reasoned. Some questions: -It is not clear to me why there are ~800 causal relationships. In medical records I am familiar with diagnosis codes such as ICD9/10 are used. Since ICD codes form a tree, one can choose highly specific or general codes for the same event. Potentially if one used the most specific code for every illness, this would lead to many relationships (though many may be redundant, if for example every child of a node shares the same effect). Is something similar at play here?  -For section 2.3, there is minimal detail about how these components are implemented. Are they part of the simulation system that will be made available, or something the authors did in post-processing of the data generated?
