Originality: The ideas in the paper are quite original. Related work has been cited well.  Quality: The work is technically sound. The conclusions are supported by the experiments.  Clarity: Please give more details of the reinforcement learning task used for learning optimal collection meta class sets. Some intuition on what makes an optimal collection should be provided.  Significance: The improvements are modest for the WebVision dataset. More empirical results would be required to assess the significance.  --- Post rebuttal response: The authors responded to my concerns adequately. After looking at the comments of other reviewers and the author's response, I'd like to change my score to 7.
