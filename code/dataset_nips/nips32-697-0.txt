High level comment:  It is difficult to evaluate this paper since the contributions are quite diverse and sprinkled throughout the paper mixed with known results. It would be good to more clearly separate previous papers from the contributions made in this paper. In particular, I think it would be good to have a clearly separate method section.  For example, currently 3.1 and 3.2 are under the (presumably) method section but most of it just repeats the derivation from Dai et al 2018. I think those parts belong into the background section and should not be stated as contributions.   Detailed Comments: -This paper adds novel theoretical results applicable to the single-agent setting and also adds consensus optimization to extend SBEED to decentralized multi-agent settings. I think it would be much cleaner to separate out these contributions into different papers. This would also make it easier to follow which challenges are due to non-linear function approximators and which ones are due to the decentralized MARL setting.    -It would be good to explain the setting more clearly in a background section. In particular, the "goal of the agents" is introduced in the method section (equation 3). Only here it becomes clear that the setting is fully cooperative, ie. each agent is trying to maximise the average reward across all agents.  -There is a repeated claim about "exploiting the data more efficiently" due to being off-policy. It would be great to experimentally validate this claim.   -The experiments would be much stronger if there were carried out on a more challenging testbed for multi-agent learning, rather than toy-tasks.   I have not checked the proofs and maths in detail.    grammar:  -line 101: "..above formulation by introduce.." -> ..above formulation by introducing.. line 202: ".. snd denote the total training step T." -> ?? -line 128: "Apply the soft temporal .." -> "Applying the soft temporal .."
