I am not an expert in decentralized optimization and its links to multi agent RL but the subject tackled in this paper is very interesting and propositions of the authors are relevant. The fact that their algorithm can use off-policy updates is for me a strong point and I got the feeling that the results presented in this paper extend current knowledge in an interesting and valuable way.
