The paper is extremely difficult to go read for a non-expert. The sensitivity sampling techniques are made use of in the algorithm design. However, it is hard to grasp the intuition and main ideas behind the algorithms. The algorithms are given as pseudocode and properties of these algorithms are stated in terms of technical theorems. Most of the proofs are in the full version (that I did not go through). I think due to space restrictions, the authors did not have space to give the main ideas behind some of the pseudocode that they give. However, I think it might be better to give the intuition and push the pseudocode to the full version.
