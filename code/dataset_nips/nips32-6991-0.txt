The contribution to prove effectiveness of random projection for polygonal curves is novel and is a neat extension of previous work on median and center clustering of polygonal curves using Frechet distance. As I understand, the sublinear dependence for 1-median clustering does not have much novelty beyond using a previously known sampling idea from Indyk's thesis (2000), already cited by the authors.  I found the empirical results meaningful and the authors do improve the efficiency of Alt-Godau implementation by an order of magnitude or more. However, I cannot judge the empricial work and its significance or broader impact effectively as I am familiar with the previous theoretical results on this problem but have not studied their practical applications carefully.
