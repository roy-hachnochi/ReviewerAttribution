Isotonic regression is an important model both in theory and practice, and thus I think the work in this article is meaningful. As suggesting in the theorem, it is desirable for estimator to have the property such as consistency and support recovery, however, I'm interested in the convergence rate is how optimal. Actually, the convergence rate would seem a little bit slow in practice.  In experimental results, the authors check the performance of the support recovery, while estimation accuracy should also be assessed for confirming the consistency.  In addition, for example in Theorem 2, $N=sn$ is defined as a samples for algorithm. However, since the input of algorithm is only $n$ sample and sparsity level, I'm not sure actually $N$ means. Please make it clear.  As a minor comment, Algorithm 3 in Theorem 3 would be Algorithm 1 from the context.
