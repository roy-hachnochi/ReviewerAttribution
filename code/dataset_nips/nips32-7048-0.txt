- Clarity: the paper is very well written. The problem is clearly formulated with appropriate distinction with other methods in the abstract and introduction. Compared to the prior works, conceptual differences are well stated. I enjoyed reading it.  - Originality and significance: despite the impressive empirical results, the main novelty of this work might be applying the idea of relativistic loss from [20] to adversarial perturbation. I do not underestimate the effort of applying a new technique to a different problem. Then, not only empirical results but also more follow-up analyses should be followed to validate how and why it is applicable. For example, I am curious about what types of cross-domain features are learned across domains. I get a little bit of hint from Figure 3: the background texture becomes more painting styles, but they are not enough. Depending on the combination of different source and target domains, how could the cross-domain features be transferable or not? The predictions on adversarial examples were all Jigsaw Puzzle. Does that indicate that any features in Painting are biased to the class? More broadly, how does style transfer relate to this cross-domain perturbation? Please provide us your insights on bigger and scientific questions.
