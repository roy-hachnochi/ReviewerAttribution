Originality: The authors propose to apply the relativistic discriminator loss to the generation of adversarial examples. The novelty is limited. Significance: The proposed method shows superior performance than several existing method in the field. Clarity: The presentation is clear overall, but there may be several typos in notation which may cause some confusion. For example, D(x, xâ€²) in line 107 is misleading, as D takes in a single input alone. Quality: The manuscript lacks enough theoretical arguments / explanations why the relativistic discriminator loss is better than the traditional cross-entropy loss in generating adversarial examples. On the other hand, sufficient experimental results are provided for validating this claim.  Pros: The paper provides sufficient experimental results for validating the claim that the proposed relativistic discriminator loss helps the training of a transferable generator of adversarial examples. It also provides a very concrete introduction and related work in terms of different attacking settings (or threat models).  Cons: A main problem with the paper may be the lack of novelty. The proposed relativistic discriminator seems to be only a small modification of an existing RGANs. While the authors successfully applied this model to generation of transferable adversarial examples, they fail to explain the fundamental reason why this loss has a benefit.
