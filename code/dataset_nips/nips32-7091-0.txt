The paper introduces a new interesting problem: to add a fixed number of edges to obfuscate the community structure of a given graph as much as possible. This problem is different from existing problems that focus on the deception of a single community, and it is related to mitigate privacy risks caused by community detection.  While the proposed algorithm simply chooses edges greedily, it is novel in two aspects. First, it is based on a new and understandable measure for the strength of community structure. The paper shows experimentally that minimizing the new measure better obfuscates community structure than minimizing modularity, which is a widely-used measure. Second, the algorithm is carefully designed so that it takes only O(#communities \times #nodes) time. The experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm is extensive. 9 datasets and 6 community-detection methods are used to show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline methods consistently regardless of datasets and community detection methods. However, the two baselines methods used are very weak. One (RAN) is simple random edge addition, and the other one (MOM), which greedily minimizes modularity, surprisingly underperforms RAN. Why MOM underperforms RAN is unclear. Greedy algorithms for minimizing variants of modularity or other measures can be considered as baselines. The paper is well written and easy to follow.
