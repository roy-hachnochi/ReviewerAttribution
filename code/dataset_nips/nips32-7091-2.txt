This paper proposed a method REM for community structure deception, aiming to avoid privacy leaking in community detection.  This work is motivated from an important application issue.  However, advantages of their proposed method are not clear.  Rather than proofs on running time, this paper should discuss more on  (1) why and how much REM improves on hiding sensitive network structure,  (2) how this avoids privacy leaking (an example in main paper rather than supplementary would help), and  (3) how this would affect us to extract useful, non-sensitive information from network.  One question should be discussed:  Can this method hide block membership for all kinds of nodes including those high degree nodes in cluster centers? Or only peripheral nodes on cluster boundaries ( which could be a great amount)?
