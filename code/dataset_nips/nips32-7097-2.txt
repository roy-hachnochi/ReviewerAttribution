This paper proposed a self-supervised method for learning representation from unlabelled point clouds. By random displacing the point clouds and training a network to reconstruct them, good feature representation can be learned, which can benefit the downstream tasks. Self-supervised learning is a hot topic in recent years. The authors extended the idea of [21] to 3D point clouds and showed its effectiveness. The proposed method is simple and easy-to-implement. The main weakness is that the performance gain is limited according to table II and III.
