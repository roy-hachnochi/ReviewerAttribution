This paper studies gradient descent with a fixed step size for 2x2 zero-sum games. The key theoretical result is that while in discrete time, FTRL only guarantees linear regret for a fixed step size, by utilizing the geometry in gradient descent, one may obtain sublinear regret in 2x2 zero-sum games. The authors show that after a long enough time, strategies will lie on the boundary of the strategy space. The main result (Theorem 2) is obtained by characterizing the exact dynamics for gradient descent, suitably selecting a dual space, decomposing each “rotation” into distinct components, analyzing the change in energy in each iteration for each component and showing that time is quadratic in the number of partitions (rotations). The authors give an example which satisfies a matching lower bound, showing that their analysis is tight. Lastly, the authors demonstrate through simulations that the regret bound may possibly hold for larger zero-sum games.  Clarity: The paper is generally easy to follow at a high level, with most details being deferred to the appendix. I found Figures 2 and 3 to be particularly useful in providing intuition to the analysis. The authors should be commended for putting the effort in making their analysis accessible. However, Section 3 and 3.1 could be further improved. In particular, it seems that the result in Lemma 6 is a prerequisite to understanding expressions (5)-(9)--- in fact, the set S_i is not even defined in the main paper at that point. Section 3 would have been much easier to read had the result from Lemma 6 been included while omitting the derivations from (5)-(8).  A few very minor comments:  (1) The phrase “This is because y^{t+1}_i cannot appear anywhere in R^{n_i}” can be a little confusing at first. (2) In Figures 2 and 3, the term “Payoff vector” (previously described by y) is overloaded and used to describe the “Transformed payoff vector” z.  (3) In Figure 3, the strategies x^t are not visible. The label could be removed if player strategies are not central to the point being illustrated by the figure.  Quality: I did not go through every derivation in the appendix, especially when it came to each of the cases in Lemmas 8 and 9. The proof sketches in the main paper, as well as the key ideas in Appendix C, D, E, and F seem correct, at least to the best of my ability.  Significance:  This analysis in this paper should be of interest to the online learning and optimization communities. Given that 2x2 zero-sum games are just about the simplest games possible, I am doubtful that this paper will be of direct interest to researchers outside these niche communities. Nonetheless, it is possible that the analysis could be a useful springboard for future research.  Originality The paper builds upon the techniques utilized by Mertikopoulos et al [2018] and Bailey and Piliouras [2018, 2019]. The geometric analysis (restricted to 2x2 games) and key results proven in the paper are novel as far as I can tell.   ============================================= Post-rebuttal: I am satisfied with the authors' response. That said, the authors' should include their rebuttal regarding extensions to higher dimensions and FTRL, together with the inclusion of Lemma 6 if the paper is accepted.
