This paper considers the use of online learning algorithms in min-max optimization. Classic results show that no-regret algorithms such as Online Gradient Descent can achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret when faced with adversarial loss functions. Moreover, in two-player zero-sum games where both players use a no-regret algorithm, the average iterates of the two players will converge to a Nash Equilibrium. However, these classic results require adaptive step-sizes or step-sizes of roughly $1/\sqrt{T}$. That is, there are no fixed-step size algorithms that simultaneously get regret bounds for all $T$.  This paper addresses this gap in the literature by proving several results about the gradient descent/ascent dynamics for two-player two-strategy zero-sum games with any fixed step-size. In particular, the authors show that the regret bound of each player in this setting is $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$, which implies that the time-average of the players' strategies converges to the Nash Equillibrium at a rate of $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$. The analysis focuses largely on characterizing the evolution of the payoff vectors for both players over time. Since the analysis only focuses on the 2x2 payoff matrix case, for each player the authors can write down the payoff of the first action in terms of the second action, which allows for a simplified representation of the evolution of the game. They show that the dynamics move to the boundary of the space and cycle between different regions along the boundary. The analysis follows by tracking a certian potential function and carefully tracking how this potential function changes in each region in addition to tracking how long the dynamics stay in each region.  The strength of this paper is that it addresses an important gap in the understanding of a classic online learning algorithm. While online learning algorithms were originally designed to work in the presence of adversarial loss functions, much recent work has focused on gaining a better understanding of these algorithms in settings that aren't compeltely adversarial, such as finding Nash Equilibria or nonconvex optimization. This work fits into that vein of work nicely.  The weakness of this paper is that it only gives results for the two-dimensional case. Moreover, the analysis seems fairly specialized to the two-dimensional case since it relies on a precise characterization of the trajectory of the algorithm, which seems difficult to write down explicitly for the general n-dimensional case.  Overall, this paper seems like a weak accept to me. I think the work identifies an important question, namely "Can gradient descent/ascent with constant step-size find Nash Equilibria?" Much of the analysis consists of straightforward calculations, but the overall approach of characterizing the different phases of the dynamics seems fairly original for this setting and is a nontrivial contribution. The paper is also fairly clear. These factors make the paper seem like a weak accept even though the contribution is in a very limited setting.  ====== Post-rebuttal ====== I read the rebuttal and other reviews. I am fine with accepting this paper if the authors add 1) an appendix on extensions to other FTRL algorithms and 2) the discussion from the rebuttal about obstacles to proving the result in higher-dimensions.
