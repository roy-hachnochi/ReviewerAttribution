I have read the authors' response. While the response doesn't fully answer my concern, i.e., providing results of training their large-sized model from scratch, it is a reasonable response. Also given the results and experiments conducted, I think the paper benefits the community. As such I have increased the score from 6 to 7.  ---  This paper extends BERT to propose a multi-task pretraining approach. The tasks are language modeling (left-to-right, right-to-left), BERT's objective, and seq2seq generation. All the three tasks share the same Transformer backbone (BERT large) and different task are accomplished through masking matrices.  The authors presented strong improvements across a wide range of tasks, such as abstractive summarization (CNN/DailyMail), question answering (SQuAD, CoQA) using both extractive and generative approaches, and question generation.  My only concern point is the initialization of this model from BERT large: what happens if this model is trained from scratch? or what happens if BERT large is continued to be trained on the version of their data?
