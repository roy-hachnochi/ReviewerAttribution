The originality: It is interesting to learn the coarse correlated equilibrium of general-sum extensive form game with multi-player setting, and to reveal the computational complexity of the problem is important. From the technical point of view, some proof techniques are not so novel. For example, main parts of Theorem 3 follow the previous work [15].  The quality: Theorem 4 shows that the time complexity of Algoirhm2, which is a subroutine of CFR-Jr, and the time-complexity of CFR-Jr is not provided. In addition, there is no theorem that shows how good \epsilon CFR-Jr can provide.  The clarity: It is well-written. The paper puts some appropriate examples and intuitive explanations.  The significance: Theorems 2 and 3 seem to be important for machine learning and game theory communities. I cannot find how important Theorems 4 and 5 are.   Below, I describe some questions mainly for the quality and the significance: (i) Does Theorem 3 mean that CFR-S does not necessarily converge to the optimal CCE? If so, it would be better to show the bound between the optimal CCE and a CCE to which CFR-S converges because an objective of the paper is to find a social-welfare-maximizing CCE.  (ii) Theorem 4 provides a time complexity about the reconstruction. What is the time-complexity of CFR-Jr?  (iii) At line 7 in Algorithm 2, if we put a pair (\bar{\sigma}_i,\bar{w}) and X already includes the same \bar{\sigma}_i, how do we build x_i from X?  (iv) I cannot find if CFR-Jr approaches to the set of CCEs because Theorem 5 only indicates the relation between the regret and CCEs. There is no theorem showing how small \epsilon CFR-Jr can obtain. Thus, I want to know, given the number of iteration T, can we bound \epsilon parameterized by T?  (v) In the experimental evaluation, how do you find the optimal social welfare SW_{Opt}?
