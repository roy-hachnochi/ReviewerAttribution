I thoroughly enjoyed this paper. The paper contributes important results and algorithms with guarantees that are clearly the new state-of-the art.  I have two relatively minor criticisms: - The algorithm CFR-Jr is rather straight-forward, as in, it is the obvious/natural way to get CFR to converge to approximate CCE, and the guarantees are a straight-forward consequence of properties of regret minimization. - CFR-S is the most unnatural CFR variant I have ever read. Why would one sample profiles if the values need to be updated in portions of the space that are not reachable anyway? One would think to resort to sampling because the problem is too large and to cut down the state space, but my understanding is that all the information states require updating even if they are not reached in the joint sample, which is why Theorem 3 can hold without any exploration. Is there a use case for this algorithm, when would it be preferred to CFR-Jr?  There is oddly no discussion of EFCE. Does a similar notion not exist for CCE?  [19] shows that dominated actions are removed by CFR. i would assume this is preserved in CFR-Jr; is that true? Or is it only be a property of the marginal strategies computed by CFR? If it's true, does it imply that the normal form CCEs filter out dominated strategies as well?  It would be nice to see more graphs like the one in Figure 3 (across more of the domains), as it shows what the convergence and welfare looks like over time. If accepted for publication, I would encourage the authors to add more of these to the appendix.
