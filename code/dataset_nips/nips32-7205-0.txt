Overall, the paper develops a new and practically useful algorithm for the distributed SGD problem with theoretical convergence guarantees and empirical evidences on its performance. The paper can be improved in terms of clarity by expanding on the main theoretical advantages of the algorithm over the Stich et al. paper and addressing some concerns on the Count Sketch detailed below.
