In this paper the authors provide a new formulation for fair nearest neighbors. The key idea is that instead of reporting the nearest neighbor, or an approximate nearest neighbor, one reports uniformly at random a point within the ball of radius r.  The authors provide a data structure of independent interest that essentially samples according to the l0 norm (#distinct elements) in the union of a query. This primitive is used in combination with an LSH black box to design the desired data structures.  Then, the proposed method is evaluated on a real-world dataset.     From a technical point of view, section 3 and the corresponding formulation are the main technical contribution in my opinion, as well as the fair NN formulation the main originality of the paper. Overall, it is also well written.   [I thank the authors for the detailed response. I have upgraded my score from 5 to 6]
