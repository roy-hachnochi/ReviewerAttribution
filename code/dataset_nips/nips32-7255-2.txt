Overall, this paper is well written. The authors have proven the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through sufficient analysis.    However, I have several concerns regarding the proposed algorithm. First question is that what is a reasonable choice of N in your initialization phase. You use N samples to construct the initial representative sets as well as the dictionary matrix. As an online algorithm, I think your convergence bound should include N as a parameter here. But I cannot see it from the theorem you presented in the paper. Can you explain it?  The number of samples in each cluster is assumed to be constant over time. What is the intuition behind this? Does this mean in the initialization, you already have enough samples to expand the representation space?  For the restricted online cvsMF algorithm, you assume that the new sample always gets to the correct cluster which I think is not possible in real world. Especially, you only have limit number of samples to initialize your K clusters. How could it be possible that you always get correct assignment?
