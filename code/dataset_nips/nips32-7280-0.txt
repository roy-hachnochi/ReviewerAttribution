The paper is well-written and offers a plethora of detailed information to support its claims, including:  -- The interpretation of Gaussian data augmentation as inducing low=pass filtering by the network. This observation, while not entirely surprising, in made within a principled framework for evaluating augmentation techniques.  --An investigation of the effectiveness of the AutoAugment approach for data-driven augmentation strategies, pointing at the effectiveness of more diversified augmentation strategies.  -- The observation that  adversarial attacks are still possible, even after low-pass filtering. and suggesting connection with the DeepViz approach for visualizing the inner workings of CNNs.  Overall the results of the paper present work that feels preliminary, in that they consist mostly of a set of insightful observations and do not, at this point, present a coherent and principled framework of addressing data augmentation strategies for ensuring robustness in vision algorithms. However, within its limited scope, the paper is quite thorough and it is very likely to lead others to further investigate these fundamental and important issues.  This reviewer has read the authors' rebuttal. After the ensuing discussion, the final score assigned remains unchanged.
