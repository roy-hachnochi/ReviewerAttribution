Originality: The frequency-domain interpretation of the effects of noise in training data as well as adversarial noise is original.  . Quality: By analyzing common corruptions and model performance in the frequency domain, the paper establishes connections between frequency of a corruption and model performance under data augmentation.  Clarity: The paper is easy to follow. Significance:: The analysis is made firm with results on a benchmark data.
