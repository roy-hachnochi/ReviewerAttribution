This work addresses an important and interesting setting, bipartite experiments, for causal inference in randomized experiments. In such a setting, treatment and control units are different from the outcome units. Unlike the prior work from Zigler and Papadogeorgou (2018) that considers a particular setting of partial interference, they consider the most general setting for which no immediate reduction to the standard causal setting exists. Moreover, they assume that an outcome unitâ€™s outcome is determined by a weighted proportion of the treated diversion units in its exposure set. The main novelty is that they propose a new clustering objective, i.e., choose the clustering of diversion units that maximizes the empirical variance of the treatment exposure. To solve the optimization problem, they propose a scalable heuristic clustering algorithm. They validate the approach by running experiments on real data.    The paper is well written and easy to follow. The reviewer thinks this work is interesting and insightful for future work in this direction.
