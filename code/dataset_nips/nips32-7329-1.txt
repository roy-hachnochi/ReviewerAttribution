This paper aims at learning a collection of transition matrices of ergodic Markov chains, where at each round the algorithm can select one of the chains and observe which state it fell in. The problem consists in designing a strategy such as the learning will occur uniformly over all chains at the best possible rate. The paper is of theoretical nature, the background on chains is properly introduced, the algorithm is clearly described and thoroughly analyzed.  The paper in its current form is a stronger submission than its previous version. It is more focused, the assumptions are clearer, it is more detailed, and an overall better read. Bound on the loss is also provided in terms of simple quantities, namely the number of considered chains and number of states, which offers a priori guarantees under mild assumptions.  The technical proofs in the appendix were not verified by the reviewer.  === Some minor comments === line-30 indexing switches from n to m line-30 kernel is later defined to be row stochastic line-122 ’Moreover’ could imply that this is a byproduct of reversibility. However this is always true. line-140 summation should be over y line-143 At line 143 you make an assumption on the sum of the Gini indexes to be greater than 0. Interestingly, could you come up with an example of an ergodic chain for which this quantity would be null ? line-157 Indexes t’ and k of X should be switched for consistency. line-161,162 Notice that the estimator for the stationary distribution is not the stationary distribution of the estimator for the transition matrix. This could be recovered (if you somewhere in the proofs rely on that fact) by making the smoothing on your estimator of the stationary distribution coarser. line-279 Does it hold when both irreducibility and aperiodicity are dropped or do you have to keep one of these ? Remark 1 deserves to be made more precise. For example, are you still relying on other other facts, such as the positivity of the sum of Gini indexes ?  ================ AFTER REBUTTAL ==================  The reviewer thanks the authors for their detailed answers, believes that the authors  will make the changes they promised and raises the score accordingly.  About the reply at L.33-38 regarding the condition on the Gini indexes. The reviewer agrees that deterministic cycles would yield 0, but interestingly,  isn't then your chain periodic hence not ergodic (under the definition that the transition matrix of an ergodic chain is primitive) ? But then, what sort of behavior would you observe if it's not a cycle but still has deterministic entries ?
