The paper considers the novel problem of estimating the transition probabilities of K different Markov Chains uniformly well, given a bound on the total number of samples allowed to draw. This is a generalization of the well-studied problem where the goal is the same but with K real-valued distributions. The paper then provides an algorithm which is then analyzed in various regimes. This amalysis also shows that the algorithm is optimal in the asymptotic regime.  The authors have done a really nice job in explaining the difficulties and the major steps both in the construction and in the analyis, making the paper an enjoyable read, and highlighting the main differences from the existing works also in this respect. The one thing that was missing for me is the motivation of this particular generalization of the classic problem on the real-valued distributions to the Markov chains. Nevertheless, the paper has some really nice ideas; in particular, I have found Lemma 1 relating the product of the losses and the sample sizes to the Gini index particularly interesting. (The second step in the proof summary could be a bit more detailed, however, to make it easier to understand why the result indeed makes sense.) In view of all this, I recommend accept.  Additional remarks: lines 39 and 201: "rely on the Wald’s second identity" -> "rely on Wald’s second identity" line 140: presumably the sum is over y in S line 150: "according to P_{k_t}"? line 210: "denotes" -> "denote"
