originality: the formal justification of the CDP trade-off is a novel contribution  quality: the derivation of the CDP function is technically sound. While inspiring, the empirical justification could be improved: 1) results are only shown on mnist, which is a set of close-to-binary images. How does the CDP tradeoff look like on more general natural images? 2) only one simple degradation scenario of additive Gaussian noise is considered. How does the CDP tradeoff performs beyond this, in the presence other degradations, e.g. blur, low-res, exposure?  clarify: the presentation of the paper is clear  significance: the general trade-off between classification-distortion-perception is of broad interest to the community of computer vision and machine learning  ** Updates ** The authors  have partially addressed  the concern on generalization beyond simple additive white Gaussian noise degradation, and promise to conduct analysis on datasets beyond  mnist.  Overall, the formulation and analysis of CDP is a good contribution to the community.
