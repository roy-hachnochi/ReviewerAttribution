The authors consider graph problems where the homophily bias helps the predictive power. They show how pre-processing graphs using graph diffusion convolution can generally improve the predictive performance of downstream methods.  The paper reads well, the core thesis is well described, its empirical analysis is thorough. The approach is tested on several methods and shows a consistent capacity of improving each one of them.  The authors analyze empirically the changes in the eigenvalues after the proposed graph transformation and offer as insight the conclusion that the procedure affects both the highest and  the lowest eigenvalues and can therefore mitigate a) the influence of long range interactions and b) of noise on local interactions.  The clarity of the insight contribute to increase the work's significance: particularly insightful is Section 6 where key questions are analyzed.
