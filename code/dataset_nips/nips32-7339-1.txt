AFTER AUTHOR FEEDBACK I think the author has addressed my comments/concerns, and I am happy to keep my current score. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BEFORE AUTHOR FEEDBACK I think this is a very well written paper. The arguments presented are sound and they are backed by theoretical investigations and empirical evidence. The authors also gave careful considerations to various essential technical details in order for the proposed method to work in practice. Moreover, the proposed method is flexible and it can be generalized to other constraints. In addition, the authors explained why other possibly more naive methods fail and I found this to be useful for me to debunk any pre-conception I had about this paper. The proposed method is quite complicated and this made me wonder whether any simplification is possible? Now since B-splines bases are positive, nonnegativity can be achieved simply by constraining the basis coefficients to be nonnegative (or between 0 and 1 for density estimation). Then Shen and Ghosal (2015) on adaptive random series priors showed that these constraints have good approximation properties for nonnegative functions (see the Appendix about B-splines). Hence instead of using the representation given by Lesserre, I am wondering whether it would be more efficient to consider the nonnegative characterization mentioned above by working with nonnegative scalar basis coefficients rather than nonnegative-definite matrices.
