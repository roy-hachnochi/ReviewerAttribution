he paper characterizes the asymptotic behavior of the variational Bayes approximation under model misspecification. I found none of the results particularly surprising since they are intuitive and expected, especially based on the results of [17] & [29]. (The proof also seems to be a straightforward extension.)  I also find that the authors make too big of a deal about the model misspecificaiton error asymptotically dominating the variational approximation error, making this old observation look like a new contribution. (As an approximation becomes more accurate asymptotically, obviously the model misspecificaiton is going to dominate.) In particular, I find the section 2.2 verbose and repetitious in explaining the obvious intuition.  The authors should be more explicit about the limitation of the result discussed in Section 2.3. I believe the local asymptotic normality assumption (Assumption 5) often fails under the type of models considered in Section 2.3 (e.g. hyper-parameters of the Gaussian process regression does not concentrate under the in-fill aymptotics).   All that said, the result is a welcome addition to the literature on the theoretical properties of the variational Bayes approximation under model. I also appreciate that the authors kept the intuitions very clear (without making things unnecessarily complicated) and the paper is generally very easy to read.  Minor comments: - Assumption 4 & 5 in the supplement are not just analogous but are essentially identical to Assumption 2 & 3. In this case, why not make the assumption for Section 2.3 more clear in the main manuscript? - Line 127, `tests $\phi_n$`: a `test` is undefined. I suppose it is a compactly supported smooth function, but is certainly not in the standard vocabulary of stats/ML audience. - Line 166, `limiting exact posterior`: this terminology threw me off and was very confusing to me because `limiting` and `exact` are contradictory. I suggest to call it just `limiting posterior`. - Line 166, `\theta` vs `\tilde{\theta}`: does the parameter with tilde play a different role? If not, it is just confusing. - Line 172, `\mathcal{Q}^d`: is the same as `\mathcal{Q}`? I suppose it is meant to emphasize the dependency on $d$, but the dependency was always there and the sudden change of notation is just confusing. - Line 289, `simulation corroborates... the limiting VB posterior coincide with the limiting exact posterior.`: I don't think this claim is true. Just looking at RMSE does *not* establish that that the two distributions (VB and MCMC) are close.   Response to author feedbacks:  Straitening out the main contributions and clarifying the limitations will certainly make the paper more worthwhile to the readers. With a successful revision, the paper will deserve the score of 7 (though there is no 2nd round review unfortunately).
