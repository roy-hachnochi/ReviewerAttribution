I have to preface my review by saying that I am not an expert on graphs and I am very unfamiliar with the results in this field. I will assess the paper based mostly on the privacy guarantees provided by the authors.  The authors consider the problem of privately finding a sparse representation of a graph.That is find a graph with O(n) edges with a Laplacian close to that of the original graph.   Their algorithm is based on computing effective resistances privately and then running a non private algorithm on these resistances to compute the sparsification.  I find the motivation for the paper interesting. The proofs seemed to be correct and the algorithms are well explained. My only problem is that the algorithm appears to be intractable. Indeed the algorithm requires solving a SDP which could potentially very hard to solve. The fact that the authors provide no experiments or an implementation of their algorithm leads me to believe that this algorithm is in fact impractical.   One minor clarification is: why do we need to sketch the left singular space to obtain the effective resistance? Can't we do that from the first sketch R?
