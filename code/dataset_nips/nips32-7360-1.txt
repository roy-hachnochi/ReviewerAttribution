The paper address privacy in graphs.  The authors consider edge privacy and provide a mechanism for sparsification of a graph that ensures differential privacy and approximates the spectrum of the original graph.  The sparse graph is then used for cuty queries.       The authors use the measure of effective resistance in the probability for sampling an edge.  It is still not clear to me that the sampling then does not divulge importance of an edge.  Most of the technical discussion is brief and proofs are in the supplementary material.  I would have hoped that a  more intuitive explanation would make up for the proofs being in the supplementary material, but that is not the case here.       There is no motivation relating to practical uses cases.  Under what scenarios are private cut queries important?  A discussion of the practical impact of privacy in the cases considered here would be helpful.
