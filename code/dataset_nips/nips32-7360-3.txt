I am not an expert on the graph sparsification and I did not check the proof.  I suggest the weak accept due to the following reasons:   1) The motivation of the problem is unclear. Although it is clear that the original graph sparsification is unsuitable to DP model. The relaxation problem is quite weird. Especially the spectral approximation condition. Why here they need to use a Laplacian of a complete graph, L_n here? What is the connection between this relaxation and the original problem?   2) Still, the motivation of the problem. I am not sure whether it is necessary to study the problem under edge DP. I think the authors should given an example why it is reasonable.   3) My reason of weak accept is due the approach in this paper is quite interesting. As the main idea is to calculate the effective resistance privately. I think it may could found other applications.  ---------------------------After Rebuttal---------------------------------------------------- I changed to weak reject due to the following reasons.   Definition 2 is quite weird. The authors should clarify why their definition is reasonable. Why here use Ln?  I think the authors need to tell a complete story. Not just say something like it can be used to some problems. Since they just considered the edge DP, they need to say that Edge DP is reasonable in these problems.    So I changed my opinion to weak reject.
