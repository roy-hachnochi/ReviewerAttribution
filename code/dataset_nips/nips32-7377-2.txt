1. While the basic idea is not so exciting, the proposed technique is well justified and the paper is well written. I would suggest to accept the paper if the space is enough.   2. In the presence of gross errors, it is not easy to estimate the true neighborhood accurately. But the proposed method explicitly depends on the estimated neighborhoods. It would be better to analyze the influence of the kNN structure estimated from the given data.   3. The following closely related paper should be included into discussions:  Matrix Recovery with Implicitly Low-Rank Data, 2019.  4. The coherence defined in 4.1 had been defined and investigated in many other papers, e.g.,   Exact Matrix Completion via Convex Optimization, 2009.  Low-rank Matrix Completion in the Presence of High Coherence, 2016.    5. For empirical validations, it would be better to show some results that the proposed technique can improve the accuracy of classification or clustering.
