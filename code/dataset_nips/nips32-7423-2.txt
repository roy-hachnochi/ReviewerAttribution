I have to say I'm not an expert on theorectical adaptive sampling in the SBM. I didn't check the math details, and may not fully understand the math sigficance of the paper.  But from my experience on research, I feel this paper is good. The writing is well organized and easy to follow. The studied  problem of adaptive sampling is important. The results are comprehensive and promising. The proposed  algorithm should be inspiring for practical application.
