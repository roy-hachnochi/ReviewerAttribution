------------------ Update after reading Author Feedback ----------------- My score remains unchanged. The authors have promised to clarify portions of the text that would more clearly distinguish between their paper and similar works.  I believe the paper elegantly merges two interesting ideas in the optimal transport literature, and provides an efficient algorithm for computing a  solution to their new problem. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Summary: The authors propose a method for computing Wasserstein distances between distributions with clustered structure. Their hierarchical approach simultaneously solves a cluster alignment problem and a global transport problem. This approach has better robustness properties than typical transport.  Comments: I very much liked the paper, and was impressed by the clarity of exposition, the simplicity of the algorithm, and the theoretical details.  I have a few comments: On line 133 you mention that ADMM is convergent even in non-convex settings. Reference [38] does show convergence for a few families of problems with non-convex objectives and constraints, but I am unsure whether they apply to your case.  I don't fully understand why your augmented Lagrangian is as it's given after line 136. Wouldn't it be  \sum_{i, j} (P_{ij}C_{ij}(R_{ij}, Q_{ij} + H_{\gamma_2}(Q_{ij}) + <\Lambda_{ij}, R-R_{ij}> + \frac{\mu}{2D}\|R - R_{ij}\|_F^2) + H_{\gamma_1}(P)  Perhaps I am missing a step or a simplification.  In lines 142--146 you discuss the effect of the entropy parameter on the algorithm. Can you comment on whether it affects convergence of the StiefelAlignment step? As the regularization parameter increases do you tend to see more oscillation in the transformations?
