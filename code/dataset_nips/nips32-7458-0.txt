This work is original, to the best of my knowledge, in automatically grading an agents capability in a Goal directed MDP. This allows the agent to generate increasingly difficult goals to perform by solving a Wasserstein barycenter problem; they effectively explain this problem as solve it well by exploiting some structure in the MDP.  The authors also provide a simple, intuitive setting where the effects of HGG are conveyed, but do not include much discussion of their more complex experimental results. While I do not doubt the validity of their approach, when experimental results are included it seems odd to not try and dissect what their method was able to contribute. Their ablation studies (in the main body as well as the supplemental material) offer additional evidence that their approach is indeed valid; one should expect that their automatic method should be robust to a reasonable range of hyper-parameters, which was important to demonstrate.
