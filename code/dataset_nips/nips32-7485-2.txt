--- after author response: ---  Thank you to the authors for all the valuable clarifications, it seems like they would strengthen the manuscript.  I spotted a minor typo in the appendix:  On the line "where the equality to 0 is true because [...]", the first \tilde{v} should be bold.  --- original review: ---  The paper proposes non-Gaussian MRF likelihood learning for robust regression. A global convergence result is derived. Overall this is a convincing paper with a rather nice result that seems to work well in practice.  Originality:  5/5  The paper extends results from literature on spherically-invariant random vectors [1 in paper] to more general losses / likelihoods. The application to obtaining a global convergence result for robust elliptical MRFs seems original.  Quality: 4/5  The paper provides both a theoretical result supporting the practical use of the proposed non-convex optimization, a description of an algorithm to solve it, as well as convincing evaluations showing good performance of robust learning especially with few samples.  Deducting one point because I think a derivation of the MM algorithm used should be provided, rather than simply giving the form of the algorithm.  Clarity: 4/5  The overall presentation is very well written and easy to follow. I did not manage to understand some of the technical details surrounding Lemma 1 and its proof, and will ask for clarifications below.   Significance: 5/5  Robust estimation seems like a likely improvement in many cases over gaussian MRFs, and this paper provides everything needed to perform it effectively.
