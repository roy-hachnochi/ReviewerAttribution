I have read the authorsâ€™ response. All the problems have been addressed. However, the quality of the current version cannot meet NeurIPS, because many typos and confusions are arisen, more importantly, the experiments is too simple and it does not enough to support the advantages of the proposed methods. If the paper can be improved accordingly in the final version, it still can be considered to accept.
