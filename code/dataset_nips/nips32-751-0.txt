Originality: To the best of my knowledge, this is the first method that surpasses human performance in a multi-player game where actions can be hidden during the game. Most of the components are extensions of DeepStack [1], but new formalizations (e.g. deductive reasoning for inferring the private actions) and model architecture adjustments (e.g. win probability layer) were necessary for addressing the challenges of the game under consideration.  Quality & Clarity: Both the experimental setup and the proposed algorithm are clearly presented. The paper is well written and self-contained for the most of it.  Significance: The extension of CFR to hidden action games can be very impactful, and the steps to achieve this were non-trivial!
