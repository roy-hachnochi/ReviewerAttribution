Significance: 1. The paper is well written and easy to follow. All experimental details are provided along with the code. 2. As per my knowledge, this is the first work which replaces non-linear functions in reversible normalizing flow model with GNN model. This simple change led to development of reversible model for graph processing. 3. On the generation side - Although the computational cost is same as GraphRNN O(N^2), inference model for graph generation can be parallelized. 4. Drawback - Graph generation is shown on very small dataset with max of 20 nodes. It would be better to compare against standard baselines as reported in GraphRNN work such as Grid, Protein and medium sized community / ego graphs. 5. Moreover, the results in Table 1 & 4 is not overwhelming.  Clarification: 1. On optimizing using Eq.(5), there is a good possibility that the loss function is dominated by large chunk of non-edge terms. Have you considered balancing the loss for positive and negative edges ?
