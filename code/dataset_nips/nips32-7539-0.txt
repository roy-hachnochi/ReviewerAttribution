This paper seeks to address the existing ambiguity in distributed SGD and knowing how and when to aggregate the solution.  They start by analyzing two extreme aggregate policies (every time and at the end) and show that the more frequent communication is by far better.  Their closest work is [21] that assumes uniformly bounded gradients and [40] that also assumes bounded gradients and small step-sizes.  They have clear notation and assumptions that make the paper concise and easier to follow.  Their main result is in showing they can decompose the results into three terms that they then show bounds for.  They bounds help show where communication comes into play to distinguish OSA and MBA.  They make the interesting point that though the asymptotic equivalence exists, the pre-asympotic analysis is what distinguish the results in practice.  This is interesting and practical and hopefully more papers consider pre-asymptotics.
