This paper proposes an interesting and novel method for paraphrase generation. I enjoyed reading the paper: the description is clear, related work is balanced, and result analysis section is convincing.   Minor suggestions:   - Figure 1 could be expanded with more details, tied to the equations or sections in Sec 2.   - The term CBOW invokes a standard word embedding method as opposed to "cheating BOW". It's fine, but confused me for a bit originally.   - If space permits, some more details about the Gumbel implementation would be helpful.   == Note after author response ==  I think my suggestions weren't mentioned in the author response since they were minor points (which is fine), but I trust the authors will improve the draft in the revision.
