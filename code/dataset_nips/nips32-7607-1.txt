Originality: the paper proposed pruning deep learning weights based on auxiliary parameters, which seems to be novel.    Quality: the work is generally complete with sufficient motivation, discussion of the benefit of the approach and numerical studies. The work lacks the theoretical justification of the approach, which is a weakness.   Clarity: the paper is generally clear, with a few minor typos. For example, R1 was first used in (9) and then later defined in (12), which could lead to confusion in readers.   Significance: I believe this proposal could be of practical use for practitioners. The work will be more complete if there are theory that justifies the proposal.  =============================================================  Comments read.
