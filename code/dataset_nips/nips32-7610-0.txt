The paper is well-written and easy to follow. To my best knowledge, the work is novel and provide an extension to the successor representation. If data available, it would be interesting to see how similar or dissimilar human/animal behave to the proposed model, especially to examine the new point of view of the hippocampal function. The choice of experimental setting can be briefly explained for the readers not very familiar with relevant literature. For example, given that we interpret the results by looking at whether it learns the barrier, it would be good to explain why the barrier is curial to the experiment/model evaluation.   _____________________ After authors response: The authors promised more discussion on neuroscience and comparison with earlier models, which would be valuable for this paper. So I am happy to increase my score by 1 point. Please also make some efforts to make the paper more readable by a boarder audience, as suggested by other reviewers and myself.
