Clarity: very clear overall Originality: original framework to the best of my knowledge Significance: seems an important contribution to the field, this language should facilitate the development of Neural Architecture Search algorithms. Quality: high quality  Minor: "While in different settings these input distributions take different forms, our formulation can work with any of them. Next, we summarize some of these alternatives." =>Unclear sentence. what is “these”? section 5.1: I don't know how helpful the introduction of all the formal notations is for the reader, and it might not the most pedagogical way to explain things. Could maybe move this section to supplement and replace it by more extended examples of code like in fig. 1->3, maybe connecting to known frameworks such as TensorFlow or Pytorch?
