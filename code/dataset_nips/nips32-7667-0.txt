The paper under review builds upon prior work on graph-based approximate kNN search, and improves upon by (a) introducing random graph initialization that speeds up the graph construction procedure (b) replacing a hard RNG constraint w/ a soft \alpha-RNG constraint, which reduces the number of hops required by the algorithm (c) expanding the BeamSearch procedure to work with SSD storage, by selecting k nodes to expand at a time, which addresses the I/O bottleneck.   Overall, while these all can be thought of as incremental contributions, the resulting algorithm outperforms the relevant baselines. It will no doubt be of interest to practitioners in the field. This type of work, however, could significantly benefit from open-sourcing the code to facilitate adoption.   The paper is well written, the techniques are well explained and the connection to prior work is clear, even for non-expert reader. The experimentation is thorough and convincing.
