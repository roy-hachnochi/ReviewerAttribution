The authors propose a method that parameterize the convolutional kernels in a CondConv layer as a linear combination of n experts, and by increasing the number of experts, the capacity of the layer can be increased. The authors evaluate CondConv on MobileNetv1, MobileNetV2, and ResNet-50. Both experiments on ImageNet and CoCo dataset indicate the effectiveness of the proposed CondConv. Overall, this paper is an interesting complete work, which is trying to improve the capacity of the network without significantly increasing the inference cost. The writing and illustrations are clear.
