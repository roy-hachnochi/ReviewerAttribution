As most of the concerns have been addressed by the authors' feedback, I upgrade my score.  ############################################################# Auxiliary classifier GAN, as a popular conditional GAN, tends to generate near-identical images for most classes as the number of labels increases. In this paper, the authors have an in-depth discussion on the source of the low-diversity problem. In particular, the authors suggest that the AC-GAN misses an important negative conditional entropy term, so that it cannot faithfully minimize the divergence between real and generated conditional distribution. Based on this insightful observation, a new twin auxiliary classifiers GAN has been developed in this paper.   The authors have clearly analyzed the problem and developed a novel solution with solid theoretical supports. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on both synthetic data and real-world data, and demonstrated impressive performance in terms of most metrics.
