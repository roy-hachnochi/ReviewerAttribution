This is an interesting and well-written paper that aims at unifying graph NNs, VAE and GAN. The node ordering study is important.  I have a few questions/comments: a. It is not clear to me how the model can generate output graphs with a number of nodes different from the input graph?  b. Spectral embedding requires to solve a linear system, which costs n^3 and thus cannot be scaled to large graphs. How do you scale to large graphs? What is the complexity of the learning system? c. Spectral embedding is an important part of the proposed. It should be presented (what is g(A)?) and also explained why it provides independence wrt node re-ordering.  d. An important application of graph generation is for molecule generation, which presents a challenging real-world challenge. It would have been good to evaluate the performance of the proposed system wrt [46] which proposed a competitive GNN+GAN+RL molecule generation model.
