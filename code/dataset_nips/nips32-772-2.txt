Originality: The work studies the problem of generating graphs given semantic conditions and proposes a new algorithm to conquer technical difficulties by combining or improving established methods. Overall, I think the work is novel and interesting.  Quality: To the best of my knowledge, the work is technically sound. All claims are well supported by experimental results. Qlarity: The paper is well organized and clearly written. Significance: The methods of improving GVAE to generate graphs of different sizes and using adversarial learning to ensure permutation invariance are important contributions and may have great impacts on future works in graph generation.
