This paper is very well-written, providing a clear description of the proposed method and a compelling argument for why it would be useful. The experiments nicely demonstrate the advantages of this method (combining the advantages of generative models with those of DL for approximate inference). I really liked this paper.   There is some related work in this field. As far as I know, the authors do a good job at putting this work in context and citing relevant papers. I believe this work is both original and highly significant.
