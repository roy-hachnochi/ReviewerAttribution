The idea of the paper is straightforward, which is to use a graph neural network as a residual part to fix the messages from a Gaussian graphical model. The proposed model is simple but effective.   My main concern is the experimental part. In the experiment, the dynamics are simple and fixed. The authors may want to train the model on a set of different dynamics (with the same structure, but different parameters), and then test them on the dynamics with the same structure but different parameters (obviously, the parameters can be input to the model as conditional variables). That would make the paper more convincing.   ===== After Rebuttal =====  The authors' response resolves my concern, and thus I update my score.
