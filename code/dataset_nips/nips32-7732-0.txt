The paper provides a nice link to more classical literature on graph theoretic algorithms for maximum flows for bipartite matching and adapts a classic algorithm to the specific problem at hand. The detailed analysis will be of interest to algorithmic researchers, and experiments seem to show a practical advantage as well, which is quite exciting. While I did not check the mathematics line-by-line, the treatment seems careful.
