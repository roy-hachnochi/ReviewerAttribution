The presented method is an extension, using Random Fourier Features instead of the approximation used in [12], for kernel-based sampling on the evaluation of the gradients for SoftMax layer.   It is not clear, and it is not studied at all, how the assumption of bounded gradients affects the empirical evidence.  Same as above for the normalization of the class embeddings and input embeddings. Moreover, it is argued by the reviewer that such a process does not correspond to a widely SoftMax use.  ----- After reading the rebuttal by the authors, I believe that this submission is stronger, however comments 1 and 2 are not addressed. I tend to keep my scores.
