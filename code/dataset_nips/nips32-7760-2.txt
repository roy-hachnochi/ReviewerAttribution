The work is original (as far as I know). I had never seen the use of OT that way to propose a distance between graphs written as eq. (6) and then (9) when a permutation is involved; despite the fact that the  result is a direct application of known results) and significant. The whole manuscript shows that this way of writing a distance between graphs, that gives also a transportation plan from one graph to another, can use in practical situations for graph alignement, a known and important problem.  I don't have much comments on the work, as I think it is a very good and that it is already very clear. Some improvements could always be made, as described in a next Section.  The authors' feedback after reviews is very good also, conforting my very good impression about this work.
