The work is very original and provides novel approaches for both the lower bound problem, where the new idea of a wall function is introduced, and for the upper bound side, where the authors deploy a new framework for the design of accelerated algorithms.  Related work is adequately cited and the key ideas in previous works are properly summarized and explained, which makes it easier to follow the novel technical arguments.  The results are significant. The authors also provide a number of open problems and conjectures to build on.
