- L109 "These properties imply convergence of the Markov chain defined by t to some stationary distribution": in general, irreducibility and aperiodicity does not imply the existence of a stationary distribution (eg. a standard Random walk).  - the TV metric does not seem like a good metric for measuring convergence in very high-dimensional spaces such as probability distributions on the set of natural images (where GANs are usually leveraged).  - assumption in Section 3.1 are terribly restrictive (especially in high-dim settings) and are not likely to be satisfied in any realistic scenarios where GANs are usually used.  - the paper seems to use the languages of convergence of Markov Chain to motivate an additional "post-processing" step on top of a standard GAN / generative process. This is definitely interesting, although the derivation through minoration conditions / cvg of MC is not that convincing.  - Although the derivation is not convincing, the numerical seem to indicate that the resulting methodology is worthwhile.
