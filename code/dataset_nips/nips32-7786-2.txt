This paper introduces an algorithm for performing Metropolis-Hastings sampling with implicit distributions.   This paper is very well written and the more difficult theory parts of the paper are explained very clearly. I particularly found the bound computed without the use of an optimal discriminator unique and interesting. I consider it a useful contribution to the field of deep generative modeling.  In section 4.1, are the models pretrained with their original objective? VAEs (as proposed) are also not implicit models, and you can actually generate samples “correct” samples from them with annealed importance sampling. Would these samples have a 100% accept rate? In general, the experiment setup could be explained in more detail. For example, do you train an encoder for the VAE?
