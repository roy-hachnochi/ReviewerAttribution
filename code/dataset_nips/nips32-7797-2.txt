Strengths  – Addresses an important problem, and the need for predictive uncertainty under dataset shift is well-motivated.  – Performs and presents a comprehensive set of experiments on several state of the art methods, on datasets across multiple modalities.  – Surveys and summarizes the dominant threads in prior work clearly.  – Includes a comprehensive supplementary material and experimental details to enable reproducibility.  Weaknesses / Questions   – The paper conducts a large scale empirical study, and draws direct conclusions. However, there is little by way of analysis / actionable takeaways from these conclusions. For example, have the authors analyzed why SVI / ensembles tend to perform best for MNIST / CIFAR-10 respectively, towards the goal of building a  better general understanding of what kinds of approaches are best-suited to any given dataset?  – Have the authors investigated the performance on different OOD datasets that are more / less similar to the source dataset (say MSCOCO vs SVHN as OOD for ImageNet), and seen if consistent orderings of the various approaches are observed?  – As an analysis paper with several different sets of experiments, I found the experimental section somewhat disorganized. In particular, Figures 1-2, 4 required repeated cross-referencing, and a consistent ordering scheme for plots would have made for a significantly better read.  – L180: "SVI .. outperforms all methods by a large margin .. ": While SVI does seem to have lower Brier scores with shift, accuracies don’t appear to be any better (figure 1b) – how was this observation made?  – L135: "However, both measure .. not directly measured by proper scoring rules": What are these additional properties that ECE and entropy capture?  ==================== Final recommendation =========================  I have read and am satisfied with the author response and will raise my score to 7. I also recommend that (as mentioned in the author response) experiments to better understand the relation of SVI performance and model specification, and better tuning of dropout models be included in the final version.
