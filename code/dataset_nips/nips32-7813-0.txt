This manuscript considers a novel active learning criterion: namely one of maximizing the true positive rate (TPR) subject to a constraint on the false discovery rate (FDR). The authors draw connections between this paradigm and several existing lines of work including combinatorial bandits and active classification.   The technical results appear sound and interesting. The authors show sample complexity results for FDR control and for pool-based active learning in terms of  novel complexity measures.   The paper is predominantly clearly written. However, I have some minor comments that could aid in enhancing the quality of the presentation:  - The notation, especially in the statement of Theorem 2, is quite difficult to parse. I would encourage the authors to consider ways to aid readability.  - Please provide a sketch of the proof in the main text that highlights the main techniques and difficulties.   I think this manuscript addresses an interesting problem and the presents novel theoretical results and techniques; I think this paper will make a great addition to NeurIPS 19.
