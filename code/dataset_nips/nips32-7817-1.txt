-- The proposed method is novel and has some nice properties. It recovers the distribution of triggers, thereby brings better robustness to the network.  -- The experiments are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the model.  -- This work is well-written with barely grammar mistakes.  -- Figure 1 can be reorganized for better clarity.  -- I do not see major weaknesses in the work. The experiments on more datasets like CIFAR100 and Tiny ImageNet could be a plus.
