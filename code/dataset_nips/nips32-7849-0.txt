The paper is interesting and well-written. It is a little dense, which is somewhat unavoidable given the page limit. It may help if the part on "Graph Theoretic Formulation" was expanded in some way since the high level description is a bit difficult to follow. To make space, it might be possible to move the mention of some of the lemmas to the supplementary material.  I did not go through the proofs in detail.
