1. Originality: High. I think this is quite different from most previous work that involves propagating bounds through the network (for incomplete verification), and MLP/SMT based exhaustive search approaches.   2. Quality: The quality of the work is quite high. My biggest concern is with the experiments (see section on suggested improvements).   3. Clarity: Good. The paper is largely very well written, and quite easy to follow. I appreciate the effort the authors put into the manuscript.   4. Significance: Low. While the approach is new, the evidence is not strong enough here to believe that this is indeed a tractable approach for verifying the exact robustness for deep networks.
