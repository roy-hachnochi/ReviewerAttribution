- Originality: There are two main contributions of this paper. The first one is to consider a CB setting where the context is not known exactly, but only in a distributional sense. The second one is that the author gives an effective algorithm under this setting, analyzing the regret theoretically, and empirically examine the performance on three datasets.   - Significance:  This paper seems to be a useful contribution to the CB literature, and will motivate some new algorithms in this new setting. Also, the author empirically examines how many data will be suitable to form a context set.  - Quality: The theorem is clearly-stated. And I am a little bit concerned about the weak baseline. Even the paper justifies that if we compare with the original baseline, we will get an order T regret without knowing context realization. I am wondering is it possible to give a stronger regret analysis (compared with the original strong baseline) under some specific cases (say with some restriction on the context distribution and reward structure)?  For the experiments, in the Movielens case, it is interesting to see the hidden (with sample 100) is better than hidden (expected), any justifications? Also for the Crop Data case, it is better to include some justifications about the very small advantage of using exact context.   -Clarity: The paper is well-written and it will be great if there are more explanation of the results from the experiments.
