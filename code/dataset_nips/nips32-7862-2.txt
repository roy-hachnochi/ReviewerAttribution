This paper is interesting and well written in general. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper that studies contextual (stochastic) bandits with context distributions, which is an interesting problem. After a high-level check, I think the analysis is (high-level) technically correct. The experiment results are also interesting.  My only major concern is that this paper might be relatively technically straightforward based on existing literature. In particular, the proof for Theorem 1 (the major theoretical result) seems to be quite straightforward by identifying some Martingale difference sequences. Please clarify!  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have read the rebuttal and prefer to keep my score.
