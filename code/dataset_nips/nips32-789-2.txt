Strength (beyond the points mentioned in the contribution): 1. This paper establishes a new framework for interpretability evaluation. The proposed method extends interpretability mining to the granularity level of attribution and enhances it with ambiguity class pairs. 2. This paper is well-organized. The author provides motivation with detailed examples and mathematical formulations to quantify the concept of insecurities. 3. This paper has a rigorous experimental design and convincing evaluation standard. The comparison on different formulation of difficulty score is particularly relevant to this field of research since they stand for different rationale for quantifying ambiguity.    Weakness: A limitation of this method is that it needs to be trained on datasets that have strong annotation of feature. Most classification dataset lacks such annotation. A reasonable next step of research could focus on the automatic discovery and proposal of features that are relevant for the downstream tasks.
