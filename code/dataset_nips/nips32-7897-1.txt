Detailed comments: I have several comments to this work: 1. In general, the idea of this paper is novel and interesting, which provides a new way for human to understand the neural networks. Three applications for ExactLine are introduced and some interesting results are shown to investigate questions about the neural networks. 2. For the Integrated Gradients, experimental results are expected to prove whether the exact IG computed by equation (8) can generated better saliency maps than the approximate IG computed by equation (6). 3. Although the proposed method provided some new insights about the behavior of the neural networks, the application of the proposed method seems limited. The authors also admit that the results for the adversarial examples do not show whether reduced density of linear partitions contributes to robustness. Is there a way to utilize the proposed method to better distinguish the adversarial examples or better design more robust neural networks? More thinking about how to utilize the proposed method are expected.
