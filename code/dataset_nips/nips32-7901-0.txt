There are various applications in ML (e.g. intensities in point processes) that learning a positive function is desired. Link function and Projection-based methods are among the popular approaches to this problem. This paper proposes a nonparametric efficient method with the theoretical guarantee to learn such functions.   How to choose the proper Bregman divergence?  In the eq(4), what is the role of the first term which does not depend on x?  The paper is generally well written and the conditions are clearly mentioned. The impact of the work is justified by the authors. I generally liked the idea and recognized it as a good step towards constrained optimization.  Update: After reading the rebuttal, I would like to keep my score and recommend this paper for acceptance.
