The authors clearly addressed my concerns so I raised my score from 6 to 7.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- The paper is well written and the methodology is potentially useful in this literature. However I have a few major concerns.   (1) The exact conformal prediction set may not be an interval but a union of multiple intervals in principle. This is problematic from a statistical and a practical point of view. That is partly the reason why split conformal set (e.g. Lei et al. 2018) or cross-validated conformal set (e.g. Barber et al. 2019) is preferred because they guarantee the set to be an interval despite some efficiency loss. For instance, if the prediction set is [3, 5]U[7, 9], how can practically interpret why 5 and 7 are in the set while 6 is not? Back to the exact conformal prediction set, in most cases we do not need this set other than its left and right endpoints, say C_L and C_U, based on which we can construct a confidence interval [C_L, C_U].  However, much of the efforts in this paper are made on approximating the whole set which appears to be an overkill. For this reason, I do not see why we need to use the homotopy method to approximate the exact conformal set.  (2) How do you choose y_min and y_max? Underestimating y_max or overestimating y_min may significantly reduce the coverage. There must be a theoretically guaranteed way to select these two parameters.   (3) On the other hand, if they can be chosen, as mentioned in point (1), we only need to find C_L = \inf\{y > y_min: \pi(y) > \alpha\} and C_U = \sup\{y < y_max: \pi(y) > \alpha\}, which seems to be much easier problem than approximating the whole conformal set.  Minor points:  (1) Equation (15): the right parenthesis in the denominator is missing.   (2) Proposition 5 in Supplementary Material: equation (30), G_y(\beta(y, \theta(y))) --> G_y(\beta(y), \theta(y)); line 386, D_y(\theta) --> D_y(theta(y)); line 386, \theta - \hat{\theta}(y) --> \theta(y) - \hat{\theta}(y).
