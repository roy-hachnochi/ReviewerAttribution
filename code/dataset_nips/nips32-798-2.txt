1. Originality: The technique proposed in the paper to update an approximate solution to certain optimization problems for streaming data is inspired from previous work on homotopy continuation, but is an interesting and new contribution. Combined with its use for efficiently constructing conformal sets, the contribution is novel. The paper clearly indicates prior work and distinguishes itself from the existing methods.  2. Quality: The submission is technically sound. The theoretical claims are supported with proofs and the work represents relatively complete body.  3.Clarity: The paper is clear and well-written for the most part. Please see improvements for further comments.  4. Significance: The paper proposes an efficient method for an emergency problem of interest to construct distribution-free prediction intervals for machine learning problems. The numerical performance of the method indicates promising results compared to an existing method and is likely to draw interest from researchers working on similar problems. The technique used to build the method is additionally also of independent interest and potentially might have other useful applications.
