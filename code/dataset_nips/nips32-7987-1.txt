There is a lot of literature for this extensively studied problem; so no novelty on the problem setting. The authors present a new algorithm that is shown to be effective in challenging generating models where the outlier columns are very close to each other, or very close to the span of the inliers.  In Data Model 1 definition, "m" is a typo. It should be M_1. The notation of [B (A+N)]T is not very clear, and potentially confusing, until you stare at the Notation section that comes later. This is an example of poor writing. The ideas in the iSearch algorithm seem to be reasonable but nothing strikes me as ground breaking. If inliers lie in a low dimensional linear subspace and we compute a direction that agrees maximally with any one such inlier, such a direction will be not so much in agreement with outliers that don't lie in this subspace. So it does seem like a relatively simple observation. The theoretical work is possibly what may make this paper acceptable to readers with a theoretical bent. That said, while the theorems seem to be analytical guarantees, it is difficult to see what that means practically. If the guarantees kick in only in conditions that lead to easy instances, then the usefulness of such theoretical guarantees is limited. So I'm mildly positive on the paper and recommend the below score.
