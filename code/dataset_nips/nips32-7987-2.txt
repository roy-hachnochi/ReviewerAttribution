This work presents a provable algorithm for detecting outliers based on robust PCA. I am impressed by the analysis and results on the different distributions of the outliers. The theoretical proof is solid.   I only have a few concerns:  a) In the introduction, the authors failed to mention many other robust PCA works.  b) Can the authors introduce more on Assumption 1 and Assumption 2?  Why are they valid and how are they related to practical applications?
