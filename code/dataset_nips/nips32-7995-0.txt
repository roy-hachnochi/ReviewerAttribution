This paper proposes a framework for casting a Markov process model at equilibrium as an SCM to enable counterfactual inference.   The authors claim that the proposed procedure alleviates the identifiability drawback of the SCMs. Then the authors show that with the monotonic assumption, the SCM is identifiable. It is not quite clear to me why it is the benefit of the proposed procedure.  The proposed procedure assumes the Binomial distribution of the observed variables, which is quite restrictive. It would be much better if the paper could cover more general cases.    After rebuttal----- Thanks for the rebuttal. It has solved my confusions. I have raised the score to 6.
