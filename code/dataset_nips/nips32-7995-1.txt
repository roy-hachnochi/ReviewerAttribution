The key research questions of this paper concern the conditions under which a Markov process model of a system observed at equilibrium can be successfully converted to an SCM. A complete answer to this question would require proofs of soundness (Any input MPM is successfully converted to an SCM) and completeness (All MPMs can be converted to SCMs), which are not included in the paper.  In their response, the authors note that "any probability model there exists a class of SCM models that are equivalent to that probability model in distribution," and say that they will "emphasize this point in the revised manuscript by including a lemma that translates this general result to our case."  At a technical level, the paper is dense.  For complete understanding of this paper, readers would have to understand Markov process models, structural causal models, some amount of molecular biology, and several areas of mathematics.  I apparently lack the background in Markov process models, molecular biology, and perhaps some areas of mathematics to fully understand the contributions of the paper.  In their response, the authors promise to "adjust the text to make the key findings more succinct, and move biological exposition and mathematical details that are not essential to communicating those findings to Supplementary Materials."  The authors position the work well within the larger context of work on causal inference, including some fairly obscure but extremely interesting recent work on causal inference applied to RL.
