Originality This paper does not focus on developing a novel method.  All disentanglement methods have been previously proposed. The WReN that solves the abstract reasoning tasks is also an existing method. Simply combining these methods does not seem novel.   Quality I have concerns about the methodology adopted in this paper. The paper focuses on discussing the relationship between the accuracy of the abstract reasoning tasks and the disentanglement score. However, disentanglement scores can only be computed when the ground-truth factors of variation are available. If ground-truth factors are available, then we can directly use the ground-truth factors to train WReN and achieve excellent performance, as shown in Figure 2, or we can train regressors/classifiers that predict the ground-truth factor before training WReN; but we do not need disentanglement learning.  If ground-truth factors are not available, then we can not compute disentanglement scores, and we are not able to utilize the results are shown in Figure 3, 4 and 5 to select the best disentangled representation. Therefore, It looks to me that disentanglement learning is not very helpful in abstract reasoning tasks.   Clarity This paper is well-organized and not difficult to follow.  Significance The details are provided in Section 1. I think the contribution of this paper would be reasonable, if the authors can address my concerns about the methodology.  Minor issues It looks to me that the word "up-stream" in this paper should be changed to "down-stream"
