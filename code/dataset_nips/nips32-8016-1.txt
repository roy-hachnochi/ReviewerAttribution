Originality. This paper is a good combination of the techniques in [28] and [36]. This allows to obtain a stochastic method with cheaper iteration for the problem considered in [36]. At the same time, Table 1 does not give clear advantage in comparison with [36]. It seems that even for moderate eps, 1/eps^3 can be larger than the size N of the dataset.  Quality. As far as I see, the proofs are correct. Experiments show the advantage of the stochastic method.  There are some misprints and questions. I refer to the supplementary material. 1. line 41 form -> from 2. line 145 computetion -> computation 3. Lemma 7. There should be \tilde{s}_k in the l.h.s. of the inequality instead of s_k. Similarly in the proof starting with the first inequality in the long derivation, tilde is missing for s_k in the first term $<\nabla_x E_{\Omega} f(x_k, \Omega)-d_k, s_k-x_k >$. 4. In (29) where does the first inequality follow from? 5. Line 505 cauchy-schwarz -> Cauchy-Schwarz 6. Line 532. Could you please give more details on how this inequality follows form the choice of the coefficients?  Clarity. Except the questions listed above, the clarity is rather good. I don't have any further suggestions for improvement.  Significance. Despite not optimal complexity, this method can be useful in practice because of its cheaper iteration and ability to solve the problem in the online setting. Also there is a room for follow-up papers with improved complexity.  =========After rebuttal============  I'd like to thank the authors for their rebuttal. Providing more details in the final version will improve the quality of the paper. I leave my score unchanged.
