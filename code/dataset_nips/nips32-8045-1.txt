What are the black dashed lines in Fig 3?  How are the subspaces discovered by DCA particularly interpretable? What do they "look" like, for instance in any of the real-world datasets show in Fig. 4? Would visualizing any of them be illuminating about underlying structures and mechanisms beyond what would have been possible with, say, PCA?  How does the method scale with dimensionality and duration of the data?   The frequency-domain method outlined is very cool.
