The specific topic of this paper is somewhat outside my area.  Originality: the paper seems original/novel, as far as I can tell. Quality: the algorithms and theoretical results seem interesting, at least from a theoretical point of view. The details of the proofs are a bit outside my area of competence so I won't comment on those. The experiments seem sound. Clarity: the paper is quite clearly written. Significance: I am less confident about the broad significance of the work because I am not so familiar with work which focuses on tree structures (see below). However, the introduction of the general adaptive strategy seems like it would be of broad interest.  One element that is lacking in my opinion is the motivation for this restricted setting. I understand the general motivation for optimal experiment planning for causal discovery, but I'm not sure what justifies the restriction to tree structures. Is there some (scientific) setting where this is substantively reasonable? If so, could there be a real data application from such a scientific setting, or at least a simulation that closely emulates that setting?  - (typo) pg 3 ln 120: {X1,X4,X5}
