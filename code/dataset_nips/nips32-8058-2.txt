This work proposes adaptive algorithms for selecting nodes to intervene in order to discover the causal directions. Their approach is based on an assumption that the underlying structure is a tree.  They proved that their algorithms could identify the causal structure with number of interventions within a constant factor of the optimal algorithm. Their analysis are divided into noiseless and noisy observation settings. They also provide algorithms for settings in which there exists intervention restriction (some nodes cannot be intervened) or settings in which it is ideal for the experimenter to perform k interventions in sequence.   The paper is sound and nicely written.  Although, I have not gone through the proofs in the appendix.  A precise definition of tree would make the claim of the paper more rigorous. Based on the presented algorithms in the paper, it seems that the underlying assumption is that the true causal structure should be a directed tree (it only has one root). If this is the case, it should be mentioned in Section 2.  As it is also mention in the Introduction section, the assumption that the underlying structure is a tree is quite restrictive. Could the authors elaborate on different scenarios that such tree-structures may emerge, i.e., for what type of applications such tree-structures are relevant?  The definition and existence of the central node highly depend on the tree-structure of the graph. This may limit the generalizability of the proposed algorithms.
