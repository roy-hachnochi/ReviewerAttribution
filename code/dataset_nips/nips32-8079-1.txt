- The proposed search space is new and the model transformation method for practical NAS for object detection task is interesting. However, the search pipeline is largely based on previous works on gradient-based NAS, which makes the novelty of the proposed method limited. - The paper is well written and easy to follow. The authors clearly outline the problem that they are trying to solve, and the experiments look reasonable. - Experiments on various detectors clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed search method and search space. - The efficiency of the discovered method is not discussed although it is mentioned in line 63: "and keep the inference times almost the same". The log file provided in supplementary material is also not clear enough. Since adding extra paths and dilated convolution may introduce considerable computational overhead, it is important to provide a detailed runtime report on inference speed to further validate the efficiency.  Update: The rebuttal addressed my concern on the efficiency of the discovered models. Although I still think the technical contribution of this paper is limited, I agree with the other reviewers that the proposed practical NAS method for objection detection can be a new and promising direction in future research. I think this is a good paper overall. Therefore, I would like to revise my score to 6.
