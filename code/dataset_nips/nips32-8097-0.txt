         I actually don't have much to say about this paper. It is clearly written and easy to understand. It presents compelling results which outperform existing techniques.          I'm not sure why the title of the paper refers to "computational mirrors"---this feels out of place and it's not referred to in the paper except in the very last section (the conclusion). Also, since motion is the focus of the work, perhaps it would be worth mentioning "video" in the title? Perhaps something like "Blind Inverse Video Light Transport by Deep Matrix Factorization"?
