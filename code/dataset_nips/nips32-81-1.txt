Overall, the introduced method is interesting and novel, however, the paper is not yet in a state to be acceptable for publication. Some parts of the paper appear too ad-hoc and it is not not always clear what the contribution of the introduced method is. More details below:   - The third and fourth paragraph of Section 1 appear convoluted and are difficult to follow. It should be more clear what the motivation of the introduced technique is.   - Section 2: it is not sufficiently explained how the presented approach differs from existing methods, e.g. such as FoveaBox or MetaAnchor. This should clarified.   - The text states 'The proposed approach breaks the IoU restriction, allowing objects to flexibly select anchors ...". However, in Section 3, it then states 'a hand-crafted criterion based on IoU is used.' This is confusing. What for was the IoU criterion used? What is similar/different to existing approaches.   - a^{loc}_j is defined to be in R4. Which dimensions are defined here? It later becomes clear from the context, but it should be more formally defined.   - The definitions in lines 101, 102 are ambiguous and should be clarified. How is SmoothL1 defined?  - 'bg' as e.g. in \mathcal(\theta)^{bg} is not defined.   - Why do \mathcal{P}(\theta)^{cls}_{ij} \mathcal{P}(\theta)^{bg}_{j} together define class confidence?  - Lines 110 - 113: If Eq. 2 strictly considers the optimization of classification and localization of anchors but it ignores how to learn the matching matrix C what is the conclusion here? Is this a limitation?  - L121: 'it requires to guarantee...'. What requires to guarantee?  - Some equations (e.g. Eq. 4) are not necessary to explain the contribution of the paper and should be moved to the Appendix. This would help to sharpen the presentation of the contribution. Similarly for Eq. 5 and 6.   - It is not clear what is the relationship of the Mean-max function and insufficient training. Why will it be close to the Mean when training is not sufficient? What is X? It becomes clear later in the text, but as presented this appears too ad-hoc.   - Figure 2 and 3 could be moved to the Appendix to make room for more important figures.   - What is meant by 'inheriting the parameters' (L156)?  - L200: Is is not clear how a 'bag' of anchors was constructed and how they where selected.   - The quantitative evaluation discussed in Section 4.2 (and the qualitative results in Supplementary Material) is interesting. However, it would have been more informative to also provide the average performance across all categories. Also, it is not clear why 'couch' is considered a slender object.   - The results presented in Table 3 are interesting but the presented approach only marginally improve upon existing work or not at all. The cases for which it works well and does not are not sufficiently discussed.    - No limitations are discussed. In which situations does the approach fail, also compared to existing work?
