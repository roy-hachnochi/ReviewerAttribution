The paper analyzes when to model-based planning instead of replay-based learning and uses several examples to illustrate the idea and also gives theoretical analyses. This paper is well-written and easy to understand. The analysis is inspiring for other researchers and contributes to the RL fields.   Comments after author response: Although the experiments are not extensive and the generality of the claims should be validated further, it's beneficial to solicit the discussion of some fundamental issues in RL, such as MPC and replay memory.   It's better to clarify the generality ability of claims before a jump of conclusion.
