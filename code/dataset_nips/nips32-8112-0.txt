While a general solution is indeed a contribution to the literature, it does not seem overly significant. Even the motivation in S1 on p1 states "Unfortunately, an empirical survey, reproducing and comparing all these different approaches, is still missing."   The paper organization is questionable. Section 2 has eight subsections with new work starting in sub-section 2.4. Perhaps it would be clearer to include background information in section 2 and start new work in section 3.  There are grammatical errors, including the first sentence of the Abstract. The paper flip-flops between CNNs and convolutional neural networks on p2, for instance. Pick one and be consistent.
