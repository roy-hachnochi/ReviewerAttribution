Updates after author response:  - Based on author response and comments from other reviewers, I have raised my score to a 7. - Thank you for clarifying rule 9. The violation of ancestrality is what I was missing if W o-> Y is oriented instead of X o-> Y. This violation is not mentioned in the paper itself as part of the reasoning and is probably important to include. - While reviewer 1 mentioned nested Markov models as retaining more information, the author response is insightful, in that this is true only in the case of hard interventions. In addition, the use of nested Markov models at the moment is restricted due to lack of an FCI type procedure, and indeed characterization of nested Markov equivalence, as pointed out in the author response. - The introduction of a new kind of graph, like the augmented MAG here, still requires justification of its edges as being meaningful re: edges from intervention nodes to nodes that are not intervened on. So a short description of this in the supplement would be good. - Again in the supplement, the authors may consider adding an informal analysis of what additional orientation rules may be necessary/not necessary to prove completeness of the proposed algorithm. - Overall, this is a good submission, and I vote for its acceptance.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ - Does focusing on soft interventions allow us to side-step violations of faithfulness brought about by determinism as discussed in [9]?  - Page 2, line 67 do you mean F_X is *not* *m*-separated from Y given X?  - What are the advantages of the present work over methods like [9], and [19]? I'm aware that SAT-solver methods may face scalability issues but [9] is also an FCI type method and should be quite fast. Concrete comparisons with simulations would be useful.  - In theorem 2, a more elegant characterization of Markov equivalence in MAGs should be preferred. See [a] https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aos/1247836670.  Two MAGs G1 and G2 may be Markov equivalent but a path p may not be discriminating for a vertex U in both G1 and G2. See figure 6 (i) and (ii) in [a]. This means that discriminating paths must be searched for in both graphs and such a search can be super-polynomial in complexity. The preferred characterization is that two MAGs are Markov equivalent if and only if they have the (1) same skeleton and (2) same colliders with order -- theorem 3.7 in [a]. In any case, statements regarding Markov equivalence in MAGs should cite the work in [a]. One could also cite the work in [b] https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1360%2F04ys0023.pdf but this criterion is not used as much.  - FCI can only be said to be consistent when the underlying data generating process is Markov and faithful to a MAG. None of the example DGPs shown in this paper correspond to a MAG. Though acyclic directed mixed graphs may be converted to MAGs as described in [23], this seems to present some problems. In a MAG, some directed edges have different interpretations as being visible or invisible (also discussed in [23]). This seems more problematic when discussing directed edges added from intervention nodes in the augmented MAG to nodes other than the variables being intervened on (as in Figure 2 in the paper). What does it mean for such a directed edge to exist between an interventional node that has a very special meaning in this context and a node that it was not meant to intervene on in the original problem formulation. Does the analogue of visible and invisible edges straightforwardly carry over? One could force FCI to rule out the presence of a directed edge between an interventional node and all other variables on the graph besides the nodes being intervened on (in fact the presence of an edge between the interventional node and the intervened node should be enforced as background knowledge) but there is no MAG that is Markov equivalent to figure 2(a) if such edges are disallowed. In light of this, I feel it is important to address this issue briefly in the text and in more detail in the supplement.  - Since the focus here is on MAGs and FCI, I think the example in Figure 1 should also correspond to a MAG. The current graph in figure 1 couldn't be learned by FCI. The alternative would have to be enumeration of all acyclic directed mixed graphs consistent with the learned partial ancestral graph using a method like [c] https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/view/14951.  -  Rule 8 should reduce to running FCI with background knowledge that no edges can point into vertices in {\cal F} and as mentioned before, the additional knowledge that Fx -> X always exists should also be enforced.  - The formulation of rule 9 is incorrect or imprecise. The definition of an inducing path is incorrectly used in rule 9, line 301: " we can conclude that every non-endpoint node along the inducing path is adjacent to Y in MAG(AugI(D))". The presence of an inducing path between Fx and Y does imply that Fx and Y will be adjacent in the corresponding MAG. However, it does not imply that every non-endpoint along the inducing path is adjacent to Y. The correct definition is used in the proof of soundness of rule 9 in the supplement.  An inducing path between A and B is defined as a path from A to B where every non-endpoint is a collider and an ancestor of at least one of the endpoints A, B. In the PAG learned in Figure 2(c), this criterion is fulfilled by orienting either X o->Y to X->Y or orienting W o-> Y to W -> Y making X an ancestor through X -> W -> Y. Unless there are other properties of Fx (which don't seem to be immediately clear to me and if present should be made more explicit) that determine the orientation of the X o-> Y edge, it seems that X can be an ancestor of Y in multiple ways. While I see mention that the inducing path must pass through X, it is not clear why X could not be an ancestor in different ways. If rule 9 is invalid in this respect, this affects the soundness of the procedure.  - The conclusion is great, I thank the authors for precisely pointing out what extensions and open problems may still be worked on.
