The authors propose a neurally plausible model for online recognition of task-relevant neurons. The key implication is that stochastic shared modulation acts as a “tag” for task-relevant neurons so that the downstream population can quickly and easily learn the important neurons for subsequent computations. As a proof-of-concept the authors apply this theory to the construction of a decoder for a simulated binary classification task but the theory plausibly extends beyond this regime. The biggest caveat to the theory is that it is unclear how the task-relevant neurons would be tagged in the first place, but the authors are up-front about this in the discussion.  Overall, the paper is exceptionally well written and is well motivated with relevant literature in the Introduction.  The mathematics were easy to follow as was the reasoning for each choice of decoder classification rules.    While most of the figures were well-selected and complimented the ideas in the paper effectively, Figure 3B is difficult to parse.  The figure is not well labeled and the color choices appear to obscure the plotted curves on one side or the other of the vertical line. Does this line correspond to the optimum from panel A? Which decoder/model is this in reference to? Is there something I’m missing about why it is plotted this way? The authors used the MSE to asses decoding performance.  Other than the fact that MSE decomposes into bias and variance, would it not have been a more natural choice to use the cross-entropy?
