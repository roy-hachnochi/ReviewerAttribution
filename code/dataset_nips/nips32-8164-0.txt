The paper proposes theoretical bounds of the predict and optimize problem, using Natarjan dimensions and margin based bound ideas.  The bounds appear novel and contribute towards the analysis of the predict and optimize problem, but unfortunately this isn't my field and difficult to review the novelty and innovation of the paper.  The presentation is clear, and even for someone not in the field, the main logic and flow can be followed.  One suggestion is it would make it more accessible by providing one or two sentences in each section to give the overall picture of how that section fits with the overall logic and contributions of the paper.  This will allow readers, even if not in the area, to get a better sense of the overall picture.
