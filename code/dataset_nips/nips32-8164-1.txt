I have read the author rebuttal. This is a good work. I have nothing to add.   ====  This paper studies the problem of minimizing a linear function on a compact convex set, where the loss vector is not known but needs to be predicted given a feature vector and a dataset of feature-loss pairs.   The problem formulation is not new and can be found in [7]. While [7] focuses on the computational aspect, this submission provides the first (as far as I know) generalization error guarantee.   The statistical learning formulation is reasonable. The first generalization error bound in Section 3 is standard. The derivation of the second generalization error bound in Section 4 is sufficiently novel and interesting to me. The presentation is outstanding; all required information is given without obvious redundancy; the technical results are well connected by the paragraphs.   As the first learning theoretic analysis of a well motivated problem, the significance of this submission is obvious. In particular, there are many immediate open problems as discussed in Section 5.
