The paper is clear and well organized. The technical content seems simple and correct. The biggest weakness is that they exploit the fact that categories are known, while in the literature I found more general works  (with unknown categories see Regional Multi-Armed Bandits, Zhiyang Wang et al. 2018; or with similarities information see Contextual Bandits with Similarity Information, Aleksandrs Slivkins 2009). Moreover, I did not understand why the three dominance relations should be relevant. According to the defined regret, they compete against the policy always pulling the best arm mu_1^1. Therefore, I wonder why they do not reject all the categories i: mu_1^i < mu_1^1. I do not see any original technical aspect, the novelty seems to be in the dominance relations but I do not see why they are really necessary. As more general approaches exist, I do not see how this project can be an useful starting point for additional research projects. ==== I have carefully read the authors comments. I still have doubts concerning the dominance relations. I do think that they are too strong to represent real situations. Besides that, I think that the proposed solution does not fully address the proposed setting.
