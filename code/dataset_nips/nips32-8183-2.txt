The setting introduced in this paper is novel and interesting. I don't think adding the group sparse dominance criterion adds much value, it is also unrealistic from an applications point of view.  The idea of categorized bandits is not new as the authors note. While the related work covers most of the papers, I would like to bring the authors' attention to https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07176 for completeness, which tries to cluster and rank the clusters (as opposed to this work where the clusters are pre-specified), and uses the strong dominance relation between the clusters.  The CATSE algorithm can be improved for the group-sparse case. According to the equation after line 218, a category becomes active if there exists an arm whose lower bound is greater than 0 - at this point the algorithm has identified the winning category and stops. Until this point, CATSE pulls all arms. However, categories where there exist arms whose upper bound is less than 0 need not be pulled, and can be eliminated.  I would like to see details of murphy sampling (code that I can read would be great).  Other suggestions: 1) add error bars to the plots 2) use dotted for 0 and solid for s in Fig 3a for easy distinguishing between the two dominances.  == After rebuttal == I have read the author's response. The consensus we had was that the dominance relations are strong and impractical.
