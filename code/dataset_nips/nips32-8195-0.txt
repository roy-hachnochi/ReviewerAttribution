I find the problem that the paper addresses quite interesting and with potential practical value. As far as I know this specific problem has not been studied before in the differential privacy literature, although it is in spirit similar to other problems that have been extensively studied, e.g. private query release. The protocol that the paper proposes adapts in a non-trivial way the non-private greedy algorithm and I find interesting the combination of the different parts: the two hash functions and the auction. On the negative side, in some places the paper is quite unclear. For instance I find the trust model not discussed enough, since there are different parties involved I think it would be good if the paper could better explain their level of trust and their relations. Similarly there are several inconsistenties that make the results difficult to follow, e.g. in line 228, where is the j used? Another aspect I find quite lacking is the experimental evaluation. The experiment the paper presents are rather limited in scope. I would have felt more confident if they were repeated for different values of the privacy parameters and over different data. In summary, I find this a rather interesting paper with some negative aspects but leaving an overall positive feeling.   Pros: -problem which can have interesting practical applications. -the proposed protocol combines different interesting ideas, including an auction mechanism  Cons: -at time the paper shows imprecise writing -the trust model is at time unclear  -the experimental evaluation is rather limited   Comments after rebuttal ---------------------------- Thanks for your answers. They helped in clarifying several concerns I had. Please, add a more complete discussion of the threat model to the paper, similarly to what you wrote in the rebuttal. In general, I find that more explanations would help in improving the understanding of you our paper.
