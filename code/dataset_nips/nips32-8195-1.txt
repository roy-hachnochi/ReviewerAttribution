This work explores a novel and plausible application setting, in which a data summary must be built from various data-holding entities, while not leaking unintended amounts of data. In addition to requiring privacy, the parsimonious setting places further restrictions on the trusted central computations. This setting also receives a proposed method that combines several state of the art ideas and methods.  Originality: the setting, mechanism, and analysis are novel.  Quality: the proposed setting and mechanism are quite thoroughly explored, with theory and experiments.  Clarity: the work is clearly written and structured.  Significance: the plausibility of the setting and the achieved performance are quite significant.
