The paper reviews Gradient Decent and accelerated methods and provide novel analysis for the accelerated methods.  Originality - the analysis techniques using in the paper are novel. The paper combines known techniques to conclude improved analysis for the known methods. The related work is very well cited and explained.  Clarity. The paper is very well written and organized. Very good review of the subject. The technical parts were left to the appendix. The theorems in the paper are a direct conclusion from "Theorem 4" which is not stated in the main part of the paper. The appendix is harder to understand, The mathematical analysis seems to be correct.   Quality - The authors made a complete work, providing claims analysis and empirical demonstrations. Most of the work is provided in the appendix.  The paper also provided strength and weaknesses for their work. A further analysis of the unstable behavior would be interesting.   Significance. The paper set interesting starting point for further study. It is hard to evaluate the significance of this paper. The analysis techniques are novel and led to improved analysis for the problem. But the paper does not focus on the techniques or how to use them in other scenarios. The results are also novel, but also shown to be "unstable", as the test error tend to explode past the minimum point. It is unclear from practical point of view when should accelerated method should be used.
