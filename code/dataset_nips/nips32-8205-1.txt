This paper adds a link between the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty (widely used in regret minimization setting) and pure exploration problems, and proposes algorithms based on this principle. This idea is natural, and it is not surprised that the proposed algorithms can achieve non-asymptotic guarantee. The paper is clearly written, and it is technically sound. The analysis is a combination of known techniques, mainly from the bandit literature and reference [9], which makes the paper not that novel. The paper proposes several algorithms, but the numerical experiment is not comprehensive.
