(1) This work studies the complexity of pure exploration when the confidence level is a constant. The approach is to solve the minimax optimization problem in the lower bound by viewing it as a two-player game and defining the players' learning dynamics. The authors also discuss a possible trade-off between the power of optimization oracles and the sample complexity guarantee. This seems to me a novel contribution to the field.  (2) Overall, the paper is well-written and not too difficult to follow. I was able to follow the proof sketches in Section 3 and the technical claims in the paper seem valid to me.  (3) My concern about this work is about the significance of the contributions, due to a lack of comparison to previous approaches and results; see Part 5 for details.  *** added after author feedback *** After reading the author feedback, I thank the authors for addressing my concerns and would encourage the authors to add the discussion to the final version.
