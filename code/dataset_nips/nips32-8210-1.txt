(1) Quality: Is the submission technically sound? Are claims well supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results? Is this a complete piece of work or work in progress? Are the authors careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work?  The paper is good quality. The idea of using IPVI for DGPs is interesting and it seems to perform competitively with VI and SGHMC. Experiments are conducted on both toy data, for demonstration purposes, and the most common benchmark datasets.  One aspect that this work could be improved in is further comparison and discussion on the design choices of the IPVI algorithm. Despite the wealth of research on implicit VI (Semi-Implicit Variational Inference by Yin and Zhou, Unbiased Implicit Variational Inference by Titsias and Ruiz), only (Huszar 2017) is cited and briefly discussed. I believe that the use of IPVI warrants a more in-depth discussion.  (2) Clarity: Is the submission clearly written? Is it well organized? (If not, please make constructive suggestions for improving its clarity.) Does it adequately inform the reader? (Note: a superbly written paper provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce its results.)  The paper is well organized and easy to read. It provides good background on DGPs and VI. The IPVI algorithm is described in detail, including pseudocode. It would be possible to reproduce the results based on the paper.  (3) Originality: Are the tasks or methods new? Is the work a novel combination of well-known techniques? Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions? Is related work adequately cited?  The application of IPVI to DGPs is certainly new and interesting, and I like the idea of parameter tying. However, Implicit VI in itself is not new, and this should be made clear. I would recommend citing (Huszar, 2017) in the introduction to make sure that the reader gets the right impression.  (4) Significance: Are the results important? Are others (researchers or practitioners) likely to use the ideas or build on them? Does the submission address a difficult task in a better way than previous work? Does it advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way? Does it provide unique data, unique conclusions about existing data, or a unique theoretical or experimental approach?  I believe that the work is significant to practitioners, as it is an effective way to do inference in DGPs.  ___________________________________________________________________________________________-  After reading the author's reply, I decided to keep my original score.
