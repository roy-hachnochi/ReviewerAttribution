I am somewhat unclear how real the hardware problem is. I mean if we can do realtime neural networks with a million inputs, shouldnt a few channels be quite easy? I guess at Neurips I would like to see more computational work. It was very nice to see real-world usage though. I like the comparison with a broad range of decoders.
