I found the task is new and interesting. I skimmed the proof and it seems sound to me. The paper is clearly written and would be an important building block for handling censored feedback.  Several minor errors: - Line 73 "if the allocated resource is larger...": I suspect it should be "smaller" rather than "larger".  - Equation (2): This is asymptotic lower bound. It should be explicitly noted that the inequality holds when T goes infinite  - Corollary 3: Since we set delta = 1/T, we have W=O(log T). Hence, we cannot say it is asymptotically optimal simply because MP-TS is.  ===After Rebuttal==== Thank you for the rebuttal. I have read the response but it did not change my score. One thing I would like to note is that "asymptotically optimal" does not just mean the regret is O(log T) but means that the regret **equals** the lower bound given in (2). Therefore, you have to make a careful discussion when you insist CSB-ST is indeed optimal in spite of W=O(log T). That is, you have to prove that W is asymptotically ignorable compared to (2). If not,  you should not use the word "optimal".
