This work proposes a simple but efficient extension of POMPDs to MV data by extending the observation/state space over the multiple views and modeling the long-term dependencies between the (latent) states. To deal with multi-view latent variables (states), a variational lower bound is derived and optimized in two settings: model-based and model-free (using run/nn-s). The optimization of the derived objective is not trivial and the authors propose various strategies to effectively deal with the dimension of this problem (including the policy transfer and few-shot-learning ideas). I find this work novel and very well presented.   The paper is well written and easy to follow. The supplementary materials describe in the algorithm details making it easier to understand the model. The state-of-the-art and related approaches are well reviewed and compared with the proposed.   The results on different RL environments show that the proposed can effectively learn underlying shared dynamics (due to the mv modeling), in contrast to the world model.
