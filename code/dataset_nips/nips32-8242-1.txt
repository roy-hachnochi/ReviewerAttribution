This paper proposes a deep-learning based reflection separation approach that uses only a pair of unpolarized and polarized images. Their network combines polarization physics in terms of a semi-reflector orientation that defines the polarization effect, assuming planar semi-reflector geometry and no motion in between the image pair. Their method performs favorably over RefletNet [22] that is fine-tuned on their planar, stationary dataset.  The approach is original in terms of the three points stated in Q1 above. Especially, using a simple pair of unpolarized and polarized images is a great advantage compared to using three polarized images separated in certain angular differences: The scene may change in time while capturing multiple images, which breaks the physical assumption that would cause critical errors during the process. In addition, controlling the polarizer manually in exact angles is hard and very inconvenient, which brings a need of complicated (possibly expensive) hardware for automatic control, such as the experimental vision camera used in this work.   It seems that the proposed method performs slightly better than RefletNet on planar semi-reflector without dynamic motion. However, to be certain they need to improve the experiments further. Please see Q5 for the list of required improvements.
