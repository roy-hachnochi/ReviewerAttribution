The paper proposes a new variant of the popular region proposal networks (RPN). The authors first identify the issue stemming from a misalignment between predefined anchors and the ground truth boxes. They investigate why this issue is not resolved well enough by iterative RPNs and propose to address the issue directly by removing the heuristically defined anchors. This is enabled by: - using a single box per position, - using a combination of anchor-free and anchor-based criteria to define the   positive boxes, - introducing a new adaptive convolution layer that allows the features to be   well-aligned with the anchors.  The experiments show that the method clearly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods (2-4% over the 2nd best method GA-RPN in about the same runtime). The authors also perform an ablation study which shows the contribution of the individual components.  Overall the paper is clearly written and well structured.  Questions / Changes:  - I wonder why the improvements seem to be larger for mainly for large objects   (Table 2, AP_L). Is there an explanation? - Why do you prefer the IOU loss over the more common L1-smooth loss? Have you   tested both? - Please make the font in Figs. 1 & 2 larger - as of now it is too small, which   makes it hard to read the labels. - Correct the typo on L172 "object objectness" -> "objectness".  Also after the rebuttal I think this paper should be accepted.
