- The paper is sufficiently novel and presented clearly. A reader unfamiliar with the Context Tree Weighting technique might have a difficult first read, but as it is a well-known technique in information theory and its applications, I don't think this should be held against it. - The experimental comparison is somewhat light if the papers primary contribution was empirical, but I think it is sufficient in conjunction with the theoretical results, which are well done.  Context Tree Weighting based variants have been used successfully in many different problems (data compression, bioinformatics), but typically deal with relatively low-dimensional binary side information, so this paper provides a method that fills this gap, and in my mind could be built on further by the machine learning community in the future.  Some suggestions for future work: - There is a body of literature which improves on the KT estimator on sequences where the entire alphabet isn't observed, which is a common case when the data is recursively partitioned. I am quite certain the method advocated in this approach could benefit from applying the recently introduced SAD estimator (https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3671) in place of the multi-KT, and the theoretical results extended to this case.
