The authors provides a novel and interesting look into the problem of pure exploration in the multiple-answers setting. The paper was clear in its exposition but the results could have been more insightful by comparing edge cases when this problem collapses to other well know problem.  For example what happens in the best arm setting or the top-k setting? Some of the constants hide the ability to check and compare the results with the state of the art in these cases.  In this paper you can derive bounds for an epsilon-good arm. Garivier and Kauffman (2016) have a lower-bound for such a scenario. Can you recover their lower bounds from your results? That is not clear.
