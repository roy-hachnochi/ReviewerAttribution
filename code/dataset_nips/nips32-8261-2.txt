Originality: This work proves tight bounds for the multi-answer pure exploration setting in the high-confidence regime, which remains open to the best of the reviewer's knowledge. The authors' approach is inspired by previous work on the single-answer setting, yet the work also contains sufficiently new techniques tailored to the challenges imposed by the multi-answer setting.  Quality: I checked the proof sketches in the first eight pages as well as the proof of Theorem 1; they all look technically sound to me.  Clarity: The paper is well-written and relatively easy to understand (considering the amount of technical details).  Significance: This work derives asymptotically optimal bounds for the multi-answer setting, where prior approaches are shown to be not directly applicable due to the non-convexity introduced by the multi-answer assumption. This is a solid and important contribution to the field and also poses a few open questions for future work.  *** added after author feedback *** I have read the rebuttal and my positive evaluation of this work remains unchanged.
