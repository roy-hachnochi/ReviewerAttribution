- The paper is well written and easy to follow. - The proposed idea (combining deep learning and diffusion distance) is clean and well motivated. - The proposed approach can (potentially, though no evidence about it) be applied in other graph applications beyond images. - My big concern is with respect to the evaluation the experimental results. From my understanding (L172), the features are initialized with a network pre-trained on MS-COCO. This means that the ResNet-101 features already embeds strong pixelwise semantic information (acquired with fully supervised training). Therefore it seems not a fair comparison with other method. - I also believe that much of implementation/training details are missing. Eg, what is the optimization algorithm used? What hyper-parameters?
