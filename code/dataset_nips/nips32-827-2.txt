I am not expert to evalute its originality and novelty to semantic segmentation as I am familiar with spectural analysis and diffusion. But my main concerns lie in the experiments. From the method part, I expect it is a general segmentation approach which should be evaluated on standard semantic segmentation dataset. But the experiments lack of such analysis severely. Even on weakly supervised segmentation dataset, it only compared with one baseline.
