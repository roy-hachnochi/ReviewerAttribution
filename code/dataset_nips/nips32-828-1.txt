This is probably the densest paper that this reviewer has seen in a long time. The material has been squashed, almost certainly beyond the point of breaking, to fit within the 8-page limit. This is exemplified by the fact that the supplementary document is 19 pages in length. It would seem to make more sense to present this in a longer format - for example a journal article which would allow for a more clear explanation of the ideas. Or alternatively the paper could (potentially) be split up into separate papers. As such the clarity of the presented work is poor which makes analysis of the quality and significance difficult to assertion.
