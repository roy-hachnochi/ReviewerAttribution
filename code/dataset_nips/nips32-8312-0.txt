------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ POST REBUTTAL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The rebuttal has cleared most of my concerns and I am happy to maintain my score.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   This paper ranks high in novelty as it is the first paper to consider discrete flows and also proposes the first discrete flow transformation layers (XOR and Additive).  The experimental results are strong, especially on Text modelling. Moreover,  the proposed method significantly computationally more efficient compared to competing approaches.  The paper is very well written and easy to understand.  However, the paper suffers from the following (few) shortcomings, 1. The capability of proposed XOR and Additive flow layers are unclear (even in 2D). E.g. in Figure 2 shows results only on a discretised Mixture of Gaussians. The fit to even this distribution is not perfect. The authors should consider a wider array of distributions to more convincingly demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed flow layers. E.g. discretised versions of the distributions analysed in [1].  2. Some important details are unclear. E.g. what is the base distribution for sampling? Is it the factorised marginal distribution? If it is how is it estimated in high dimensions (given that the number of data samples needed for an accurate estimate would grow exponentially)?   [1] Invertible Residual Networks, Behrmann et. al.
