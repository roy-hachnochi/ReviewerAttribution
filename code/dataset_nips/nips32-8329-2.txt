- The paper is well written and the model details are clear for the reader.  - The model is evaluated in two well-known datasets and compare to a handful of relevant baselines.  - Results suggest the model improves over previous state of the art. The models seems to advance the state-of-the-art.   - I believe it would be interesting for the reader to better understand the effect of the time window on the final computation.   - I believe the reader would benefit from more failures examples in the paper. The examples shown are all success examples.
