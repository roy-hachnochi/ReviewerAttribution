This paper is well written and the contribution is clearly descibed. My main concern is whether the assumption of correlated pairs of noisy images is helpful for real-world image denoising. I expect that the authors can give us some examples and initial results to illustrate this point for real application tasks.   My second concern is that the proposed method is derived based on AWGN, while the real noise may be far different from such assumption and can be both signal-dependent and spatially variant.

It seems that the proposed method is sensitive to the paramter \epison (see Lines 202~203). Thus, it is suggested to conduct an ablation study to see the effect of \epison.
