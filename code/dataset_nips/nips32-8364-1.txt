The paper propose the truly and in exactly alternating least squares. Instead of approximately solving two independent linear systems, in each iteration, the algorithm solves two coupled linear systems of half the size.  The submission is clearly written, and well structured. Setting up the premise, reviewing related work and motivation for the authors proposed algorithm. The mathematical derivations appear correct and algorithm runtime complexity is provided (proofs in supplementary material). The proposed algorithm and results are in my view significant, showing the ability to cut run time while retaining quality measures.   The experiments section could be expanded to further detail the results. E.g. providing some views on the difference of performance (where existing methods fail to work or unable to find a solution). Likewise, in the experiments (or discussion) section, a view as to whether the proposed algorithm would work in all cases or a set of them (indication for possible future work).
