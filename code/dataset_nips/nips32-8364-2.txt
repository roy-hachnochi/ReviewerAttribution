SUMMARY: The paper presents a technical improvement to the alternating least-squares (ALS) solution to CCA. The novel method is named “Truly and Inexact Alternating Least Squares” (TALS). The idea is to solve two coupled linear systems of half size per iteration. In previous work, two independent linear systems have been solved which deteriorates the final canonical correlation between the views due to inaccurate assignment of the weights on the variables. Additionally, a faster version, FastTALS, is proposed. FastTALS applies momentum acceleration to increase the speed of the optimisation. The momentum hyperparameter requires tuning, and in case hand-tuning is not preferred, an adaptive version of FastTALS is proposed. It automatically sets the tuning hyperparameter, during optimisation.  ORIGINALITY: It is a novel idea to couple together two linear systems of half size compared to the two previous approaches. In the paper, it is clearly demonstrated what the two previous approaches and the proposed method look like. The literature review is adequate and well-referenced.  QUALITY: The theory presented is complete and proved. The presented method and its advanced versions are empirically assessed on three real-world datasets: Mediamill, MNIST, and JW11. The proposed methods are compared with the two earlier approaches. The performances of the methods are assessed using a (novel?) measure by computing the squared sine value of the largest principal angle between the learnt weight matrix and the ground truth obtained using MATLAB’s svds function. In other words, the performance is evaluated in terms of convergence to the ground truth U and V. The convergence to U and V is shown as a function of the time and numbers of passes through the data. More experiments are reported in the supplementary material. Overall, the proposed approach is evaluated both theoretically and empirically.   CLARITY: The paper is clearly written and well-organised. The MATLAB implementations of TALS and FastTALS are accessible through an anonymous dropbox link, so the presented results can possibly be reproduced.   SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed approach seems to give both a significant speed-up to ALS-based CCA and improve the accuracy of the results. For practitioners, it is important that the canonical weights are correct so that the relations between the variables can be inferred. Therefore, this approach would be recommended instead of the previous ones.  *** AFTER REBUTTAL*** I have read the authors' response and other reviewers' comments.
