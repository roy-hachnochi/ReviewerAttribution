Originality:  The questions proposed in the paper are interesting and novel. The solutions and conclusion can have a huge impact on the ML community. Quality: The theoretical result looks pretty solid. But I have some doubts in the experimental section: in Table1, how could the row be “nat”(natural) and the column could be “rob”(adversarial examples)? Maybe one is the setting in training and the other is how you generate the test examples? Clarity: The paper shows many interesting findings, however, it is not easy to get. For example, “ Trade-off natural vs. adversarial accuracy” is very obscure and it takes me some time to figure out what the paragraph is trying to convey. It would be nice to make the paragraph title more consistent and explicit.  Significance: The findings can be influential for practical usage.
