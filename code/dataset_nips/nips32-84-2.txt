Post rebuttal: the author feedback addresses my concerns, though I still think the readability of the paper needs improvement. I increased the overall score. --------- My main concern is that the main algorithm (Sec 4) and the privacy analysis are not clearly stated, making it hard to check the quality of the paper. More specifically, In terms of clarity, - Algorithm 1 and 2 needs to be better explained in the text. The pseudo code can also be made more readable, for example, Line 4 and 7 are actually if-then-else statements but the else parts are implicit (the full version is better).  - PTERRIFICBALL should be explained more. It is unclear how much noise is added.  - It seems to me Algorithm 1 would find k clusters. Yet the recursive part calls it twice with k-1. Doesnâ€™t that mean we would have 2(k-1) clusters? - Line 3 in Algorithm 2 mentioned a subroutine PGE which is not defined. PGE seems to be important as it is the main component in Algorithm 2 that guarantees Differential Privacy.  - Line 251, is TerrificRadius the same as TerrificBall?  In terms of privacy analysis: - In Algorithm 2, why do we add Lap(1/epsilon) noise to |Cj|? Is the sensitivity 1?
