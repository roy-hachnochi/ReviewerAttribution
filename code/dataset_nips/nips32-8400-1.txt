Thanks to the author for their response. I think the author should discuss the algorithmic challenges associated with the proposed approach in the main body of the paper.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Originality - I think the paper is fairly original. I have not seen many applications of Fourier transforms or complex analysis in RL, so the idea of the paper is very novel and fairly exciting.   Quality - Overall, I am happy with the quality of the paper. The paper does a good job of laying the theoretical groundwork for using characteristic value function for analysis in RL. For what I could check the Math seemed ok.   Clarity - The paper is clear and well-written.   Significance - I think the paper can have future significance.   I like the paper for its originality. The idea of using characteristic value function is new and unique to me. The paper follows up nicely on the idea of proposing natural extensions like characteristic value functions, value iteration, etc.  My main criticism is that I donâ€™t see why it would be advantageous to use CVF instead of just the traditional way of maintaining VF. The paper does not talk about the application of its method. There are no experiments or application of the procedure proposed. This is a major weakness.   However, I do believe novel ideas like this are good for conference discussions.
