The introduction is very well written and the method and problem setting are well motivated. The methods are not all original, but are rather an interesting use-case/application of existing methods and are a useful contribution.  In section 2, the authors present the BELGAM model, but should cite similar models (ie BNNs in the context of a VAE) that have been used for LVMs in the past (for example, Johnson et al 2016)  Section 2 introduces a lot of notation, which could be better summarized in a table.  I couldnâ€™t quite follow the explanation of the PVAE; is S_i a matrix or a vector?  How do you compute KL(q(theta | X)||p(theta))? Since q(theta|X) is only sampled via a Markov chain, how do you compute its entropy and therefore take its gradient?  The experimental validation is quite extensive and is a strength of the paper.
