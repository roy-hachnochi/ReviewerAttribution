This submission aims to establish recovery guarantees for deep image prior methods used in solving (linear) inverse problems. Motivated by compressive imaging and phase retrieval, a projection gradient descent (PGD) approach is adopted that entails projecting onto the range of deep networks. For Gaussian measurement matrices the convergence of the PGD method to the ground truth is established for compressive imaging as well as the phase retrieval observation models.   Strong points: -recovery guarantees for deep image prior is a very important problem -the technical analysis is solid  Weak points: -the novelty of the proof technique seems to be incremental; it seems to be a combination of the results in [Bora et al’17] for RIP and [Oymak et al’17] (not cited, listed below) for linear convergence of linear inverse problems with nonconvex regularization. The authors need to clarify the challenges that deep image prior model introduces.  [Oymak et al’17] Oymak S, Recht B, Soltanolkotabi M. Sharp time–data tradeoffs for linear inverse problems.
