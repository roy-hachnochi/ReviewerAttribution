Originality: The problem formulation is interesting. The main part of the algorithm relies on the well-known multidimensional scaling (MDS) and procrustes methods.    Quality: The quality of work presented in this paper seems good and the authors tried to explain the problem clearly. Adding some more details on the experiments would be helpful.   Clarity: The paper is well written.   Significance: Phase retrieval problem itself is considered an interesting and challenging research problem that arises in many applications. The case where the random operator is also unknown makes it a more challenging problem, but I am not aware of many scenarios where such a problem arises. The authors motivated the problem with OPU setup, but the results presented in the paper are on a very small scale and not very convincing about potential advantages of the proposed framework. In short, I like the problem on the algorithmic level, but I am doubtful about the practical significance.
