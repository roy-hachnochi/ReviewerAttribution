The paper is written in a confusing way that the setup is not explained clearly. There is no clear reason to me why there need to be multiple signals -- since the measurements are taken on all  difference of pairs x_q-x_r. The setting of multiple signals also seems to have nothing to do with the described MDS algorithm. [The author responded that one cannot determine the global phase with one signal -- that is true, but the authors have auxiliary vectors r_1,...,r_K and why do they need s \xi vectors?]   The organization is not good, either. Assumptions such as “DMD is binary” seems to be popped up all of a sudden from nowhere. The paper also cited some other algorithm without explaining what the problems other algorithms solve. It would be more readable if the authors can reorganize the paper and explain more clearly in the motivation part/problem setup what the constraints are due to hardware limitations.  The authors further mention that they use the algorithms developed in this paper to implement the RSVD algorithm in [8]. I think they can be more specific here. What the authors actually implement is to compute A = BG for some given matrix B and a Gaussian random matrix A. [The authors seems to suggest in their response that it is a harder problem to do the matrix-vector multiplication simulation simultaneously for multiple signals, but why is it so? Is it due to hardware constraints?] It seems that the point is to use an optical system to simulate the computation of A = BG via some decoding algorithm. What is the advantage of this? [The authors responded that an optimal system is much faster than both CPU and GPU. Perhaps that should be made more explicit in the paper. Neither the introduction nor the experiment mentions speed comparison.]
