I think this paper is well prepared. I have the following comments.  (1) I think the most important contribution is in theoretical aspect. Nevertheless, I cannot judge the proposed results is based on the previous works or these results in developed by the authors themselves. Thus, I suggest the authors to highlight their unique contributions. (2) I notice one assumption is that k clusters have equal size. I think this is too strict for real application. Can the authors give more insights about the results when this assumption does not hold? (3) As stated in Section 5, the authors have also touched the computational issue. I have not found some numerical comparison. I suggest the authors to added some numerical comparisons.
