SETTING: In continuous control, model predictive control is often used as a means to negotiate model mismatch or misspecification. Here, the setting assumes the availability of cost functions for some time steps in the future. This seems somewhat stylized. In terms of predictability of cost functions (representing prices etc.), a guarantee akin to that of doubly robust estimators would seem more apt. Furthermore, while regret is a perfectly well-defined quantity, a competitive ration like guarantee might be a better measure since the regret is non-vanishing.  TECHNIQUES: The key observation here is that with the foreknowledge of cost functions up to a certain horizon enables one to run gradient-based offline optimization algorithms (like GD, NAG etc.) on the best-in-hindsight problem for a few iterations in the online setting. This was observed in previous work (Li 2018). This paper proposes a somewhat classical, yet very well placed reparameterization of the problem that fits into the aforementioned framework. To the reviewer, it seems the obvious parameterization in terms of the controls does not seem to, at least immediately, yield the result. **In this light, this reparameterization + offline-algorithm-on-hindsight-problem observation is quite neat.** The lower bound seems conceivable given the one in (Li 2018).   1. Can the authors comment on the transformation to the canonical form affect the strong convexity and smoothness of the transformed costs on Line 479?   2. Line 155/6 -- Was x_t+1 = A x_t + B u_t intended instead of x_t+1 = x_t + u_t?  POST RESPONSE Adding the response under "Parameterization in terms of control inputs." to the main paper would be nice. The reviewer also thinks R#3's suggestion of putting GD first would add to readability. The reviewer is retaining his/her score.
