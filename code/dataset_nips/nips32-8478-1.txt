Originality: According to lines 59-61, it seems to me that the proposed 1BITMC approach is just a special case of the approach proposed by Davenport et al. 2014. This paper also states that the 1BITMC approach is originally proposed by Davenport et al. 2014 (lines 114-115). In this sense, the paper does not propose any novel approaches. The theoretical results of the 1BITMC approach, which seem to be the main contributions of this paper, are mostly adapted from those of Davenport et al. 2014.  Quality: I am a bit concerned about the experiment setup in Section 4.2. This paper randomly split the data into a training, a validation, and a testing set. This paper uses the testing set to evaluate all rating prediction approaches in terms of MAE and three variants of MAE-IPS. This evaluation procedure might be biased because the testing set is not missing at random and hence is biased. Instead, existing studies (Schnabel et al. 2016 and Wang et al. 2019) use missing at random ratings collected by forcing users to rate randomly selected items as the testing set.  Clarity: This paper is mostly well written with a few exceptions. For example, the paper defines a noise matrix at line 77, but never models the rating noise or uses the noise matrix in the propensity estimation. So, it seems to me that the definition of the noise matrix is not necessary for the overall flow of the paper.  Significance: This paper demonstrates that the proposed 1BITMC approach is significantly better than the naive Bayes and the logistic regression approach on synthetic datasets. However, the experimental results of Section 4.2 in the rating prediction and the classification task on the real datasets seem not to be significant to me.
