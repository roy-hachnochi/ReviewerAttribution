1. This paper successfully applied GAN objective on neural vocoder for speech synthesis. The model is moderately novel.  2. The paper present the model in a clear way. Equation/figures are accurate. Overall writing is high quality  3. The experimental results are missing the MOS of existing vocoders. For example, the authors should at least provide the MOS of autoregressive wavenet. For copy synthesis, the MOS of the proposed vocoder is only 3.09. The current state-of-the-art is above 4.0. So the authors can not claim the proposed vocoder as state-of-the-art.  4. Copy synthesized speech from the proposed vocoder contains clear artifacts. I don't think this vocoder can replace wavenet or wavernn.
