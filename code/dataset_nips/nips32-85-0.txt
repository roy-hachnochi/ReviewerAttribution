Overall the results are somewhat interesting. Smoothed sensitivity is a standard technique for achieving differential privacy; although most interesting smoothed sensitivity algorithms tend to be computationally hard, still the results would be interesting I believe. The paper is also reasonably well-written. -- I read the author response. Something that might make the paper more useful to a practical reader is a more concrete statement of what the results mean for Renyi-DP -- another related relaxation.  Finally, a related paper is [1], which also does a Renyi-DP based analysis for smoothed sensitivity algorithms. It would be nice to see how the results in this paper compare with [1].
