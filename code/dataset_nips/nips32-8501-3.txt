This is a good paper that studies an interesting problem. The paper is well-written with good literature review and exposition. The idea of using the PL condition and the smoothing approach are well-motivated from optimization, but the application to game play is interesting. The technical results and analysis seem solid. The experiments are rather limited, it would be interesting to verify the results on more varied examples.
