Originality: The work combines a set of well known components from the DL community. We do not see a real technical innovation, but the combination of the said methods is interesting in itself. The difference o the Multi-Attention compared to previous methods, is not clearly explained and not very convincing.  Clarity: I find that the submission is clear overall. About the class-center triplet loss; The authors should explain how the extracted features are finally used for 0-shot learning. This gets clearer in the supplementary material, but it should be explained in the main paper and a reference to the supplementary should be added. A couple of typos - one in the abstract-.  Figure 1. and the text of the paper clearly describe how the multiple components are articulated.   Significance:  The impact and significance of the paper for the community will be average. This is a good piece of work and the code is provided, nevertheless, we do not see a clear technical breakthrough that would be reused by other authors.
