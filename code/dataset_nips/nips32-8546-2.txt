The paper studies the SDG algorithm for least square regression problems. A new analysis with step decay schedule of the learning rate is presented which theoretically shows the near optimality of the algorithm. The paper also proves that the polynomial decay schemes learning rate is sub-optimal.  Overall, the paper is well-written and theoretically sound. I have not checked the proof in detail but the analysis looks right to me.   Base on the theoretical novelty of the paper, I would recommend for publication.
