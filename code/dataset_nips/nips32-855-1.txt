- originality: This paper proposes a novel and simple algorithm called SSRGD for finding local minima in nonconvex optimization. - quality: This work is solid. - clarity: This paper is well-written and easy to follow. - significance: The proposed SSRGD algorithm does not need an extra negative-curvature search subroutine unlike previous algorithms and improves previous results to the almost optimal results.
