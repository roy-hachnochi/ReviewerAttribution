Originality: Admittedly (by the authors), the proposed algorithm is a fairly straightforward extension of previous ideas.  However, the authors are up-front about this, and their manuscript contains considerably additional analysis and empirical work, which more than exceeds any sort of originality bar in this reviewer's opinion.  Quality: The work is of high quality, with extensive theoretical analysis of the convergence of their algorithm.  Clarity:  The paper is quite clear.  The appendix discussion of the proofs could use slightly more detail (particularly for outsides)--even a few sentences of guiding intuition could be useful (i.e., regarding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points, for the uninitiated)  Significance:  This method clearly outperforms other methods, and is conceptually simpler and easier to compute.  Conditioned on the authors actually providing tensorflow code for the result, this looks like a powerful, general technique for few-shot metalearning.
