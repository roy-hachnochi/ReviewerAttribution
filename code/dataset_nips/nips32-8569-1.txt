   The authors propose a loss which is controlled by two temperature parameters of generalized logarithm (exponential), one of which comes from the probability model and the other comes from Bregman (beta) divergence.    The proposed loss shows robust nature to noises as expected and confirmed by simple numerical experiments with good visualization.    The idea looks similar with ref[2] using Bregman divergence instead of Tsallis, therefore the proposal is not surprising.    In statistics, it is well known Bregman divergences (not only beta-divergence) leads consistent and robust estimators, and heavy-tailed distributions (not only Bregman-dual link function) are insensitive to outliers, so robustness of the proposed loss looks natural outcome.    The former facts are intensively investigated by Shinto Eguchi, Frank Nielsen and their collaborators.    The latter facts are found in, for example, a famous book by Huber (1981).     Overall organization of the paper is well considered including a good introduction of Bregman divergence, and theoretical discussion of the proposed loss is clear enough, so quality and clarity of the paper is very high.    The presented idea is nice, but significance to the community is unclear.
