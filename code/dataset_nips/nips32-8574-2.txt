The paper is in general well written.   The results are built upon the result in (Hand and Voroninski, 2017), and (Bora et al. 2017). From my understanding, the first theorem is mainly built on (Hand and Voroninski, 2017), and the second theorem is mainly built on (Bora et al. 2017).   For the second theorem, the result implies the deeper the network is, the smaller the delta should be. It would be better to discuss how tight is the analysis, and whether this dependency is necessary in practice.   ==== After rebuttal I have carefully read the author's response and other reviewer's feedback. I have less concern about the usefulness of the theoretic results and the gap between the theory and the algorithm. I have changed my score from 6 to 7. I would expect a higher score with much stronger experiments, although proving the idea of the algorithm works itself is quite interesting.
