The paper proposed one novel  multi-resolution weak supervision problem for sequential data, which is quite interesting for both research and practical application. The problem formulation and key challenges are clearly demonstrated.  For the proposed approach, the authors provide convincing  explanations. Experimental resutls are also promising.   For the weakness, see the following improvements suggestion.
