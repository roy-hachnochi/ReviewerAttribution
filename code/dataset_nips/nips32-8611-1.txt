This is a very interesting work dealing with continuous action spaces, and develops associated semiparametric theory for this framework.   In Theorem 2, why does V_{DR}(\pi) achieve the efficiency bound if the model is misspecified (contrary to the usual DR result so that we only get consistency but not efficiency)? Also, why do we need the additional assumption of homoskedasticity when the model is correct?
