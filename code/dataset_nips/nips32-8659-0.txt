The main advance of this manuscript is the reduced sampling complexity and computational speed of the proposed algorithms ExactSHT and RobustSHT; with theoretical guarantees.  These advances are illustrated on a small scale toy problem, see Figure on page 8.  One of the deficiencies of the manuscript is the very limited quality of numerical experiments, so much as to not include some of the important aspects such as probability of recovery and the differing performance of the ExactSHT and RobustSHT.  The main manuscript includes a pair of plots with a small discussion, and the supplementary material includes a modestly longer experimental section; see for instance Table 1 on page 23.  The advances are important, more so than many results in compressed sensing these days as CS is a well developed topic.  The results are presented clearly, but the organisation of the results isn't ideal at present as the sampling complexity isn't shown in the main manuscript.  The authors are encouraged to move Table 1 of the supplementary material to the main manuscript as this is especially important; alternatively it could be presented in plot form within the current plots using a right axis on sampling complexity.
