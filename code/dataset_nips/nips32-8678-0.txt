I found this paper difficult to read. Some of the reasons were structural - I found the main and readily usable contribution of this paper to be the actual algorithm( the multi-criteria dimensionality reduction algorithm). The problem is that this information is written in paragraph form (between line 259 to 269) instead of pseudo-code so that it is readily visible.  I also did not like the naming and organisation of the sections. The authors used the chapter name 'results' to mean mathematical foundational results it might be more helpful to rename this chapter into something like 'theoretical background'. It might also be more useful to have this chapter after the related research chapter so that it becomes even more evident why that background theory is necessary and where is plugs into the current state of the art solutions. I am not familiar enough with the literature in this area to comment on originality of this work.
