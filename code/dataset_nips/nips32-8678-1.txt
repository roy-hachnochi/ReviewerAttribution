The paper makes interesting connection between fairness and multi-parameter optimization, bringing to bear powerful techniques (such as SDP relaxation) from the latter. It supports its theoretical findings with experimental validation whose results suggest that in practice the number of extra dimensions is even smaller than the analytical guarantees.  The paper is notable for diversity of its tools (SDP relaxation, geometry of quadratic functions, reduction of MAX-CUT to Fair PCA, experimental results).
