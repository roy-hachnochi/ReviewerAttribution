I believe this paper should be accepted to NeurIPS.  Originality: This paper combines a number of known ideas into a very nice framework to do heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in the IV setting.  Quality: The paper is technically correct. The experiments are well motivated and well done.  Clarity: The paper is very clear and easy to understand (my one comment is that I had to rewrite the equations for myself ignoring the intercept terms to really understand what was going on).  Significance: This is a method with lots of potential applications in both academic and industrial practice.
