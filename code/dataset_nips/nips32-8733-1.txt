This paper follows a recent line of research on analyzing sparse JL transform for vectors with bounded l_{\infty} norm to l_2 norm ratio. The current paper focuses on sparse JL transform with general sparsity parameter s and give tight bounds on tradeoff between l_{\infty} norm to l_2 norm ratio, accuracy and sparsity s. The given bounds clearly demonstrate the advantage of large sparsity parameter s and give a complete picture for sparse JL tradeoffs.   I appreciate the amount of technical effort the authors put to analyze sparse JL transforms. The paper seems technically sound and is clearly written. I recommend acceptance.
