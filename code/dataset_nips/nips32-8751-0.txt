After reading the author response, I believe my questions have been fully addressed.  ==========  The proposed method is novel, and the paper is well written. I have a few clarification questions below.  Clarification: • In Algorithm 1, why is it necessary to have a second condition d_{s->g} > MAXDIST? Shouldn’t the first condition d_{s->w_1} < d_{s->g} be sufficient? • It would be more helpful if the authors could provide a complete algorithm table that details the interactions between the goal-conditioned RL and the SearchPolicy in Algorithm 1.  Typo: • Between lines 91 and 92, inside the parenthesis of d_{\pi}, it should be s_2 instead of d_2.
