This paper provides a framework to study group representation dynamic over time, provides theoretical analysis from the perspective of departure dynamic and in-group representation change. The paper is well-written and most importantly, clearly delivers several key insights in this sequential setting.  1. The paper shows that group representation disparity can easily exacerbate under a monotonicity condition, which means the retention rate goes higher when a group's representation increases. While this observation is not new, the authors further show that the exacerbation cannot be solved under commonly fairness criterion because the group feature distribution still can be affected, which is nontrivial but often ignored in fairness research that focus on static supervised learning tasks.   2. Another key contribution of this paper is to highlight the importance of aligning fairness criteria with what drives user retention. Fig 5 in Section 4 shows the distribution of the converged group proportion under combinations of arriving rates.   3. The authors propose a method of finding proper fairness criteria through a constrained optimization step. They show the ideal stable fixed point in a heatmap, but real experiment results would be more effective, especially in the case when perfect fairness is not feasible.
