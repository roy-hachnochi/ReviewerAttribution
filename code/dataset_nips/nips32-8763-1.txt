The paper presents an original application of the novel framework of area-convexity to the design of accelerated algorithms for mixed packing and covering LPs that break the \ell_\infty regularization barrier. It is very significant in that it extends the area-convexity idea beyond the original applications in Sherman's 2017 paper. I believe it will lead to more scholars getting to know this line of work and deploying it for their problems.   The paper is well-written.
