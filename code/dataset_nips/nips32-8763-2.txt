Originality: Maybe the idea is applying [She17] to MLP itself is not very hard to come up with, doing it right seems to be non-trivial. Quality: I didn't find any flaw in the proof as far as I checked. Clarity: The paper is well written and easy to follow. Significance: As I mentioned, it seems the obtained result is significant as the dependency on eps is often problematic.
