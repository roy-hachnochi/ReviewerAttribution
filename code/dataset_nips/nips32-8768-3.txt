Originality: I believe the authors have introduced novel approaches for selecting a flat clustering from a hierarchical clustering. I believe that this work is interesting and novel. Some closely related work is only mentioned in the supplementary material and I think it would be beneficial to move to the body of the paper with further discussion. Particularly, the line of work on clustering with same/different cluster membership queries [Wang et al 2012], [Vesdapunt et al, 2014], [Firmani et al, 2016] (others mentioned in this paper). Particularly, I'd be very interested to better understand the tradeoffs between the assumptions of this work and the related work and to better understand the motivations for the assumptions of this paper. I believe that the proposed work requires fewer queries, but at the same time is limited in selecting a tree consistent partition. Other related work that I think should be more thoroughly discussed includes: active learning methods for building the hierarchy by querying for pairwise similarities [Eriksson et al, 2011] and [Krishnamurthy et al, 2012] and the constraint-based approach of Vikram & Dasgupta [2016]. In these cases feedback is used to construct the hierarchy. While some use pairwise similarities, I imagine the works could be extended to think about those similarities as 1/0 labels for same cluster / different cluster. It would be insightful to understand / highlight advantages / disadvantages of the two approaches-- particularly regarding the fact that the desired clustering I believe is always realizable in the related work.   Quality: The approaches in the paper seem to be technically sound. My main concerns about quality regard the problem setting and how being restricted to a tree-consistent partition is limited. I think a conclusion should be added to the paper.  Clarity: The paper is clearly written. Clarifications on the above related work would be beneficial. While I realize that space is limited, I think more detail on the non-realizable case would be helpful-- perhaps some kind of illustration that shows for a ground truth clustering C* several tree structures for which C* is not realizable and for each cut that minimizes the error measure.   Significance: I believe the authors contribute results that are important to the area of work on active/interactive clustering. If the authors were to provide additional motivation for problem setting, I think that this would be very beneficial. In particular, when would it be preferable to do gather feedback for selecting a cut from an existing tree rather than gathering feedback in building the tree itself (and say using that feedback to select a cut).
