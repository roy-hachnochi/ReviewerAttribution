Post-response comments: I have read the response and it was informative. The new tasks are a good addition. -----------   -What do you mean with quasi-static tasks in Section 4.2. It could be a number of different things and Iâ€™m not sure I captured which one it refers to.  -Using state-only trajectories instead of s-a pairs trajectories certainly seems convenient for being able to operate with demonstrations from different sources and for generalization to different agents with different properties. At the same time, I wonder if there are negative effects of doing this, as the notion of the transition function is lost.   - In Figure 1, was the system starting from the same initial state for each test to each goal state?  - The writing was clear and easy to follow.
