Strengths: State-of-the-art performance. The idea is novel and interesting, the evaluation is done properly, the results are significant for the field. The paper is clearly written.  Experiments: Proper evaluation on three datasets (ROxford, RParis, INSTRE), comparison with state-of-the-art solutions.   I strongly suggest acceptance.
