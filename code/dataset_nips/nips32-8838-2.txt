*this paper is nicely written and the results are presented in a rigorous and clean way, I like that paper! *also, the results are important since it was not clear to the community if these  improved bounds also hold in that regime  *however I would like to ask the authors for being more clear: in l. 38/39 they write that these bounds are mini-max optimal; in fact, in that regime there are no known lower bounds! so claiming optimality is a bit too much here! please be more careful, also on p.4, l.127-131 (the regime of Caponnetto and DeVito is different)   *I do not fully get the effect of randomization. Can you prove your results without randomization (and usingthe full dataset)? Your randomization-strategy allows to build an estimator with less data then the full dataset. My intuition is that this should have an empirical effect. Surely, these rates cannot be established when using only a subset of the data (without additional assumptions). How much do you "loose" when implementing your algorithm? In your experiments you choose the full sample. This deserves a more detailed discussion.
