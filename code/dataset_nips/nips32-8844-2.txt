Originality: To my knowledge the results in this work are clearly new and interesting. They build on and advance existing works.   Quality: The paper appears to be a complete, and self-contained work that backs up claims with proofs or results. The paper states both what can be achieved but also what cannot.   Clarity: The paper is well written and organised. It introduces the problem very well, and all relevant terms are well introduced. The supplementary material contains some of the proofs for theorems in the main paper.   Significance: I believe the results of this work are important for future research of RNN and their training methods. While earlier work already looked into orthogonal networks (mostly for memory capacity, eg  White, O, Lee, D, and Sompolinky, H. Short-term memory in orthogonal neural networks; also others Mikael Henaff et al Recurrent Orthogonal Networks and Long-Memory Tasks), expressiveness of the approaches has not been compared in this form, at least to my knowledge.
