As I mentioned, up to my knowledge, the idea of using Hamiltonian equations as loss functions of NNs is new, interesting and easy to follow. However I am not convinced that it can be applied to a large set of physical problems. The major draw back is that the Hamiltonian equations should be known in advance by the designers of the model rather than learned from data. Another short-coming is their trivial experimental results. As a matter of fact, I do not find much point in the presented toy tasks 1, 2 and even 3,  as the maximum information that the network is potentially able to learn is to estimate the noise parameter as otherwise the provided prior knowledge is sufficient to solve these tasks (and therefore no neural net is needed). The last task is much more interesting because the NN learns to link the raw data (pixels) into the quantities for which the Hamiltonian is defined. However even this task is in a sense too simple and does not convince me that such an approach can be applied to any real world problem.
