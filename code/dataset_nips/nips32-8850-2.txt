1. Originality: To the best of my knowledge, modeling hamiltonian of a dynamic system using NN is novel. Though there are concurrent works with the similar theme, this paper is, from my point of view, the most clear and thorough one among them. The related works are well cited.  2. Quality This paper is technically sound. This work is self-contained and did a good job to prove the concept it introduces. The evaluation is thorough, yet a bit simple, but is powerful enough to prove the concept of this paper. 3. Clarity: This paper is well written. It give a gentle introduction to hamiltonian mechanics for readers who may not have the proper background. 4. Significance: This work provides a novel, concrete and practical methodology for learning dynamic systems in a physically grounded fashion. Moreover, this modeling strategy has great potential since it may not rely on the exact coordinate frame which the system is defined, as hamiltonians can be defined on any valid generalized frame which suit the constraint. This direction definitely  requires more thoughts and efforts and should be of significance to the community.
