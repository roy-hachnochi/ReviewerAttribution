GCNs are widely used and well studied in both theoretical and application works. Although this work is not the first one to analyze the representation power of GCNs in learning graph topology, it still brings in some fresh air in the field of graph neural networks. It has potential impact on researchers working on GCNs and related applications, as a guideline of how to design the architecture of GCNs to improve the representation power. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed modular design can increase the representation power of GCNs.
