Summary: The paper proposes a novel method for predicting future trajectories of multiple vehicles in the scene. The approach is validated on two datasets (CARLA and NGSIM) and sets the new state-of-the art on NGSIM.  The scores below are consistent with "overall score" legend.  Originality: 6. 1) The approach is novel. It relies on RNNs and graphical models to estimate the probabilities of future trajectories. A novel algorithm similar to EM is proposed for training the model. 2) The approach differs from previous work in the way that multiple possible futures are represented. 3) The related work is reasonably cited. However, this paper also seems very related, is there a reason not to mention it? "Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction of Surrounding Vehicles with Maneuver based LSTMs" https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05499  Quality: 6. The datasets and baselines are reasonably diverse. The experiments seem well-executed.  Clarity: 3. The reviewer found it hard to understand the core ideas of the paper and follow the mathematical derivations. Comments: 1) The notation seems confusing. For example, in L88-89 X^n corresponds to the data up to the time step t, however, there is no t in the notation. The same is true for Y^n.  2) How exactly does the point-of-view transformation (L136) work? Why is it needed? 3) How are Z variables handled exactly in the optimization code? Are they sampled at some point? How does NLL computation work? 4) Why is the model with 1 latent mode (MFP-1) better than CS-LSTM? That is, if there is a single mode, what is the purpose of latent variable modeling? Minor comments: 1) In Table 1, why are "Variational" and "Hypothetical" columns important? What does "Hypothetical" mean? 2) L283: compare -> compared 3) L302: in interesting -> interesting  Significance: 5. Given the current explanation and the absence of code, it could be hard to implement the method and reproduce the results.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- POST-REBUTTAL UPDATE: Given the body of additional experiments, the promise to open-source the code and clarify the explanations, I am increasing my score from 5 to 6. The method seems to work sufficiently better than the baselines (even though it's quite heavy for understanding, in my opinion) and the presence of code should make it reproducible.  If the paper is accepted, I would strongly suggest that the comments mentioned above in the "Clarity" section are addressed in the camera-ready version of the paper. It would also be ideal if the code is open-sourced by the camera-ready deadline.
