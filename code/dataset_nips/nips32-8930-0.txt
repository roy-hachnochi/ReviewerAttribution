Originality: The formulation of the variational encoder as an explicit function of spatial coordinates is novel. Application to electron microscopy data is also novel Quality: The work appears technically sound from what I could tell. This work is a bit out of my area of expertise. Clarity: The writing is clear with sufficient background Significance: The model is novel and adds to the repertoire of generative models for images with explicit disentangled continuous representations. It opens up the door to many applications and further improvements.
