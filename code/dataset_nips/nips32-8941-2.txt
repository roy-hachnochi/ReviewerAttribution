Originality: Although the result was derived under Gaussian assumption, it is interesting and includes the original result; the authors give the notion of ESD that tends to zero implies type II error (1-power) goes to zero, and show that the power is closely related to the empirical distribution of the precision matrix of regressors.  Quality: The theoretical result is constructed using Javanmard and Montanari (2014, IEEE-T-IT) and looks fine. Clarity: The paper focuses mainly on the theory, but it seems better to add some comments on the connection to practical viewpoints. For example, can many real data satisfy the conditions of Proposition 4?  Significance: It is significant as there has been no such formal theoretical analysis on power in knockoffs inference. It is also important for empirical researchers since it is used for selecting a knockoff that yields higher power.
