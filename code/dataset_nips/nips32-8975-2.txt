The paper is well written and very comprehensible. Necessary basics are explained and the experimental results give evidence that the proposed method increases classification performance. The experiments seem to be done very thoroughly. While the results on the NATO radar dataset is not very outstanding, the method seems to outperform the baseline SPDNet on the AFW and the HDM05 dataset. Overall, good work with some minor errors:  - line 24: symmetric positive definite (no capitalization) - throughout the paper: mathoperators (like log, exp, argmin, ...) can be defined using \DeclareMathOperator{\argmin}{argmin} - algorithm 1: batch and normalized (no capitalization)
