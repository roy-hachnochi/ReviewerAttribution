This paper clearly differentiates its novelty from the work on which it builds.  The quality of the paper is good.  The paper is mostly clear; but the abstract could be made clearer by focusing more at the beginning on the impact of the LMU than on how it works.  Also, throughout the paper I was wondering whether this work was all simulation or whether it was run on real LMU hardware.  The paper mentions BrainDrop and Loithi multiple times, and Section 5 suggests a hardware implementation too; but in the end, I decide everything was simulated because you pointed to code in GitHub.  But you didn't say whether that code needed special hardware to run.  So which is correct?  It would help to clarify that early on in the paper.  As for significance, this work will be of interest to the neural chip researchers at NeurIPS.  I definitely enjoyed that the authors were able to use references from 1892 and 1782!  :-)
