Originality: I'm not very familiar but experimental tasks looked new to me. Moreover, the proposed approach is a novel combination of previous works. Quality: All arguments in the paper is well supported verbally. In the experiments section, they also supported their claims empirically. Clarity: Overall it is good. I had difficulties to follow 'Choice of Metric Space' subsection. Significance: I think other researchers won't use this approach as is for solving problems but they will try to build upon. I think this work can lead to other high quality publications. For methodology, it follows a similar approach borrows different components from previous related work and build upon. Although research direction looks very promising, experimental results looked very dataset/experimental setup specific to me.
