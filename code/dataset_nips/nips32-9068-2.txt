UPDATE AFTER REBUTTAL: I want to thank the authors for the rebuttal letter and for their willingness to extend the discussion motivating the choice of tasks in terms of the computational primitives that they expose.  - Originality:   This type of systematic investigation is sorely needed in the literature of neural networks and RNNs in particular, despite not being particularly original in strict sense of the term - Quality:  The methodology seems solid and nicely takes into account quantitative methods previously developed in the literature - Clarity:  The paper is clear and well-written. The motivation is very convincingly laid out. - Significance:  Beside being significant for its results, the paper is significant in that it exemplifies a type of scientific approach that is sorely missing in the literature.
