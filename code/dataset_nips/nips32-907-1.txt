This is a new solution to an old problem. The problem is somewhat significant. The paper's goal is clear and is overall well written. The theoretical analysis is sound and intuitive, though I did not check the proofs. The simulation study, including an Ablation study, is fairly thorough. However, I find some details are missing. 1. It is unclear to me why the loss function (10) enforces the desired margin in (9). This seems to be a missing piece of puzzle. Some better and intuitive explanation (perhaps a direct calculation) is needed. 2. I wonder what exactly is showing in Figure 2. What is "feature distribution of different methods"? Isn't that the output X_i*b where b is the coefficient matrix? 3. I am puzzled by some of the discussion in 3.3. On the one hand, the authors proposed "Deferred Re-balancing Optimization Schedule", which is to " first trains using vanilla ERM with the LDAM loss before annealing the learning rate, and then deploys a re-weighted LDAM loss with a smaller learning rate." However, they also mentioned that " the second stage does not move the weights very far." If the second stage does not move the weight by much, then shouldn't the vanilla ERM with LDAM loss work well enough? I don't think the results have any issue, but the way the motivation of this new strategy is presented needs a fix up.  Edit: I have read the author response and changed my score from 6 to 7.
