Summary of paper: Considers strategies for playing a repeated, general two-player game against an online learning algorithm. Shows tight connections to the Stackelberg equilibria of the game. In general one can guarantee to achieve the utility of being the leader in a Stackelberg equilibrium, and this is tight if the learner has no swap regret. One can gain more against standard "mean-based" learners like FTRL.  Summary of opinion: I think this paper asks a very interesting and exciting question in the field of online learning and game-playing (which so far mostly focuses on zero-sum games or specific games like auctions), and provides a useful and valuable solution. I found the paper clear and well-written. The connection to Stackelberg equilibrium is intuitive and clear in hindsight, but an important step forward for the literature.  Originality: strong as far as I know. Generalizes some very specific cases in the literature (auctions). Clarity: very good in my opinion. Significance: Quite high. No-regret learning is a broad area of high interest, and I think many researchers will learn from these results and want to build on them.  Suggestions for writing clarity:  Line 34 - what is epsilon?  Definition 2 - asymptotics of gamma are a bit confusing, is gamma a function of T, or t, or neither?   Please respond to any part of my review that you feel appropriate.
