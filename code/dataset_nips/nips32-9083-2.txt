I believe that the idea of stochastic Bellman operators is interesting (though a bit incremental, due to the presence of [5,12]) in the context of gap-action increasing Bellman operator. Though it is not super related, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.5918.pdf also studied random Bellman operators, and it might be proper to reference this work and discuss on relations.  Although the idea is interesting I find this paper problematic in terms of its theoretical work. On the other hand, its empirical contribution is not important enough (in my view) to cover for the problematic theoretical work.   Here are my remarks.  - A suggestion : Think it is not proper to refer to the Bellman operators as 'Robust'. Although I understand the reason for author's choice 'robust' in the field of decision making usually refers to the case adversarial perturbations exists.  - The authors use the terms stochastic ordering and convex order. It must be defined in the preliminaries, that's why preliminaries are for.  -The proofs in the appendix are not written good enough in my opinion, they are quite sloppy in my opinion. Furthermore, I believe the authors require pessimistic initialization of the q function to make the proofs work.  Here are my remarks on the proofs.   (**) Remarks on the proof of Theorem 1. - In the proof, line 408, why T_{\beta_k} Q_k(x,a) \leq T_B Q_k(x,a)? shouldn't you assume that V_k(x)-Q_k(x,a)\geq 0 for that? if so, where that you prove it?  - The third and forth relations of the passages below line 411 are not clear. - In the paragraph below line 417, why did you analyzed convergence in probability all of a sudden? and how, based on that, you returned and gave an a.s. convergence result?  (**) Remarks on the proof of Theorem 3.2 -) Why do you need to consider any increasing f(\cdot)? why not explicitly show by induction what you wish to prove?  Furthermore, I didn't understand why E[f(\hat{Q}_{k+1}]  \geq E[f(\bar{Q}_{k+1}]  results in \hat{Q}_{k}  \geq \bar{Q}_{k}.  -) In the last part of the proof the authors again use f(\cdot). What's the reason for that? in the Definition 3.2 you solely use the increasing advantage.  (**) Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 3.4 written in a really sloppy manner in my opinion. It is not clear what the authors mean by saying `convex-order'. The proof of Theorem 3.4 is hardly stated- the induction is not specified (base case, induction hypothesis and induction step). Moreover, the authors does not explain why their claim holds.   -) The experimental results are nice, but can hardly be seen as an important contribution in my opinion as they are quite basic and test a straightforward implication of the suggested approach. Furthermore, the authors did not prove that the q-learning version which they empirically test indeed converges. In the theoretical part, the authors analyzed a value-iteration like algorithm in which the *entire state space* is updated per iteration.
