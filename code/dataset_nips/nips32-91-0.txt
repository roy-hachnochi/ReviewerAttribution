Saliency detection is an interesting and important problem in computer vision. It is often used for localising the object of interest in a given scene and as a guiding step (or an anchor) for object detection algorithms. Authors address this problem by adopting MAV/CRF  and deep FCN in their framework. Although the outcome of this method is good, the authors do not motivate the use of FCN, CRF and handcrafted saliency prediction methods. Given that several state-of-the-art CNN based segmentation and saliency detection algorithms have been proposed in the recent literature, what value does this work add to CV/ML research? Can you please list the saliency detection methods whihc were used in this paper? Can you please comment on the computational efficiency of this technique compared to the other methods? A similar work, "Deep Unsupervised Saliency Detection: A Multiple Noisy Labeling Perspective" (CVPR 2018), with some overlap has been published in the past. How is your contribution different from this work?
