Despite the impressive empirical results, the paper is difficult to follow, and it seems the proposed method is just a combination of existing previous methods.  The paper, despite the simplicity of the method, could have used better writing. - in terms of style -- related work should come before describing the method. - when using acronyms (e.g. USD, SBF), for the first time, make sure the full name is mentioned as well, and the acronym in brackets.  - if a method is referred to using an acronym (RBD, DSR, MC, HS) -- please use the same acronym in the tables -- it is difficult to trace the acronyms and citations throughout the paper otherwise.  Are the results on ECSSD, DUT and SED2 evaluated with the model trained on MSRA-B?  How would this method compare to Chen et al 2018 (DeepLab)? Is there a reason for not evaluating on Pascal segmentation?  How does the weighted F-measure act as a pixel-wise loss, and how does it enforce inter-image consistency? The section (L86-106) is only explaining how to compute the F measure, and that loss is 1-F_beta.  What is the difference between the "No-CRF" in the ablation in supplementary material and the "no self-supervision" in Table 2?  L188-189 -- it is not clear what the change to the network was made. Is the same change applied to ResNet? If so, is only this new layer trained, and the rest of the network is frozen?  Training seems to be done on a small number of images, for a small, fixed number of epochs (25). Is this sufficient to prevent overfitting? How was 25 decided? Did the authors consider other forms of regularization?
