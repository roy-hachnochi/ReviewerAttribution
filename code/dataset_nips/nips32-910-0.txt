The paper is well written -- I have a pleasant read of the paper.   A few comments:  1. Theorem 1 is not very useful. The input to A is either a set or an ordered set. Only when it is an ordered one, it needs global indices to decide the order, right?  If the input is a set without order, there is no need to refer to global indices.   2. The paper embeds computation graphs, not graph structure or function. The paper can do a better job of relating and differentiating the three concepts (graph structure, computation graph, function).   Graph structure => computation graph => function   The arrow => is an onto relation: the same graph structure indicates the same computation graph and so on. But the reverse is not true.   Computation graph is defined on generic operations while functions need instantiated operations. Then your discussion of equivalence of computation graph might be easier: if any operations make two derived functions not equivalent, then the computation graph is not equivalent.   3. The title should be VAE for "Computation Graphs" not for "Directed Acyclic Graphs" because the paper does not embed graph structures.   4. Figure 7: why does the right plot much darker than the left plot in general -- the distribution of the BIC scores (pixel colors) should be the same, right?   5. I don't know the work NAONet very well, but it seems to me that it also embeds computation graphs to vectors. Why not include a fair comparison of the two?
