Originality: Generating DAGs is a very new and important problem. My main concern is about the novelty of the method. - Both the encoding and decoding procedures of the proposed work are highly related to Ref.1. However, no discussion or comparison is given. - The asynchronous message passing algorithm is a straightforward extension of the original algorithm.  Quality: In general, the paper is of good technical quality. All claims are well supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. But both the objective function and the training strategy are missing in the main manuscript and are over-simplified in the supplementary.  Clarity: The paper is well organized and clearly written.
