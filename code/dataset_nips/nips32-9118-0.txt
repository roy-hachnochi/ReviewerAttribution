This paper tries to answer the question: can the results from [Shamir, 2018] be extended to multi-block ResNets? The authors formally characterize that under condition Line 206 and Line 207, ANY local minimum is either "good" (meaning it is better than linear predictors), or the minimum eigenvalue of its Hessian is strictly negative. These results are new as far as I know.  My main concern is regarding the usefulness of the result. In particular, the assumption in Line 207 seems strong compared to the results in [Shamir, 2018]. Also, the result in Section 3.2 seems like a trivial application of [Shamir, 2018].   Overall the paper is easy to follow. I feel there is room for improvements in some sections. Some of them are listed below.
