Although this paper relies heavily on the well-established field of dynamic systems analysis, I found this paper to be refreshingly innovative in that it takes these tools an applies them in a new way.  This is a refreshingly research focused paper compared to the other papers I've reviewed for NeurIPS this year.  I like that the authors tackle a difficult problem, that of interpretability of RNN's, in a very principles manner.  The paper's quality is good in that it explores a variety of important avenues (e.g., multiple data sets, multiple models, multiple measures of the dynamics, etc.)  The paper is very clear and easy to read.  I comment the authors for this.  As for significance, interpretability is of key relevance in academia, business, and government.  This paper provides a new lens for looking at this problem.
