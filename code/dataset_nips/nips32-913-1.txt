* Originality: The paper proposes a nice idea for speeding up WMD, using a hierarchy. This idea although was applied to several problems long time ago (e.g. hierarchical softmax) but it is novel for this problem.    * Quality: The paper presents throughly properties of HOTT. Experiments showing that HOTT does work.   * Clarity: The paper is NOT difficult to read to capture the main contributions. However, I did not check the math carefully. In the equation in line 95, what are deltas?   * Significance: Although the main idea is nice, its implementation is heavily relied on pruning LDA's topics to make |T| and the number of words in each t small. I found it very tricky, and was wondering what if we also use the same heuristic for WMD.
