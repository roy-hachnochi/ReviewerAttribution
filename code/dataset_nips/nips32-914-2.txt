Generally, the idea is clearly conveyed. Although the techniques employed are not new, the modelling is quite intuitive, and all derivations are technically sound.  However, there is a major problem with the rigor of the related work section. The paper seems to have missed an important work on non-stationary GP which imposes hyper GP priors on the parameters of the squared exponential covariance function (Non-Stationary Gaussian Process Regression with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, Heinonen et al., 2016).   I believe this work does not belong in the same category with [14] (which the authors have claimed to be “too strong of a modeling assumption”), because it jointly learns the distribution of the covariance parameters. I feel that the referred work is relevant and deserves to be rigorously compared with the proposed method in the experiment section.  As for [14], the authors have also not justified their claim with empirical evidence. Most comparisons are made against stationary methods such as full GP and local stationary GP ensemble with a separate partitioning step. I would like to see how [14] proves to be ineffective in the domain of interest because of its restrictive assumption. It would also be helpful if the author can show RMSE vs. no. Gibbs sampling iterations to demonstrate the convergence of the proposed method.  -- Post-rebuttal Feedback:  Thank you for the response, which has reasonably addressed my concern. I have increased my rating of your work.
