The paper is very well written and the authors are honest about their results. The subject of the work is also very important to the community of neuroscience. Although the methods are not original, they are used very well together in the pipeline. The final results, however, do not look complete to me. The most important use of autonomous data analytics algorithms for science is to provide interpretable results, e.g. demixed data in Kobak et al. 2016, or interpretable components of TCA in Williams et al. 2018. To my understanding, presented framework does not provide any interpretable results. Even if not interpretable, the authors could show if the framework predicts the same state in a specific event in each trial, e.g. levers grab. I think figure 3c suggests that it does not. Also, regarding generating the video from neural data, the current results could be   the product of learning the structure of the video and its changes over time, especially because very similar events happen in each trial (things that are different between trials such as animal's hands are not very well captured). In fact, the current results looks like average over all trials. I think it is important to see how using neural data actually improves the prediction (for example as opposed to average of all trials in each time step).
