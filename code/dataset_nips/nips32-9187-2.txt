The paper clearly describes the method and is easy to read. The originality of the paper is in the composition of the CVAE+ARHMM modeling of animal behavior videos, combined with an SLDS decoding of behavior from neural activity. This is an impressive array of statistical methods, and I am excited to see how well it works. The biggest question is whether the model works well compared to simpler methods. It is nice to see qualitative results of the method in the supplemental videos.
