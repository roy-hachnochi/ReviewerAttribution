The paper is well organized and easy to understand. The use of MoE as approximate posterior is proved to be effective across several different tasks.  Weakness: 1. Although the four criteria (proposed by the author of this paper) for multi-modal generative models seem reasonable, they are not intrinsic generic criteria. Therefore, the argument that previous works fail for certain criteria is not strong.  2. Tabular data (seeing each attribute dimension as a modality) is another popular form of multi-modal data. It would interesting, although not necessary, to see how this model works for tabular data.
