****************************Originality**************************** Strengths: - The paper does a nice job of discussing the various desiderata of successful multimodal models in the introduction, nicely decomposing these into generative and discriminative objectives.  Weaknesses: - The paper is not that original given the amount of work in learning multimodal generative models:     — For example, from the perspective of the model, the paper builds on top of the work by Wu and Goodman (2018) except that they learn a mixture of experts rather than a product of experts variational posterior.     — In addition, from the perspective of the 4 desirable attributes for multimodal learning that the authors mention in the introduction, it seems very similar to the motivation in the paper by Tsai et al. Learning Factorized Multimodal Representations, ICLR 2019, which also proposed a multimodal factorized deep generative model that performs well for discriminative and generative tasks as well as in the presence of missing modalities. The authors should have cited and compared with this paper.  ****************************Quality**************************** Strengths: - The experimental results are nice. The paper claims that their MMVAE modal fulfills all four criteria including (1) latent variables that decompose into shared and private subspaces, (2) be able to generate data across all modalities, (3) be able to generate data across individual modalities, and (4) improve discriminative performance in each modality by leveraging related data from other modalities. Let's look at each of these 4 in detail:     — (1) Yes, their model does indeed learn factorized variables which can be shown by good conditional generation on MNIST+SVHN dataset.     — (2) Yes, joint generation (which I assume to mean generation from a single modality) is performed on vision -> vision and language -> language for CUB,     — (3) Yes, conditional generation can be performed on CUB via language -> vision and vice versa.   Weaknesses: - (continuing on whether the model does indeed achieve the 4 properties that the authors describe)     — (3 continued) However, it is unclear how significant the performance is for both 2) and 3) since the authors report no comparisons with existing generative models, even simple ones such as a conditional VAE from language to vision. In other words, what if I forgo with the complicated MoE VAE, and all the components of the proposed model, and simply use a conditional VAE from language to vision. There are many ablation studies that are missing from the paper especially since the model is so complicated.     — (4) The authors have not seemed to perform extensive experiments for this criteria since they only report the performance of a simple linear classifier on top of the latent variables. There has been much work in learning discriminative models for multimodal data involving aligning or fusing language and vision spaces. Just to name a few involving language and vision:         - Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling for Visual Question Answering and Visual Grounding, EMNLP 2016         - DeViSE: A Deep Visual-Semantic Embedding Model, NeurIPS 2013 Therefore, it is important to justify why I should use this MMVAE model when there is a lot of existing work on fusing multimodal data for prediction.  ****************************Clarity**************************** Strengths: - The paper is generally clear. I particularly liked the introduction of the paper especially motivation Figures 1 and 2. Figure 2 is particularly informative given what we know about multimodal data and multimodal information.  - The table in Figure 2 nicely summarizes some of the existing works in multimodal learning and whether they fulfill the 4 criteria that the authors have pointed out to be important.  Weaknesses: - Given the authors' great job in setting up the paper via Figure 1, Figure 2, and the introduction, I was rather disappointed that section 2 did not continue on this clear flow. To begin, a model diagram/schematic at the beginning of section 2 would have helped a lot. Ideally, such a model diagram could closely resemble Figure 2 where you have already set up a nice 'Venn Diagram' of multimodal information. Given this, your model basically assigns latent variables to each of the information overlapping spaces as well as arrows (neural network layers) as the inference and generation path from the variables to observed data. Showing such a detailed model diagram in an 'expanded' or 'more detailed' version of Figure 2 would be extremely helpful in understanding the notation (which there are a lot), how MMVAE accomplishes all 4 properties, as well as the inference and generation paths in MMVAE. - Unfortunately, the table in Figure 2 it is not super complete given the amount of work that has been done in latent factorization (e.g. Learning Factorized Multimodal Representations, ICLR 2019) and purely discriminative multimodal fusion (i.e. point d on synergy) - There are a few typos and stylistic issues: 1. line 18: "Given the lack explicit labels available” -> “Given the lack of explicit labels available” 2. line 19: “can provided important” -> “can provide important” 3. line 25: “between (Yildirim, 2014) them” -> “between them (Yildirim, 2014)” 4. and so on…  ****************************Significance**************************** Strengths: - This paper will likely be a nice addition to the current models we have for processing multimodal data, especially since the results are quite interesting. - The paper did a commendable job in attempting to perform experiments to justify the 4 properties they outlined in the introduction. - I can see future practitioners using the variational MoE layers for encoding multimodal data, especially when there is missing multimodal data.  Weaknesses: - That being said, there are some important concerns especially regarding the utility of the model as compared to existing work. In particular, there are some statements in the model description where it would be nice to have some experimental results in order to convince the reader that this model compares favorably with existing work: 1. line 113: You set \alpha_m uniformly to be 1/M which implies that the contributions from all modalities are the same. However, works in multimodal fusion have shown that dynamically weighting the modalities is quite important because 1) modalities might contain noise or uncertain information, 2) different modalities contribute differently to the prediction (e.g. in a video when a speaker is not saying anything then their visual behaviors are more indicative than their speech or language behaviors). Recent works therefore study, for example, gated attentions (e.g. Gated-Attention Architectures for Task-Oriented Language Grounding, AAAI 2018 or Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Word-level Fusion and Reinforcement Learning, ICMI 2017) to learn these weights. How does your model compare to this line of related work, and can your model be modified to take advantage of these fusion methods? 2. line 145-146: "We prefer the IWAE objective over the standard ELBO objective not just for the fact that it estimates a tighter bound, but also for the properties of the posterior when computing the multi-sample estimate." -> Do you have experimental results that back this up? How significant is the difference? 3. line 157-158: "needing M^2 passes over the respective decoders in total" -> Do you have experimental runtimes to show that this is not a significant overhead? The number of modalities is quite small (2 or 3), but when the decoders are large recurrent of deconvolutional layers then this could be costly.  ****************************Post Rebuttal**************************** The author response addressed some of my concerns regarding novelty but I am still inclined to keep my score since I do not believe that the paper is substantially improving over (Wu and Goodmann, 2018) and (Tsai et al, 2019). The clarity of writing can be improved in some parts and I hope that the authors would make these changes. Regarding the quality of generation, it is definitely not close to SOTA language models such as GPT-2 but I would still give the authors credit since generation is not their main goal, but rather one of their 4 defined goals to measure the quality of multimodal representation learning.
