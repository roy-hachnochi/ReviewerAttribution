Pros: 1. Paper is well written and easily readable. 2. It presents a novel approach for state space reduction of neural network that could be extended to similar problems.  3. It address an important issue of computational complexity in output range analysis for neural network.   Cons: 1. This paper should explore different partitioning schemes and provide a timing comparison among them. 2. It should provide a metric to compare degree of over approximation as compared with approach in [4]
