Overall, I like the approach in the paper and the theoretical background looks solid (though I didn't check the proofs). My main problem with a paper is in the  experimental part: * just one experiment is considered on rather toy neural network * no comparison with other methods is made  Thus, it is impossible to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed method.
