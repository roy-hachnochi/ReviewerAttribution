This is overall an interesting direction but the impact of the proposed scheme is somewhat underdeveloped given that the gains are somewhat limited and most of the theoretical results build directly off of existing work.   - While the proposed scheme does improve the storage requirements of HBE, it is not clear from empirical evaluation as to how much savings the proposed scheme provides relative to the data set size. The data set size and the O(1/\epsilon^2) factor appears to be the dominating storage requirement here (either the full or the subsampled set); it is not clear from the empirical results how significant are the O(1 / \sqrt{\tau}) savings here. - The example for the proposed scheme on page 5 (lines 150-153), the resulting KDE estimate is only accurate if L = 1/\sqrt{\tau} instead of being O(1 / \sqrt{\tau}), which requires use to know \tau beforehand which might be problematic. The intuition behind this example is very useful but maybe this explanation can be further clarified to address the aforementioned discrepancy. - The theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme to match the average performance of the existing HBE scheme. However, as mentioned in the manuscript, the variance of the estimates from the proposed scheme would be adversely affected. But this loss in variance is not empirically studied.  ===== Post response -----  I thank the authors for the response.  Based on the response and the discussion, I am motivated to raise the score.
