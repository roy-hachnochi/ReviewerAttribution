Originality: This is a clever variant of the original HBE by Charikar and Siminelakis. Though it is simple and natural in hindsight, the fact is that nobody realised this in the last two years even though [CS17] appeared in a top venue.  Quality: Proofs (in supplementary material) appear solid. The paper is generally very well written, but comparison of space usage for different methods is sloppy, making the improvement over [CS17] seem larger than it is. Many bounds stated seem to assume d=O(1). Table 1 is misleading. The issue is that it is only necessary to store each point once, and then use pointers to refer to it. Thus, the space usage of (a trivial modification of) the [CS17] HBE is d/τ · 1/ε^2 + 1/τ^{3/2} · 1/ε^2. The new bound is only better when d < τ^{1/2}. This should be made clear.  Clarity: The paper is clearly written. I think it would be possible to reproduce all results.  Significance: I believe this is a significant improvement over [CS17] as well as over the variant of in the recent ICML paper [SRB+19]. Since the problem is of wide importance, I think this will be of interest to many NeurIPS participants.
