Though the proposed method has achieved improvements on standard datasets. However, there are some questions about the methodology. Why data close to the decision boundaries are considered adversarial examples? Though the densities of data near the decision boundaries are relatively sparse, should it be the core principle for finding adversarial examples?  The writing quality of the paper is questionable. There are lots of grammar issues that may prevent readers from reading the paper smoothly. For example, line 8: "an image tampered with", what's the object following with? And, line 35, there should be a comma after "on one hand"
