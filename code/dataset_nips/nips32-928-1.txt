       Positive:       - Clear and important motivation and problem.       - Good writing throughout; concise, to the point. Thank you.       - Method is simple.       - Improvement from integration of multi-frame linear flow vs. quadratic flow is tested       - Clear results on multiple datasets, with ablated components.       - Video: Results from 1m 50s onwards are great. This presentation format with the comparison to other techniques would be good to use for the boat sequence, also.        Room for improvement:       - Method does not directly estimate quadratic flow, but instead estimates linear flow across pairs of frames and combines them.        - SepConv and DVF were not retrained on your 'large motion' clip database. It is known that better training data (more selective to the problem) is important. What effect does this 'large motion' clip selection have on these models? Put another way, what is the difference between the SuperSloMo network trained on regular vs. large motion data?       - Video results: 42 seconds: while impressive, this result shows visible popping/jumping whenever we reach an original video frame. Why?       - Video results: The interpolated frames are noticeably blurrier than the original frames. While this is a problem with these techniques in general (potentially caused by the averaging model for frame synthesis), it is still a limitation and should be stated as such.        Minor:       - Title: consider adding 'temporal' or 'motion' to the title.       - L86: additional comma at the end of the line.       - Figure 4 - the frames labeled as GT with the trajectories: the trajectories are estimated and should be labeled as such; there are no GT trajectories.       - L225 - please add Eq. (2) not just (2)
