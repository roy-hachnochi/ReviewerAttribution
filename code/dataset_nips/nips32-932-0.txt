- Originality: This work is a novel combination of existing methods [2,18,22].   - Quality: The submission is technically sound and well supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. Authors show some failure case examples, however, they did not particularly describe or analyze why it happened.  - Clarity: The paper is easy to read.  - Significance: The experimental results are important as it advances the state-of-the-art in this field. However, this method is inherently limited to ResNet based network architectures.    ----------After rebuttal----------- Authors address the some concerns in rebuttal, e.g., runtime overhead is negligible. I look forward to see other results that authors promised to report in the finial version. So, I stand with my initial decision as an accept.
