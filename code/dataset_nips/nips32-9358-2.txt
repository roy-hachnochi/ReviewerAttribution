Originality: Positional/temporal embeddings with self-attention models have been studied in many papers, although not with theoretical-driven motivations. The paper should distinguish the contributions more clearly.   Quality: The quality of theory-driven discussions is high but the experimental results section needs to be improved.   Significance:  The paper addresses an important direction to enable self-attention models for time-series forecasting. In general, the study of temporal embedding selection is impactful, especially with the insights from two theorems.   Clarity: The paper is mostly well-written and the contributions are clearly explained. But I think there is room for improvement in writing. For example, some theoretical arguments can be moved to the supplementary material, in exchange for interesting interpretations and analysis moved to the main body of the paper.
