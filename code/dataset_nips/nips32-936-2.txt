Overall, the introduced method is novel and the results it allows generating are interesting. A number of aspects of the work remain unclear in its current state. However, I think these can be addressed as part of the final version of the paper. Therefore, I am leaning towards accepting this work.   - L101: What is meant by 'frustum culling' in the context of extracting features from spatial memory? The notion of 'culling' is introduced in Section 3.2 in that it refers to culling features. But as this is part of the main contribution it should be made more clear what is meant by this. Furthermore, in Section 3.2 it is not clear what the culling operation is really doing. Instead, the description of Equation (3) is stating that the requested neighborhood is filled. So apart from Equation (3) there is no description of what is actually meant by the term 'culling'. This should be clarified.   - The description of 'Encoding Memories' is not clear. In lines 112-122 the text states that a sequence of observed images as either RGB or RGB-D is used. Later an example is provided for constructing the agent's spatial memory for RGB-D observations by converting the depth maps into point clouds and existing solutions are presented how to approximate ground planes.   - L128: What is a 'patch' in this context? Later the text also refers to 'feature patch'. It should be more formally defined.   - Figure 4 should have a more meaningful caption. As is it is not comprehensible what is illustrated this figure.  - L159: 'field of view' is the more common term.   - When I am not mistaken, 's' and 't' (in Equations 3, 4) are not defined (also not in the supplementary material).   - L208: What is the unit of 83x83?  - L216: What is a patch here?
