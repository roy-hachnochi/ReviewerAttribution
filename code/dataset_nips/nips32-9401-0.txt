This paper proposed a new rerandomized densification strategy for minhash as well as a bin-wise CWS. The proposed method achieves the smallest variance among all densification schemes.  Densification of one permutation hashing is a very important problem, and this work proposed a new technique that achieves the smallest variance. The idea of this paper is quite interesting to me, and I like the analysis and experiment of this paper.  Overall, the idea of this paper is interesting and it is a great incremental advance in the field of densification one permutation hashing. So, I would like to give a positive vote for this paper.
