The authors introduce and interesting concept of the potential for self-care interventions to increase
accessibility to Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) services in humanitarian settings.
However, the authors have not made a strong case, with strong evidence as to how introducing this
intervention will help address some of the challenges of implementing SRHR services mentioned in their
paper. For example, are there any pre-conditions necessary within the health care system for self-care
interventions to achieve intended outcome (s)? What kinds of support does a patient need for any SRHR
self-care interventions to succeed? Do patients need some level of supervision or oversight? What are

some of the unique challenges anticipated in humanitarian settings while implementing self-care
interventions? How can these be overcome?
Lines 29-36 (pg 4), the authors explain certain factors that limit the realization of SRHR, and
recommend self-care interventions. However, it does not seem to be clear how well self-care will address
these factors when introduced.
Line 36 (pg4), at the end of this paragraph, there needs to be a transition sentence or two introducing
the concept of self-care interventions and its potential to overcome these challenges in humanitarian
settings.
Lines 48-60, (pg 4). Considering all the limitations outlined in this paragraph, the authors should explain
how self-care will succeed in humanitarian setting. Can self-care interventions be provided independent
of these factors? For example, in a weak health care system such those in humanitarian settings, is
self-care in itself sufficient? Are there specific SRHR interventions that lend themselves to self-care
interventions?
On the discussion about involvement of adolescents and LGBTI, it is not very clear how using self-care
will address the issues mentioned by the authors. For example in lines 44-56 (pg5), the authors are
making a case for exploring adolescentsâ€™ lived experiences in SRHR priorities. The authors did not make
the connection between this assertion and the need for self-care. Are the authors trying to communicate
that there are certain population groups in humanitarian settings that should be prioritized with self-care
interventions? Why?
The two case studies on: 1) The case of HIV self-testing and 2) The case of self-injectable long acting
contraceptives, the authors have provided these without adequate analysis on the processes that led to
their implementation and whether these processes can be replicated in humanitarian settings. Line Lines
31-34 Lines 29-36, the authors explain certain factors that limit the realization of SRHR, and directly
recommend self-care. However, it does not seem to be clear how sex care addresses these factors. At
the end of that paragraph there needs to be a transition sentence or two introducing self-care and how it
is ideal to overcome these factors.
The authors need to explain how self-care will work in humanitarian emergencies considering all the
limitations listed in lines 48-60 in page 4. Can self-care be provided independent of these factors? For
example, in a weak health care system such as those in humanitarian emergencies, is self-care in itself
sufficient? Is there a need for a strong health care system? Can it work with a weak health system?
How do the patients get back up support in a weak system?
On (pg 9), the authors mention that there is scant evidence on feasibility, safety and uptake of DMPA in
humanitarian settings. Why do the authors want consideration for this intervention even though there is
little evidence in humanitarian setting?
While self-care interventions have the potential to reduce barriers of access, it is not very clear how its
implementation in humanitarian settings will help the situation given the unique challenges in this
context.
