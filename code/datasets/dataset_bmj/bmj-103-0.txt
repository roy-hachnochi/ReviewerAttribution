The authors revised the article improving the opening and concluding sections, and the overall
reporting.
The proposed solutions in the section “clearing the fog” are very interesting and relevant (in particular
corporate funding pool and public funding). To better sustain the proposed solutions, the authors
should briefly refer to the factors needed to foster these solutions (and the barriers), and who is
involved (public grants according to the policies in different healthcare services; the increasing
demands to patient groups in terms of engagement in clinical research and health services; the role of
pharmaceutical industries…).
Finally, please note that reference n. 10 (Herxheimer A) is listed two times (n. 10 and n. 44), and
reference n. 34 seems incomplete.
