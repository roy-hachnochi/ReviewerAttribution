This paper charts changes over time in frequency of sex in Britain, reporting data from the
rigorously conducted NATSAL surveys at three time points over 20 years.
This paper is of definite interest to BMJ readers.
Methods
The analyses are rigorous and methods clearly described.
Results
The tables are clear and easy to follow.
However, it is difficult to follow results cited in the text since figures are given by gender
from three time points, each citing the confidence intervals. Can the confidence intervals
be omitted from the text, since they are given in the tables?
The trends over time would be easier to see if presented in graphical form as well as in the
tables, for example in bar charts (which could also indicate confidence intervals and allow
visual comparison by gender).

I think that an analysis of the trends over time by gender and gender of partner/s is
needed, to see whether there are differences by same-gender; both gender; and 'opposite'
gender partnerships (since numbers of partners differ in these groups for example).
• Interpretation and conclusions
Sadly, I don’t think that we can yet say “Further, gender equality may now extend to the
sexual sphere; where previously women may have felt obliged to meet their partner’s
sexual needs irrespective of their own, they no longer do so”
• Abstract/summary/key messages/What this paper adds
The abstract is clear, although would be easier to follow without the confidence intervals.
•
Key message:
Perhaps clearer to say:
Our study shows a marked decline in frequency of sex amongst the sexually active in
Britain, and an increase in celibacy
Summary:
I think this paper would be strengthened by additional analyses by gender of partner/s if
space permits, or at least discussion of this in the Discussion section.
