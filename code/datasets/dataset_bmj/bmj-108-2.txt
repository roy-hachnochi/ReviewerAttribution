Thank you for asking me to review this interesting network meta- analysis reviewing surgery
for SUI. With more that 140 different operations described it remains clear that there is no
ideal operation for SUI although the use of MUS has revolutionized our current management.
This is currently very topical and the BMJ has already ran some 'tabloid' type press articles
regarding the role of the MUS. Consequently it is reassuring to see the evidence and I think
this should be published for two reasons; because it is a very good paper and also for the
sake of editorial balance.
This is a very well written, well referenced and thorough review of surgery for SUI. The
paper is clear and comprehensive and well illustrated and supported by appropriate tables
and figures. The findings are not surprising but this NMA gives the clear message regarding
what are the most efficacious methods for the surgical management of SUI. It also clearly
shows that reverting to the older more traditional operations will ultimately lead to increased
morbidity, longer hospital stay and a greater drain on hospital resources.
Given the important message from this NWA and the wide readership of the BMJ I think this
paper is timely and important and warrants publication.
A couple of minor points;
- It is detrusor overactivity rather that detrusor instability (Fig 5)
- And I am not sure Australia and NZ ever banded all MUS... certainly some have been
re-instated now.
A slightly larger question;
- Why were Bulking agents excluded? These have become increasingly important now that
MUS are 'paused' and I think it would be important to include them - particularly as the
authors have included PFMT
Overall I really enjoyed reading and reviewing this paper and would certainly support
publication.
