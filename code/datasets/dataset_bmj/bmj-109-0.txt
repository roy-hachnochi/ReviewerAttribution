Overall, this is an interesting study and well-written manuscript, which examined the
prospective association between glucosamine use and CVD risk, using data from the large
UK Biobank. The authors found a reduced risk for several cardiovascular outcomes
associated with regular glucosamine use, after adjustment for a number of potential
confounders.
While these results are attractive, I would suggest caution in the interpretation of these
findings in terms of potential causation. We have observed several disappointing results
from clinical trials of nutritional supplements and chronic disease prevention, despite
consistent observational evidence. Hence, I would not over-interpret these results as
suggestive of causal effect, but simply as observational associations. Specific suggestions
for the authors:
1) Please provide sex-stratified analyses, given the large sample size and the need to
examine potential sex differences.
2) Glucosamine use might represent an overall marker for a healthy lifestyle, so please
address this possibility in your discussion.
3) Please rule out potential selection bias in your study population, given the large number
of excluded participants.
4) A major limitation of this study is the lack of detailed information on duration and dose
of glucosamine use, which does not allow to explore the nature of this potential association
with CVD risk.
5) I would suggest to attenuate the interpretation of results, as simple observational
findings, thus refraining from any statement suggesting causation.
