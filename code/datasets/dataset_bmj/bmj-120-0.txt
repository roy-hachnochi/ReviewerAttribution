This is an interesting and useful study on determinants of the trend in mortality from acute stroke in
England using HES and ONS death data. However, there are a few major issues requiring discussion and
further attention:
1.
The authors claimed this is a population-based study, however strictly speaking it is not. This is
only hospital episodes study and likely to under-estimate all the rates as shown in the established
population based stroke registers that estimate in the UK there are about 10% stroke patients who are
community patients and not admitted to hospitals. Also, another dataset, the Sentinel Stroke National
Audit Programme (SSNAP), may be more suitable for this type analysis with more specific and detailed
data on stroke although it is hospital based. Can the authors discuss these point.
2.
Although useful confirmatory data to previous studies, the paper only provided facts on mortality,
events and case fatality. They are all closely linked outcomes and basically quite similar and hence,
highly correlated. The paper lacks any risk factors for stroke therefore is somewhat superficial in
explaining the determinants of these trends. Also, there are no primary and secondary prevention
treatment data at all, which makes the analysis and conclusion regarding care unjustified and
incomplete.
3.
The section on ‘study population and selection criteria’. It’s not ‘population-based mortality’ as
there are stroke patients who are not admitted. Regarding the definition of event, ‘Events were identified

as a hospital admission for stroke, or as a death with stroke as the underlying cause without a
corresponding hospital admission for stroke in the preceding 30 days”, however, what about stroke
patients not admitted and patients admitted to hospital due to other cause of disease but had stroke
while in the hospital? All these were likely to contribute to the potential biases of the study findings.
Also, why only use 30 days case fatality? What about 7 days, 6 months and 1 year case fatalities to
further investigate links with acute care and longer term care?
4. The new methods or messages from this paper are not strong, the advantage being mainly the use of
whole country linked data which has been reported before. The relevance to practitioners should be
clearer.
5. Reference 27 appears to be missing.
6. The strengths and limitations says this is the largest study of stroke morbidity..., although unclear
what morbidities are presented here?
