The value of this paper's conclusions to the patient are marginal except insofar as they
reinforce the conventional messages about life-style choices and cardiovascular risk. But
to the interested lay person – heart patient or not – the whole matter is intriguing and
certainly worth reading.
Allowing for the “noise” in a system of this sort, we can say that about half the effect that
is being investigated has been accounted for; what can the rest be due to? The authors
propose some candidate factors and of these the most likely are surely those with
haemorheological implications, since
both MI and stroke are essentially fluid-dynamical phenomena. But this of course overlooks
the fact that many of these other conditions are often grouped – thus high BMI and
hypercholesterolaemia are often joint products of diet, so that covering one of these
variables will have covered the other as well, for the purposes of this study.
A likely source of a bias that would explain at least some of the unaccounted effect is the
fact that smoking habits and history are self-reported. The data here is therefore more
correctly describable as “self-image” than “fact”, and smoking being generally known to be
an undesirable, even anti-social habit, the error will all be in one direction. Similarly, the
prime variable, educational level, is also self-reported (I am assuming that Biobank
registration did not require the production of degree certificates, etc), and education being
generally accepted as a good thing, errors, whether of memory or fancy, will be
unidirectional. Note that these two effects would affect the results in the same way, ie both
may help account for the unexplained difference.

There was no patient or public involvement (PPI) in the design or pursuit of the work
reported which seems a pity to this reviewer, for it might have at least led to a discussion
of these and similar points.
