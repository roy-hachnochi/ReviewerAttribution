In this work, the authors aim to identify factors causally affected by educational attainment
that may themselves increase the risk of Cardiovascular Disease, Coronary Heart Diseses
and Stroke. Particularly, through a series of Mendelian randomization (MR) and
observational methods they assess what fraction of the effect of education on these
diseases can be explained by BMI, smoking and blood pressure. This is a very fine paper
showing how MR can be used to study mediation.
Below I comment in each of the criteria followed by minor comments/suggestions.
• Originality - does the work add enough to what is already in the published literature? If
so, what does it add? If not, please cite relevant references.
My greatest concern about this work is its originality. MR has been used to assess the
causal relationship between these risk factors and CVD/CHD (1-3 [and others]). However,
these were not cited in this Manuscript. Also, the effect on Educational attainment on BMI
and SBP has been previously assessed through MR (4). Given that the effect of Educational
Attainment on BMI and SBP is known and that it is also known that BMI and SBP is causally
related to CVD, it is expected (as they lie in the same causal path) that BMI and SBP
mediates a fraction of the effects of Educational Attainment on CVD.
• Importance of work to general readers - does this work matter to clinicians, patients,
teachers, or policymakers? Is a general journal the right place for it?
Yes, this work is important for policymakers as it identifies diverse intervention avenues for
CVD/CHD/Stroke.
• Scientific reliability
Overall, the statistical methods and data are sound. However, please discuss/clarify the
points below:
In the main text the authors mention they used the SSGAC GWAS summary results from
the latest SSGAC Educational Attianment GWAS. However this has UK Biobank in it. In
contrast, in the supplementary material they mention that the older SSGAC Educational
Attainment GWAS was used instead. Please clarify as using the summary statistics
containing UK Biobank may inflate the MR estimate.
Detail how principal components were used to identify “similar genetic ancestry”.
Please give the parameters used in the function clump_data from the Two-Sample MR R
package, e.g. what was the R^2 threshold?
A sample of 318,147 individuals from UK Biobank was splitted into 2 to run the smoking
and SBP GWAS. Do these samples correspond to unrelated individuals? If not, please
comment if there could be potential bias due to related individuals in both samples.
The effects of Education Attainment on CVD are higher in MR than observational estimate.
Please comment if pleiotropy (including if IVs of Education may be acting directly on CVD
and not through their effect on Education).
Similarly, please comment if reverse causality (e.g. BMI on Educational Attainment (5))
may bias the results.
• Research Question - clearly defined and appropriately answered?

Yes.
• Overall design of study - adequate ?
Yes.
• Participants studied - adequately described and their conditions defined?
Yes.
• Methods - adequately described? Complies with relevant reporting standard - Eg
CONSORT for randomised trials ? Ethical ?
Refer to my comments in the “Scientific reliability” section
• Results - answer the research question? Credible? Well presented?
Overall, the results are well presented. Please consider some of the suggestions/comments
below:
The captions of the figure do not have the figure number, I got lost a few times while
reading through it.
Please include scatter plots of the effect of SNPs against exposure and outcome (bzx vs
bzy).
Would be useful to move some of the supplementary tables to the main text (e.g.
ST22-ST25) to gauge the sensitivity tests.
• Interpretation and conclusions - warranted by and sufficiently derived from/focused on
the data? Message clear?
Yes. However, I feel would be good to mention that these estimates may only be adequate
to European populations. Also please discuss some of the points I raised in “Scientific
reliability” section
• References - up to date and relevant? Any glaring omissions?
Previous MR studies should be cited and discussed. See my comments in the “Originality”
section
• Abstract/summary/key messages/What this paper adds - reflect accurately what the
paper says?
Yes
Minor details (typos):
“Individuals of White British descent were defined using both self-reported questionnaire
data with similar genetic ancestry based on the genetic principal components (PC) (17).” Should it read “ using both self-reported questionnaire data and similar genetic ancestry
based on the genetic principal components”?
“In all methods, a longer time in education was associated with lower ORs of BMI, SBP and
smoking (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 4).” - Should it read “was associated with
lower BMI, SBP and smoking”?

“However, it is important that over half of the effects of education remain unexplained in
these analyses.” - Should it read “is important to note” ?
