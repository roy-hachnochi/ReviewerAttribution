This paper addresses the confirmatory results of the assessment of birthweight and
preterm births with the development of CKD. The authors have employed a cohort registry.
The findings of an association have been previously shown from numerous previous
studies. many of these important studies have not been included in the references but
should be to define the unique contribution of this current study. specific comments:

1] a comprehensive literature review should be completed.

2] The implications for population CKD and ESRD rates should be better described.

3] Hypertension and diabetes treatment might be addressed in such greater detail.

4] given the previous study results and the current results, the specific clinical implications
should be addressed in greater detail

5] The future research of the topic should be better defined
