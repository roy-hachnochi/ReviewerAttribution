Crump et al. have conducted a population-based study of preterm birth in relation to CKD
from childhood into mid-adulthood. These findings will be of interest to pediatricians as
well as to other researchers in the field. However, the following points need to be clarified.
1.
This manuscript does not include birth weight information. Nephron endowment
can be affected not only by preterm birth but also by low birth weight. This tendency is
reportedly strongly associated with fetal growth restriction (formerly called intrauterine
growth retardation). Therefore, assessment based only on gestational age is likely to be
confounded by birth weight. This should be stated as a limitation of the study.
2.
Related to the above concern is the question of how many children in the study
had fetal growth restriction. The authors stated that early term birth (37–38 weeks) also
increased risk. However, if a number of children with FGR were included, it might also
confound the results, leading to erroneous conclusions.
3.
The authors state that this is the first large population-based study of preterm
birth in relation to CKD. However, a similar population-based study from Japan has already
been published (Hirano et al. Nephrol Dial Transplant. 2016; 31: 1895-1900). This
manuscript is very important since maternal information of Japan is accurate as it is
recorded in Maternal and Child Health Handbook in all cases. Therefore, the word “first”
should be deleted, and the article by Hirano et al. should be included in the references.
4.
In this study, the authors estimated the gestational age of children born in the
1980s using ultrasound assessment but, for those born in the 1970s, by maternal report of
the last menstrual period. The latter may be inaccurate if the menstrual cycle is unknown
or irregular, resulting in possible uncertainty of a few weeks in the actual gestational age.
Therefore, the authors should mention this as a limitation of the study.
