As a CABG patient (22 years ago) I have had troponin tests every now and then during
subsequent angina episodes. As a patient involved in lay representation for the intervening
years (I was a lay representative on the steering group for Quality Improvement Scotland's
Health Technology Report 4 Jan 2004 on The organisation of troponin testing services)I have
frequently voiced the need for studies such as this one.
That is to use the vast amount of information available to fine tune the approach to elevated
troponin levels.
Unfortunately the statistics used to investigate the data are beyond my comprehension , as
is the interpretation of same.
So, if those better used to this methodology are happy with it then I am delighted that such
a hugely impressive number of patients (>250,000)and, their follow up, can significantly aid
in the clinical decision making process.This can only be to the benefit of patients he world
over put in that worrying presentation position
