Whilst the authors agreed that my comments were insightful and appropriate,
they have elected only to make made some very small additions following my
previous comments, and to continue with reporting the “replacement food
analysis” against my recommendations. IN my opinion, including this analysis as
currently reported makes the paper misleading and not acceptable for publication
as it continues to imply that the authors can make stronger claims about the
value of food replacement than are warranted. It is an overinterpretation of the
data. It does not appropriately acknowledge that all the replacement analysis is
a statistical modelling exercise. Adding two sentences to the end of the
discussion about this is inadequate.
I have taken the opportunity to “test” the understanding of this analysis with
some experienced colleagues here, all of whom have been misled by the claims
which the authors are making. For example, the claims in the abstract that: “A
reduction in one serving/day of red meat along with an increase in an alternative
food choice was associated with a lower risk of death, and the largest benefits
were seen for replacement by nuts”; “Decreasing red meat and simultaneously
increasing other healthier animal or plant foods over years was associated with
lower mortality” are written implying that Every person who I have shown this
too has thought that you must be studying people who have made this change,
rather than it being predicted from a statistical modelling exercise.
As I indicated previously, the change data on red meat and other food product
consumption that the authors have in this study is of value and importance. The
replacement data is a hypothetical modelling exercise, is at best speculative, and
should not be reported alongside the real cohort data.
