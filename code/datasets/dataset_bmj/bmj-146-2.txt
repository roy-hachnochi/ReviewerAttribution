The authors have done a very good job in responding to the reviewers’ comments and the current
version of the manuscript is significantly improved because of that. There are some minor comments
that I would like them to review but have marginal impact to the overall paper. These are itemized
below:
In the Abstract it is not clear what is meant when the authors say that sotagliflozin 400gm compared
with 200mg was not more effective for adverse events. Please clarify
It might be sensible to explain in the Methods how they dealt with comparisons of studies with multiple
arms and single placebo arm in their meta-analysis. Even though this is a suggested approach in the
Cochrane Handbook, it is one of several options.
Please clarify if reduction in eGFR is actually positive (as shown in Figure 4) or if it is negative; as >eGFR
is meant to be a better outcome. Might need to change text accordingly. This “decline” appears to be
addressed in the Discussion but it is still unclear if the direction is correct.
In the final part of the Results, the reporting of discontinuation is a bit confusing. Do 35.8% of patients
REPORTING DKA discontinued WHILE 6.9 of TOTAL patients discontinued because they experienced
diarrhea? Please be consistent in what the denominator is (if at all possible) or if not possible, be clear
what the denominator is.
Please consider editing sentence: “Three RCTs evaluated the effects of sotagliflozin 400 mg and 200 mg
and one {of these} RCTs assessed also the 75mg dose-effect.”
Please note that calculation of OIS is not standardized. Some researchers might use different alpha and
beta (e.g. alpha = 0.01 and beta = 0.1) . Please include somewhere in your Table 1 and Table 2 the
values used in your estimation of the OIS as part of the reporting transparency.
As a side note, this is probably the first Cochrane RoB figure I have seen with ALL cells in green. It is
extraordinary. Having said that, I am not an expert in RoB and have to take the authors’ ratings at face
value. Their reported rater concordance is pretty high.
