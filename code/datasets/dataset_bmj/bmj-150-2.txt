This is a very well written and supported research article with a large sample size and high rate of
follow-up which contributes important information on the safety of influenza vaccination during
pregnancy to the literature. Few studies have assessed the safety of maternal influenza vaccination
beyond the first 6-12 months of life. This assessment of safety 5 years after vaccination will be
important in convincing mothers to receive influenza vaccination.
I have a few questions/comments for the authors consideration:
Page 8 lines 10-13: Excluded infants with missing information on 2009 pH1N1 vaccination during
pregnancy – 11%. Do we understand the reasons for lack of documentation for these 11%? Were any
sensitivity analyses undertaken to include these infants? I see in results/discussion that you state they
had similar characteristics to study population.
Page 8 line 52: Does pediatric complex chronic diseases include autism/ASD? Average age of diagnosis
for ASD is 4 years, earlier if more severe. I don’t see it among the neurologic conditions F84.0 in ICD-10
(not as familiar with CA version though).
Page 12 line 47: experienced least frequently – should this be less frequently? I think you mean least
frequently among infectious outcomes but it sounds strange because the next result presented is less
common.
Page 17 line 15: Was ASD not considered as a primary outcome given this finding?

Minor:
Table titles should include sufficient descriptors to stand alone – suggest add location and time period at
a minimum.
Different size fonts in heading of Table 2.
