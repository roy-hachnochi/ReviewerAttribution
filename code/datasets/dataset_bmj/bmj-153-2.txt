I think the authors for their detailed responses to mine and the other reviewers
comments as well as providing several additional analysis to_the robustness of
the data and to address the concerns of the reviewers. In particular, appreciate
discussions about the methodological approach and its association with causal
inference. My comments to the prior version may have been too strict as the
authors clearly followed a causal inference methodology and this has now been
made clear in the revised manuscript. However, I think that addition rewording is
not necessary as the authors greatly discuss the limitations of their approach.
Thank you for testing the assumptions of the instrument and for specifying that it
has not been used in the propensity score model. I agree with the careful
interpretation of this analysis.
I would recommend adding to the "what this study adds"section that the found
increased risk where partly of small magnitude.
It may be worth adding a section of the clinical implications as well as a
suggestion of further targeted research to understand the found effects.
I would suggest to not bold results in table 2, 3, 5 and 6 for which the 95% CI
does not cross the null value.
I believe that a statement of patient involvement and plan for distributing the
results is missing.
The authors may consider rewording the title of this study, as I'm not sure what
is meant by the burden of death. I would also recommend being consistent when
stating the title, the objectives, and the main outcome measures.
