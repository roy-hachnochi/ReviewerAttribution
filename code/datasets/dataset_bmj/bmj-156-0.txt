I would like to thanks the authors for using the most up-to-date data in their revision. I
have an number of suggestions for improvement.
On page 12 the tramadol only category was described as the comparison category in yet in
the formal analysis description (pg 13) short acting opioids (excluding tramadol) was the
reference. This needs to be consistent.
I believe that the statistical analysis was carried out correctly and it is likely that
'appropriate' methods were used but the statistical methods section need further clarity to

understand what was done. As an example, the authors mention that 'Regression Models'
were used but what were these models and what were the assumptions and were these
met?
There is discussion around censoring so were survival models used (or were
censored events ignored in the analysis)? This is inefficient. The section previously on
'definitions of prolonged opioid use' also mentions the use of logistic regression - this
should ideally be put in the stats method section.
Figure 1 - perhaps report % on the y-axis and not proportion to be consistent with the
reporting in the manuscript.
Table 1 - I would also report the 'male' data. This table is quite large and at the editors
discretion may need modifying.
Figure 2 - when describing the results to the higher median discharge fill, you may also
want to comment on the uncertainly - the range is very large. Where you provide median
fill data in the text, I would also add the interquartile ranges.
Thanks you for also considering variants of the exclusion criteria in your response. For
transparency I would recommend that the main analysis remains as planned using the
updated dataset. This is to avoid any potential for bias from looking at the results form
several analyses.. Other analysis could be included if of interest and labelled something
along the lines as 'post-hoc' analysis.
