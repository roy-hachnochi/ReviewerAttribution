The manuscript by Ekelund and colleagues describes a harmonised pooled analysis of
physical activity and sedentary behaviour and risk for all cause mortality. Physical activity
was measured in the included studies using waist-worn accelerometry devices from 2
manufacturers (Actigraph and Actical).
The idea is novel, the paper is well written, and
the statistical analyses are carefully planned, executed, and reported. Results are
interpreted in a clear and straightforward way and the paper will be of interest to both
clinicians and policy makers with an interest in physical activity. The main strength of the
study is the harmonisation strategy for the accelerometry physical activity data.
Minimising heterogeneity in the calculation of the exposure is itself a major step forward
for the physical activity field, a field that has historically relied on the rather messy
information questionnaires often provide.

My only major reservation with this paper has to do with the measures taken to reduce
chances of reverse causation, i.e. the possibility that the effect sizes were not inflated by
the inclusion of participants who both had lower physical activity/more sedentary
behaviour and died early due to established sickness. I do not feel that all
possibilities the available datasets offered were exhausted. Two cohorts did not even
adjust for major prevalent disease at baseline (Murabito et al, 2015; Bakrania et al, 2017),
which needs to be acknowledged in the discussion. The majority of cohorts had available
information on history of established/diagnosed CVD (e.g. CHD, stroke) and cancer,
conditions that can encourage or even impose less physical activity and more sedentary
behaviour. Model 3 in these cohorts used such information for adjustments and results
were broadly similar with Model 2 (which was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and SES). This
is not always an adequate measure against reverse causation; it is not uncommon that
adjustment for major chronic disease/disease history in the multivariate model has
minimal impact on the estimates, but stratification of the analyses by disease status
produces very different results in each stratum. A sensitivity analysis excluding all
participants with a history of major CVD and cancer would strengthen the paper by adding
internal validity to these results and confidence to the studyâ€™s key messages.
For the
same reason and considering the relatively short mean follow up (<7yrs), excluding the
first year of follow up is reasonable. But another sensitivity analyses excluding fatal
events in the first 2-3 years of events would also strengthen interpretation and offer
reassurance that the larger than previous literature effects sizes this study reports are
likely to be real.
