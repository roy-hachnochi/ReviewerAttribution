In the revised manuscript the methods and analyses conducted were well designed and
well done, further, now become much comprehensive to the readers. The results gained
that dietary fat quality has an important role for the prevention of CVD and total mortality,
including cancer mortality, among adults with T2D are of very much clinical relevance.
This reviewer appreciates it very much that authors referred to the role of dietary
cholesterol which is often consumed simultaneously with PUFAs and concluded that their
findings are independent of dietary cholesterol intake. This would indicate that dietary
cholesterol intake is not a strong predictor of circulating cholesterol levels due to the
homeostatic cholesterol synthesis in the human body; in contrast, dietary fats are able to
modulate blood cholesterol levels much more strongly than dietary cholesterol. This
concept is yet not relevant in some countries and the present manuscript will help change
this situation.
