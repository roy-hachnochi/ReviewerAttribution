General comments for the Editor and the Authors: I thank the authors for the careful
revision of the manuscript and their detailed response letter.
I have only a minor comment regarding the response to question 8 of the statistical
reviewer: The authors provide arguments why PUFA intake is different between men and
women at baseline, which could be also explained in the manuscript. Please clarify in the
manuscript why Table 1 now show characteristics of participants at midpoint follow-up
instead of baseline (as usually expected in most articles).
