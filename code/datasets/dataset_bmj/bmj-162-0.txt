Thanks for the suggested amendments.
Just a few more minors relating to the same issues I raised before but I don't necessarily
need to see the changes.
The authors have now clarified that logistic regression models were used - this is now
much clearer on what was done. Traditionally these models produce odds ratios, but the
authors report risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (Table 4) and the risk rate
difference. In the text these are listed as IRR's. For the readers, it might be worth adding
a sentence on how these measures were computed from the logistic regression models
fitted.
Please also note you have changed rate ratios to risk ratios - this is not consistently
changed throughout - e.g. Table 4 header still reads 'rate'.
