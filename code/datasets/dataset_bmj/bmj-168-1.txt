This paper addresses a very important question of fundamental relevance for health policy.
The authors did an outstanding job in demonstrating that there is no evidence for a change
of tobacco consumption trends following FCTC implementation.
Although these findings do not support the idea that FCTC did have a major impact on global
tobacco consumption trends, I am afraid that inference regarding causal effects of FCTC are
not possible. We do not know how trends in global tobcco consumption would have
developed in the absence of FCTC. The conclusion of a null effect is made under the
assumption of stable trends in consumption over time (in fact over several decades) which
may or may not be true (with no possibility to check). In the light of these limitations I feel
that the interpretation should be made more cautiously.
