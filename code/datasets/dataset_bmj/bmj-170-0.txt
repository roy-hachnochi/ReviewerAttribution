In this version of the manuscript, further adjustments for relevant conditions occurring
within the exposure timeframe were carried out. The findings have remained robust to these
adjustments and therefore the potential for reverse causality has been minimised.
I think this current version is suitable for publication. I have one very Minor point In the Results section when describing the strength in association between PAEE and
deltaPAEE with the different outcomes, the point estimates for all analyses are consistent
BUT as the models adjust for more covariates and the number of participants/events
decrease, the confidence intervals for the effect of PA on 'cancer mortality' includes 'no
effect'. This is correctly reported for the sensitivity analyses but is not included in the
reporting of the primary analysis. Please correct for consistency.
