In this paper, Alexander et al aimed at analyzing the impact of a recorded diagnosis of
NAFLD on incident CVD, independently of traditional risk factors in 4 population-based
European databeses.
The independent contribution of NAFLD to CVD is a matter of interest for the general
physicians since, as the authors correctly stated (page 6), available analyses could not
disentangle NAFLD from metabolic syndrome and other CVD risk factors. Differently from
what authors stated, however(page 6 line 38-39) knowing that NAFLD is an independent
predictor of CVD would not be mean causality and would not be enough to change clinical
practice toward an aggressive treatment of NAFLD: a trial demonstrating that reducing
liver fat reduces CVD events would be required, as such evidence is currently lacking and
cannot be provided by an observational study.
My biggest concern with this study regards the methods used to define “coded NAFLD”.
Liver steatosis is defined by liver fat exceeding 5% of hepatocytes, and NAFLD
encompasses 2 distinct pathological and prognostic entities, simple steatosis, which does
not progress to liver cirrhosis, and Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH), which can progress
to liver cirrhosis.
The sensitivity of commonly used methods to detect steatosis varies widely:
-liver enzyme elevation is rather insensitive(reported sensitivity for NAFLD around 50%)
-upper abdomen ultrasound works better for liver steatosis affecting at least 30% of
hepatocytes(Saadeh et al, Gastroenterology 2002; 123(3):745-50; Chalasani et al. AASLD
2018 Guidelines Hepatology 2018; 2018 Jan;67(1):328-357. )
-CT scan and MRI/MRS are >90% accurate for milder steatosis grade
-liver biopsy is required to diagnose NASH.
With such premises, it is unclear what method was prevalently used in different databases
to detect fatty liver: if liver enzyme elevation was used extensively, then a susbtantial
proportion of NAFLD cases would have been missed and misclassified as non-NAFLD,
thereby diluting the association of NAFLD with CVD.
Since the overall global prevalence of NAFLD diagnosed by imaging in the general
population is estimated to approach 25% (Younossi et al. Hepatology. 2016;64:73–84) and

the authors reported a much lower NAFLD prevalence (page 3 line 29), I argue this is the
case and NAFLD has been heavily underdiagnosed in this study. This undermines the
confidence one can have in the finding of a lack of independent association between NAFLD
and CVD.
If the authors have the chance, I therefore suggest at the very least presenting separate
figures for NAFLD diagnosed b liver enzyme elevations and by imaging.
Another issue is the accuracy in ruling out competing causes of steatosis, which at a
population level are viruses and alcohol consumption. The authors use repeatedly the term
alcohol abuse to define alcohol-related fatty liver; however, guidelines set the cutoff at a
much lower level of alcohol consumption, namely 140 g ethanol/week for men and 70 g/wk
for women. Again, using “abuse” levels of alcoholo intake would classify many
alcohol-related fatty liver cases as NAFLD. We know that alcoholo affects CVD risk.
In summary, a clearer definition of NAFLD is advisable to confer credit to the findings of
this study
