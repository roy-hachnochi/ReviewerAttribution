1. Reference numbers should be checked in both manuscript and Tables as there is at least
one redundancy (citations 17 and 36 are the same)
2. The method of validation in Table 4 should distinguish between split-sample validation
versus cross-validation. Currently, these are both lumped together as ‘cross validation’.
3. The last sentence of paragraph 1 in the introduction is awkwardly phrased. Please
rewrite.
4. In the Results section, there are two separate references to specific variables being
‘strong predictors of all-cause readmission (Table 2)’, however the effect size is not
mentioned in either the text, the referenced Table 2, or the Supplement. Please clarify.
5. It is worth including another limitation – that the few rigorous studies to date that have
studied interventions targeting hospitalized adults at high risk for readmission have failed
to decrease readmissions (PMID: 25285540; PMID 25268437).
