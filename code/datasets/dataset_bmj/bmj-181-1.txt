How did the authors decide on how to split their quartiles. In general, it can be
done by patients or hospital, i.e groups with equal number of patients or equal number of
hospitals. The results can vary depending on how the analysis is performed.
2)
I am a little surprised at the high rate of non-PE related 30-day mortality. How
was PE death defined? One would assume that most deaths in the 30 days leading to a PE
would PE related. Can the authors elaborate on the causes of death.
3)
It seems like the majority of benefit is not necessarily in the high volume centres
but in not being a very low volume centres. In other words, maybe the threshold is at the
very low volume centres in the first quartile. If this is true it has ramifications on the
authors recommendation of PERT centers. It is not necessarily that high volume centres,
and their corresponding PERT programs, reduce mortality but just that low volume centres
have really bad outcomes and are not at the standard of practice. I think the authors
should temper their conclusions.
4)
I think the risk adjustment for severity of illness is potentially deficit. Without
more granular data (echo, troponin, BNP) the severity of PE may not necessarily be
controlled for. The authors alluded to residual confounding but maybe they can expand on
this. Furthermore, how was blood pressure and heart rate measured. Was it on
admission? Was it a one-time measure or did they use an average? More detail is needed
as the crux of the results are in the risk adjustment.
5)
I believe volume was modelled as a categorical variable. Can the authors expand
on the reason for this. Usual designs in volume outcome studies use fractional polynomials
or restricted cubic splines.
