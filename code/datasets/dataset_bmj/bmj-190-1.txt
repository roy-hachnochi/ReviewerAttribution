Few would doubt that it is timely to consider spreading and scaling-up of innovation across the pages
of the BMJ. Everyone – researchers, clinicians, managers, policy makers, secretaries of state (or their
ministerial equivalent in other countries), and not least patients – have an interest in a health system
that is better than it is now at adopting new things, diffusing evidence, disseminating better practices
and getting them to work widely, across-the-board. The question on the mind of any thinking person
who wants an improved health system is how to do this.
Inevitably, the way to make progress is to think outside of normal boxes and modes of imagining how
to accomplish improvement because it is normal thinking and existing modes of doing this that has
gotten us to where we are today. Because clearly, the health system has some work ahead of it if it is
to improve its current performance. Around 60% of care is in line with level 1 evidence or
consensus-based guidelines; up to 30% is duplication, waste, low-value or futile care; and, 10% of
patients across different settings are harmed.(1)
The question is, does this paper say something sufficiently interesting for the BMJ readership? And, is
it a new slant or is it just a repackaging, that is to say, old wine in new bottles?
To be frank, as I began to read this paper, I had a frame of mind that said there isn’t much new to be
articulated regarding spreading and scaling-up that I hadn’t seen before even though the authors are
very well known and invariably produce insightful work. Having said that, a critical frame is not a bad
stance from which to review a potential contribution.
But I was pleasantly surprised. The authors have examined spread and scale through three
perspectives and have done an excellent job at thinking how we might grapple with innovation and
improvement via these different lenses. It is not a systematic review, and it would be unwise to do
that as the topic area does not deserve that kind of excessively scientific, meta-analytic style review.
Instead the authors have thought about three competing logics: implementation science, which they
take to be a more mechanistic exemplar; complexity science, which they view in an ecological frame;
and social action as a representative of, and a theory drawn from, social science.
While I wouldn’t change this three-fold perspective piece, it is worth pointing out that these are not
the only frames through which health care can be viewed. For example, one could look at theories of
culture,(2) or a resilient health care frame,(3) or through the lens of new public management,(4) or
look at spread and scaling from the perspective of patients and the professions rather than those or
other theoretical logics. However, that would be a different paper, and I for one am tired of reviewers
commenting not on the paper before them, but the paper they would like to see and so I have
resisted the temptation to comment on other theories or perspectives one could take beyond those
encapsulated in this paper.
So, this paper does indeed work and it should it be published in the BMJ. Ignoring that it is a
commissioned piece, it stands on its own two feet. I appreciated the three perspectives and it is
admirable the way the authors have neatly summarised in only a few paragraphs where the field is in
these three areas. The boxes of cases excel in bringing out the text and exemplifying the three
perspectives. The model in Figure 1 is great, but the authors should show what they have added or
modified from Barker et al. (2015)(5) to substantiate their claim that it is based partly on that work.
I also liked the learning health system summary but worried slightly that this introduces yet another
frame of thinking when there are many models from complexity that could be drawn on. I wondered if
it was essential. It made me think though: is there a diagram or model for each of the three
perspectives? But I know space is short in the BMJ, and I wasn’t sure whether that was completely
necessary. I’ll leave that to the editors and authors to think through. Table 1 and the Appendix are
nice contributions and will help both experts and novices to appreciate the underpinnings for the
claims made in the paper.
Three points to raise before concluding. One thing missing from the complexity section is the idea of
the fractal nature of complex adaptive systems. If health systems are fractal, their social patterning

replicates at different scales. This could pose problems for spread and scale, or it could be used to
advantage – to promote change. The authors could take this up in this contribution or leave that for
another day. Second, the authors talk about actor-network theory but not social network analysis
(SNA). Recent work is showing how SNA can expose complexity features of relationships and might be
useful to mention.(6) Or again, as this paper as it currently stands is packed with ideas, that too could
be left for another day. Third, there is a review and model from a systematic review of whether large
scale hospital and system-wide interventions improve outcomes.(7) It may be useful, but again, the
authors may want to use this elsewhere, or not at all.
All-in-all, this is a timely and useful piece of work that fits very well into the recent series that has
been commissioned between the BMJ and the Health Foundation on improving health care (I believe
that’s where this piece is destined to be?). It does, as the authors say in the opening, extend
understanding of spread and scale. So, it contributes what it says on the tin.
