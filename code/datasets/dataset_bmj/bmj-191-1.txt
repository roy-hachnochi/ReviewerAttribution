The intention and execution of this systematic review is good. However I am convinced it
would be better placed in a specialty journal rather than BMJ where the readership covers
multiple disciplines. Journals such as critical care or an emergency medicine journal.
For future clarity I think the "physical examination" need to be clarified at each point as in
the key points, as there is no mention of physically examining the eyes for papilloedema,
with any instrument (Ophthalmascope or panoptic by any medical doctor, by an
ophthalmologist, or using advanced imaging which is developing in this area with fundus
mydratric camera or FLEX optical coherence tomography). This should really be mentioned
in the introduction or discussion.
Physical examination as defined within this paper, would be late signs in my clinical practice
of raised ICP and should be acknowledged as such.
The utility of ONSD ultrasound is not wide spread and is incredibly variable in the literature,
and as seen by the results here. I would be concerned that generalists or those in remote
settings would use ONSD as an indicator based on the pooled data here, despite the cavets
in the body of the text, the conclusions at each the abstract, key points and discussion need
to be worded carefully as to not bias the reader.
I also presume that feature of raised ICP on CT will be also user dependant, where a
dedicated neuroradiologist will be more accurate over a general radiologist, would be worth
mentioning.
I believe the conclusions in general are valid, that none of these tests are individually or
collectively indicate raised ICP. I do think the authors should consider a paragraph of newer
methods, as described above, or examination by someone who can confidently examine the
eyes, or send fundus images to an expert for review.
