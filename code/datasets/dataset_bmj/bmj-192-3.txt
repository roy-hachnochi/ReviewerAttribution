This paper is relevant for scientific and clinical knowledge on dementia, is clear and well
written. The methodology of integrating administrative data with data derived from well
planned research is interesting and promising. The results are consistent with previous
studies and open new perspectives for prevention of dementia.
My major criticism are:
1) why the authors used a Transition analysis for evaluating the role of CVD in dementia
occurrence. The main analysis on CVH score was carried out wit survival analysis and also
the analysis on cvd can be done with the same method using CVD as a time dependent
analysis. I suggest to reanalyse the data with the same method.
2) The author report the "As there was no evidence of effect modification by sex (P for
interaction=0.42), analyses were
undertaken without stratification." I disagree with this sentence since confounding may be
presence even in absence of effect modification. Sex is clearly associated in the authors
data both with exposure and outcome and thus is a good candidate to represent a
confounding factor. I suggest to consider besides to social status, age at enrollment also
sex (gender) as a covariate with potential confounding effect.
3) This might be a minor remark I wonder why for brain volumes the authors reported the
beta coefficients of a linear regression and not the usual survival analysis. I would prefer a
unique method all over the paper at least when possible as in this case.
Finally the number of tables may be reduced and more importantly the authors should
rearrange the distribution amonsupplementary and non supplementary tables.
