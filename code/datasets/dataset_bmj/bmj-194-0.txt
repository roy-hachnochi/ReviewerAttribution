It is an interesting work, but I have few concerns.
1. 'prediction' is a word used to describe the estimation of the chance of developing a event
in future. But the study reported here, by my understanding, is trying to judge the present
state of a child in some aspect of health. 'Daignosis' might be a more appropriate word to
use. In that case, methods and criteria used to evaluate a new diagnosis should be applied.
For example, the correlation coeffiecent between the observed and the estimated
measurements should be reported. In addition, the variation of the difference between the
two measurements by FM or FFM should be reported.
2. The method for developing the estimation model should be elaborated more, so the
readers know how to repeat the work.
3. The title. The term of meta-analysis has special definition. It does not fit in the method
used in this study. the term used here should not be appropriate. The title should be
changed to something like "development and validation of a model to estimate fat mass in
children and adolescents using easily available information".
4. A statistician with experiences in medial tests should review this paper.
