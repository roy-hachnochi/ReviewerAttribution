1. In table 4, "Composite cardiovascular events (on treatment)" entry is confusing. IS
this correct? Wouldn't one would expect the combined therapy group to have lower incident
events given the other results presented in the table?
2. The authors might re-approach the design of the sruddy to primarily attempt matching
based on non-HDL-C groups (LDL-C values + 30 mg/dL, consistent with the ATP-III
formalism). This will better capture the efffect of hypertriglyceridemic effects on
apoB-containing particle burden and TG effects since the non-HDL-C is inclusive of VLDL-C
the main TG-rich lipoprotein in excess in diabetics and metabolic syndrome patients with
moderate hypertriglyceridemic states with TG<500 mg/dL.
