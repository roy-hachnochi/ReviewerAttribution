Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this manuscript by Breda, et al.
Certainly, the topic is of great global importance. In the manuscript, the authors lay out
arguments for promotion of implementation research in moving the NCD agenda forward.
I have a few principal concerns about this paper:
First, I would agree with the initial Editorial Office comment that the paper does not really
put forward new or innovative thinking. The authors review what, I would say, is already
widely known and accepted. For example, the 2 boxes illustrate very widely used elements
of ImpSci research in providing definitions of implementation outcomes and stakeholder
groups. While they have included NCD-relevant details, I do not see this paper, insofar as
it lacks innovative thinking, as appropriate for BMJ.
Second, the paper contains a lot of "us" vs "them" language and this makes me, as a
reader, uncomfortable. Line 26 and line 278 are examples of this. I see that the majority
of authors are WHO-based and I wonder whether this drives the use of such language.
But, I would recommend the authors approach the paper with a less hierarchical
perspective.
A few additional language/grammar comments:
Line 134: I do not think "reimbursement" is the correct word to be used here. Do you
mean financial reimbursement? That is not what the EM model addresses.
In the paragraph of lines 159-169, please be consistent with acronyms. For example, you
introduce MAPs but use MSAPs; you introduce EMR but use EMRO.
Line 220: I believe you mean "adaptation" not "adaption"
Line 277: I believe you mean "responsibility" not "responsible"
