This analysis outlines important priorities for UHC, with a specific emphasis on actions for G20
governments that is unique, to my knowledge.
I found the section on “Harnessing innovation and access to technology and medicine judiciously”
problematic, as it makes a number of assumptions without supportive evidence. For example, there is
little empirical evidence available on private-public partnerships for UHC, and none cited, that would
support the claim that they will be the solution for “meeting health care needs at scale”.
The section on “mutual learning platforms” is excellent and important.
Overall, although the piece was well-written and highlights much-needed considerations in the efforts
to achieve UHC, the format is reflective of a policy brief (as the authors indicate) rather than an
analysis that provides novel insights on UHC. I’d suggest that the analysis would be better suited for
another publication in the current format.
Specific feedback:
p. 9 Line 48- UHC2030 is not explained.
Some explanation of G20 might be required in the intro
The piece is sparsely cited in some areas, e.g. p. 10.
p. 11- there are some current efforts underway to set up common UHC monitoring that the authors
may wish to examine and perhaps link to, such as https://www.healthdatacollaborative.org/.
p. 13, Line 18- spell out acronym
