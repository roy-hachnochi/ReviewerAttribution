Deliberate next steps toward a new globalism for universal health coverage: a call to action by G20
Identifying tractable changes in need of accelerated progress that G20 can uniquely accomplish
towards the goal of Universal Health Coverage
Comments for editor and author:
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this paper. Overall, I enjoyed reading this insightful
paper which pointed out some very important issues we currently face and provided four major
recommendations in order to fast-track our way to achieve UHC: the re-emphasis on primary health
care and healthy migration, accountable financing and resource allocation, innovative (disruptive)
digital technologies, and cross-border monitoring mechanisms.
The underlying concern that I have after reading this paper is that, for the areas of actions suggested,
the vulnerable populations or those living in resource-limited settings will still have the highest barrier
to (obtain information about) access PHC. Inevitably, these are the individuals who are also the least
likely to obtain the relevant resources, the consumers that large corporate industries often neglect
when formulating their marketing strategies, and the part of the population that is less likely to be
picked up by our surveillance mechanisms. Thus, while the arguments seem quite promising, the
practicality of these recommendations remain skeptical and certainly worthy of future investigation.
Strategies for implementation will mostly likely be context-specific and tailored to each country, but it
would be much more persuasive if the authors provided plausible means of tackling each of the
proposed directions.
For instance, it is quite visionary to call upon governments in fostering partnerships between the
technology industry and health organizations (pages 9-11). However, we also know that these large
companies are heavily profit-oriented, so for them to not just simply ‘meet the needs of a privileged
minority’ or to ‘expand markets for suppliers of drugs or diagnostic devices’, adequate incentives must
be provided for them in order to align their interests with that of the governments in achieving UHC.
Sharing a mutual vision between private and public sectors can be extremely difficult. So I am
wondering if the authors have any comments on this?
Also, on the point regarding the health of migrants (pages 5-7), I absolutely agree that the migrants
constitute a significant portion of the vulnerable population which requires our serious attention.
Active efforts must be put in to establish a reliable information system that generates standardized
indicators about their health status. This is actually a shared theme that intersects the 4th
recommendation about cross-country monitoring systems (page 11), as well as mobilizing domestic
resources to ensure fiscal discipline in resource allocation (page 7). In my opinion, many practical
problems remain. Inter-sectoral collaboration among different government bodies is already difficult,
let alone the inter-country collaboration in order to set up this bilateral system and produce a set of

standardized data. This would require extensive level of communication and a commonly shared
interest at the national and international level. So again, is it possible that the authors elaborate
further on this issue? Or perhaps provide the readers some insights and/or evidence about perhaps
how countries should go about achieving this?
Lastly, I feel that the figures need to be discussed more in details in order to support the authors’
arguments in text. The abbreviations used should also be introduced first.
