The authors present an important, clearly described description of the changes in
readmissions and "revisits" among Medicare beneficiaries in the US between 2012 and
2015. Given the international emphasis on such outcomes, it is timely and fills a much
need knowledge gap. The use of national data - along with the specific sample is
appropriate, and the analysis seems appropriate overall as well. Several issues, if dealt
with, could improve the impact of the piece considerably.
1) At present, this is really just a descriptive piece with no real comparison group. A
comparison group is not obvious here, but some additional analysis (or even additional
description) would flesh out these findings. Compare race/ethnic groups? age groups?
Geographic regions? these would enhance the rigor, and better help explain the findings.
We know Medicare expenditures vary widely in US regions/states, so its a little too broad
strokes just to do national figures and interpret these. Without significant additions, this
should probably be a letter with ~ 500-750 words, not a 2000 word piece.
2) These changes are relatively small. Given a small time frame for this level of policy
evaluation (3-4 years), I think this needs to mentioned in the discussion that the clinical
significance of this is uncertain
3) in the discussion, the authors portray an increase in ED visit and DC and OBS stays as a
bad thing, citing 1 paper. I'm not sure this is enough to pronounce this trend as negative,
especially when the associated cost difference of inpatient stay- obs/ED might be
significant, and reduced cost is also a significant goal of initiatives to reduce readmission.
Examining mortality in this dataset, estimating cost differences, or looking at diagnoses
associated with "revisits" would strengthen the argument here. The authors need to at
least have more equipoise in their discussion about the implications of the trend
