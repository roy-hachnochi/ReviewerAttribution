Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. The use of a large administrative
dataset to highlight the challenges of 30 day readmissions as a measure of quality are well
described. This paper highlights how an unintended consequence of the use of 30 day
readmissions as a quality measure may be longer short stays or ED visits which are not
formally considered readmission but still include a patient returning to hospital for care.
Overall, this paper makes this case forcefully but some additional discussion regarding
unintended consequences of health policy or administrative decisions would be warranted,
perhaps drawing on the literature from elsewhere... there has been much written on this
topic regarding the star rating system in the UK and ED wait times.
A few specific comments:
Page 7, line 45 - there is an error in text reading "Poison regression", should be Poisson
Page 10, lines 3 to 10 - The authors note that early death is associated with ED visits or
short stay 30 days after hospital discharge , however the outcome of death is not explored
in any depth in the paper nor it is noted as a data limitation. Offering some explanation as
to why this was decided would be useful and would in particular strengthen this important
argument in the paper.
