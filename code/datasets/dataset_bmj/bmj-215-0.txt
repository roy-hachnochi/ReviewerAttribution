Recommendation: Minor Revision
Comments for the Authors:
This systematic review paper is comprehensive, informative and relatively easy to read.
The conclusions appear to be supported by the study results and statistical analyses.
Nevertheless, the authors may decide to check the manuscript for minor typing errors and
writing style.
It may not be possible to provide a mean/median daily vitamin D supplementation dose on
the basis of all included studies due to different treatment regimens and dosing intervals
(i.e., daily, weekly, monthly and/or bolus doses). Furthermore, it is difficult to determine at
this stage exactly what could be considered as an effective/optimal daily dose of vitamin D
supplementation. It may be useful in current and/or future clinical trials to obtain data on
not only the administered daily doses but also the vitamin D status in study groups before,
during, and after treatment to determine the effectiveness/efficacy of vitamin D
supplementation in improving the actual vitamin D status (i.e., circulating 25(OH)D and its
active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D). Long-term vitamin D status is expected to be much more
accurate, reliable and important clinical parameter when compared to a daily dose of

vitamin D supplementation (e.g., some RCT participants may not strictly comply with the
recommended/prescribed vitamin D supplementation).
Hollis & Wagner, 2004 suggest that a daily vitamin D dose of 250 μg (10,000 IU) for up to
5 months is not expected to elevate circulating 25(OH)D to concentrations greater than 90
ng/mL (225 nmol/L), while daily doses of less than 25 μg (1,000 IU) may not be adequate
for maintaining even physiologically normal circulating 25(OH)D levels of 15–80 ng/mL
(37–200 nmol/L) (Hollis & Wagner, 2004: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15113709
).
Drincic et al. (2012) indicate that “it has been shown for normal weight adults that total
body utilization of vitamin D needed to sustain a serum level of 25(OH)D of 32 ng/ml (80
nmol/l) is on the order of 4,000 IU/day (citing Heaney et al. 2003: Human serum
25-hydroxycholecalciferol response to extended oral dosing with cholecalciferol. Am J Clin
Nutr 77:204–210.), and for 40 ng/ml (100 nmol/l), 5,000 IU/day” and that “vitamin D
replacement therapy needs to be adjusted for body size if desired serum 25(OH)D
concentrations are to be achieved” (see link:
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2011.404/pdf ). In a paper on practical
guidelines for the supplementation of vitamin D and the treatment of deficits in Central
Europe, Pludowski et al. (2013:
http://czasopisma.viamedica.pl/ep/article/view/EP.2013.0012/25848 ) recommend vitamin
D intakes in the general population and groups at risk of vitamin D deficiency.
These limitations and uncertainties potentially associated with vitamin D supplementation
dose vs. vitamin D status in treatment and control groups should be acknowledged and
discussed for the reader in greater detail.
Regarding vitamin D supplementation for prevention of cancer, the authors may decide to
include in the discussion a systematic review study by Bjelakovic et al., 2014 (Cochrane
Collaboration:
https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007469.pub2/epdf/full ),
where a weak association was observed between vitamin D supplementation and all-cause
mortality as well as cancer-related mortality.
Some specific comments:
The authors suggest in the Implications section (page 12): “The clinical implication of our
findings is that the widespread use of vitamin D supplementation for adults may be not
justified”. This generalization may not be accurate. Adequate Vitamin D status is required
for a normal physiological function and there is evidence in the published literature
indicating potentially significant vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency in the general
population worldwide.
It may be useful to establish threshold doses of vitamin D supplementation at which
optimal serum 25(OH)D levels and vitamin D sufficiency can be expected in different
population subgroups such as obese, elderly, pregnant/lactating women, children, people
with dark skin pigmentation, people spending most of the day indoors and away from
sunlight (~90% of the time), people with impaired vitamin D metabolism/hydroxylation
(e.g., inadequate expression of the enzyme CYP27B1 to form functional 1,25(OH)2D),
people with defective vitamin D receptor (VDR), people with chronic diseases, allergies and
asthma, immunocompromised individuals, and those living in the regions of high
geographical latitude.
Currently available data on the basis of modern urban populations may not be offering
reasonable estimates of what could be considered as normal/optimal serum 25(OH)D
concentration for an average individual. Luxwolda et al. (2012;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264449 ) indicate that “Populations with

traditional lifestyles having lifelong, year-round exposure to tropical sunlight might provide
us with information on optimal vitamin D status from an evolutionary perspective”. The
authors show that populations in East Africa have a mean serum 25(OH)D concentration of
115 nmol/L (46 ng/ml) with a range of 58-167 nmol/L (23-67 ng/ml) in Maasai and 71-171
nmol/L (28-69 ng/ml) in Hadzabe population. It should be noted that these people use
moderate degree of clothing and spend most of the day outdoors as it was historically the
case for human populations inhabiting tropical regions. Our genetic ancestry tree has its
evolutionary roots in Africa (see, for example, Weaver and Roseman, 2008:
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/evan.20161/pdf )
There is also evidence in the published literature suggesting that, in comparison to native
populations, migrants from tropical regions residing in high latitudes and who are not
obtaining vitamin D through diet or supplementation may be at a greater risk of developing
vitamin D deficiency and some associated diseases (see, for example, Hintzpeter et al.,
2008: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18641195 ; and Jablonski and Chaplin, 2012:
http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1590/785.full.pdf+html ).
