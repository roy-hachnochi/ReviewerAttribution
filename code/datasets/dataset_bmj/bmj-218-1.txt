Zhao and colleagues report on a systematic review and network meta-analysis of clinical
trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of EGFR inhibitors for patients with advanced
stage non-small cell lung cancer. Robust statistical methods and meticulous analysis have
been performed. The manuscript is written very well without any semblance of bias.
Major comments:
1. Introduction: Authors note that nearly half of all cases of NSCLC harbor EGFR mutation;
this certainly true in Asia, but does not hold true for the global NSCLC patient population.
2. Authors note that there is a lack of head-to-head trials with EGFR TKIs. This is not
accurate since there are not multiple trials reported in the literature with direct comparisons
including FLAURA, ARCHER, LUX Lung 7, etc.
3. Methods: Erlotinib plus linsitinib is an experimental combination that is not approved for
use. It is unclear why this study was included.
4. Authors note the role of co-mutations. This is an important and emerging topic. More
information about how many studies reported co-mutations, the type of co-mutations
reported and their respective impact on outcome is of interest.
5. The discussion would be stronger if it explained why the findings of this study are of
relevance to the readership and how it changes current management of lung cancer.

6. The information is of interest to physicians that care for lung cancer patients; a better
explanation of the importance to the general medical audience (of the BMJ) will make the
case stronger for consideration of publication in BMJ. As it stands, it would be more suited to
a sub-speciality journal.
