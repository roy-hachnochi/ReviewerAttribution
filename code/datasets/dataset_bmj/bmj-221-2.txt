Using the latest Beijing health reform in 2017, itâ€™s important that the analysis showed the
comprehensive hospitals reform redirected patients to PHC, reduced drug sale in public
hospitals while gave rise to a growth of expensive examinations. The analysis is innovative
and interesting; however, addressing two minor issues relative can strengthen results of
this paper.

1)
Evidence on whether the comprehensive hospitals reforms reduce health
expenditure should be provided, as one of the utmost important targets of the reform.
2)
The alignment of incentives between different stakeholder should be further
justified. Intuitively, due to significant information asymmetry between health workers
and patients, supplier can and always induce unnecessary demand of patients to cover the
profit loss in the reform, which also be supported by a significant increase use of MRI and
CT. In this case, how does the alignment work?
