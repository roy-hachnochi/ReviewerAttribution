This is an original study which provides information about the medium term outcome of two operations
for uterine prolapse, one uterine sparing (Sacrospinous hysteropexy), the other non-sparing (vaginal
hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension) as part of a prospective RCT with a 5 year
follow-up. As such, it is the best comparative evidence we currently have regarding the medium-term
outcome of these two interventions, and the authors conclude that sacrospinous hysteropexy is at least
as good if not better, a finding which may well have major implications for how we manage this common
condition in the future. It is therefore an important study.
I have no concerns about the scientific reliability of the study which as been carefully designed on an
intention to treat basis. The sample size is relatively large (>200) and the drop-out rate is not excessive
when allowance is made for the duration of follow-up. The end-points are well described and the authors
provide a CONSORT flow chart. However, as the analysis of the results is relatively complex, this should
be checked by a statistician. On the assumption that there are no statistical errors, the interpretation of
the results and the authorsâ€™ conclusions are fair. Importantly, the authors address the strengths and
weaknesses in their study and compare their results with earlier studies albeit these are either
retrospective or the follow-up is considerably shorter, and discuss relevant areas of future research.
The authors provide a comprehensive and up-to-date list of references and the abstract and key
messages offer a reasonable summary of the study.
All in all, this is a very good submission which I enjoyed reading. While it may only be of interest to
gynaecologists or with increasing sub-specialisation, only urogynaecologists, it is a good example of a
prospective RCT in the field of surgery, something which does not feature that often in journals such as
the BMJ.
