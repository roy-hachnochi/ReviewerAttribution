BMJ 49220- Sacrospinous hysteropexy versus vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament
suspension in women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher: 5-year follow-up of a multicentre
randomised trial
Stats Review:
The manuscript reports on the 5-year follow-up from a trial which initially was setup to determine if
sacrospinous hysteropexy (SH) was non-inferior to vaginal hysterectomy. In this manuscript the focus is
now on superiority of SH instead of non-inferiority (established in the first paper with 2 year follow-up).
The published protocol anticipated that superiority of SH could be identified and therefore this analysis is
consistent with the published protocol.
There is however an important issue with this reporting and is related to completeness of follow-up and
use of the statistical analysis based on imputed values. The imputation of LVCF could be potentially
biased depending on other factors related to the intervention. It is unclear to me (as a non-content
expert) how this incomplete follow-up would impact on the assumptions required by the different
imputation approaches used.
Instead, as the primary outcome and most of the outcomes for Table 2 are ‘events’, I would suggest the
use of a time-to-event approach, that is survival methods, even if the timing is not entirely well defined.
This will allow for estimation of hazard ratios HR, assuming proportionality of hazards, and use of data
up to the time of censoring reducing the need for imputation. Even in the case that proportional hazards
could not be used, Kaplan-Meir plots and estimates should be presented to describe the way these
events occurred (for the primary and possibly for some of the relevant secondary outcomes).
Another important issue regarding the primary outcome is that as the number of events is small, it
would be extremely useful to provide a table with the actual available data (event, when, if imputed,
why) as part of the supplementary material.
