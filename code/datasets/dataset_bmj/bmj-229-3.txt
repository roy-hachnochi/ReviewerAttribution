• Are the questions the paper addresses relevant and important to patients and/or carers?
Yes, I think so – with cancer on the increase having H Pylori treatment if testing positive,
and taking supplements is something that everyone can achieve to help reduce the risk of a
diagnosis. Getting tested for H Pylori is also something patients can do themselves to feel
empowered in taking positive steps to protect their health
• Are there topics or issues that are missing, or need to be highlighted more?
I don’t think so. It would be interesting to know the impact of replenishing the gut flora
after the antibiotics and PPI on the incidence of gastric cancer. But I know that is a different
study.
• Is the treatment or intervention suggested or guidance given something which
patients/carers can readily take up? or does it present challenges?
I think it’s easy for patients to take supplements, especially if they are provided by the trial.
• Are the outcomes described/measured in the study important to patients/carers? Are there
others that should have been considered?
I think the fact that a statically significant result was found is enough for patients/carers.
• Do you have any suggestions that might help the author(s) strengthen their paper and
make it more useful for doctors to share and discuss with patients/ carers?
No, I don’t think so.
• Do you think the level of patient/carer involvement in the study could have been
improved? If there was none do you have ideas on how they might have done so?
Yes, as none were used. It would be interesting to know the patient perspective on the
wording used to get engagement in the study and on how willing participants were. Knowing
this would help shape further, larger studies or help to educate the public on this topic so
people went to get tested for H Pylori.
