A good paper raising the challenge of how to ensure a culture in which speaking out on
patient safety is the everyday norm not the exception.
•
Agree that NHS is ‘rocked’ by series of scandals but there is also huge amount that goes well
(in millions) of healthcare interventions every year, so would suggest this is set in context. Everyday
safety matters.
•
Would suggest making stronger reference to the importance of working on cultures what
create psychological safety for staff at any level or profession to speak up.
•
Mid Staffs review published 2013 – think helpful to state dates rather than state ‘recent’ .
•
the lack of timely feedback in teams (that staff don’t give and receive feedback as the norm)
and hierarchy are a fundamental challenge to embedding the necessary supportive culture. Michael
West’s work on ‘pseudo teams’ could be worth referencing?
•
Use of the term ‘frontline’ – do you mean the staff who give direct care to patients at the
microsystem level?
•
You state ‘recursive dynamics that are strongly contextually-mediated, and significant risks
both systemic and individual’ – is it possible to use simpler language to help the wider readership?
•
‘should be to transition from bottom left to top-right in the Figure, to create a virtuous
dynamic of local learning that would obviate the need for powerful but cumbersome legal safeguards’
– do you have any practical suggestions or a case study example of what it would take to transition?
