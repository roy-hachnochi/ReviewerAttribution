This is a well-executed, well-written, succinct study/paper with a useful clinical message
for clinicians treating hypothyroid patients. It is refreshing to see TSH as an annual
time-varying covariate, although how this is achieved (other than in R) is not clear.
Perhaps a sentence on how the TSH categories are arrived at would be helpful to the
reader.
I have a few minor comments for the authors to attend to:
Limitation: other covariates were recorded at baseline however some covariates (smoking
status, BMI, lipid lowering treatment) will also vary over time as will their effect. This
needs to be acknowledged as a study limitation and acknowledge them as fixed
(non-time-dependent) covariates.
A statement about the level of missing data at which imputation was done (or not and
hence variable rejection, as a result too many results missing) should be included.
Page 9, line 13, insert ‘baseline’ to read ‘…hazards model was adjusted for the following
baseline covariates:’
There is a risk of immortal time bias on the majority of outcomes in those hypothyroid
patients where the index date is taken as one year after the patient registered with the

practice. The authors need to address this point and comment on misclassified and/or
excluded immortal time bias.
