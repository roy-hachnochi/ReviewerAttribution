In the present study, the authors carefully examined that the consumption of dairy foods in
relation to risk of total and cause-specific mortality. Taken together, the issue is very
important and the manuscript is well-written, furthermore, the three included cohorts
(NHS, NHSII, and HPFS) are of all high quality and the statistical methods are reasonable,
which have enhanced the reliability of the present research. However, there are still
several results which need to be clarified.
Major comments:
1. In Table 2 (page 18 line 16&17)
Differently adjusted results for total mortality in NHS indicate different direction of
association. The age-adjusted HR (0.99, 0.97-1.00) indicates a marginally inverse
association between higher intakes and total mortality risk. On the contrary, the
multivariate-adjusted HR (1.03, 1.02-1.05) associates the higher intakes with more total
mortality risk. I suggested that these results should be re-checked carefully, and the
underlying mechanism of discrepancy might need to be explained: what makes NHS
different from the other two cohorts? Since, this pattern was not observed in the other two
cohorts.
2. In table 3 (page 20 line 12&26, page 21 line 5)
While the HR is calculated by quintile (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5) in Table 2, the sub-group
analyses of HRs are calculated by quartile (Category 1, Category 2, Category 3 and
Category 4) in Table3. Please explain the difference.

3. The three cohorts were established in the 1970s and 1980s, and were followed until
2016. In these 40+ years, great advances were made in the treatment of CVD and cancer
(stent implantation, new regimen of chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody and so on). These
advances may neutralize the association between dairy intake and mortality risk, which is
suggested to be discussed.
4. More detailed results
The present search reported the results concerning cancer mortality. But cancer type
specific results were not shown (eg: lung cancer mortality, breast cancer mortality,
prostate cancer mortality, and so on). Since the list of risk factors varies among different
cancers. And the biological process of carcinogenesis varies as well. If it is possible,
detailed cancer type specific results would facilitate the understanding of the association
between dairy intake and mortality.
5. Other confounding factor: such as Family history
Family history and genetic background play vital roles in the incidence of disease,
especially in cancer and CVD. Taking family history into consideration might be more
beneficial.
6. Conclusion in abstract
Statistically significant positive results are very interesting and impressive, which were not
concluded in the CONCLUSION section. The conclusion is convincing but a little
conservative.
7. The importance of dairy products varies over decades
As the manuscript suggested, the effects of dairy intake may depend on the background
diet. The background diet pattern may shift along time, and I think it’s a critical factor
which might influence the conclusion dramatically.

Minor comments:
1. Spelling in page 9 line 24
AHEI or aHEI？
2. Wrong position of column names
In page 21 (the results of Cheese), column names were in the wrong position.
3. Methods for dose-response analysis missed
Methods for dose-response analysis were missed in the METHOD section.
