As mentioned in my first review, this is an extensive systematic review and meta-analysis
on the effect of omega-3, omega-6 and total dietary polyunsaturated fat for the prevention
and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This revised version has improved, the authors
addressed all my comments and suggestions as well as those from other reviewers. The
manuscript contains a large amount of trials and outcomes that by nature makes it
complicated to follow, but the authors made the revised version easier to follow. I have no
further comments for improvement.
To clarify to the authors in some of the comments I made, reference number was referring
to the study reference ID that I suggested to add. However, I agree with the authors that
they have too many references to include in the main manuscript and that they will leave
the study names instead.
