The authors have responded very positively to the reviewer comments. I just have three
very minor points of detail.
1. The abstract states that children not first born were excluded. This is not quite correct,
in that a few fathers will have had a child before the cohort started in January 1994. The
wording in the Methods makes this clear - "the birth record of the first child born within
the cohort interval was paired to the father".
2. Table 1 summarises the three groups of fathers, and in particular it shows that on
average the IVF and ICSI fathers had more years of formal education. This is of course
adjusted for in the analyses, but it might still be worth pointing out.
3. And a very tiny point - on page 10 line 183 it should be "sensitivity analyses _were_
conducted".
