I want to thank the authors for responding in detail to the comments of the editors and
reviewers. I want to comment on some remaining issues, that I believe are confusingly or
incorrectly presented.
In your response regarding my comments whether the term independent should be used as
an adjective for the shown relative risk, the authors argue that their results do not show that
having NADFLD adds to the predictive information beyond the usual risk factors. Please note

that you did not address how much NADFLD add to the prediction of your outcomes, but you
have set up a model to address the effect of NADFLD on the outcomes. I would recommend
to separate concepts of prediction and risk factor evaluation.
Please also note that when referring to excess risk you are referring to the absolute scale.
However, you present results on a relative scale.
I'm still concerned about the setup of the multivariable models. The consideration of
including covariates appears to have been dependent on the availability or the quality of
recorded information. The setup of the multivariable model should have been based on
confounding factors. Results of different multivariable models can only be compared if they
are running the same subset of individuals.
Having a large number of individuals available is not a guarantee that this sample is
representative of the target population. I also do not agree with the statement that the size
of the study can address potential biases. Moreover, the authors imply that by matching a
large sample of unexposed addressed issues on underdiagnosis. If there is a fixed frequency
of underdiagnosis in the target population, it does not matter how many serve as the
reference, the frequency will always be the same. It just could be estimated more precisely,
if such information would be available.
