Thank you for the opportunity to review this systematic review comparing various
contemporary treatment modalities to monopolar TURP for BPH. This is a comprehensive
meta-analysis with rigorous methodology. I only have minor comments:
Minor:
-There are various grammatical/syntactical errors throughout the paper, for example:
line 16: should read "the year 2000"
line 19: should read "benign prostatic hyperplasia"; should be corrected throughout the
manuscript
-I am confused by the authors use/meaning of "blood clot tamponade" throughout the
paper.
-The authors appear to lump bipolar electrocautery into the enucleation group during their
discussion. This should be avoided as bipolar TUR is not traditionally regarded as an
"enucleation" technique.
-Lastly, it would have been nice to see comparisons between the various laser techniques as
I'm not convinced that monopolar TURP remains the "gold standard" in outlet procedures.
While this comment is not directly related to the manuscript, the authors should consider
this in future studies.
