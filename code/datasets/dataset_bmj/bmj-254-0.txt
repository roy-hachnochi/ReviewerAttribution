This is a relevant clinical question in that the role for fibrates in the treatment of patients
with metabolic syndrome is an unresolved clinical question
There is also concern about possible side effects from a combining a fibrate with a statin,
particularly in relation to myopathy/myalgia. There is no information on this point. It
may not be available, but would be interesting/helpful if it was.
This revised paper is clearer than the original
I am not an expert on propensity scoring so do not know how to weigh the value of this
outcome compared to the null effect reported for randomised clinical trials particularly
FIELD.
I note that in this version of the manuscript serum creatinine was higher in the group
receiving fenofibrate whereas this did not appear to be the case in the first version of the

manuscript. I would expect an increase in creatinine in the fibrate treated patients, so
these results are more plausible.
All units should be quoted in SI units including those for the metabolic syndrome diagnosis.
