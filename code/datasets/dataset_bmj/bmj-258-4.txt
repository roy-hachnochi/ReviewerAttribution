(a). On page 4, lines 9-13. Actually in the health economics literature, “health” has long been considered
as durable capital stock, which may depreciate by age and increase by investment and eventually
produce healthy time. The HCI further assumes that healthy time can be fully translated into economic
growth. I think this can be further clarified in the analysis.
(b). On page 4, lines 59-60. In the section “Weakness of the HCI”, I feel like the second argument is
quite strong. But I am a little bit confused with the first argument brought by the authors. Paying
attention to human capital does not necessarily mean that the policy will be more likely to favor those
advantaged in terms of their current productivity level. The human capital based healthcare may actually
support more for people who can enjoy highest gain in human capital and thus highest income
increment, given the same healthcare inputs. I think the authors may need to re-consider how this issue
may lead to a concern towards equity.
(c). On page 6, lines 22. There is a typo… it should be “easier” not “easer”?
