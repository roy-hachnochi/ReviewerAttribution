This article offers a valuable analysis of the World Bank’s recently introduced (2018) Human Capital
Index (HCI), which I greatly enjoyed reading. It explains what the HCI is, its historical roots in the
neoclassical economic theories of human capital developed especially by Gary Becker and his student
Michael Grossman, and lays out some of the potential strengths and weaknesses of the Index. I think
there is great value in this kind of analysis – ie. that contextualises the often-reified numbers produced
by global health knowledge brokers, like the World Bank. However, I wonder if the article takes a more
polemical stance than is necessary. Given the relatively short length of the article, the claim that the HCI
is ‘of limited use for guiding healthcare policy overall’, for example, cannot really be substantiated. While
I am sympathetic to the authors’ claims, I think the most valuable contribution of this article is in
offering BMJ readers contextualisation of the HCI within its historical/epistemological/organisational
genealogy. I would recommend saving a more thoroughgoing critique of the HCI for a longer-form
article. This can accomplished quite simply by tempering some of the language and claims throughout
(interestingly, the conclusion to the article already strikes a more balanced tone). This is my main
concern with the article, though please also see more specific points below.
1. Introduction:
P1 Line39/40 – the description of Adam Smith’s early characterisation of human capital as ‘one that is
fixed and realised within persons’ makes it sound as though it is immutable (‘fixed’). Perhaps ‘embodied’
or ‘located’ would be a better term here?
2. The HCI
P2 Line 57-60 - in the description of the HCI’s three components, the first sentence is a bit awkward
and would benefit from rewriting.
P3 Line 37 – I found myself wondering how the different elements of the HCI were combined, exactly,
above and beyond how it is described as ‘via multiplication’. I found the answer in the supplementary
Table 1, but note that there is no in-text reference to Table 1. It would be good to place this relatively
early in this section. And in text reference to Table 2 is also needed.
3. Strengths of the HCI

P3 Line 49-60 – These sentences seem to ascribe a lot of agency to the HCI – it ‘does’ (line 50), it ‘tries’
(line 53), it ‘serves’ (line 55). The first sentence also makes some assumptions about what economists
at the Bank consider to be their job (this doesn’t appear to be based on qualitative interviews with Bank
economists, for example). Perhaps using the Bank’s mission statement/vision statement etc would be a
good way to make the same point without risking such assumptions about individuals’ views?
P4 Line 3-7 – I’m not convinced that the HCI ‘opens up new markets for lending and advice for the bank,
beyond its traditional focus on infrastructure investment’. This claim seems a bit overstated/outdated
given the Bank has been lending for health for a solid few decades now.
P4 Line 9-10 – I know that Becker/Grossman considered health a consumption good, but that hasn’t
been introduced in this article, so that sentence “Since the HCI considers health spending no longer a
consumption good…” comes as somewhat of a surprise. Is there a way to rephrase/rework this?
P4 Line 29 – it might be worth spelling out who/what the IHME rather than using the acronym.
P4 Line 29-32 – In the sentence starting “Moreover…” there is a subtle invocation of causality that I’m
not completely convinced by, i.e. that because of the conceptual origins of human capital in labour
economics, this enables the bank to make sense of the global job market. Perhaps this can be rewritten
to imply less of a causal relationship? Incidentally, the next sentence also starts with ‘Moreover’…
P4 Line 35-38 – I think that NGOs eagerness to adopt the HCI could be characterised in a way other
than ‘confusing’. This speaks to the broader point that the HCI itself can be a very powerful tool with
which to advocate for equity-enhancing health initiative that otherwise might be hard to justify in
non-economic terms. This, as I see it, is one of the strengths of the HCI – that within a broader climate
where economic logics carry so much gravitas (often to the detriment of equity arguments), harnessing
economic logics in service of equity aims is a potential strength.
4. Weaknesses of the HCI
P5 Line 19 – this sentence references a country’s ‘stock of wealth’. This is a bit of a specific term that
isn’t really defined/explained – could it be rephrased or briefly defined?
As a final point, there is a slightly unusual/awkward use of the word subsumed throughout the article. To
the best of my grammatical knowledge, things can be subsumed within and subsumed under, but can’t
be subsumed to. I would recommend looking into this before submitting the final version of this article.
On the whole, I think this is a really valuable explanation and contextualisation of the HCI that will be of
great use to the readership of BMJ.
