The paper addresses an important topic around the use of evidence through Health
Technology Assessments to inform how governments prioritise the funding of health care
interventions. In a sense, its present a next major step in the development of HTA method
through an approach known as SEED – which incorporates locally specific cost
effectiveness evidence as well as ‘second order issues’ such as political acceptability - into
a decision making framework.
Two general comments:
The paper does not provide enough detail about the SEED approach. It seems to me that
this is the main point of the paper but the description of SEED disappointingly ends before
it really begins. I suggest significantly shortening the first part of the paper which
essentially makes the argument that decision makers need to take into account local
context rather than rely exclusively on international evidence. This seems to be a generic
point that doesn’t need much effort to prosecute and could probably be done in a couple

of paragraphs. What I would be more interested in is: How would SEED work in practice?
How much buy-in has there been for the SEED approach? Is there already some evidence
of its use? How would we evaluate improved decision making through SEED relative to
non-SEED approaches such as ‘WHO Best Buy’?
The other general point relates back to first principles - is SEED an approach that is
consistent with the normative role which ideally is played by HTA? The value of a HTA
approach based on ‘Best Buys’ is that it gives decision makers an evidence-based
argument for funding A over B, in the face of potentially competing political arguments. In
this respect, it is a tool for generating political commitment. On the other hand, the SEED
approach, by including prevailing levels of political commitment in its algorithm, seeks to
reflects the status quo. This shift would seem to result in a dilution of its normative value.
Another way of expressing this is that HTA through a simple Best Buys approach can be
seen as an antidote to the ‘rule of the mob’. It gives us a clear message as to where to
invest based on the best possible evidence, irrespective of other pressures. By replacing
Best Buys with SEED - an approach that includes ‘politics’ into its algorithm – aren’t we
therefore allowing the mob back in through the front door? Although I do see value in the
SEED approach, and it seems that there is already some impetus around the world for it,
it would be good if the authors could take a step back to address this question.
Specific comments:
Page 5 or 17, line 8: I’m not sure this example really illustrates the point that we cannot
use international evidence to inform local policy. To me the example simply represents
bad policy design irrespective of whether it was informed by international or local
evidence.
Page 6 or 17 line 48-49 – This sentence is hard to follow.
