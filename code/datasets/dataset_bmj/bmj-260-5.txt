Thank you for asking me to review this interesting paper. The study is exemplary in so far
as it shows that health policies can be evaluated using robust methodology. This is a
national study, with 60 clusters, recruiting several thousand women. The authors have
demonstrated that health policy interventions can be evaluated using randomized
methodology and this is in itself an important message for the BMJ readership. For these
reasons, I feel it should be accepted. There are however some important revisions that are
necessary.
Interpretation of findings
The authors demonstrate that the effect of the intervention on the outcome was OR=0.92
95% CI 0.7 to 1.22. Their conclusion is that 3rd trimester ultrasound should not be
rolled-out. Unfortunately, the correct interpretation of this finding is that the study is
inconclusive: the intervention might reduce AEs by up to 30% or it might increase AEs by
up to 22%. Both of these would very likely be clinically important. Whilst these values are
at the limits of the Cis, other values not near the limits (say 0.8) are well supported by
this CI and so the study does not rule out that the impact might be as much as a 20%
reduction.

The abstract results and conclusions place much emphasis on detection of SGA, but there
is no mention in the methods of the abstract, nor background that this is an outcome.
Similarly, there is little mention of this part of the study in key parts of the paper.
Reporting
Can the authors please ensure that they report according to the CONSORT extension for
SW trials. Some example items that are insufficiently reported according to this reporting
guideline are sample size (no reference to methodology is provided), flow diagram.
Statistical analysis section is not sufficiently complete to allow replication.
Identification and recruitment biases
The characteristics of participants look well balanced across arms. This is a welcome
surprise. In cluster trials with recruitment post randomsation this does often not happen.
The authors have opted to put P-values in the baseline tables. I would suggest to remove
as mostly the consensus is that these should not be included. However, related to this is
the issue of blinding at different stages of the trial, and this is insufficiently reported. For
example, at the time of identification and recruitment of participants, were the participants
aware of the allocation (and if not, what steps were taken to mask this). See the timeline
diagram for cluster trials published in the BMJ in 2016 for more information.
Time adjustment
I could not clearly identify what factors had been adjusted for. The authors have opted to
use statistical selection for adjustment for confounders. This is fine in itself. However, the
SW design is confounded with time and so time (categorical effect for period or non-linear
effect) should be adjusted for, irrespective of its statistical significance. The authors should
also reflect on the assumptions inherent here, in that the underlying secular trends are
assumed the same across all clusters. Can the authors please also report an unadjusted
effect for completeness. Can you please report what factors have been adjusted for.
Within cluster correlations
The statistical analysis section suggests that random cluster effects were included only if
statistically significant, again this would be inappropriate. My guess is that an
exchangeable correlation structure has been included. However, correlation structures are
more complicated in longitudinal studies and this is likely a simplification of the underlying
correlation. Mis specification of the correlation structure inflates type 1 errors (leads to
P-values which are smaller than they really are).
