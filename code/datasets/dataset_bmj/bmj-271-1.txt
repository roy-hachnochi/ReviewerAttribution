This is a very well put together article which makes some sensible suggestions for
reforming the PEF. My major comment relates to whether the authors should have taken
the argument further by questioning its existence. The corollary of liberalizing the criteria
for accessing the PEF is presumably that the interest rates on the bonds issued by the PEF
would need to rise. Although not mentioned by the authors these are already very high
(6.5% over LIBOR for flu and 11.1% for other diseases according to the FT article cited).
So the question is whether this price is worth paying as compared to the direct and more
flexible funding offered by the CFE and CERF. Otherwise there are various typographical
and grammatical issues that require a good edit eg "mundane limitations".
