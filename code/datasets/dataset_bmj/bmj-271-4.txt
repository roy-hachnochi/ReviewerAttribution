This is a well written analysis article that I think should be published. I have a few
relatively minor points for consideration:
1. Tables 1 & 2 – It would be helpful to include the total value of payouts from CFE and
CERF in this table (i.e. derived from tables in the appendix), to help highlight what the
potential contribution of PEF might have been. I would also suggest combining these
tables with a sub-heading for flu / non-flu as the extra table with one row seems
unnecessary.
2. There are only 2 outbreaks in Table 1 that were anywhere near meeting the criteria –
i.e. one that did not meet the cross-border criteria (i.e. ongoing Ebola in DRC) and one
that did not meet the total number of cases / deaths (Lassa virus 2015-16). Do the
authors think that both should have received funding? Do they have any comments on
what methodology could be used to assess optimal trigger points for releasing funds?
3. It is useful to have number of confirmed cases and deaths in Table 1 – could figures
also be added for the number of countries affected and the number of deaths in each of
the countries (i.e. to see how far off the outbreaks were from meeting the second two
criteria)? This could be an appendix if table becomes too busy.
4. How many deaths had been reached by the time DRC requested financial assistance
through the cash window?
5. How exactly would we work out what the predetermined radiuses should be – and how
could we mitigate against a repetition of ‘arbitrary criteria’ already implemented?
6. Would any of the cholera outbreaks funded by CFE have met the other PEF criteria?
7. It would be helpful to briefly comment on what is being planned for PEF 2.0.
8. Preparedness measures are mentioned in the appendix but not explained in the text –
please clarify
9. Have there been any applications to PEF that have been rejected? If so how far away
from meeting the criteria were these applications?
