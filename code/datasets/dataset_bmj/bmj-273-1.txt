This is an interesting network analysis of various management strategies for uninvestigated
dyspepsia. This is an important problem and as stated in the article there is still some
uncertainty around the best first line strategy to adopt for dyspepsia patients. I think this
is an important paper that is suitable for publication in BMJ. I have some additional
comments.
1. This is a high quality systematic review and network meta-analysis as wold be expected
from this group.
2. The inclusion criteria seem reasonable but this subject is not as straightforward as it
seems. The authors have excluded the CADET-HP study (Chiba et al. BMJ 2002; 324;
1012). This randomized H. pylori positive primary care dyspepsia patients to eradication
therapy or placebo (and therefore the placebo group would have symptomatic
management) and evaluated dyspepsia at 12 months. They could justify exclusion as this
is a select group of patients (all H. pylori positive) but this is not currently in their exclusion
criteria (and they have included other trials with select groups) and strictly following their
current inclusion criteria I feel this study is eligible. Furthermore it will be the only trial
that is double blind (so could be methodologically more rigorous). The results of this
network meta-analysis are still uncertain and additional data may clarify the most
appropriate strategy.
3. The study does not include all relevant outcomes. They evaluate dissatisfaction with
management (I feel “satisfaction” with management is a more positive way of saying this!)
but do not evaluate quality of life. They also do not evaluate health care costs. I
understand why they did not do the latter as prices vary from country to country as do

health care behaviours. Nevertheless they could evaluate the key units of health care
costs over and above endoscopy. They should also assess PPI use in all groups (and H2RA
is given), GP visits, specialist visits as well as endoscopy.
4. The paper states that two trials included only H. pylori positive patients (page 14 line
35) and quote reference 19 and 38 – reference 19 is an individual patient meta-analysis so
I think there is a mistake in the referencing. They may be using reference 19 to quote the
unpublished study but it would be better to quote the PhD.
5. I may have missed it but is heterogeneity between studies for direct comparisons
stated? If not, they should give I squared values for the direct comparisons.
6. It would be visually helpful to summarize the comparisons using surface under the
cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) (Salanti G, Ades A, Ioannidis JP. Graphical methods
and numerical summaries for presenting results from multiple-treatment meta-analysis: an
overview and tutorial. J Clin Epidemiol. 2011;64:163–71).
7. The authors could consider using GRADE assessments for their NMA
8. The discussion should also point out that none of these trials were blinded (and could
not be) so a subjective outcome like satisfaction with management could relate to prior
expectations of management (e.g. a good doctor will perform an endoscopy to evaluate my
symptoms) and dissatisfaction simply relates to preconceived expectations not being met.
As far as I am aware none of the trials evaluated patient expectations before
randomization.
