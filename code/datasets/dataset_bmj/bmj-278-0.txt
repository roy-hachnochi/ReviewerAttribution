The revision is superb and the response to my comments very clear. I thank the
authors for this. I only have two further minor comments. Best wishes, Richard
Riley
- Harrel’s E statistic should be Harrell’s E statistic I assume? Also, can the
authors very briefly explain to the reader what the E statistic is, as I actually had
never heard of it.
- I-squared is a poor measure of heterogeneity; rather report the estimated
between-study standard deviation (SD), tau, should be reported.
