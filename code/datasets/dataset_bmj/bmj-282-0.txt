This paper examines total soy products as well as sub-groups including fermented soy
products and natto and the relationship with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The
authors find an inverse association between intake of fermented soy products and all-cause
mortality and an inverse association between intake of natto and cardiovascular mortality.
The question about whether soy products are beneficial is of general interest, and
importantly only cohorts studies conducted in Japanese or other populations who consume
a decent amount of soy can really look at the associations between soy intake and health
outcomes. There have been a few other studies from Japan on soy products. These
previous studies are all mentioned in the current paper, and include the study by Nagata et
al. (Am J Clin Nutr 2017) which similarly found an inverse association between natto
consumption and mortality from cardiovascular disease (and stroke), but I don't think
looked at all fermented soy products as a group. This was the only other cohort study I
found that specifically looked at natto, and the other studies (e.g. Yamasaki et al. 2015
and Kokubo et al, 2007) did not look at fermented soy or natto. So I think the novelty of
the current study is in separating out fermented soy products and also looking at natto
separately, as more data on this particular product is needed.
I have a couple of comments about the presentation of the results:
1. Firstly, Table 1 shows participant characteristics in quintiles of total soy product intake. I
think this should stay, but I would also like to see in the supplementary tables, a similar
table but for natto and/or fermented soy products. It seems from this study that
natto/fermented soy products are particularly beneficial, but an alternative explanation is
that the relationship between these sub-types of soy products and mortality is more
affected by residual confounding, so it would be helpful to see participant characteristics by
natto and/or fermented soy products.
2. There is also a bit of repetition in what is presented in Table 4 (the associations between
fermented soy and natto and deaths from specific causes) and Supplementary Tables 1
and 2 which present associations between intake of each of the soy sub-types (including
natto and fermented soy) and cause-specific deaths. You could take natto and fermented
soy out of supplementary Tables 1 and 2, but actually I prefer removing Table 4, and
shifting Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 into the main body of the paper. This is because
there are some other associations in these tables that don't get mentioned in the text, i.e.
the inverse association between soy isoflavone, and soy fibre and heart disease in men.
Other specific comments:
3. Introduction, line 67. The sentence beginning 'One reason for the increasing rates of
such diseases' needs clarification because rates of heart disease have been declining for
many decades in many Western countries. Which countries are you referring to here?

4. Introduction, line 91. Instead of using the word 'benefits' I suggest re-phrasing to use a
more neutral phrase, about more definitive data about the association (because I don't
think that is total consensus about soy consumption and health to say that soy is
definitively beneficial).
5. Methods, line 201. I'm not sure what is meant by the phrase 'vulnerable opinions'.
6. Results, lines 229-232, are these sensitivity analyses shown in the tables?
7. Discussion, line 249, there seems to be a '44' accidently inserted here.
8. Discussion, line 278. Instead of saying negative findings, I suggest changing to 'null'
findings, to avoid confusion (as negative may mean inverse association to some). also on
line 280, I suggest inserting 'may', as in 'The bioactive components of soy products may
modulate their...'
9. Discussion, line 287. I think you need to re-phrase this to make it clear that after the
comma you are meaning that fermented soy products are also rich in other bioactive
components.
