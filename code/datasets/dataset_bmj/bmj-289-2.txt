This is a very necessary and important contribution. It should be the basis of a critical debate. I do
like the graph on page 4 and on page 13. I am not totally convinced of how all the arguments are put
forward - some of the links are (especially the workforce section) less convincing than others. I don't
think we need to link everything to everything. I think some tweeks could be helpful for the impact of
the paper - I suggest to differentiate more clearly in the text the climate determinants that need to a
addressed, the changes in the burden and pattern of disease the consequences for planning and
delivering UHC. For each of these there are different lead actors and I would want to see a bit more
on both the policy and political dimensions in the conclusions (and the paper itself?). For example one
of the most interesting and important actions is kind of hidden away in the graph on page 13:
Inclusion of health and health care system costs into cost- analyses of climate action, such as within
carbon pricing. Creative solutions such as financing UHC from the elimination of fossil fuel
subsidies27 and carbon pricing. Two major issues impinge on both UHC and climate action: political
will and fiscal space. IN both developed and developing countries. In some countries this is not just
about investment but divestment (from coal for example). Can the authors say a bit more here or at
least indicate how this debate should be conducted? Do we need to reach out the environmental
movements? Greta? Is the climate issue so large that UHC will get buried? I hope for a little it on that
from the authors. The authors need to say more about the ONEHEALTH approach - but otherwise
great article!
