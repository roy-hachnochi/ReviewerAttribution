This is a well-written article addressing an important public health issue in the context of climate
change. The authors have made very well arguments about the impacts of climate change on UHC,
with suggested solutions. To help the authors to make the case stronger, I have put my below
suggestions for their consideration:
1. Page 4, Figure 1--I was wondering whether the Extreme weather should also include the extreme
precipitation in the Figure?
2. Page 5: Paragraph 1--do you want to mention mental health as well? Also could authors include
"morbidity" such as ED visits, ambulance call-outs and hospital admissions as health indicators, in
addition to "mortality"? There have been many studies in the different parts of the world now.
3. Also on page 5, in Infectious disease section, you may want to include several specific enteric
infections study results to support your argument. For example, the impact of climate variability on
salmonella infections (Millazo et al 2017), hand, foot and mouth disease (Wei et al 2014). Also in this
section, you may also want to include the impacts on work-related injuries and illnesses --there have
been increasing literatures in the past 3-5 years (Xiang et al, 2013, 2014, Varghese et al, 2018,
2019).
4. Also page 5, the authors mentioned disease burden relevant to climate change--there have been
publications directly quantifying hospital monetary costs due to climate variability which authors might
want to include (Wondmagegn et al, 2018).
5. Page 9: Healthcare workforce section: I was wondering whether the authors could talk this in
details--there have been increasing literatures in this area in recent years, studied the perception,

knowledge and capacity of climate change and health adaptation from primary healthcare workers,
CDC staff and clinicians, the barriers and enablers -- I think these results are important to make the
argument stronger.
6. Page 13: Table 1: I was wondering healthcare workforce could be included in the health system
resilience and community health education and engagement could be included in the climate change
adaptation section?
