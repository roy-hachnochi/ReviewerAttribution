The amended paper has included further discussion about the decision to use an MCID of 4,
and included statements that clearly highlight this trial aimed to replicate the findings from
the previous RCT (Albert et al). This has improved the message in part.
I would like to see the clear statements they include in some parts of the paper also in the
results and conclusions of the abstract and the final sentences of the discussion/conclusion.
These are: 'we set out to see if we could replicate the findings of the former RCT', 'we
assessed the potential curative effect of antibiotic treatment' and 'we were not able to
replicate the findings of the previous RCT'. Currently the abstract and final words in the
discussion say 'did not provide a clinically important benefit' and 'our results do not support
the use of antibiotic treatment for chronic LBP and MCs'. The problem with these statements
is that the definition of what is clinically important in terms of between group difference on
the RMDQ in a RCT is contentious and there are good arguments that can be made that
would mean the conclusion of the trial could also be 'we showed a between group difference
in line with other recommended non-surgical treatments for chronic LBP and thus this
intervention is a reasonable treatment option for chronic LBP alongside other interventions
shown to have small to moderate treatment effects'. Therefore I believe it will be a clearer
message if the clear aim of this trial is articulated as the attempt to replicate the findings of
the previous RCT that suggested antibiotics might offer a 'cure' for chronic LBP with a large
effect size compared to placebo, and that the abstract and discussion conclusions clearly say
the same clear message - that they were unable to replicate the findings of the previous
trial, that antibiotics in this current trial did not lead to large benefits over placebo, and that
the results do not support the use of antibiotics as a 'cure' for chronic LBP. If these
messages are consistent throughout then I believe the results and conclusions will be more
acceptable to the international LBP clinical and research community, and patients.
I missed a point-by-point response to the reviewers' comments - was that not submitted
with the revised manuscript?
