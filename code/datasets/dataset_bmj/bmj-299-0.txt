This manuscript has a fatal flaw which must be addressed before considering it further.
Stunting, wasting and underweight are statistically defined and fundamentally related.
Stunting = length < -2 SD below reference population, underweight = weight < -2 SD
below reference population, wasting = weight for length < -2 SD below reference
population Underweight will include the vast majority of children that are stunted, unless
the stunted children are older and actually overweight (children > 5yrs are not in these
surveys). Discordance between stunting and underweight has not been my experience
having lived in sub-Saharan Africa for explicit purpose of treating such children for 35
years. Nor is this consistent with published data looking for the double burden of
malnutrition in the same individual. And underweight will include the vast majority
children who are wasted, unless those are taller children who are very thin, which is again
very unlikely. So in general among the population prevalence of underweight > stunting >
wasting. So to say that stunting is 41% and underweight is 23% means to me there is
some flaw in the calculation of z-scores or in the measurements themselves. The authors
should recalculate z-scores if they have individual data or exclude surveys that have this
anomaly. If this seems to a finding among most of the surveys I question the validity of
the dataset to explore the proposed hypothesis.
Second, having experience with Feed the Future work, this is often focused in regions or
areas of the selected countries, in Ghana for example it is only northern Ghana. Can the
authors parse the data into areas that were engaged with Feed the Future and those that
were not?
