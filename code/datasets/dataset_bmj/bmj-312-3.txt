<i>Relevant for patients:</i>
Yes, highly.
<i>Areas of relevance that are missed:</i>
Given what the authors have written and changed the only thing missing is the part in the
first article on the surveys on the opinion from patient groups about receiving industry
funding. If it is still good data, I might be good to include it again, as it shows the
discussions and ideas on industry funding. The articles quoted in the this section are no
longer included in the reference list. I’m OK with it if the authors can give a clear reason for
this, but if not I would like it to be re-included. It is an indication about the internal (patient
organisations) discussions on the subject of industry funding.
<i>Methods used:</i>
I don’t know enough of the statistics to judge if the changes made fit the questions asked in
the first round of comments.
<i>What can be improved:</i>
Compared to the previous version of the article, this one is clearer in its statements based
on what can be found in the studies and does not add conclusions that can’t be made (like
the implication of bias by the patients organisation because of industry funding). The
inclusion of the advice that this type of study would be needed is helpful.
<i>What is missing:</i>

• <i>Are the questions the paper addresses relevant and important to patients and/or
carers?</i>
Yes. Industry funding is an important issue that needs more research on the impact. Having
the meta-analysis done in this study is already very helpful.

• <i>Are there topics or issues that are missing, or need to be highlighted more?</i>
Just the part on the <i>surveys about the opinion on industry funding between patient
organisations</i> that was in the previous version of article. (p 17/100 previous version of
the article.)
• <i>Is the treatment or intervention suggested or guidance given something which
patients/carers can readily take up? or does it present challenges?</i>
Yes patients and patient organisations need to think about industry funding and the effect it
has on their organisation and the freedom of expressing their opinions. As a patient involved
in a patient organisation you need to think about the effects and consequences it has.
• <i>Are the outcomes described/measured in the study important to patients/carers? </i>
Yes. For this article these are the right outcomes to highlight and report upon.

•<i> Do you have any suggestions that might help the author(s) strengthen their
paper?</i>
I think the new version of the article is sufficient improvement.
Two small remarks for improvement:
(1) In the CONCLUSIONS (p4 L55-56) and in WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS (P4 l82-83) the
authors write that “industry funding of patient groups is common in many higher income
countries and disease areas”. This sentence is unclear. What disease areas do you mean?
How many patients groups are there in middle and low income countries? What exactly are
you saying? Later in the article the authors write that with the exception of South Africa all
studies were conducted in high-income countries. Please amend the sentence in the article.
(2) Why has the part on the studies on survey data on the opinion of patients groups about
industry funding been left out in the new article? It is an important section on the discussion
about industry funding.
• <i>Do you think the level of patient/carer involvement in the study could have been
improved? </i>
Yes it could have been improved, but they have improved some of it between the first and
second version of the paper.
The authors have stated the of two of the authors engagement in women’s health,
consumers and community involved.
A representative of a patient groups commented on the findings.
The dissemination of the findings to patient groups through publicly accessible conferences,
workshops and the media has been added. Which is positive. It would be good to do this
both in the US and in Europe.
