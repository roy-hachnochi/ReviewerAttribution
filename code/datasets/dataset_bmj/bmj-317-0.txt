This study observed and summarized the changes in post-discharge care utilization and
patients mortality rates over the years of 2008 - 2016, which included years both before
and after ACA was enacted in 2010 and HRRP was initiated in 2012. This study examined
the consequences of HRRP, aiming to address the concerns of this policy negatively
affected patient care by triaging patients into other types of care or no care when
hospitalization was necessary, therefore this study yields very high policy significance.
Generally, the study delivered good news that HRRP didn't result in higher utilization of
observational unit and emergency department, at the same time didn't seem to result in an
increase of mortality rate overall (except for heart failure patients). It was delightful to see
that from this perspective, HRRP has been beneficial (or do no harm) to Medicare

population, improving care access and health outcomes. The huge efforts in developing the
study ideas and generating this information were greatly appreciated.
However, there are some questions need to be justified and a few clarifications need to be
made before it is presented to the BMJ readers.
Post-discharge care locations: were they collected from hospital-reported files (MedPAR) or
were they captured from the claims from all the post-discharge locations and physician
outpatient claims? MedPAR data is not accurate on reporting the post-discharge locations.
How did you define the discharge dispositions for patients with multiple discharge
locations? Did you use the first locations or did you use the locations with the longest
duration? For example, some patients could be discharged to home with home health care
because they had to wait for the SNF beds, and probably after 1 week, they were admitted
to SNF. In this case, did you define the post-discharge location as Home Health Agency or
SNF?
Another point needs to be discussed is the potential bias due to the differences in patient
groups. These are important factors associated with health care utilization and health
outcomes, and therefore need to be controlled while examining the utilization and mortality
rates. Table 1-3 of this study suggested that there could be an imbalance between different
groups regarding age, gender and disease comorbidities. For example, patients alive at
30-days of discharge were much younger than who died. HRRP controlled for age, gender,
and case-mix severities when calculating risk-adjusted readmission predictions (76 FR
51673 through 51675), with the consideration that these factors were associated with high
readmission rate and worse health outcomes. Therefore, theoretically patient with different
level of risk factors were affected by the policy differently. The effect could be more
significant with these factors adjusted. Also, the unobserved variables for each facility and
patient both time-variant and time-invariant need to be controlled as well, so as to
separate the true effect of HRRP. Intuitively, the large sample size and the nation-wide
data pool seemed to be promising for fix-effect panel analysis, clustering, or classic
regression models. It will be helpful to know why this study was limited the analysis at a
descriptive level (any concerns/limitations)?
The trend for no care group ("no readmission/observation/ED") is important and should be
reported as well. Overall, if the care utilization decreased for readmission, observation stay
or ED visits (figure 1), then there should be an increase in the number of patients who
didn't receive any care. Given the mortality rate increased for heart failure patients, this
could imply that these patients were driven away from any of the hospital/observation
unit/ED when they needed care. This will eventually lead to worse health outcomes and
definitely be an unintended consequence of HRRP.
Some confusing parts in Table 1-3: "numbers reflect the proportion of patients alive
discharge", is this statement applied to the rows of "Male sex" and beyond? the numbers
starting from "Health conditions" are proportions of patients with the corresponding
events? This table is reporting the proportion of death for each type of post-acute care
patients dead at 30-day, while characteristics of study sample need to be reported as well
(i.e. what is the characteristics of the study sample for readmission, Obs. stay, ED or no
care groups?).
Overall, with the above questions addressed and clarified, I think this study is of great
significance and will benefit the BMJ readers.
