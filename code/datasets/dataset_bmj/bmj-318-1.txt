This is a well-conducted study and the manuscript is clearly written.
The necessity for Data Monitoring committees is exemplified here, with the trial stopping
with only a third of planned recruitment achieved, due to more perinatal deaths in the
expectant arm.
This is also a good exemplar of the 'vagaries' of composite outcomes, particularly when
specified as the primary outcome. The SWEPIS had multiple outcomes of varying and
competing 'importance'. Consequently it is not surprising that the overall finding was a null
result.
The finding that all 6 perinatal deaths were in nulliparous women and were in other centres
besides the main centre perhaps deserves some more attention in the manuscript. This may

help better understanding of which women are at greater risk and which care practices may
be contributing either positively or negatively.
Pregnant women were not involved in the design of the study which is a limitation. Timing of
birth is an issue where shared and informed decision-making is vital, yet we are struggling
to find ways to do this. I note that a manuscript of women's views is planned.
This study makes an important contribution to knowledge about managing post-term birth.
