I think this is a robust article worthy of publication. It addresses an important issue - the
potential burden of polypharmacy in an increasingly large cohort of people, it demonstrates
the potential usefulness of a decision framework to assist GPs in discussions re ongoing use
of medications. As far as my non-statistician knowledge can take me, the methodology
looks sound, with computerised block randomisation and masked statisticians and
heterogeneity between groups being considered. A power calculation is clearly described
and potential harms are taken into account as one of the major end-points.
