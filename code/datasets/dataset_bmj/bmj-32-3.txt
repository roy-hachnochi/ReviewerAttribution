This is an important paper addressing a topical of considerable relevance to health services
around the world: that of polypharmacy and whether interventions can reduce
inappropriate polypharmacy and improve outcomes for patients.
While it is possible to criticise any paper, this is one of the strongest that I have read in
this field. The authors are to be congratulated on successfully conducting a very large and
complex study in four European countries; reaching their predetermined sample size and
achieving very good follow-up up to 2 years post-intervention.
As documented in my recent BMJ editorial on deprescribing,
https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l570, previous large-scale studies have failed to
show major impact on patient outcomes, even though there have been modest reductions
in numbers of medications prescribed. The results of the current study are similar based on
the intention to treat analysis. Nevertheless, the per protocol analysis did show a clinically
important (18%) reduction in death or non-elective hospital admission. While the
methodological purist might dismiss these findings, they are important because they
suggest that impact on patient outcomes is possible from an electronic decision support
tool (albeit requiring a very large study to demonstrate this).
I have been asked by the BMJ to comment on specific aspects of the methods and so I
have done this here:
1) Primary and secondary outcomes are clearly explained
2) How the sample size was determined is clear
3) Computerised block randomisation was used to generate the random allocation
sequence and this was done after collecting baseline data
4) Allocation concealment is not applicable as sites were either in the intervention group or
TAU group
5) It was not possible to mask practitioners or patients, but outcome assessors were
masked
6) The estimated effect size and 95% CIs are presented for the primary outcome measure
7) Harms are presented (as these form the primary outcome measure)
8) The registry and registration number of the trial is reported
9) The trial protocol has been published in an open access journal
10) The funding source is reported and this independence of the research team from the
funder is stated

Here are some further comments:
1) In a pragmatic 'real world' study like this it is possible that there could have been bias in
the collection of data after the baseline, although have no reason to suspect the risk to be
higher than any other similar study
2) The was some loss to follow up, but in my view this was remarkably low for such a large
study and the authors have used appropriate techniques (imputation) for addressing this
3) The authors did not correct for multiple testing of secondary outcomes. I do not have a
problem with this
4) I am not a statistician, but I was impressed with the rigour of the statistical design and
analysis
5) There was no PPI input to the study, which is disappointing, and a little surprising
6) The groups were well matched at baseline
7) The introduction and discussion did not take adequate account of the literature on
interventions aimed at tackling polypharmacy/deprescribing, and the discussion could do
with a more detailed section comparing and contrasting the findings with other literature
8) I think the discussion could do with more on the implications of the findings (for
researchers, clinicians, patients and policy makers) along with suggestions for further
research
9) I did not find that the screenshot of the 'comprehensive medication review' helped me to
understand how this worked to provide useful advice to clinicians. Perhaps provide an
annotated version?
10) For the supplementary tables a lot of abbreviations are used and I think these need to
be explained (in footnotes) or spelt out
11) Table 8: why is there such a big difference in '% of patients affected' comparing TAU
group T0 and TAU group T3 (and the equivalent for the CMR group)?
