A good piece of work.
I would like more description of the intervention and how it was used in practice. Did the
GP run the decision support system during a consultation, or before the consultation? Did
the GP use it every time the patient comes in for repeat medications, or were these extra
consultations for the study?
I see that the GP or staff member collected patient data including 'current symptoms' at
baseline. Was a questionnaire used to collect these data, or was it a question "any
symptoms today"? Did symptoms include questions about adverse drug effects? Were any
follow-up data on such symptoms collected?
Other minor suggestions are that I am not sure about the term "older polypharmacy
patients". I think generally we talk about "older people" and then those on multiple
medicines for multiple chronic conditions, or with polypharmacy.
Citations need to be checked for compliance with rules.
Define BMI when first used. Using a z or an s?
There is no mention of inappropriate use of long-term antidepressants being identified by
the tool. Perhaps this was not an issue in participants, but it may be worth a comment as
long-term use of antidepressants against clinical guidelines (for longer period of time than
indicated) is otherwise an issue.
A final comment - I wonder about some consistency in phrasing. Authors currently using
"enhancing drug-related patient safety", "without compromising drug-related safety",
"without increasing harm to patients". All have slightly different meanings.
