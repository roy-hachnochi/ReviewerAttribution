This manuscript, “When and how should the public be informed? . . .”, does a good job of detailing the
variability in when and how regulatory agencies informed the public about safety problems with the
SGLT2 inhibitors. I believe that this topic, regulatory agencies handling of safety problems with
drugs, is an important one and one that has been neglected.
I have no major issues with the manuscript but do have some suggestions:

The manuscript doesn’t answer the opening question except in very general terms in the conclusion.
It focuses on variability in regulatory agency responses. Perhaps the question doesn’t belong in the
title.
Figure 1 is the key item for addressing the question of when regulatory agencies have acted. I find it
a little difficult to appreciate at first glance. Some specific comments regarding it:
• In the legend EMA is above AU and TGA is above EU. Should be reversed.
• The timing appears to be from the time of first advisory. Perhaps the title should state this, e.g.,
“Timing of safety advisories and related events relative to date of first advisory”.
• The gray bars surrounding the safety problem titles are varying lengths. Do the lengths have
significance? It is not obvious and, if they are significant, should be described in a footnote.
• There appears to be no “data received” for diabetic ketoacidosis.
The “data received” data are ones that need better explanation. How were they determined? Please
provide a definition. If the definition is the date industry submitted something to a regulatory agency,
then the date may be long after when the problem was first detected.
My own experience, predominantly with the FDA, is that transparency is unacceptable for safety
advisories. I believe the manuscript is correct in observing that transparency in safety advisories is
poor for the FDA. While the FDA does a decent job in transparency for new approvals and for advisory
committees, its safety advisories simply state the problem and provide a brief summary of how they
investigated the problem and their conclusions. They do not provide adequate detail for a researcher
to understand whether their investigations justify their conclusions and for patients to understand the
risks. I can easily provide two cogent examples:
• An FDA safety communication cleared angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) of causing cancer
based on an internal FDA meta-analysis.1 The communication summarizes the results of the
meta-analysis briefly, as it usually does for safety communications. Why couldn’t the FDA provide the
entire meta-analysis? In this case, the meta-analysis was fatally flawed: It only counted cancers
coded as “malignant lung neoplasms” as lung cancers but failed to count cancers coded as “lung
carcinoma”. This flaw was revealed in an FDA review of a new drug (and the review includes a more
sophisticated meta-analysis implicating the ARBs and lung cancer.)2 The safety communication has
never been corrected—8 years later.
• A hot topic this year in drug safety has been the carcinogen contaminants in many ARBs. Both
the FDA and the EMA have issued safety communications minimizing the risk of these contaminants.
The FDA communications state the following: “FDA estimated that if 8,000 people took the highest
valsartan dose (320 mg) containing NDMA from the recalled batches daily for four years, there may
be one additional case of cancer over the lifetimes of the 8,000 people.”3–5 Because this estimate is
the most important datum for considering ARB use, how was it determined? No details are provided.
The EMA provides similar estimates of risks but also provides more details on how the risks were
determined.6–8 Whether the EMA’s risk estimates are adequate is debatable. Neither agency
provides patients with understandable estimates of risks reflecting the uncertainties.
A future paper? This one merits publication after the minor issues are addressed.
