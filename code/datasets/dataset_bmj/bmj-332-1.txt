This is a valuable contribution to the BMJ's special issue from an experienced group
of researchers. They contribute valuable insights into the ongoing challenges faced
both in health research and health service provision if we are to meaningfully
contribute to reducing the inequity in health outcomes and health experiences of
individuals from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic and migrant communities in the
UK.
I have made some brief comments/ suggestions:
Page 2
Line 54 I am concerned by the phrase "shared biological features" - whilst what is
meant by this statement may be shared physical features, I think that it plays into
the idea that there is a genetic basis for race however as the authors subsequently
point out these characteristics are not fixed or natural. I wonder therefore whether
Raj Bhopal's definition might be better employed here:
Ethnicity is described as ""the social group a person belongs to, and either identifies
with or is identified with by others, as a result of a mix of cultural and other factors
including language, diet, religion, ancestry and physical features traditionally
associated with race".

Line 47 Is there evidence that people of colour are increasingly experiencing this in
the UK? I know there is anecdotal evidence but couldn't find anything published on a
brief search of hate crime stats/ published literature. If there is evidence, is this
worth citing?

Line 9-10 I am not wishing to downplay the current levels of hostility against
migrants and people of colour but is it true to say things have become increasingly
hostile in general over (all) time or perhaps 'in recent years'.
Line 22-24 Can this sentence make it clearer that there is a significant body of
evidence demonstrating the social and political factors that shape.... 'it is clear' may
be perceived as a value statement and I think it is important to underscore that this
assertion is grounded in a significant body of evidence across the social, political
and epidemiological literature. Comparatively, as the authors point out, the
evidence for the impact of genetics is minimal and limited to genetic strains
associated with geography/ survival benefit e.g. sickle cell trait or cultural practices
e.g. Tay Sachs.
May also be worth pointing out that with increasing globalisation these genetic
reflections/ productions of experience related to ethnicity are likely to change?

Page 6 Line 48 While such data would undoubtedly be useful, prior to considering
how to incorporate it into routine health records it is vital that we protect the
information from being used for purposes which might be harmful to the health of
individuals and populations. For example, demographic information, including
names and addresses, continue to be passed to the home office by the NHS without
consent in order to aid immigration control. This is despite significant concerns
raised by the Health Select committee. Is it worth drawing attention to these
concerns?

Box 1 Is it worth adding an unequivocal statement here about there being no
evidence to support a genetic/ biological basis for race?
