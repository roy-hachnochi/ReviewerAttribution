Overall this is a good, well-written and well-argued article. The authors have been
boldly critical and have backed up their arguments with evidence. I found the
inclusion of practical examples in Boxes 2 and 3 particularly helpful.
I have suggested a few areas where more details or examples could further
strengthen the argument (shown in the bullet point list below). I have also make a
small number of comments against the BMJ questions for reviewers (shown in caps
lock).
• I had an overarching question about whether ‘health’ also incorporates mental
health? If not, could the authors signal that people from an ethnic minority
background also experience inequalities in mental health care? e.g. my colleague
Veena Raleigh at The King’s Fund has published analysis on this topic.
• p2 of 17, first sentence under the sub-heading ‘Migration and ethnic diversity in
the UK’ – the use of the adverb ‘beautifully’ is at odds with the rest of the tone; this
is the only reference singled out for such praise in this article and I found it jarring.

• p3 of 17, second paragraph under the sub-heading ‘How migration and ethnicity
relate to health’ – are there any references for the point re: ‘Disproportionate
numbers of minority ethnic people live in poor quality residential areas and
experience poverty’?
• p 4 of 17, second sentence ‘Importantly also, the role of interpersonal racism in
producing health-harming practices among ethnic minority people cannot be
ignored’ – why not? Can an example be given?
• p5 of 17 – insert a close bracket at the end of the first paragraph after the phrase
‘female genital mutilation’.
• P5 of 17 – re: adaptation of the DESMOND programme – I wondered if there was
any evaluation of this, or any feedback collected from participants.
• p. 6 of 17, third paragraph – can the authors say anything about why those 32
JSNAs were selected?
• p7 of 17, at the end of the first paragraph – I wondered if the NIHR has been
given an opportunity to respond to the participants’ comments about how they
perceive NIHR’s readiness to fund research? If so, it would be helpful to note what
the NIHR response was.
• p7 of 17, under the sub-heading ‘Where next? Opportunities to reorient our health
system’ – this is arguably out of scope, but I wondered if the authors had any view
regarding the lack of representation of ethnic minorities at senior levels in academia
and policy-making bodies and whether/how this could have an impact on how
research and evidence is generated (the authors mention the workshop participants
cite the ‘low representation of ethnic minority people within health and medical
research’ as a factor contributing to low volume of research being commissioned).
• p7 of 17, under the sub-heading ‘Where next?’ – could the authors say who
they’re referring to as ‘health system leaders’?
Questions for reviewers:
• Is the article important?
YES; THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CRITIQUE OF CURRENT POLICY.
• Will it help our readers to make better decisions and, if so, how?
POSSIBLY; THIS ARTICLE OUTLINES THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTH
INEQUALITIES BUT THESE MESSAGES ARE NOT ALWAYS LISTENED TO.
• Will the article add enough to existing knowledge?
YES; THE AUTHORS HAVE OUTLINED NEW RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC.
• Does the article read well and make sense? Does it have a clear message?
YES; THIS IS A WELL-WRITTEN AND WELL-ARGUED ARTICLE WITH A CLEAR
MESSAGE.
• Originality — does the work add enough to what is already in the published
literature? If so, what does it add? Please cite relevant references to support your
comments on originality.
THIS ARTICLE OUTLINES NEW RESEARCH. I HAVE NOT COME ACROSS ANALYSIS
OF JSNAs PLUS DELIBERATIVE WORKSHOPS ON THIS TOPIC IN OTHER RESEARCH.
• Importance of the work to general readers — does this work matter to clinicians,
researchers, policymakers, educators, or patients? Will it help our readers to make
better decisions and, if so, how? Is a general medical journal the right place for it?
YES; IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE READERSHIP OF THE BMJ TO NOTE THIS CRITIQUE
OF CURRENT POLICY AND TO REFLECT ON HOW WELL THE HEALTH SYSTEM IS
MEETING THE NEEDS OF A DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATION.
• Scientific reliability:

• Research question — clearly defined and appropriately answered?
YES.
• Overall design of study — appropriate and adequate to answer the research
question?
YES. ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW ABOUT THE RATIONALE BEHIND
INCLUDING THE 32 JSNAs (AS MENTIONED ABOVE).
• Participants — adequately described, their conditions defined, inclusion and
exclusion criteria described? How representative were they of patients whom this
evidence might affect?
THERE IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS.
• Methods — adequately described? Main outcome measure clear? Is the study fully
reported in line with the appropriate reporting statement or checklist (these are all
collected and regularly updated at http://www.equator-network.org/)? Was the
study ethical (this may go beyond simply whether the study was approved by an
ethics committee or IRB)?
SEE MY NOTES ABOVE.
• Results — answer the research question? Credible? Well presented?
YES.
• Interpretation and conclusions — warranted by and sufficiently derived
from/focused on the data? Discussed in the light of previous evidence? Message
clear?
YES.
• References — up to date and relevant? Any glaring omissions?
THESE MOSTLY SEEM TO BE IN ORDER, SEE MY EARLIER COMMENT ABOUT MENTAL
HEALTH INEQUALITIES.
• Abstract/summary/key messages/what this paper adds — reflect accurately what
the paper says?
YES.
• Documents in the supplemental files eg checklists for reporting statements eg
CONSORT, PRISMA, and STROBE (see http://www.equator-network.org for other
examples and for extensions to existing statements); and the protocol for an RCT.
Do these properly match what is in the manuscript? Do they contain information
that should be better reported in the manuscript, or raise questions about the work?
NOT APPLICABLE.
