The stated goal of this paper is to “examine progress towards improving equity in
financing for WCAH”. It does so by comparing data on the targeting of WCAH over time
across countries, the levels of financing for WCAH within countries, and also presents
some short descriptive case studies of financing situations in countries. While interesting,
the paper lacks one central research question and, in my opinion, tries to do too much
within the limited space available and thus as a result does not really do one thing really
well and thus not really making a substantive contribution to the literature. I think the
paper could do more by focusing in on one of the pieces of the paper and do it well rather
than a few analyses in a fragmented fashion. I also believe, as I further describe below,
this paper should be broadened in its focus on equity in financing as it does not only look
at it in its analysis.
Upfront the authors make a very important point: there is little guidance on what and
“equitable distribution’ of “funding” for WCAH would look like. However, this already
begins to introduce the core problem I see with this paper. It tries to both look at equity
in financing (i.e. where money comes from) and equity in distribution (where money goes)
although the title and stated goal of the paper is just about financing.
In my mind, health financing is the collective functions of raising revenues, pooling
revenues, and purchasing. They introduce the terms of horizontal and vertical equity that
are traditionally used in the analysis of health financing. They are measures of fairness of
who pays for health care. The authors also note that there is a methodology known as
incidence analysis that traditionally looks at who are the beneficiaries of public financing
(although developments in the field have gone beyond that in recent years). Incidence
analysis helps to highlight the net payment and benefits received by people of different
SES from a health system. The authors say that they follow this logic to do their analysis
of the equity of health financing but this later methodology is better at studying the
equitable distribution of funding and not of financing, although there are important
differences in its goals. The authors interchangeable apply these terms throughout the
paper that makes it confusing.
At the global level, the authors look at donor financing and they find that overall financing
has increased for WCAH and suggest that if you think about who pays for health care
globally, this is an increasing in the vertical equity of financing, I can believe and buy this
argument. Then they say that donors are increasingly prioritizing lower income countries
and those with higher mortality and that this is also an improvement in vertical equity,
however, who is paying for health care is not changing (or necessarily even the amounts
for this argument) so it is not a measure of vertical equity. The allocation of aid, or the
distribution of funding is to me more a question of efficiency ( the argument that aid
should be prioritized to where it would produce the most benefits) and not about the
equity of financing. Figures 1-3, for example, do not support equity in financing.
At the national level, an analysis of the vertical and horizontal equity of domestic financing
for WCAH would look more at what share of resources are coming from which financing
sources and not just the levels of financing. Even saying that a certain percentage of
resources comes from government sources, however, is not itself an analysis of the equity
of financing as one needs to know who is paying the taxes to fund government activities.
There data in the GHED, as the authors acknowledge, is very limited to be able to do this
as a result, this part of the paper does not make much of a contribution. I wonder if this
is part of the paper that could be easily dropped as it adds very little to the analysis of
equity of financing. The authors suggest that richer countries have higher per capita
spending on WCAH, this is not particularly interesting, nor does it necessarily speak about
equity. Do they also spend more as a share of total resources? Does a larger share of
resources come from more equitable forms of taxation such as general revenues? That

would be an improvement but of course a real equity analysis of the equity of financing
would also include an analysis of who pays taxes to support government financing.
Finally, the authors purposely selected the three case studies for 3 very different reasons,
which limits our ability to draw generalizable lessons from these cases. If I understand
correctly, the Nigeria case basically argues that the level of financing for WCAH has not
increased and risks decreasing in the future. However, the authors only state the levels of
funding coming from each source, rather than the proportion of funding come from the
different sources, or where revenues come from (if taxes are financed by oil revenues in
Nigeria, for example, would say a lot about the equity of financing). From those figures, it
sounds like it has remained relatively stable over time so I am not sure how the
conclusions drawn come from this analysis. For Senegal, the authors conclude that
financing is becoming increasingly inequitable, despite the fact that the data given
suggests that government is playing a much larger share of total financing for health,
however, none of this data is disaggregated for WCAH so it is unclear how it adds to the
stated goal of the paper to measure progress towards the equity of financing of WCAH.
The case study on refugees in Lebanon is very interesting but represents such a different
case study that I am left wondering what a more equitable financing system for people
who are not citizens of a country should be rather than any insights on the progress that
is being made there. I believe the findings pertaining to equity of health financing for
WCAH should be made clearer or these case studies should be dropped.
My overall suggestion to the authors would be to frame the material in a way so that it is
not just about the equity of financing for WCAH, which I feel they don’t’ do properly, and
perhaps focus the discussion on one type of analysis (e.g. where is financing allocated).
For equable, the figures 1-3 are some of the most interesting pieces of the paper, but as
they don’t really look at equity, don’t really fit.
A more minor point, in the introduction the authors provide a very simplistic description of
what equity in financing mean and mostly suggest that systems are either equitable or
not, but the reality is the richest person pays for health care for the rest of the country,
there are always improvements that can be made to make a health system more equitable
financed. So for example, I would disagree with this sort of statement because these are
separate dimensions of equity, a system could theoretically be vertical equitable but
horizontally inequitable:
Financial contributions are widely considered equitable if those who have a similar ability
to pay contribute equally (horizontal equity), and if those with greater ability to pay
contribute more (vertical equity).
And the following sentence is also not necessarily true, as this mixes the ideas of
efficiency and equity (and does not reflect the true goal of incidence analysis either):
Financing is distributed equitably if those with equal need benefit equally (horizontal
equity), and those with greater need receive more (vertical equity).
I also don’t fully understand this sentence, because OOPs are in fact a reflection of a
person’s ability to pay, if they were unable to pay it, they would not pay it: “Out-of-pocket
contributions are considered the least equitable because they do not reflect ability to pay.”
Finally, statements such as the following a gross oversimplification “Taxation is considered
the most equitable, as it (usually) requires the richer to pay more.”. It depends on what
type of taxes are being considered and who actually pays those taxes (e.g. general
revenues vs. oil taxes). Even then, the vertical and horizontal dimensions of equity need
to be considered separately as some forms of taxes may be vertically equitable but not
horizontally equitable.
