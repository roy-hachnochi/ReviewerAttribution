This article presents the results of a population-based cohort study in Ontario using linked clinical and
health administrative databases aiming to measure the association between newly initiated
physician-delivered palliative care in the last 6 months of life and health care use in adults dying from
non-cancer illness, and to compare these associations with those who die from cancer.

This is an excellent piece of research and I want to congratulate all authors who collaborated on this.
The article is well-written, well structured, presents a clear message, and all necessary information is
provided to help understand the structure and the results of the study.
Some suggestions for the authors:
1. Include in the introduction your vision on quality of palliative care.
2. Include in the introduction some information on how palliative care is organised and delivered in
Canada (Ontario) e.g. comparing it with another country (aim: to state the uniqueness of the
organisation and delivery of palliative care in Canada).
3. On page 9, lines 153-155 with regard to confounding by indication: elaborate a bit more on the
selection of the 6 months of life and e.g. also include a critical reflection of the varying disease
trajectories of the focused patient groups of the study.
