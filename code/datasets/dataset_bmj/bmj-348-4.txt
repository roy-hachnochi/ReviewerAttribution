Dear Editor
Thanks for invite to me to review this interesting paper. Dr. Huang and colleagues made an
important scientific effort to answer a clinically relevant question regarding the
dose-response relationship between dietary sodium reduction and blood pressure change
and the impact of intervention duration.
This Systematic-Review and meta-analysis was well conducted, following PRISMA consensus
and applying all methodological tools suggested by Cochrane collaboration. The paper was
well written, with a clear clinical message.
After a detail revision of this paper, I have some comments that could contribute to this
academic paper:

1. Data sources for this systematic review were: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials. I would like to know if authors tried to search gray
literature published about this topic in other sources and contact authors looking for primary
data.
2. 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, as a proxy of intake sodium, can capture 90% of
dietary intake, the other 10% is relating non-urinary losses. Indeed, urine collection could
be incomplete in many RCT. The authors could explore these aspects as a potential bias to
mention into the text.
3. Besides, the authors mentioned that this paper registered in PROSPERO, it could be
important for the reader know the register number of this Systematic review.
4. It is curious that blood pressure (Systolic or Diastolic) was no taking into account as MeSH
term in the search strategy, mainly because the aim was the association of intake sodium
and blood pressure. This concern merit a comment of the authors.
5. Authors mentioned that study quality was assessed but I did not see any sub-analysis
taking into account the quality of the studies. How do the quality of studies impact the
results?
6. Authors mentioned the evaluation of heterogeneity using I2, and show I2 values in the
main results, but there is no a deep discussion about the possible causes of this high
heterogeneity (76.6% to 99.1%). This high heterogeneity could preclude made a
meta-analysis through the calculation of a summary measure. This point requires to be
discussed for the authors. Indeed, the I2 information was not included in the forest-plot
graphs. This is a very important topic to include.
7. Other previous report published, have associated Body mass index (BMI) with both
sodium intake and blood pressure and statistical analysis adjusted by BMI attenuated the
association between sodium intake and blood pressure. Is BMI a modifier or a mediator of
the association between sodium intake and blood pressure? Is it important include BMI into
this analysis?
