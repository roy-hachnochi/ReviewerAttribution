Good study of an important topic. My only comment to consider is whether the first bullet of
the "What this study adds" section is substantiated by the results of this study: "The
'weekend' is a misnomer for for many researchers" Based on these results, there is an 85%
probability of not reviewing on the weekend; "many" are not submitting and reviewing on
the weekend. The late-night data was quite striking to me, suggesting regular family time
might be impacted.
