The purpose of the paper was not completely clear from the abstract. The objective suggested that the
intention of the paper was to add to the debate about the generalisability of the findings from the UK
Biobank study but the study design was indicating that it was something slightly different. Two purposes
were conflated and there needs to be a clearer indication of whether the intention is to utilise the
findings from the prospective cohort study to challenge the issue of generalisability or whether this study
is intended to focus on the comparative study and to add to the evidence base on nationally sampled
cohort studies. The introduction appears to set out the objective of the paper more clearly as addressing
the concerns about generalisability.
The introduction references the low response rate to the baseline UK Biobank study and it would be
helpful for the article to state the potential causes of this. Although the arguments for and against
representativeness are reflected, the issue of non-engagement is not addressed. As the relative
response rate for the HSE and SSE studies was higher it seems to be an important point to address.
Public support for research is critical to ensure it has value so understanding why engagement varies
across the studies is important. The study could have benefited from patient engagement in either
setting the research question, design or dissemination. Involving patients can help in prioritising
questions of importance to patients and may have the effect of increasing interest in future cohort
studies and understanding why the UK Biobank study had a low response rate.

The limitations of the study suggest that the strength of the study has been affected and there are still
questions about the generalisability of the findings from the Biobank study. Other studies have
demonstrated that slight differences in questions can have an impact on the responses and data. A wider
discussion addressing some of the concerns of earlier papers would have been helpful and strengthened
the challenge to existing views.
