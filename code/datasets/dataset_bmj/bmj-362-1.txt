BMJ 049015-R1: Development and reliability of an instrument to evaluate the credibility of
anchor-based minimally important difference estimates for patient reported outcomes
The present manuscript provides a useful tool for the evaluation of studies identifying MIDs
for PROMS. There are some issues that would be useful to discuss or clarify before
publication could be recommended.
Points:

• Kappa calculations – The use of quadratic weights for the kappa calculation implies that
the categories are ordinal and equidistant. This does not make sense given the categories
used in the items. In particular 'Impossible to tell' cannot be deemed to be closer to
‘definitely no’ than ‘definitely yes’. Please correct if this is what was done or clarify in your
paper if this is just a reporting issue.
• Table 1, the examples provided for the 5th criteria need expanding. Currently these are
not informative enough.
• The term ‘transition rating’ is used continuously and is central in several parts of the
manuscript. This needs to be defined somewhere prominent in the manuscript as it is not
necessarily a term familiar to many readers. Suggest this is included in a Box somewhere
near the start of the manuscript.
• Related to the above, the authors make a distinction between the five core credibility
criteria relevant for ALL PROM-MIDs and the extension for the ‘transition rating anchors’.
Nevertheless most (possibly all) of the examples given are for transition rating anchors.
Please provide clearer examples of other forms of anchors in the main body of the
manuscript as well as in Table 1 (see comment above).
• It is also unclear in the results why the reliability analysis was available for 135 of the
core credibility criteria and 137 of the first item in the extension. Naively I assumed that
the extension would be applicable to a subset of the total number of studies with the core
being applicable to all. Please clarify. Please also comment on the limitations that this
framework has due to inadequate reporting of the correlation to answer extension
questions 2 to 4
• Regarding the time thresholds given, I think there needs to be a caveat regarding the
actual PROM link to the condition. If it is a chronic condition not likely to change much,
these times might not be adequate. Similarly, for those conditions for which change might
be counted in minutes or less. Please consider at least mentioning this in the Discussion.
• There needs to be a justification or a reference for the thresholds given for the
correlations in the extension questions.
• ‘Overall judgement of credibility’ – Based on the current framework, it appears to me that
there are particular items for which the assessment of the MID might prove more/less
robust to. For example, regardless of the other criteria, if item 5 is not met, could you still
call this an MID?
