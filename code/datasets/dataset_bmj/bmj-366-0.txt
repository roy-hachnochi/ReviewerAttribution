General comments:
1. Introduction: page 4, lines 84-86: authors should add references for studies on RCTs and
meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies.
2. Authors should include unit/metric, for example, BMI units in lines 126-127.
3. Page 7, line 147. Inappropriate reference format. Reference 71 is not available in the
reference section!
4. Page 9, lines 211-213. Authors should clarify the cut-offs for macronutrient components
refer to percentage of energy for each macronutrient. How did the authors define cut-offs for
dietary risk matrix analysis? Are these validated cut-offs?
5. Page 10, line 233, results section. % participants died should have been 2.4%. Please
check % of participants with CVD as well.
Results section:
1. The cut-offs chosen for interpreting the associations between macronutrient intake and
study outcomes (all-cause mortality, incident CVD) are rather confusing, and do not align
with the cut-offs used in the dietary risk matrix analysis. For example, risk of death was

lowest among participants who consumed 15-25% from protein, but the HR (95% CI) was
for reported for the comparison of 10% vs 15% of energy from protein. Similarly, rationale
for comparing 35% vs 10% energy from sugar should be provided in the manuscript.
2. Page 12, lines 274-275. the direction of the association between sugar intake and
all-cause mortality and incident CVD should be provided.
3. Supplementary Figures S8-S10: Authors should clarify “low”, “high” calorie intake and
carbohydrate intake with the defined cut-off values. Moreover, the relevance/significance of
these figures were not discussed anywhere in the main text. They seem ‘stand-alone’
figures!
4. Referring to authors’ response - comment 17. I assume that the authors intended to say
“there is no accurate estimation on how calorie is available for each gram of fibre intake’.
Dietary risk matrix:
I believe that some of the sections of the ‘development of an all-cause mortality risk matrix
to inform personalised dietary advice’ manuscript had been added to this current version of
the manuscript without addressing the reviewers’ comments. Points for further
consideration:
- In the results section, the cut-off for high fibre is incorrectly mentioned as 10-25 g/d;
findings for 10-25 g/d category is not available in Table S4. I assume that the categories
(10-<15, >=15) were collapsed due to similar hazard ratios. However, the upper limit for
fibre is reported differently in the results section (10-25 g/d), just >=15 g/d in Table S4 and
30 g/d in Figure S11. This should be consistent throughout the manuscript.
- According to results of Table S4, statistically significant result was observed only for MUFA
category 10-<20. Why was MUFA category 20-25% of energy used instead of 10-<20 to
develop the macronutrient risk matrix?
-Figure 1 has been wrongly cited in the dietary risk matrix section, it should have been
Supplementary Figure 11.
Table S4:
1. Authors should include lower and upper limits of each macro-nutrient intake category,
number of participants and number of events of each category in Table S4. Also, clarify
whether the percentage (%) refer to percentage of energy for each macronutrient.
2. Clarify ‘office-based risk factors’ and why were ‘age, sex, diabetes, BMI categories,
systolic blood pressure and smoking’ were included in the ‘office-based risk factors’
category?
3. Many important confounders such as education, ethnicity, physical activity, alcohol
consumption, overall diet quality, socio-economic status, medical history, medication use,
supplement use, etc were not considered in the multivariable analyses. It is not clear if these
analyses were adjusted mutually for the rest of the macronutrients.
4. It is not clear whether participants reporting existing health conditions (such as cancer,
CVD, kidney diseases, etc at baseline) were excluded in the analyses.
- Figure S11. Dietary risk matrix for all-cause mortality. Was this study sufficiently powered
to conduct stratified analyses by 4 or more groups (ie., various categories within the
macronutrients, protein, fibre, starch, MUFA and PUFA? Further, dietary recommendations
based on the macronutrients are rather difficult to follow by the general population. Hence,
dietary recommendations based on foods or food groups rather than macronutrients will be
useful.
- SFA and sugar were dropped from the model because their associations were not
statistically significant. What would be the alternative dietary (substitutions)
recommendations for those who consume higher amounts of SFA or sugar?
- Generally, dietary consumption (/energy intake) differs by sex. Do the study authors
recommend to use the same dietary risk matrix regardless of individual’s sex or other
status?
