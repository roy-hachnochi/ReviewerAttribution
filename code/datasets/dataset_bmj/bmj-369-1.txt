The revised paper is essentially acceptable, although may not have enough data or
precision for some readers.
The authors have attended to my points and no doubt the other reviewers will also have
checked whether they are satisfied.
I find Fig 3-6 to be somewhat 'uninteresting' and would suggest they might amalgamate
into one figure. And graphics quality would need improving for all.
I dislike the 'We must ...' statements in the last 2 bullets of the key points section, but the
journal will no doubt make it's own style choices and necessary adjustments.

In summary, OK to proceed given that this is part of a series, but has limitations and
might not merit a stand-alone paper in my judgment.
