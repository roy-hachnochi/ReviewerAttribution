This is an interesting paper showing recent trends in different types of heart disease in the US, which is
very clear and comprehensive, and draws attention to an important public health issue.
The authors have explained why they used the term "race" and added an analysis by region. Race is a
term widely used in the US, it still seems a very “loaded” term, whose use needs to be contextualized
further.
The authors continue to use “race” specific life expectancy to calculate years of potential life lost (YPLL),
but have added an analysis by region. Life expectancy in the US is longer for white people than black
people. Using race specific YPLL gives more YPLL if a white person dies prematurely than if a black
person dies prematurely at exactly the same age. Use of race specific life expectancy could be construed
as normalizing systematic disadvantages by race and more importantly as devaluing black lives. If
resources are directed to the groups with the greatest per capita YPLL based on race specific life
expectancy then relatively more resources would go to white people than black people, because black

people have shorter lives and lower YPLL. However, most resources should go to black people to address
their overall shorter lives.
I wonder whether the analysis of disease and race specific YPLL using average US life expectancy would
give different results and interpretation. Analysis by region does not address this issue.
It would be helpful to be clearer that fewer deaths from early onset types of cardiovascular disease
might inevitably result in more deaths from late onset types of cardiovascular disease, so it might still
save most YPLL to focus on preventing early onset cardiovascular disease.
