This revised version of the paper is a clearer and stronger contribution to the current
scientific debates about measuring progress in improving health outcomes, in this case in low-&-middle income countries. The authors have thoroughly and appropriately
addressed the reviewers' comments on the earlier version, both in presentational style
and technical details. The removal of a draft continuum of care chart - as recommended
by the reviewers - and instead, the indication of a consultative process to produce one, is
a marked improvement.
The only additional comment would be in relation to the opening italicized key message
which is rather tortuous & unclear, and should be improved through the onward editorial
process.
I recommend this version of the paper for publication.
