The authors have addressed the reviewerâ€™s comments thoroughly and have substantially
strengthened the manuscript as an original piece of work and a resource for researchers. In
particular, the addition of an overall recommendation column provides clear guidance for
comparing and selecting a multimorbidity index for a specific project.
The reviewers addressed my specific concerns regarding the generalisability of including
indices developed in populations with specific conditions.
I would like to re-iterate my initial review, in that this is a well-conducted, novel piece of
work that would be valuable for researchers conducting research in patients with multiple
long term conditions.
