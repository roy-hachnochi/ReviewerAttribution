The revised paper represents a huge amount of work, on a complex and difficult problem.
The end result would be very useful, mainly to other researchers rather than clinicians.
The authors have done their best to address the previous reviewers comments, although I'm
still not 100% convinced they have resolved two of my concerns.
First, by focusing on the first validation of each measure, its not clear to me that they have
indexed later papers which validated the same measure against different outcomes, and this
would be relevant if I was looking for measures which had been validated against a specific
outcome. Maybe they have looked at this again, but I couldn't tell.

Second, I still think its a shame that they excluded counts of diseases as a measure of
multimorbidity, since this is the most commonly used approach, easy to implement, and
reasonably valid for some outcomes. They have now highlighted this as a limitation in the
discussion, but in my view it is an omission that makes the paper a bit less useful.
Third, they appear to have addressed most but not all of the issues raised by Gary Collins
(the statistician) in the level of detail he requested. But I have sympathy with the authors
here, because if they attempted to do so it would make the paper even more lengthy and
complex than it is already.
I didn't understand their explanation for why they didn't use the Probast tool (p8, lines
11-16) - their explanation seems contradictory to me.
But overall, they have done a lot of work and done a good job to address the other
comments of the reviewers
