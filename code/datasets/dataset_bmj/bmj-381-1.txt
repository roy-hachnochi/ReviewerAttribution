So, this is an important review of an important topic which as you rightly say is clouded in secrecy. I
think overall it makes some good points about how some of the technical aspects of trade agreements
may increase the cost to the NHS doing some basic calculation of popular medicines. I think that
works quite well to iterate the argument made. Two comments here, I think the section on NICE,
especially the price thing is hard to follow and needs to be clearer. Specifically this paragraph
'NICE evaluates new medicines for cost-effectiveness using a threshold of £20,000-30,000 per
quality-adjusted life year gained. Paying more than the accepted cost-effectiveness threshold implies

that other services would be displaced without justification, given a finite budget. For example, the
NHS have refused to procure lumacaftor/ivacaftor, an originator cystic fibrosis medicine with a list
price of £105,000 per year.'
Does not completely clearly work I think and the example of the specific medication at the end to me
seems confusing rather than adding clarity.
The big thing and that is my point and I think to me the challenge when thinking about the potential
about this deal for the NHS, is the political nature with which these deals have been used to drive
policy. Essentially, the examples you provide mean there will be a greater democracy deficit in health
decisions. The UK risks loosing sovereignty over its NHS and the strong rhetoric around NICE - an
internationally admired model for policy decision making that is evidence based is particularly
worrisome. It fits within a broader agenda of how populist politics have sought to systematically
undermine 'facts' - I am thinking for example of the anti-vaccine movement.
These broader agendas are there, but you do not state them head on. I think I would accentuate that
just as much as costs the deal will mean less control, sovereignty etc over the NHS, which is directly
the opposite to politicians promises.
