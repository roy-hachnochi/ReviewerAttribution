General comments: This is an important and well conducted systematic review and
meta-analysis of unrecognized myocardial infarctions (UMIs) detected with ECG or CMR.
Selection and inclusion of studies seems to be adequately and thoroughly performed.
However, the authors claim to explore the value of screening for UMI whereas this topic is
only briefly discussed. Reading is disturbed by a few grammatical and wording errors
throughout the manuscript.
Specific comments:

1. Introduction: First sentence states “…due to the lack of atypical symptoms…” where the
authors mean “due to the lack of typical symptoms” or “due to atypical symptoms”. Please
rephrase.
2. Introduction: Last sentence: The 3d “key question” is not explored in this paper (see
general comment above). Please remove this from the aim/as a key question.
3. Methods: In the first sentence of Data extraction and quality assessment it is stated that
“Two reviewers (J.W. and W.L)” conducted the literature searches. However, there is no
J.W. among the authors, nor listed under Contributors on page 21. Please correct.
4. Results: There is no information on how the ECG interpretation and the CMR
assessments were performed (visually? semi-automatically? Automatically?) and which
criteria were used to diagnose MI with the two methods (Q-wave? subendocardial late
gadolinium enhancement?). Please provide this information.
5. Results: Page 13, 2nd paragraph, 2nd sentence under UMI-CMR and health outcomes
reads “Each 1% and 10% increase in late gadolinium enhancement was associated with…”
What is meant? Increase in number of subjects with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)?
Increase in LGE intensity? Increase in size of LGE? Please clarify.
6. Results: Page 15, 1st sentence under Additional predictive effects for health outcomes of
UMI reports identical numbers for IDI of all-cause mortality and fatal MI. Please correct this
so that it corresponds with the numbers presented in table 1.
7. Results: Page 15, 1st sentence under Diagnostic consistency between ECG and CMR
refers to Schelbert et al, JAMA 2012, as reporting diagnostic consistency between ECG and
CMR for UMI detection. This is not correct since Schelbert et al report significant differences
(ECG detected 46 UMIs and CMR 157 UMIs, and they report that “there were 27
participants with UMI by ECG who exhibited no MI on CMR, and there were 138 individuals
who had UMI by CMR yet did not meet criteria for UMI by ECG (p<0.001).”) Please correct
this. However, such an error decreases the overall reliability of the meta-analysis.
8. Discussion: Page 17: The subtitle Who should be screened for UMI implies that a firm
conclusion can be drawn from this meta-analysis which is not supported by the presented
results. The discussion is relevant, but the subtitle should be rephrased. (Also, see further
comment #2.)
9. Discussion: Page 17: The reference #50 is repeated 3 times at the same position.
10. Discussion: Page 18, 1st sentence under How to manage patients with UMI describes
the results of to 2 RCTs but only refers to a comment (Scirica et al, Circulation 2013).
Please refer to the original publications.
11. Strengths and limitations: Page 20, last sentence states as a limitation that “UMI-ECG
was defined with different criteria in included studies”. These criteria should be described.
(Also, see further, comment #5.)
12. Conclusions: Page 21, 2nd sentence states “Screening for UMI is useful…” Such a firm
conclusion cannot be drawn from the presented data.
13. Table 2: Please provide information on which studies these estimates are based.
