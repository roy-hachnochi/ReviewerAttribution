The edits are well done. I have no further quibbles. There is much subtle but compelling
handling of methods details: left censoring, time-varying effects, accounting for missing
data, statement on patient involvement, life table analysis for time periods at risk, etc.
Overall, I think this is a very important and landmark study, and deserves to be highlighted
in the Journal. An editorial is warranted.
