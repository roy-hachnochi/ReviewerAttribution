Important to have meta-analytic results so that we have a broader understanding of where
the evidence stands. As a patient who has been on biologics for many years, this topic is
important to me. I also had to switch from MTX + biologic to a different biologic (without
MTX), so I especially appreciate being able to see evidence comparing effectiveness of
different drugs.
Not really sure what “network” meta analysis is, though. A sentence or two to explain this
approach and why it’s important would be appreciated.
It’s not immediately clear what the problem with heterogeneous patient populations is isn’t good to have diverse demographic factors included? I understand homogeneity makes
comparisons easier, but it’s problematic for generalizability.
Are the current definitions of key outcomes shaped at all by patients? Does clinical disease
activity index reflect what patients care about?
The authors state they included RCTs with at least one patient-relevant outcome but they
don’t give any rationale for that.
I appreciate the focus on the CDAI, but I know that my rheumatologist still uses the DAS
28. So, will these results be taken up by rheumatologists?
Patients were involved in reviewing the protocol and preliminary report. I think patients
could be further involved by consulting on dissemination of the results to patients.
