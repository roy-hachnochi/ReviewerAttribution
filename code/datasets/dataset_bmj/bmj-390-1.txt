The authors try to evaluate the long term risks of invasive breast cancer and breast cancer death after
ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed through breast screening. The authors have been quite successful in
achieving their objectives. However, I still have some major comments.
In particular, the authors control for many confusers, but they do not do it for several who could be very
influential in estimating the risks, both of incidence and mortality. First, they do not control the
socioeconomic level of women, nor do they do so because of their place of residence, which could have
environmental risk factors and / or other contextual risk factors (such as socioeconomic deprivation).
Authors should discuss, in detail, this lack of control and its influence on their results. Also, as they could
have controlled them.
