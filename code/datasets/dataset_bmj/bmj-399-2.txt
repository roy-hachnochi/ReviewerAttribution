This paper addresses a topical and important issue for general practice and
highlights some of the questions that need to be addressed at a time when the use
of technology enabled consultations is increasing.
it is clearly written and well structured, but there is one important theme that is
missing and a couple of important issues are touched on so briefly that they could
be missed.
The paper acknowledges some pros and cons of online consultations but doesn't
refer to a range of well established uses of on line communications with GPs and
other primary care clinicians - particularly remote monitoring of long term
conditions - for which there is some evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness.
Remote monitoring of LCTs and online communication of clinical data could act as
an effective and convenient alternative to, for example, attending a hypertension
review appointment that would free up GP or practice nurse slots for other clinical
problems.
Recognising the word count limits, the above issue could be well illustrated
through a second short vignette.
There is only passing reference to supply induced demand and (P5 line 39). How
does this fit with policy rhetoric about promoting self-care and use of other
services such as pharmacists?
This loops back to the brief mention of e-consulting and as my GP at the start of
the paper. These technologies include links to self-help advice - but its not clear
whether these resources divert patients away from contacts with clinicians or
provide them with the information needed to justify a GP consultation. Policy
makers seem to be hoping for technology enabled demand management through
a linear progression from click to call to face to face contact, but its not clear that
this is actually happening. How far can we go in forcing patients through this
sequence?

Finally, there are no numbers in the paper to inform readers about the scale of use
of online consultations. Although there has been little formal research beyond the
use of telephone triage and consultations, there are some published estimates (or
perhaps 'guesstimates') of the number and characteristics of uses and the altcon
study may provide some data on this.
