The authors appear to have addressed the reviewer comments comprehensively.
However, although they have changed the nomenclature for the retrospective self
assessment at age 10 (thinner, plumper, about average) to early life body size, the
abstract conclusions still state that lower BMI during childhood can increase risk regardless
of later body size changes and similarly, the main conclusions paragraph talks of the
association with early life adiposity and high body mass index.
I also do still wonder whether there should be more emphasis throughout on the fact that
this is the 'perception' of early life body size that is being discussed/investigated.
