This submission deals with an intersting topic with a special advantage of the
inclusion of genetic risk. Despite of being unable to draw conclusions regarding
effects I find this manuscript important to be published in a high-quality journal. It is
also carefully written and most of the shortcomings have been brought up
thoroughly.
Detailed comments:
1. Please, indicate what you mean by total n-3 PUFA. Have you included n-3 PUFA of
animal origin as well? If so, please, mention this (line 261), since some researchers
seem to forget the plant sources of n-3 PUFA.
2. Please, explain why n-6 PUFA was not included in this manuscript. The title does
not refer to n-3 PUFA. If you keep n-6 PUFAs out, please reconsider the title of this
manuscript. E.g. in supplementary table 8 it would be nice to see results of n-6 PUFA
as well.
3. I am quite worried about the covariates used (supplementary table 4) in the
analysis. In non-olive oil favoring countries the intake of MUFA correlates highly with
the intake of SFA. Furthermore, the intake of TFA generally correlates highly with
the intake of SFA. Please, discuss this issue carefully.

4. FFQ is a questionable and highly variable method, although often the only
possibility in epidemiologial studies, to assess the intake of energy, n-3 PUFA and
TFA. There is an indication about this in different cohorts in the same country in
Supplementary table 5, e.g. the Finnish studies. Please, discuss.
