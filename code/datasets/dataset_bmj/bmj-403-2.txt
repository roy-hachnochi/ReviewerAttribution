I found this paper interesting, but puzzling and inconsistent in parts. I note that the objectives were
to explain 'in layman terms , if and how the original TRIPS Agreement hampered access to medicines
for people living in developing countries' and to 'assess to what extent the Paragraph 6 System first
and Article 31bis now solve the problem that was created by the TRIPS Agreement' etc - which are
fine. I think it largely succeeds in its first objective and Section 1 presents a good account of the
issues in 'layman terms' . However Sections 2 and 3 seem almost abbreviated and much less
accessible, almost as if they needed to be shortened to fit within the word count. The explanations are
brief and the arguments seem underdeveloped.
In particular I think that your argument that 'governments of developing countries .. can use
compulsory licenses.. for all medicines needed to protect public health' and that 'the possibility of a
compulsory license (is) .. a deterrent against full use of patent rights' need a great deal of further
discussion. The threats and intimidation extended by the US (despite being a signatory to TRIPS)
toward countries both planning and executing compulsory licences arguably undermines the
effectiveness of CL as a deterrent to anything.
More generally the paper would benefit from some judicious editing
