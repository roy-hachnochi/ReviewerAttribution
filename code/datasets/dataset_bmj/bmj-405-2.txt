This study argues that in view of difficulties for countries to reach the two impact
criteria for elimination of maternal-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV, there
should be a recognition of country-level achievements in the pre-elimination phase
as a way to maintain momentum towards EMTCT. While the authors make a
compelling case in this analysis article, I recommend that they address the following
minor concerns.
•
The authors make a strong case that the WHO numbers are unattainable
and unfeasible for high HIV prevalent countries of SSA. The authors should give
more detail as to how the WHO and the Global Plan came up with these numbers.
•
Furthermore, while the authors present a convincing argument by
examining the necessary inputs to produce a final MTCT of <=5% and ≤50 new
pediatric infections per 100,000 live births, their argument would be strengthened
by including a table of the known data available for some (or all) of the 22
prioritized Global Plan countries. For example, they could include one column
indicating maternal HIV, another with the MTCT rate, and a final indicating the year
and source of the data.
•
Finally, the authors conclude that while the “gold standard” can continue,
they recommend that countries be recognized for their efforts to strengthen sexual
and reproductive health milestones. While they listed some of the recommended
milestones early on, it would make a stronger case if the authors provide specific
recommendations for how these milestones can be realized, especially given that
this is the first in a series of such reviews.
•
There is some duplication of material in figure 1 and table 1, and table one
is overly complex. I suggest abbreviating material in table 1, and ensuring that the
material covered in the table is complementary, but not overlapping to that in the
figure.
•
Throughout the manuscript there are missing commas and other
punctuation. I recommend that the authors thoroughly proofread the manuscript.
