The paper critiques and reviews the various methods and early experiences from five Sub-Saharan
African countries with regards to monitoring the impact of PMTCT interventions. Overall I found the
critique to be well conducted and following an expert group consultation meeting with the countries
concerned and major international role players. I have three major comments below that i feel should
be addressed/answered given the African context and INDEPTH DSS network sites present (in 4 of the
5 countries focused upon in this manuscript but numerous others in other parts of SSA) as well as
other initiatives such as ALPHA and other global burden of disease estimation initiatives such as GBD.
The reference to short and long term outcomes is also not clarified with explicit mention of what these
are. Furthermore I noted many grammatical/language related issues in the manuscript and also
suggest a thorough proofread prior to publication.
Major comments
I have two major comments below:
1. The authors state the following “Historically, methods used are mainly cross-sectional and
facility-based. This excludes populations not accessing healthcare” I don’t think this is entirely true if
one considers the INDEPTH demographic surveillance sites in SSA. E.g. sources of data for populations
not accessing health facilities but having regular HIV sero-surveys embedded in their longitudinal
population cohorts? Linkage of individuals within these surveillance populations to routine facility
based data?
Some examples from Africa Centre (now called AHRI):
E.g. Tanser F et al (2017). Identifying ‘corridors of HIV transmission’in a severely affected rural South
African population: a case for a shift toward targeted prevention strategies. International journal of
epidemiology. 2017 Dec 28.

Tanser, F et al (2013). High Coverage of ART Associated with Decline in Risk of HIV Acquisition in
Rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Science (New York, N.Y.), 339(6122), 966–971.
http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1228160
There is also a later section on page 7 entitled “Assessments at demographic surveillance sites” I
don’t feel this issue is sufficiently critiqued in this article. Also not clear why demographic surveillance
sites (e.g. see full list of DSS sites below in 3 of the other African countries concerned, 4 including SA.
No DSS site in Zimbabwe) located in the other countries concerned not included in this review? Note
the descriptive of SA demographic sites is not comprehensive. They authors refer to Agincourt and
another DSS in north east of the country (presumably Dikgale) however no mention of Africa Centre
(now called AHRI) which has done a lot of work on HIV and repeated HIV sero-surveys of its adult
population.

Furthermore there is some overlap with The ALPHA network which brings together ten collaborating
African research institutions, which conduct population-based HIV surveillance in eastern and southern
Africa, and is coordinated by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
2. Beyond SPECTRUM I would also suggest that it be worth mentioning the Global Burden of Disease
initiative and the HIV related estimates produced now annually. E.g. Wang H, Wolock TM, Carter A,
Nguyen G, Kyu HH, Gakidou E, Hay SI, Mills EJ, Trickey A, Msemburi W, Coates MM. Estimates of
global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and mortality of HIV, 1980–2015: the Global
Burden of Disease Study 2015. The lancet HIV. 2016 Aug 1;3(8):e361-87.
I realise some may not agree with the estimates/modelling process in GBD but given that this is a
review/critique I think this needs to be mentioned.
3. Long and short term outcomes eg. Page 9, 3.1 Routine cohort monitoring, “demonstrated that
clients of known positive status had better short-term outcomes”: what outcomes are these
specifically? I would suggest including an appendix or table with the key short and long term
outcomes related to measurement of PMTCT impact.
Minor
Suggest a thorough grammar/language proofread e.g.
•
Abstract, line 23: “representative” this should be “representatives”
•
Abstract, results, line 32: “All five countries included use statistical…” something missing in
the word e.g. “use of statistical…”
•
Etc.
Abstract and Introduction etc: “Organisation” in WHO should be with “z”.
1. Statistical modelling

Methods: the following descriptions “Models are mathematical equations … and particularly outcomes
that are difficult to measure directly.4” – seems vague.
Please include more relevant recent reference(s) for Spectrum e.g. Stover J, Brown T, Puckett R,
Peerapatanapokin W. Updates to the Spectrum/Estimations and Projections Package model for
estimating trends and current values for key HIV indicators. AIDS. 2017 Apr 1;31:S5-11.
Table 1, Lessons learnt: “There are few routine data available on long-term PMTCT impact; thus
measuring long-term PMTCT impact relies on modelling”. Not sure this logical fits under “Lesson
learnt” rather a limitation of current available data/study designs.
It would be useful to list the output indicators from Spectrum that relate to PMTCT specifically.
Page 8, lines 4-11, Section 3. Use of programmatic data to monitor PMTCT impact: “In Malawi …
Not clear why only details regarding Malawi are presented here. Subsequent reference to DHIS system
in South Africa but lacking details from the other 3 countries in this article. Not a well-balanced
section and synthesis could be improved.
