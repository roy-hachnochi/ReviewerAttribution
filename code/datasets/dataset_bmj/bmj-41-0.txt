This is an elaborate study about a very important developing pandemic disease. The authors
have collected an enormous number of data and present these in a proper manor. Although
only observational data, for clinicians treating Covid19 patients anywhere these results are
very important. Not always the difference between mild and moderate disease is clear. The
differences between death and recovered patients are often declared by the moment of entry

in the hospital, but there are enough observations that give insight in the development of
the disease.
Remarkable is the mentioning of the influence of comorbidities. Only hypertension seems to
have been of influence, but the frequency of the other mentioned coexisting diseases do
suggest that perhaps not all comorbidities have been registered. The absence of
prehospitalisation medication is perhaps also a sign of that. It could help other clinicians to
predict the possible complications in especially moderate patients. Perhaps it is possible to
enrich the manuscript with these kind of data from the medical history.
I cannot comment on the statistical information.
