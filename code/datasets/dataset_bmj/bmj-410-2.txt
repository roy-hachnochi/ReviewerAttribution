This is an interesting analysis highlighting a few perspectives on the role that food
companies should play to promote healthier diets among consumers in order to
decrease the burden of non-communicable diseases. Overall, this paper touches
most relevant issues on this topic. There are a few minor suggestions:
Line 30: “Consumption of processed foods …”, that phrase needs a reference which
shows the increase in processed foods consumption and their effects on health. I
feel like the authors are rather talking about specific foods for which we have a good
level of evidence that they contribute to disease e.g. SSBs, fast foods, energy-dense
(high fat/sugar) foods. I think the term “processed foods” is rather vague and can
mean many things. For example, wholemeal bread or plain yogurt are processed
foods, yet there is no evidence that they increase risk of NCDs. So in general I
would be more specific or use terms such as “nutritionally poor processed foods”.
Line 54: This phrase about commercial food systems that deliver affordable food
only to high-income countries and most middle-income countries, I find it a bit odd
and confusing. What happens to lower income countries?
Line 59-60: second part of that phrase needs a reference showing that the output is
skewed towards highly profitable processed foods.
Line 63: I would specify people overeat energy dense foods which are more
affordable
Line 65: Dietary risks should also include saturated fats (from which we have new
evidence from SACN)
Lines 188-190: Is there any evidence that consumer preferences are shifting
towards healthier consumption? Perhaps the latest trends observed in NDNS can be
used here to support this
Lines 191 onwards: the term “healthier” is used here although it is a bit unclear
what is meant here. I think a definition of what they mean by healthier is required at
some point.
