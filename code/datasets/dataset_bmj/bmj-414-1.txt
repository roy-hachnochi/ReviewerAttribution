This Analysis manuscript describes in some detail the current landscape of national and institutional laws
and regulations regarding "openness" when a "mistake" has been made and an "apology" is due, with
particular emphasis on the UK.
The manuscript is well-researched and well-written, and will be of interest to readers of the journal.
In my view, the manuscript can be accepted without revision.
