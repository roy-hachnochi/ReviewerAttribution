1/ A problem might be that all criteria included in Nutrigrade contributes 0-1 points,
except the bias/study quality/ study limitations, although they may be more or less
important. This could be brought up in the discussion.
2/ Page 21, line 38-43. In the conclusion, it is stated that future studies should
focus on less frequently investigated dietary exposures for which there is low quality
evidence for associations. However, I mean that it is important to focus on factors
for which there are plausible biological hypothesis and maybe not on single food
items such as sherbet, despite the low quality evidence. In line with this, I suggest
that the conclusion is somewhat changed in order to highlight that some exposures
are more important to examine than others.
3/ The importance of dietary data of high validity in future studies should be
stressed, because some true associations may not have been observed as some
exposures may be more difficult to measure than others, e.g. due to issues related
to misreporting.
4/ Figure numbers are missing for Figures 1-3b
5/ Page 14, Line 42: Replace in Table 4 by in Table 2?
6/ It would be valuable to identify some specific dietary exposes that would be
especially important to examine, instead of only mentioning that less frequenltly
examined factors or factors for which the evidence is graded as low should be
examined.
7/Table 2: “Evidence” could be replaced by “Quality of evidence”
