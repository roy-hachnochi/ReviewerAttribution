Universal Health Coverage: The Evidence on Incentives for Physicians [working title]
Comments for editor and author:
General comments:
Here the authors discuss a very timely issue regarding the various strategies to
motivate physicians in achieving universal health coverage from low- to high-income
countries. Overall, this is a well-written editorial with a sound argument which is
somewhat human resource management-oriented, i.e. what can motivate the
providers to fill the ‘know-do’ gap. However, there are some issues that need to be
addressed.
Specific comments:
1. Introduction - p.2 lines 30-33: The authors stated that ‘there is also little
correlation between quality of care and challenging working conditions (lack of drugs
and equipment) or working loads’. This is quite untrue since there is abundance of
evidence looking at how working loads and other related factors can influence
healthcare quality. For instance, a highly cited article by Aiken et al (Lancet 2014;
383: 1824–1830) observed higher inpatient death rates as working load for nurse
increases in nine different European countries.
2. Introduction – p.2 lines 42-45: Two categories of motivational factors (extrinsic
and intrinsic) were specified by the authors in the beginning of the article without
justification as to why they were chosen. Since the rest of the article further
explores details based on this grouping, I believe it would strengthen the central
argument if some explanation is provided early on in the paper as to why these two
categories were defined.
3. Financial incentives – p.3-4: I feel that some of the explanations are supported
only by a limited number of references confined to one particular income setting (i.e.
LMICs such as India and Rwanda). Because the factors can be very contextual,
maybe authors could also discuss evidence from high-income countries and the
effectiveness of financial incentives on improving their quality of care. I believe there
is quite a bit of evidence from high-income Asian countries.
4. Appealing to intrinsic motivation – p.7 lines 18-20: Example from reference 40
does not correspond to the statement before?
5. Discussion – p. 10-11: In this section, the authors provided some alternative
solutions to enhance effectiveness of the mentioned motivational strategies (e.g. the

default option and mobile technology), as well as limitations in interpreting the
evidence collected. Nevertheless, I expect a bit more to this section of the article –
specifically more insights or opinions provided for the readers as to how we can
consolidate the impact on quality of care from these strategies – just before closing
with Conclusion. I think this would give the central argument a stronger stance at
the end rather than just explain why we should interpret the evidence with caution.
