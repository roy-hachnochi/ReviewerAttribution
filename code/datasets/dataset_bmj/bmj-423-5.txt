The authors of the manuscript assessed the association between ultra-processed
food and risk of cardiovascular diseases in a French cohort, and reported that high
consumption of ultra-processed food was associated with a higher risk of all
cardiovascular disease outcomes. The topic is current, and the manuscript is
well-written overall, but some issues should be addressed.
Major comments:
1)
One overarching concern about the study is that ultra-processed food is a
very heterogeneous exposure. Shop bought whole grain bread for example, if I
understood correctly, would be regarded as ultra-processed, although it seems
unconvincing that it would be associated with disease risk in the same manner as
some other ultra-processed foods such as sugar sweetened beverages or processed
meat. Indeed, when the authors assessed the risk for individual foods (Appendix 7),
there was no significant association for many foods. In light of this, the results
should be interpreted with caution, and the resulting public health message is
unclear.
2)
Diet was assessed using 24 hour recalls collected within the first two years
of follow-up, and the values were averaged. This could result in a situation where
the exposure was assessed after the outcome, if the participant had an event within
the first year for example. Excluding the first two years of follow-up would therefore
seem insufficient to assess the likelihood of reverse causality, as a participant might
change their diet close to the end of the initial two year period, which would
influence their CVD risk in the few years after that. A longer exclusion (e.g. 5 years)
would appear necessary, and in my view, it would be more appropriate to show the
main results by excluding cases within the first two years, to avoid violating the
temporality principle.
3)
The NutriNet-Sante cohort consists of relatively young participants, where
CVD is perhaps less common compared to the general population? Absolute risk
estimates in addition to the currently reported relative risks would give a better
indication of the level of baseline risk as well as risk difference and population
impact.
4)
The authors reported that the proportion of unprocessed/minimally
processed foods was inversely associated with CVD risk. Could the higher risk
associated with ultra-processed food be explained by the simultaneous low
consumption of unprocessed/minimally processed food instead? Did the authors test
for a model adjusting for minimally processed food consumption?
Minor comments:
Abstract
5)
The average number of repeated 24 hour dietary record could be mentioned
in the settings and participants section.

6)
Both in the abstract, main results and tables, mean follow-up and
person-years for each outcome should be mentioned.
Methods
7)
Relevant ICD codes could be added for each outcome.
