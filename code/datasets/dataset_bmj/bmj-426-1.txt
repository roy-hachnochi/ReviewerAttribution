Thank you very much for asking me to review the manuscript BMJ.2018.045723 submitted by Astrup
et al as a response to the WHO guidelines on saturated fats and trans-fats.
The review raises the right questions and adduces good evidence to support the critique of the WHO
guidelines on dietary consumption of saturated fatty acids (SFA).
The authors correctly point out that WHOâ€™s decision to depend only on RCTs and ignore observational
studies provides for an incomplete assessment of available evidence. Even more important, the focus
on a single nutrient in isolation, without considering the matrix in which resides in a food item or the
modifying effects of the nutrients it co-exists with in that food item, is a reductionist fallacy. On the
same lines, even a single food item should not be considered in isolation, ignoring the other food
items which form part of a composite diet. Even as the importance of considering composite dietary
patterns mounts in epidemiology, a return to single nutrient assessment and advocacy is regressive.
The assessment is further suspect when only surrogate (intermediate) markers are considered,
without clear evidence on total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events,
cancer incidence and mortality and diabetes incidence.
By calling on WHO to acknowledge these short comings and review its recommendations, the article
makes a valuable contribution and merits publication. Food based dietary guidelines are needed,
based on general nutritional principles and amenable for adaptation to different national contexts.
Dietary diversity is the cardinal principle that should frame such guidelines. Difficulty in formulating
them at the global level should not lead to specific nutrient based recommendations as a convenient
path of normative guideline making. The case of SFA illustrates the frailty of such an approach.
I strongly commend the article for early publication.
