Interesting position paper on the link between saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake and cardiovascular
disease. The WHO guidelines recommending to reduce intake of SFA and to replace it with
monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are too simple. According
to the latest scientific evidences on the effects of SFA on health the type of SFA intake and also the
food matrix containing these fatty acids may be determinant of the final effects. This paper advocates
that a food based translation of the recommendations instead of reduction in SFA intake should be a
better choice.
However, these minor points should be take into account in order to improve the quality of the
manuscript.
1. Page 4, 2nd and 3rd paragraphs: Perhaps evidences linking SFA intake and health ate not robust,
but the evidences on the effects of SFA on hard end-point are statistically significant. These fact
should not be minimized. In addition, the effects of several RCT on surrogate end-points should be
quantified in order to better understand the clinical relevance of the changes observed.
2. Page 5, 1st paragraph. Explain better the relevance of the effects of SFA on apolipoprotein CIII.
3. Page 5. 2nd paragraph. The evidences from observational studies should be summarized and
should included references.
4. Page 6, 2nd paragraph. The results should included the number of eggs consumed per wk,
especially in the relationship between egg consumption and risk of diabetes mellitus.
5. Page 6, 2nd paragraph. In respect to study of Fuller et al, the duration of the intervention should
be included.
6. Page 7, 1st paragraph. The differences between "cacao" and "cocoa" should be included and the
different effects of these "two products" on health.
7. Page 7. 2nd paragraph. Butter intake should be quantified as well as the effects of these intakes in
major disease outcomes and mortality.
8. Page 7, 3rd paragraph. Explain the structural differences between SFA from diary products and
from other sources.
9. Page 9, 2nd paragraph. Include a reference in relation to the last statement.
