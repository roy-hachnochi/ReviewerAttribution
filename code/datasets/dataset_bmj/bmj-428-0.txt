Overall comments:
This piece makes the case that healthcare must re-orient its practices to focus on
determinants of health outside traditional means, such as drugs, surgeries, and
diagnostic tests and procedures. To move in this new direction the author's suggest
consideration of how best to align individual, community and planetary health.
I'd recommend the authors consider:
1) placing further emphasis on the evidence that speaks to the cost-benefit of such
actions to make clear that preventing illness is not just a moral good but a financial
one (eg
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28121775;
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-017-0014-9)
2) highlighting current prevalence and cost trends in non-communicable diseases,
especially obesity which is likely to make children in developed countries live shorter
lives than their parents, and making the point that traditional medical interventions
are both ineffective and expensive, so the only alternative is to do what the author's
suggest if we are to prevent an unmanageable healthcare crisis - both in financial
and health terms.
3) be clear about your audience - is it healthcare systems in all nations? healthcare
systems in developed nations? I ask because healthcare systems in LMIC are
unlikely to be substantial contributors to the concerns the authors raise. I see the
strongest arguments for an audience of developed nation healthcare systems. If
that's so, focus on arguments that will matter to them - that interventions that align
to the three aims will keep patients healthier and potentially save them money,
especially in places where there are national health systems (see
http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002602) or
robust accountable care organizations.
Specific comments:

p.1 L 16 I'm not sure I know what's meant by a "sustainable planet". If humans left
the earth, the planet would just be fine. Perhaps "livable" would be a better word
choice?
p. 1 L 48 "To live up to the promises" might be better worded as "to ensure the
health"
p. 1 L 50 not sure what's meant by "industrial logic" will be clear to readers.
Consider being more explicit
p. 2 L 55 350k <5yo deaths is more than malaria (400k deaths/yr ~70% under 5)
p2. 2nd para - consider specific mention of some of the SDGs most important for
healthcare to engage with
p. 3 L10 "failures to live up to" perhaps healthcare leaders will be more motivated by
a statement along the lines of "Increasingly, health care organizations of all sizes are
recognizing that they can do much more to live up to the ideal of "do no harm"
p. 4 Healthy Families NZ - This is a compelling example though I do not quite see
what it has to do with the healthcare system as customarily understood. I don't
disagree that healthcare should be broadly defined but I think readers may see this
example as not relevant to healthcare.
