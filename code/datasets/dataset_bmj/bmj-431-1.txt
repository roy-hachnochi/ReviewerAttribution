This is a well-writen paper which discussed the association of Type 2 DM and 5alpha-reductase inhibor.
There are several issues to be clarifed before accept:
(1) Table 2 showed Cox proportional hazard model results. Did the data file meet the assumption of
"proportional:?
(2)Table 3 showed the matched baseline characteristics by propensity score. We all knew that the
propensity score resolved the issue of " selection bias for the obervable variables". However, in the
obervational study, the most important issue was to resovle the unmeasured bias. If the authors could
utlize another statistical method such as instrumental variable, which could resovled the "selection on
the unobervable variables" may persuade the reviewers to beleive the present results.
