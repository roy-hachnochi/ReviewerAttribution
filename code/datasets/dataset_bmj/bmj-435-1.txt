This manuscript uses evaluations done by the IQWIG, the German HTA body, to
examine the therapeutic value of new medications (and new indications for existing
medications) that were introduced into the German market and by extension the
European market. It makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate on this
subject which has implications for how drug regulatory bodies evaluate new

medicines and even more importantly for the direction of research and development
in new medicines.
The authors draw upon IQWIGâ€™s work to show that the majority of new medicines do
not offer any major therapeutic value over existing medicines and offer some
recommendations about how that deficiency can be corrected. At present however
there is only passing reference to the international literature in this area, e.g., the
article by Kesselheim, and I think that the article could benefit by briefly citing the
other literature, e.g., the ongoing evaluations done by La revue Prescrire and some
of the other American studies.
I also have a few more specific comments:
Page 3, line 5: It is not clear what "drug use" means.
Page 4, lines 37-38: The authors need to explain further the mechanisms by which
the current trial landscape is hampering the development of new therapeutic
options.
Page 4, line 54: How is the term "breakthrough therapy" defined in the German
context?
Page 4, line 56: Providing patients with impartial information is appropriate but it
would seem to me that more is needed for them to make informed treatment
decisions, e.g., a good relationship with their doctor, knowledge of the benefit of
alternative or no treatments.
Page 5, line 29: The authors should explain the nature of these initiatives.
Page 6, line 8: The authors should acknowledge that setting goals is often a highly
politicized process.
