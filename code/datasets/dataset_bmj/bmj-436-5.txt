This is an well-written manuscript addressing an important research question on SSBs and
cancer risk. My comments are as following.
1.
Although the authors mentioned the rationale of choosing the most frequent cancers
for this paper (i.e., breast cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer), I am surprised not
including lung cancer. It might be good to show the number of cancer cases in this project,
and conduct the analysis for some other cancers. So, this paper will provide more data on
this topic.
2.
Given possible difference in the associations between certain risk factors and
colorectal cancer risk, it might be to have supplementary tables on tertile categories for
colon cancer separately for men and women, recognizing the numbers might be limited for
men.
3.
Obesity is an important issue for study on SSB and cancer. Although authors have
conducted the stratified analysis, I would have liked to see a little bit more discussion on
how results change when adjusting for obesity related variables, such as BMI.
4.
If SSB is bad, does it worthwhile considering a substitution analysis to see whether
replacing other “healthy” beverages might be a better alternative choice?
5.
Minor: would be better to show the validation study results on SSBs
6.
Minor: Table 1, the p-values I feel not that meaningful given the large sample size.
So, even subtle difference may be detected with significant p-value.
