This is a very thorough analysis of two large and unique dietary datasets. While
cross-sectinal analyses of the relationship between meat consumption and health have
shown reasonably consistent results, the ability to look at change in meat intake and
subsequent mortality adds some further strength to the observations. There are nonetheless
some limitations to the analysis and interpretation which I would like to see addressed:
Major points:
1. The possibility of unmeasured confounding, which haunts observational nutrition
epidemiology, is not mentioned. Although any covariates have been included in the analysis,
a major omission from the list is some measure of socio-economic status. Although the two
cohorts are more homogeneous in this respect than the wider population, educational
attainment or some index of wealth would be a useful addition.
2. The use of servings per day as the unit of exposure is simple but also difficult to interpret
when the serving size varies so widely between different meat items. As some diet
guidelines use grams of meat per day it would be useful if in the descriptive data the authors
could provide the weighted mean intake in grams as well as servings. the authors could also
consider displaying the results as servings per week, as a mean change of 0.15 servings per
day is harder to visualise than 1 serving per week.
3. The fact that there was little or no difference in mortality between those who reduced
meat consumption and those who did not is obscured by the replacement analysis which
must rely on the associations between intake of the replacement foods and mortality for the
positive results. Would the same results be seen for replacement of high fat, high sugar
foods by the same replacement foods? Given that the population intakes of protein probably
exceed requirements, using one protein-rich foods in this analysis is to me inappropriate:
what about replacement with vegetables or whole grains, of which consumption is likely to
be too low?
4. The association between processed meat consumption snd death from neurodegenerative
disease in women but not men (figure 2) is intriguing and needs more reflection. What kinds
of neurodegenerative diseases were most common? Could this be a result of reverse
causation, for example reduced dexterity affecting cooking skills?
Minor points
a) Page 11 line 54: given that the analysis uses serving sizes not calories per serving, I don't
think it is correct to assume that replacing serving of one food with another will be isocaloric
b) page 7 line 39-44: approx 60% of the deaths in the NHS and HPS are reported as being
due to CVD or cancer. Were all causes of death known, and if not could this information be
given? Also, in the HPS the number of deaths due to CVD and cancer are both given as1754:
is this a coincidence or a typo?
c) eTable 1 second column headline should be 'ICD-8 code'
d) eTable 2 if data is not normally distributed should the IQR not be shown with upper and
low bounds, not as a single figure?
