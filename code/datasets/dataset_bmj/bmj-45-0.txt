Thanks for making the revisions. In light of the extra clarifications made and author
responses to initial queries, I have a number of further concerns that I would like the
authors to consider.
1. Reporting Guideline: In the author’s response, they suggest that the review follows
‘PRISMA protocol’. This is unclear because PRISMA is the guideline for final reporting of
reviews but PRISMA-P is the protocol
Moher D, Shamseer L, Clarke M, Ghersi D, Liberati A, Petticrew M, Shekelle P, Stewart LA.
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P)
2015 statement. Syst Rev. 2015;4(1):1
For PRISMA, please use BMJ reference.
2. Registration: In the author’s response, they suggest the study was registered with
PROSPERO and the registration is still pending – if this is the case then this should be
followed up. However, it seems unlikely that this would take this long if the study was
registered prior to the reviews search being carried out – were attempts made to register
this study retrospectively rather than prospectively – please be transparent. My experience
is that registration can be rejected by PROSPERO if they believe much of the work has
already been completed.

3. Search Strategy: In the manuscript, the authors suggest that unpublished studies were
excluded because they may be lower in quality than published studies without peer review.
This is a strong claim - the authors need to provide some references to back this claim.
There is in fact growing evidence that there may be little difference in the quality of articles
without peer review (preprints) compared to those with peer review. The reviewers
response is also confusing because they detail ‘strategies they used to identify unpublished
studies’. So why would you look for unpublished studies then exclude them all based on
quality? If there is a protocol, surely this exclusion criteria would have been documented?
Incidentally a good review of how to search for unpublished data was published by BMJ.

4. Pg 6. Line 84. In the revision, the authors now specify that those studies that reported
on survival rather than mortality were excluded. Can the authors explain the rationale for
this? In addition, amongst the ‘effect sizes’ of interest you were including hazard ratios –
these typically correspond to survival outcome.
5. Risk of Bias Assessment: The authors originally used N-O scale which I did suggest was
OK with the suggestion ‘ROBINs’ might be a more up-to-date tool to use. The authors now
use ROBINS-I which is for interventions but they modified it for exposures. How did you do
this? The exposures tool is currently under construction but there are some preliminary
tools available for this purpose (see website).

6. Statistical methods: The authors might want to explain how and the rationale for
converting ORs, RRs and HRs from the study papers in to log RR +/- SE. Is this to obtain a
single ‘effect size’ from each study? This isn’t clear nor while you later refer to (page 8, line
134) log OR/RR/HR – have you not already converted these to the same scale?
Minor: pg 7 Line 115: >50%
Pg 8 Line 124 ‘pre-defined criteria’ – what is this criteria?
7. Results
a) Figure 1: The text suggests that 57 full text articles were potentially relevant. Figure 1
suggests this is 53. The statement about the total number of included studies also doesn’t
marry quite right. The text suggests there were 31 studies from 30 publications but Figure
1 suggests this is 30 studies (not publications). I would update the information in Figure 1
for clarity, e.g. 31 studies from 30 publications if this is correct.
b) Table 1-3: The male/female split under the sample size column is unclear, e.g. M/F 7216.
How many were M/F?
c) Table 1-3: I was also unclear what was meant by the column ‘Follow-up’
d) Table 1-3: Information in the ‘Comparison’ column needs better explaining.
e) I’ve done one spot check in the Tables. Pg 10 line 178 it is reported 16,085 CVD deaths.
If you sum the cases in Table 2 this comes to 21,748 – is this correct? Please check all
numbers in tables/text as I also believe other’s don’t match.

f) RoB assessment ‘Pg 11, line 192’. The authors report that none of the included studies
had a low RoB in all components. This is a bit misleading as about 11 studies did have an
overall RoB assessment as ‘Low’ and a ‘Low’ assessment in 6 of the 7 domains. In the other
domain, the authors report ‘No Information’
From my point in 5) do domains 3 and 4 need to relate to ‘exposure’ and not ‘intervention’
when being referred to in Supp Table 2. I would use the guidance from this reference again.
Perhaps when put into this context there is some information on the ‘change from intended
exposure’. Supp Table 2 would benefit from some information on how you arrive at the
‘overall judgement’

g) Page 11 ‘Findings from the systematic review’ : It is unclear to me which tables I need to
refer to in order to find the information being discussed. This section reports 28 studies on
the association between total protein intake and A/C mortality but Table 1 only lists 24
studies? Perhaps you can indicate in the Table results somehow in the ‘ES (95%CI)’ column
the different associations you found, e.g. demarcate ‘non-sig results’, ‘inverse association’
and ‘positive association’.
h) Pg 11, line 208. Looking at the Tables and the Forest plot together you have combined
both data from HR and RR – this is not advisable. RR are based on a single time point.
What you describe as the pooled ‘ES’ maybe seen as somewhat meaningless. Can you not
do a subgroup analysis for those that report RR and HR? Perhaps what you have currently
shown can be seen more as a sensitivity. See my point in 6 also where there is a suggestion
you may have used the raw data from the individual studies to calculate the same effect
estimate from each study. This reference might help

The approach in h) will follow on with the subsequent analysis in this paper, mainly the
dose-response analysis.
