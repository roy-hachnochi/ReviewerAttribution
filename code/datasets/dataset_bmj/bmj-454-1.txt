I read with great interest the paper on self-care interventions. The topic is timely
and important and the authors have done a nice job at disentangling the many
different facets of this topic. I think the paper provides a good overview of the
issues and does a good job at laying out a potentially useful framework. There will
need to be more evidence generation around this going forward but this paper
makes an important contribution to the discourse.
