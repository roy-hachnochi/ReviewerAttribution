This is a modelling study on the impact of sugar targets by Public Health England.
There are several areas for improvement:
-The narrative of this manuscript needs to be to be more engaging for the reader.
-Limit use of non-standard abbreviations (e.g. NDNS)
-Introduction should be shortened
-Study hypothesis not clear
-Percentages should be followed by actual numbers
-Data tables overly long and somewhat hard to read
-More details on the statistical modelling and assumptions should be presented
