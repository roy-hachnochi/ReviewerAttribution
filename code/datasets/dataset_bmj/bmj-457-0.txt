The authors have responded thoroughly to my comments. I am still concerned
about residual confounding by nutrients (e.g. saturated fat, salt), even though
the reviewers have strengthened this discussion in the manuscript. I also agree
with other reviewers who mentioned the fact that ultra-processed food covers
such a broad spectrum of foods, but it will be interesting to see further research
into neoformed compounds, contact materials, etc.
