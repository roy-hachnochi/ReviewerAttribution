The aim of the authors was to compare the different self-management models
(multi-disciplinary case-management, regularly-supported self-management and
minimally-supported self-management) and self-monitoring models, against usual care and
education to determine which are most effective at reducing healthcare utilization and
improving quality of life (QoL) in asthma, using a systematic review and network
meta-analysis (NMA).
The methodology is robust. Randomized controlled trials involving the different
self-management intervention models for asthma, including 105 RCTs with 27,767
patients. The primary outcomes include healthcare utilization (i.e. hospitalization or
emergency visit) and QoL. Summary standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95%
credible intervals (95%CrI) were estimated using Bayesian NMA with random-effects.
Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed.
Regular supported self-management was characterized by regular consultations (totalling
more than 2 hours) with a healthcare professional during the intervention period for the
purpose of reviewing the patient’s asthma status and medications. This may occur either as
a formal part of the intervention or the patients may be advised to see their own doctor on
a regular basis.
The results showed that in terms of healthcare utilization, both multi-disciplinary
case-management (SMD=-0.18, 95%CrI: -0.32 to -0.05) and regularly-supported
self-management (SMD=-0.30, 95%CrI: -0.46 to -0.15) were significantly better than
usual care. For QoL, only regularly-supported self-management (SMD = 0.54, 95% CrI:
0.11 to 0.96) showed a statistically significant increase when compared to usual care. For
trials including adolescents/children (aged 5-18 years), only regularly-supported
self-management showed statistically significant benefits (healthcare utilization:
SMD=-0.21, 95%CrI: -0.40 to -0.03; QoL: SMD=0.23, 95% CrI: 0.03 to 0.48).
Multi-disciplinary case-management (SMD=-0.32, 95%CrI: -0.50 to -0.16) and
regularly-supported-self-management (SMD=-0.32, 95%CrI: -0.53, -0.11) were most
effective at reducing healthcare utilization in patients with symptoms of severe asthma at
baseline.
The authors well discussed the biases of the analysis, and also the duration of two hours of
the intervention. It should be notes that this RSSM was developed mainly in primary care.
The main finding is that among a range of existing self-management/self-monitoring
models, ‘regular supported self-management’ should be the first-line choice for treatment
of asthma amongst adults, adolescents and children with asthma, whatever the severity of
the disease, with improvement in health care utilization and QoL.
The manuscript is well-written and I think that every practitioner should be aware of the
results of this study.
