I thank you for asking me to review this manuscript. No doubt this is a very interesting study. It has
highlighted the importance the rare types of invasive cervical cancer especially as the incidences of the
more common types are decreasing in the western countries.
HrHPV positivity was however very low in RICC compared with the common ICC and the relative
distribution of the serotypes seem to be a reversal in the more common types of ICC, could this be
attributed to the use of FFPE blocks?
Does the method of extraction lead to the reduced detection of hr HPV? It is important to clarify this with
the increasing use of the HPV vaccine, does that mean that the vaccines will be less effective in the
prevention of RICC whose relative incidence may increase because of the decreasing incidences of the
more common types?
