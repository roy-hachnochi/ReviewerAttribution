Overall this gives a useful overview of the seven nominated reports post-Ebola and the actions that
have, or have not, been taken by WHO and others in response. However, partly because of the
(short) length I find it in some respects superficial in its analysis and not entirely balanced.
Detailed comments are:
p4. Second sentence. This seems badly phrased - as the paper itself identifies three areas of
convergence and sees remarkable consensus in what went wrong and what needs to be done. So
"is unclear" possibly means "needs elucidation".
p.5. First para. I suppose everyone knows but it omits the fact that the PHEIC declaration was
unduly delayed which was one of the main criticisms of WHO performance.
p5 2nd para What are these "40 targeted examinations"? I don't see any reference to them in Ref
(1). Second sentence: What "gaps"? Gaps are not previously referred to. Is it that we "know little"
or that it has not previously been brought together like this?
p.11. I think there should be some reference to the successful Ebola vaccine trial in spite of all the
difficulties referred to, either in middle para or in the succeeding section.
p.14. Middle para. What WHO has done in revamping its emergency structure gets rather short
shrift. It remains to be seen how well it will work but the effort put into creating a structure that is
intended to work as one at the three levels of the organization meets some, but not all, the criteria
that were set out in the reports.
p.15 - first full para. This is a bit muddled. The PHEIC delay is attributable mainly to pressure from
the affected countries. The issue of financing (assessed vs voluntary) and threats to WHO's
independence is a conceptually different matter relating to WHO donors, and not specific to
emergencies.
p.15 second full para. Well the emergency programme is arguably a major institutional reform.
Best to be specific about what is meant.
p.17 Conclusion. Use of "we" - who are "we"? It should be avoided unless it clearly means the
authors - can't speak for others who may disagree. The general tenor of the conclusion is quite
negative and quite vague. Creating a mechanism that holds governments and intergovernmental
organizations to account raises a whole lot of intractable issues (and different ones for
governments and international organizations) that are simply not discussed. I would favour a more
concrete set of conclusions.
