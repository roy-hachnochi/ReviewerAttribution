The paper is well written. The statistics are also comprehensive. However, the greatest concern is that the
data from the authors' published RCT accounted for the majority of data included in this meta. Especially
when the high-biased studies were excluded, the results were very similar with that of RCT. the results of
this meta would significantly biased by their RCT. Additionally as for the final conclusion, the authors

included all kinds of fractures: fresh or old fractures, operated or nonoperated. That would result in a huge
heterogeneity, which made the results hard to explain. For instance of the operated fractures, ideal
reduction, fixation and rehabilitation plays the biggest role. the effect of ultrasound becomes little or even
negligible. while for the nonoperated chronic fractures, it may be different. The present conclusion that
ultrasound is not helpful to all the fractures is too big. it is hard to believe the orthopaedic doctors would
change their decision making.
