In one view advance care planning assumes that patients have or can generate wishes and goals that are not going to change
and that are specific enough to be used to guide their care in any of a variety of specific and unimaginable future events. The
task is therefore seen as gently and with great sensitivity ‘biopsying’ the patient to obtain these wishes and goals.
In the event, the patient must hold two hypotheticals in mind: imagine that you have lost the ability to make decisions AND
that you are so sick that decisions are needed about life-sustaining treatment.
The authors review some standardized efforts to ‘biopsy’ (MOST, POLST, TEP, UFTO), with a focus on the decision to accept or
reject an attempt at CPR, (I very much like that they make explicit that the procedure is no more than an attempt). They then
describe a new approach, RESPECT, developed by a collaboration of stakeholders.
Several barriers to making good plans are very difficult to address.
People change their minds all the time.
Professionals, family members, and as the authors note, patients themselves all underestimate how the patient will rate QoL
and what treatment will be wanted in the case of extreme illness.
Recognizing this, the US, has strict limitations on when life-sustaining treatment may be limited on the basis of an advance
directive. (If I were to say at age x “if I’m ever age x + 10 and I have become demented and dependent I wouldn’t want
treatments,” no state in the union will honor that.)
Substitute decision-makers are often needed. How they are identified and how their authority is defined varies by jurisdiction.
Panic, struggle, strife and disagreement are common in times of disaster.
I do not see that RESPECT has resolved any of these core problems.
From a practical point of view it is true that no data drive efforts to improve decision-making and that current practice requires
ACPR on many patients who are very unlikely to benefit.
There are single RCTs in NEJM (Curtis) and JAMA (Carson), however, showing harm from very sensitive discussions with
patients who are nearing death. In NEJM Weeks showed that patients receiving ‘palliative chemo’ for advanced lung and colon
cancer who had the most unrealistic expectations for cure rated the communication skills of their physicians the highest.
(Patients who knew their actual prognosis rated their physicians as poorer communicators.)
For those who are clearly able to say ‘no,’ many jurisdictions have clear paths to accomplish this effectively.
If ‘futility’ is defined in a given jurisdiction, and if ACPR (initiated after arrest, of course) meets that definition, then in many
jurisdictions it need not be provided regardless of patient/family intent.
If these conditions are not met then I don’t think we yet have the form that will make it easy to limit life-sustaining treatment.
Nor,actually, do I believe it should be easy to limit LST.
Talking about impending death can be burdensome. At line 50, the TEP, on pg 5, I’m not sure that this locution can
successfully sidestep what the dying patient must face: “… throughout their health journey.” I presume that means “during
life.”
There is another potential pitfall. The authors refer to ‘other successful initiatives’ suggesting that patients who participate in
planning, and their survivors, feel better about things. Satisfaction rates are very high in patients entering hospice, for
example. This does not show than planning leads to a less struggle-ful death. Another explanation could be that humans can
be more or less reconciled to their own death. Those at the more reconciled end are willing to plan for and able to accept
death. Those at the less reconciled end will refuse planning and may struggle against death.
Any purported evidence of benefit from advance planning initiatives should address this confounding.
