ReSPECT Form is not legally binding and is supplementary to the existing DNACPR Form currently in use by individual Trusts
(Figure 1) and does not replace it. This needs to be made clear in the text.
ReSPECT cannot be for every patient and at all ages. There is no clear guidance regarding its use unlike other studies where
similar approach was used in patients with serious illnesses or frailty. Clarity for patient selection is advised.
It is not clear if ReSPECT allows patients of different ethnicity and religions to make decisions consistent with their faith and
ensures that those decisions will be honoured in an emergency and across care transitions.
There is need for a few lines on the challenges surrounding introduction of ReSPECT. Poor completion of DNACPR Forms and
their update has been as issue which may apply to ReSPECT paperwork. There are difficulties in completing the form in the
community due to pressure on services and hence merits acknowledgement.
There is a need for a consistent national policy with a focus to make patients and general public aware that such an approach
is to allow patients “natural and dignified death”. Resources for training health care professionals to conduct shared decisionmaking discussions with patients and carers is required. Addition of this aspect to discussion is desirable.
Conclusion:
Overall this is a balanced article and should be considered for publication with minor revisions. There is pressing need for
standardising NHS policies and forms for DNACPR decision making. ReSPECT promotes person centred approach and high
standards of decision making in all care settings.
