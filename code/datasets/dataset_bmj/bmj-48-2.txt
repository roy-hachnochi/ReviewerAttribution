In this study, the authors compared five prediction models for ovarian malignancies in a
multi-centre cohort study. In addition to discrimination and calibration, the clinical utility of
the models was examined measured by the Net Benefit obtained from decision curve
analysis. The authors present a thorough examination of these outcomes including several
sensitivity analysis. The authors conclude that the ADNEX model was the best model for
discrimination between benign and malignant tumours in patients presenting with adnexal
tumours. Overall, the study is well designed and the study findings are clearly
communicated. All statistical methods undertaken and appropriate and clearly described.
1. The main conclusions state the ADNEX model was recommended – is this with or without
CA125? Can this be clarified in the abstract conclusions and what this study adds section.
Can the authors also comment on differences in results between the ADNEX models with
and without CA125. What are the advantages of collecting CA125 in addition to the other
predictors?
2. The collection of CA125 was not mandatory in all centres and missing for 53% of the
study population. Can the authors add details of how complete the CA125 data was by
centre? Was centre included in imputation model?
3. Several centres were excluded due to providing data of low quality - how was this
defined? How many centres were excluded based on low data quality only?
4. The study protocol is included as an appendix – is this information available elsewhere
online or in a repository?
5. Table 3, column is headed result, please specify what values are in this column, for
example median (IQR), n(%)
