Thank you for asking me to review the revision to the paper. The resulting changes are helpful but I was disappointed
that they chose not to explore some of the issues raised in further detail. This is particularly the case in the discussion of
the African refugee/non-refugee findings- I believe this warrants further explanation (many of which have been provided
by Reviewer 2).
I am also unsure of the use of 'psychologically traumatic' and think that a neater term is 'potentially traumatic events'.
This phrase though would benefit from more explanation, about why its use is preferable etc...
Finally, I would maybe veer away from 'famine' and use- extreme psychosocial adversity or some other catchall phrase.
Overall, the paper is a useful contribution but still requires some more information.
