Good paper presented by an excellent team with a worldwide visibility. The paper uses existing data from three US populationbased cohorts to explore the long-term effects of the intake of various potatoes preparation. Perhaps the most interesting
aspect of this paper is its direct relevance for a current public health issue in the US, namely the change allowing potatoes
replacing vegetables in food packages of nutrition programs for women and children.
Overall, few remarks on the scope, the methods, the results and the discussion as presented in the paper. A couple of thoughts
though:
- the most embarassing oart of the paper is the abscence of effect of potato chips on blood pressure, including a depressing
effect in one of the cohorts under study (participants consuming ≥4 servings/week of potato chips have a lower risk of
developing hypertension). If the association between boiled potatoes and French fries is taken as granted, thus the association
with chips is expected to be stronger. Could it be that the consumption of chips is associated with healthier meals (e.g., more
crude vegetables and fruits ?) Or, conversely, the consumption of French fries could be associated to high meat consumtion ? I
understand from the paper that the statistical methods that the effect of potatoes have been isolated, but only up to a certain
point. And I do not believe that the recent changes in oil composition (less transfat) is a good explanation.
- the large size of the database (3 millions persons-years) explains that the modest relative risks related to two potatoes
processings are strongly significant.
- there is nothing on the cost of including or excluding potato vs. vegetables. This should be briefly addressed within the
context of the current US debate.
However, this paper is wortjh to be published, also as an example of a timely analyse of existing database to intervene in a
public health decision.

11. Please ensure the paper complies with The BMJ’s style, as detailed below:
a. Title: this should include the study design eg "systematic review and meta-analysis.”
b. Abstract: Please include a structured abstract with key summary statistics, as explained below (also see
http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/types-of-article/research). For every clinical trial - and for any other registered studythe last line of the abstract must list the study registration number and the name of the register.
c. Introduction: This should cover no more than three paragraphs, focusing on the research question and your reasons for
asking it now.
d. Methods: For an intervention study the manuscript should include enough information about the intervention(s) and
comparator(s) (even if this was usual care) for reviewers and readers to understand fully what happened in the study. To
enable readers to replicate your work or implement the interventions in their own practice please also provide (uploaded as
one or more supplemental files, including video and audio files where appropriate) any relevant detailed descriptions and
materials. Alternatively, please provide in the manuscript urls to openly accessible websites where these materials can be
found.
e. Results: Please report statistical aspects of the study in line with the Statistical Analyses and Methods in the Published
Literature (SAMPL) guidelines http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/sampl/. Please include in the results
section of your structured abstract (and, of course, in the article's results section) the following terms, as appropriate:
i. For a clinical trial: Absolute event rates among experimental and control groups; RRR (relative risk reduction); NNT or NNH
(number needed to treat or harm) and its 95% confidence interval (or, if the trial is of a public health intervention, number
helped per 1000 or 100,000.)
ii. For a cohort study: Absolute event rates over time (eg 10 years) among exposed and non-exposed groups; RRR (relative
risk reduction.)
iii. For a case control study:OR (odds ratio) for strength of association between exposure and outcome.
iv. For a study of a diagnostic test: Sensitivity and specificity; PPV and NPV (positive and negative predictive values.)
v. For a systematic review and/or meta-analysis: Point estimates and confidence intervals for the main results; one or more
references for the statistical package(s) used to analyse the data, eg RevMan for a systematic review. There is no need to
provide a formal reference for a very widely used package that will be very familiar to general readers eg STATA, but please
say in the text which version you used. For articles that include explicit statements of the quality of evidence and strength of
recommendations, we prefer reporting using the GRADE system.
f. Discussion: To minimise the risk of careful explanation giving way to polemic, please write the discussion section of your
paper in a structured way. Please follow this structure: i) statement of principal findings of the study; ii) strengths and
weaknesses of the study; iii) strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies, discussing important differences in results;
iv) what your study adds (whenever possible please discuss your study in the light of relevant systematic reviews and metaanalyses); v) meaning of the study, including possible explanations and implications for clinicians and policymakers and other
researchers; vi) how your study could promote better decisions; vi) unanswered questions and future research
g. Footnotes and statements
Online and print publication: All original research in The BMJ is published with open access. Our open access policy is detailed
here: http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/forms-policies-and-checklists/copyright-open-access-andpermission-reuse. The full text online version of your article, if accepted after revision, will be the indexed citable version (full
details are at http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/about-bmj/the-bmjs-publishing-model). The print and iPad BMJ will carry an
abridged version of your article. This abridged version of the article is essentially an evidence abstract called BMJ pico, which

we would like you to write using the template downloadable at http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/bmj-pico. Publication of
research on bmj.com is definitive and is not simply interim "epublication ahead of print", so if you do not wish to abridge your
article using BMJ pico, you will be able to opt for online only publication. Please let us know if you would prefer this option. If
your article is accepted we will invite you to submit a video abstract, lasting no longer than 4 minutes, and based on the
information in your paper’s BMJ pico evidence abstract. The content and focus of the video must relate directly to the study
that has been accepted for publication by The BMJ, and should not stray beyond the data.
