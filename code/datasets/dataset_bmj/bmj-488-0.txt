Dijkstra et al have continued the follow-up of the POBASCAM randomized trial in The Nederland where all women had
both cytology and HPV DNA test at baseline, but the HPV results were blinded in the control group. Now they have
fourteen years of follow-up. For HPV negative women in the age group 39-53 years the long-term CIN3+ risk was very
low, indicating an extension of screening interval to ten years for these women. However, HPV positive, triage
negative, women have a substantial 5-years CIN3+ risk, and need follow-up before resumption to routine screening.
The claims are properly placed in the context of the previous literature. The experimental data support the claims. The
manuscript is written clearly enough that it is understandable to non-specialists. The authors have provided adequate

proof for their claims, without overselling them. The authors have treated the previous literature fairly. The paper
offers enough details of methodology so that the experiments could be reproduced.
* Originality - does the work add enough to what is already in the published literature? If so, what does it add?
This study indicates that the 10-year cancer and CIN3 risks after a negative hrHPV DNA test are similar to the
corresponding 5-year risks after negative cytology and is supportive of an interval extension to 10 years for women
39-53 years.
* Importance of work to general readers - does this work matter to clinicians, patients, teachers, or policymakers? Is a
general journal the right place for it?
The results are important for clinicians, patients and policymakers. This study supports the planned switch from
cytology based screening in The Nederland every five years for women 30-60 years (seven screening rounds with
cytology) to HPV primary screening for women 30, 35, 40, 50 and 60 years (five screening rounds with HPV-testing).
* Scientific reliability
Research Question - clearly defined and appropriately answered?
Yes.
Overall design of study - adequate ?
Yes.
Participants studied - adequately described and their conditions defined?
Yes.
Methods - adequately described? Complies with relevant reporting standard - Eg CONSORT for randomised trials ?
Ethical ?
Yes.
Results - answer the research question? Credible? Well presented?
Yes. Cumulative cancer incidences after two and three screeningrounds could be presented as percentages or per
100,000 women (0.0003 => 0.03% or 30 per 100,000 women) – page 8 line 28-40.
