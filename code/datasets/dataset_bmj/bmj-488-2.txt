The authors provide new long term outcome data of the POBASCAM randomised trial which compares efficacy of HPVbased versus cytology-based cervical cancer screening.
The results of this study are of high public health relevance since it provides evidence on crucial questions for new
cervical cancer screening policies, such as determination of the screening interval and triage of HPV+ women.
I have one major comment. The authors compare incidences of CIN2+, CIN3+ and cervical cancer in hrHPV-negative
and cytology negative baselione results in the two arms of the POBASCAM trials. However, the outcomes among HPVnegative women in the control arm and among cytology-negative women in the intervention arm are less relevant. We
suggest to provide outcomes primarily among cytology-negative women in the control arm, HPV-negative women in
the experimental arm, with co-test negative women in the experimental arm as a particular group, which provides
evidence to chose between screening policies with HPV testing alone versus contesting.
SPECICIF COMMENTS
ABSTRACT
Page 2, line 25-27
In the intervention group, women with negative cytology had a lower cancer incidence rate than those in the control
group (rate ratio 0.41; log-rank p-value 0.010), however their CIN3+ incidences were similar (rate ratio 0.87; logrank p-value 0.200).
It would be more clear if this sentence is reformulated as:
Women with negative cytology in the intervention group had a lower cancer incidence rate than those in the control
group (rate ratio 0.41; log-rank p-value 0.010), however their CIN3+ incidences were similar (rate ratio 0.87; logrank p-value 0.200).

INTRODUCTION
Page 4: line 5-8
Add a ref of a meta-analysis which pools the reduced incidence of CIN3+ and of cancer: Arbyn Vaccine 2012.
Add this ref also at line 21
Line 25: drop “therefore”. Also for simple programmes evidence is needed.
Line 41, last part of sentence
“…and in hrHPV positive, triage test-negative women”
This can be formulated more clearly as: “…and in hrHPV positive women with negative cytology ”

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Page 5
Line5-6). Sampling with Cyto-Brush only is adequate for cytology. It would be better to drop collection details since it
was described previously. A ref where technical details were described can be added.
It is not mentioned whether cytologists reading Pap smears in the intervention arm were aware of the HPV result or
not. This an important design detail that is lacking.
“At the subsequent screening round at five years, participants in both study groups were managed according to the
intervention group strategy (i.e, co-testing)”.
Sentence is not sufficiently clear. Does the word “manage” concerns only the triage or screening? Was HPV testing in
control arm offered to all women or just in triage? Was HPV testing offered to women with BMD at 2nd screening in
the control arm?
The management of screen-positives at subsequent screening rounds are mentioned but the screening methods at the
subsequent screening rounds are not mentioned.
Histology

Obviously, women with cancer were also treated but this is not mentioned.
RESULTS
Page 8 and Table 1
The values of the incidence rates would be more easily readable if expressed per 1000.
Fig 2a & b.
The risks in women who were baseline cotest negative are not displayed although in the text the readers are given the
impression that this risk is shown in the graphs. It is recommended to add the Kaplan-Meier curve for this group. The
cyto-negative group in the intervention arm and the HPV-negative group in the control are less relevant are not so
relevant (grey and green curves). A plot with three curves would be more readable and didactical: blue, purple and a
new curve for the cotest- in the intervention group. The green and grey curves could be displayed in a plot in an
appendix.

The relative decrease in incidence of CIN3+ and cancer is similar in hrHPV-negative and cyto-negative women. Provide
p value.

Give also cancer incidence ratio for women with double negative cytology triage
DISCUSSION
Page 10, line 8
The ref highlighted in the introduction could be added at line.
The authors could add a § explaining proposed intervals: 5 years for women aged 30-40, 10 years for women aged
>40year if last HPV test was negative and continued 5 year screening if last HPV test was positive. Can the authors
confirm this policy? Can the authors look for the risk for women who have before the age of 40 a positive hrHPV result
with a negative outcome and with a subsequent negative HPV screen test? This would reassure the NL policy that
these women also can be offered 10 year intervals when 40+.
In the NL the interval will be 5 years for hrHPV-negative women up to age 40. Would the authors dare to propose 10
years also in this group?
