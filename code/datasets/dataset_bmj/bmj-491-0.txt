Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. This investigation reports on a study to show that early epinephrine
administration (≤ 2 minutes after the first defibrillation) in initial shockable patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) was
common, and was associated with a decreased chance of good functional outcome. This retrospective observational study was
based on data of IHCA adult patients from the American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation Registry for
7 years. I would like to congratulate authors on a methodologically sound study, conducted well. The statistics are nicely done
and the manuscript is well referenced. However, several minor issues have to be addressed by the authors.
Minor issues:
1. Total dose of epinephrine
The difference of total dose of epinephrine between 2 cohorts (i.e., ‘Epinephrine ≤ 2 min’ and ‘no epinephrine ≤ 2 min’
cohorts) may be a crucial element associated with outcomes after IHCA (3 mg [IQR, 1–4] versus 1mg [0–3]). As the time to
return of spontaneous circulation was similar in 2 cohorts, it seems plausible that the total dose of epinephrine in patients
receiving early epinephrine cohort was higher than those not receiving early epinephrine. However, both total dose of
epinephrine and timing of receiving epinephrine may have a tremendous impact on outcomes after cardiac arrest. Therefore, I
believe that some comments for total dose of epinephrine are required.
2. Post/peri resuscitation treatment: Extracorporeal-Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (E-CPR), Targeted Temperature
Management (TTM) and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)
Post/peri resuscitation treatment, such as E-CPR, TTM and PCI, plays important role for long-term outcomes after cardiac
arrest. Therefore, more precise description regarding post/peri resuscitation treatment and comparison between 2 cohorts may
be required.

3. Table 1: Some figures in the table are incorrect.
1) Number of sex in the ‘No epinephrine’ group may be 509 (35), not 978 (65).
2) Number of history of heart failure in the ‘Epinephrine’ group may be 338 (22%), not 338 (220. This may be a simple
misprint.
4. Table 2: Some figures in the table are incorrect.
1) Number of antiarrhythmic drugs for all patients may be 412 (14), not 421 (14).
2) Number of witnessed for all patients may be 2633 (90), not 311 (10).
3) Number of VF for all patients may be 2034 (68), not 3024 (68).
5. More precise description for study cohorts in the Table 1 and 2 should be stated ‘Epinephrine ≤ 2–3 min (n = 1510)’ and ‘No
‘Epinephrine ≤ 2–3 min (n = 1464)’ instead of ‘Epinephrine ≤ 2 min (n = 1510)’ and ‘No ‘Epinephrine ≤ 2 min (n = 1464).’
6. Figure 3: Name of vertical axis
The mark before ‘2 min’ may be ‘≤ (within),’ not ‘O (bold circle).’
