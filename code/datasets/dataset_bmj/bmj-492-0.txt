The authors have addressed many of the reviewers' comments and the manuscript is significantly
improved. I still have concerns regarding some of the essential results however.
There is still an issue regrading the decision to include only studies with >1000 participants. The authors
present a very coherent argument regarding the lack of power in smaller studies, but surely the purpose of
a pooled analysis is combat issues associated with small sample size in individual studies? Selection bias
remains an issue but this is acknowledged more fully in the paper now.
My main criticism remains however, the authors make the statement:
"Thus, there is a need for a clear, concise and evidence-based list of RFs that clinicians can use,
before 16 weeks gestation, to estimate a womanâ€™s risk of PE."
Unfortunately this manuscript does not provide this as it has only assessed RFs in isolation. I appreciate
that the combination of RFs is complex but in real clinical practice, these RFs rarely exist in isolation and
therefore whilst this paper condenses an enormous amount of information, it is not clinically translatable.
This is compounded by the dichotomisation of many of the variables which wouldn't be handled in such a
way in a predictive model/risk score. I don't think therefore that the NNP calculations are that useful - or at
least the potential benefit of these calculations needs to be played down much more. The example raised
by one of the previous reviewers regarding parity and raised BMI for example is typical. In clinical practice
convincing a woman to take aspirin who has had 3 previous healthy pregnancies, just because her BMI is
above 30 is very difficult and not evidence-based - does she really have an increased risk of PE? The
authors have the power to address this with the data they have collated and I would urge them to do so to
make this a much more translatable and meaningful publication.
