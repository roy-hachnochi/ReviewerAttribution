Drs Kotecha et al investigated the efficacy and tolerability of beta-blockers by age-categories in adult women and men with
HFrEF by pooling individual patient data from 11 placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=13,883 patients). The authors found
a significant and consistent reduction in mortality and HF hospitalization in each age quartiles. Moreover, discontinuation of
therapy was similar in patients randomized to beta-blockers or placebo, even in older patients.
This is an interesting study and the paper is well-written. With the increasing elderly population in developed countries,
cardiovascular diseases such as HF is expected to increase in parallel and hence results from the present analysis is highly
relevant and timely.
I have minor comments/queries.
The authors selected an EF cut-off of 45 in their study. Both ESC (2012) and AHA/ACC (2013) guidelines recognizes the
limitation in selection of optimal EF cut-off for defining systolic heart failure. While the ESC considers EF range of 35-50 as
“grey area” suggesting that these patients “most probably have primarily mild systolic dysfunction”, the AHA/ACC states that
“EF in the range of 40% to 50% represent an intermediate group”. It may be worthy to provide a brief rationale for selecting
this cut-off.
As shown is table 2, there is an increased prevalence of ischemic HF etiology across age-quartiles. This is not surprising as
advanced age has been associated with increased ischemic heart disease. Since the authors have this valuable data, it would
be useful if the authors perform an analysis about the efficacy of beta-blockers in ischemic vs non-ischemic cardiomyopathy as
a part of their sensitivity analysis. It will be interesting to see if interaction analysis reveals any difference.
