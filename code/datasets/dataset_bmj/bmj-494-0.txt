The manuscript describes a novel approach to assess the impact of adiposity on mortality. Overall, I would
give high priority for publication.
1. The higher RRs in women compared to men are not restricted to the category of people who started
heavy, where women an average have higher BMI than men; for example in the group lean-marked
increase women have (roughly) twice excess risk compared to men for all causes of death. One explanation
is that the somatotypes seem to perform better in women than in men (see ref. 20). Alternatively, the
difference may reflect some heterogeneity in the biological of adiposity early in life between sexes. In any
case, more discussion on this issue would be welcome.
2. Similarly, the negative interaction with smoking deserves more discussion. Although it is obvious that
smoking may confound the association between BMI/somatotype and mortality across categories, it is less
clear whether confounding alone would explain the much smaller effect compared to never smokers within
BMI/somatotype categories, and why the confounding effect would be stronger in women than in men.
3. Although the paper represents an elegant epidemiologic exercise, and might inform on underlying
biologic mechanisms, its contribution to clinical practice and public health is less clear. How much does the
analysis of lifespan trajectories add to a straightforward assessment of current (i.e., adulthood) adiposity?
RRs in the category lean-marked increase do not appear (at least in men) to differ much from RRs among
those who started heavy. Should a general practitioner try to assess the trajectory of their patient
(presumably with a large amount of misclassification) rather than just measuring current BMI?
