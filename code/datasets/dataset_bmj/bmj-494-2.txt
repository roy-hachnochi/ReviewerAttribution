The authors use two large cohorts to construct five shape trajectory groups from age 5 to 50, and then
compare mortality in the diffferent groups. I have some comments on the study design, analysis and
presentation.
1. The key exposure here is the recalled somatotype at ages 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40, and the corresponding
rating at age 50 is inferred from the age 40 rating. The way this is done strikes me as clunky, based on
just the previous rating and ignoring the earlier ones. It also requires the age 40 rating to be present to
estimate the age 50 rating. Since the purpose is to represent shape over the life course it would surely be
better to use all the available shape ratings and BMI at 40 to impute the age 50 rating.
The description on page 39 implies, though does not state, that BMI was measured at ages 40 and 50:
“…we assessed the average BMI from age 47 to 53 as the BMI for age 50. We then divided BMI at these
two ages into 9 categories”. Which two ages?
“The cutoff points for each category were calculated as the median BMI of this category at age 40 plus a
constant to account for weight gain from age 40 to 50”. But why use the median as the upper cut-off,
which will misclassify half those in the group? Surely one needs cutoffs midway between the group
medians?
Also, using a single value of 1.5 kg/m2 for 10-year BMI gain ignores the fact that BMI is increasing over
time in some groups but not in others. The calculation needs to take into account all the available
information on individual trajectories.
2. Related to this, Figure 1 shows that 28% of individuals were excluded as they had “missing somatotype
data for more than two different age points”, or put more simply, fewer than 4 somatotypes. This serious
data loss strikes me as unnecessary – Figure 1 shows that the group trajectories are essentially linear
(despite the cubic fit), which means that anyone with 2 or more somatotypes could reasonably be
analysed. Even requiring a minimum of 3 ought to reduce the dropout appreciably.
3. A second data exclusion is for BMI < 18.5 kg/m2. I can see that this is meant to reduce reverse
causation, but since the whole purpose is to model BMI, it seems illogical to omit individuals whose BMI is
arbitrarily low. In any case the numbers involved are tiny and will make no difference to the results.
4. Related to point 6 above, the essential linearity of the group trajectories indicates that a simple randomslope-random-intercept model would lead to broadly the same conclusions, and the relative size of the
slope and intercept random effects in predicting mortality would quantify the importance of mean BMI
versus BMI gain.
5. Is there a way to superimpose on the group trajectories of Figure 1 the mean BMI values appearing in
Table 1? It would provide some validation of the group allocation.
6. The hazard ratios in Tables 2 and subsequently are adjusted for a string of covariates including lifestyle
factors such as physical activity, alcohol consumption and dietary score. Are these factors not on the causal
pathway, and hence should not be adjusted for? The research question involves the shape trajectories
versus mortality, which must be due at least in part to lifestyle differences – so why adjust for them if the
interest is in the trajectories themselves?
7. Table 2 shows that for deaths due to stroke in women smokers (though not in men), groups 3 and 4 are

significantly protected relative to the lean-stable group. This is surely worth a mention.
8. The interaction in Figure 2B is said to be insignificant (P = 0.46), yet the two trends look strikingly
different, and much more so than in Figures 2A and 2C. Is it correct? It’s not entirely clear what sort of
interaction has been fitted – I assume it's comparing the linear trends across shape groups in the two
diabetes groups.
