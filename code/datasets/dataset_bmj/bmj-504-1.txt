This is another post-hoc analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial, a phase III trial that investigated apixaban vs.
warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). Here, the authors aimed at analyzing the effect of
polypharmacy on risk of stroke and bleeding. In detail, the authors analyzed the correlation of the "crude"
number of concomitant medications with clinical outcomes.
The results of the analysis are not unexpected, as both ischemic and bleeding complications occurred more
often in patients treated with a higher number of concomitant medications. The efficacy results seem to be
similar to result of the original publication of the ARISTOTLE trial, while bleeding complication were similar
for apixaban and warfarin with increasing number of co-medications.
Here are my specific comments:
Was this analysis predefined in the study protocol of ARISTOTLE?
The number of co-medications seem to be a surrogate for co-morbidities/frailty, and risk scores for stroke
and/or bleeding. Explanation of the added value of this particular analysis would be important.
The definition of polypharmacy and classification based on the crude number of concomitant medications is

somehow arbitrary:
It would be interesting to have detailed information of the medications (class of drugs, reason of
prescription, etc.).
Also analysis according co-medications that inhibit p-glycoprotein and/or the CYP-syestem would be
clinically useful - instead categorizing patients according to the "crude" number of co-medications.
One limitation is that only the baseline number of co-medications was analyzed, changes during follow-up
might be relevant. However, this is a clinical trial setting and I do not expect a relevant effect of changes
during follow-up on the effects of anticoagulation on stroke prevention and bleeding.
