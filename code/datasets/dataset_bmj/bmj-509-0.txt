The paper considers the impact of HVBP and has attempted to consider the wider nuances of its impact through statistical
analysis. The paper is well written, but there are specific limitations relating to the use of three conditions which were selected
to attempt and define a correlation. The paper reflectively explores its own limitations relating to the availability of data for the
given three year period. There is also a point of consideration to be offered, that the use of renal failure as a comparator
condition interlinks with the target conditions. This is a potential area of overlap, but the paper does consider an important
area of interest. It also utilises data from a large sample and offers discussion on incentivisation and its impact on patient
mortality, as well as being timely in its selected topic area.
