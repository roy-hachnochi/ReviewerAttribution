The authors examine the impact of the HBVP on mortality. This is a retrospective evaluation using two different cohorts of
hospitals using the 100% medicare data.
The patient counts between the HBVP and non HBVP varied significantly, which could have resulted in regression to the mean
in the HBVP arm. The study could have been strengthen by a propensity matched comparison to avoid this issue. Further
statistical comparisons of the differences in hospital demographics could have been useful.
