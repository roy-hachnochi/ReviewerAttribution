The authors addressed the first two comments of my critique by making appropriate changes in the manuscript. The
third comment, on implications for clinical practice, however, does not appear to have entailed any change in the revised
manuscript. I think some of the considerations made by the authors in their response letter should be included in the
manuscript.
