Recognising the depth of the study data and analysis being discussed the following may be helpful in providing the
reader with greater clarity.
Study Objective - clarifying:
1) If the study is to compare both tests SurePath AND ThinPrep with conventional cytology.
2) If the study is to compare detection/incidence/ diagnosis of cancer by the three
methods
(CC/SP/TP)
3) The definition of “interval cancer” being after/outside a scheduled screening dates. The
wording of this sentence is not clear.
4) That the study looks at incidence and diagnosis?
5) If the study and data focuses on CIN II or all CIN (as per Table 3)
Tables referenced in text.
In the absence of patient involvement in the study and dissemination of study results to the public I would suggest
providing the Abstract in plain language.
Rational:
• The results of the study are important and relevant to women and the public.
• The importance to the individual to participate in screening programs for both
individual and population health benefit
• Individuals and the public to better understand incidence/detection does not always
equate to cancer prevention as stated in the study objective,
• Assist the community to identify when data is presented on a population basis versus
an individual basis.
• Assist the community understand variations exist in methods used in detection
and diagnosis
