The research seems to have been robustly undertaken and it does add to the pool of knowledge, so it
deserves to be published

It is of general interest to know how many people start/stop taking drugs and which sections of the
population are most likely to stop/stay stopped
It would be interesting to know why people stopped. Was it just general lack of compliance, or laziness or
did they have some of the side effects of statins that are rarely reported ?
What made the high percentage who re-started do so ? Were they threatened with dire consequences by
doctors who were missing their QOF payments, or did they just tell their doctor that they had re-started for
a quiet life ?
