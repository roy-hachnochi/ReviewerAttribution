There have probably been over a hundred studies on adherence in statin users. So the scope of this
problem is well known. Many of these studies, however, have poor methodology resulting in a wide
variation of estimates of actual adherence. This study certainly belongs to the methodological most sound
studies i have seen on this subject. The large cohort allows for the identification of several determinants for
non-adherence and in depth analysis of restart. This latter issue has been studied less often than
adherence in general. In addition the long follow-up is positive as statin use is not intended for a few years
but for a life time. Finally the fact that the authors previously published the study protocol is positive.
Detailed comments:
What this study adds and introduction: these are both not very concise and contain sections that are not
really relevant for the aim of the study, such as the lowering of the threshold for treatment with statins and
the discussion about harm-benefits of statins.
method: The methods applied to calculate adherence are generally sound. I miss a description of how the
authors dealt with medication in stock at a next prescription. Is this added to the amount of the next
prescription? Furthermore i am of the opinion that excluding patients with only one statin prescription leads
to an overestimation of adherence. The authors do however report these figure and a quick and dirty
calculation suggests that this leads to an overestimation of adherence of approximately 5%. This should
receive some attention in the discussion.
Discussion:In my opinion the authors are drawing very firm conclusions about the quality of their data:
' Our study focuses on patient issues, which is the most complex aspect, potentially involving issues
spanning physical and psychological personal characteristics, genetic and other health effects, cultural
issues and lifestyle choices' I think these issues are not really adressed as the authors do not have in depth
information on patients reasons for (dis)continuation of statins. They have only general characteristics of
which especially health/co-morbidity related issues seem properly documented. Ethnicity e.g, is not known
in more than 30% of patients whereas in 97% of those in whom its known are white (whereas
approximately 87% of the UK population is white)
Another aspect that should be adressed is the fact that CPRD data are prescribing data. Smaller studies
suggest that 5-10% of patients who receive prescriptions do not fill these in the pharmacy. So studies
using reimbursement or dispensing data may come to lower adherence estimates.
Despite all the methodological pro's of the study i do not think that the findings are really novel. Most
findings have been shown previously, all be it in studies that often were methodological less sound.
Therefore i think the study does not really coincides with the more general readership of the BMJ. Of course

statins do belong to the most widely prescribed drugs.
