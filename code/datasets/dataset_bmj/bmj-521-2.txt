The authors have done a major revision of their original analyses, with a detailed and convincing
response to all the comments raised by the reviewers.
In their revised analyses, they have done (I believe) as much as they can do with the data they
have, and have carried out a number of sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the robustness of their
findings. This is an impressive set of well reported complex analyses on a large cohort and I have no
concerns on the methodology.
Apologies to the authors for my slowness in responding.

10. Patient involvement statement (see http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/articletypes/research).
11. Please ensure the paper complies with The BMJ’s style, as detailed below:
a. Title: this should include the study design eg "systematic review and meta-analysis.”
b. Abstract: Please include a structured abstract with key summary statistics, as explained below
(also see http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/types-of-article/research). For every clinical trial and for any other registered study- the last line of the abstract must list the study registration
number and the name of the register.
c. Introduction: This should cover no more than three paragraphs, focusing on the research question
and your reasons for asking it now.
d. Methods: For an intervention study the manuscript should include enough information about the
intervention(s) and comparator(s) (even if this was usual care) for reviewers and readers to
understand fully what happened in the study. To enable readers to replicate your work or implement
the interventions in their own practice please also provide (uploaded as one or more supplemental
files, including video and audio files where appropriate) any relevant detailed descriptions and
materials. Alternatively, please provide in the manuscript urls to openly accessible websites where
these materials can be found.
e. Results: Please report statistical aspects of the study in line with the Statistical Analyses and
Methods in the Published Literature (SAMPL) guidelines http://www.equator-network.org/reportingguidelines/sampl/. Please include in the results section of your structured abstract (and, of course, in
the article's results section) the following terms, as appropriate:
i. For a clinical trial: Absolute event rates among experimental and control groups; RRR (relative risk
reduction); NNT or NNH (number needed to treat or harm) and its 95% confidence interval (or, if the
trial is of a public health intervention, number helped per 1000 or 100,000.)
ii. For a cohort study: Absolute event rates over time (eg 10 years) among exposed and nonexposed groups; RRR (relative risk reduction.)
iii. For a case control study:OR (odds ratio) for strength of association between exposure and
outcome.
iv. For a study of a diagnostic test: Sensitivity and specificity; PPV and NPV (positive and negative
predictive values.)
v. For a systematic review and/or meta-analysis: Point estimates and confidence intervals for the
main results; one or more references for the statistical package(s) used to analyse the data, eg
RevMan for a systematic review. There is no need to provide a formal reference for a very widely
used package that will be very familiar to general readers eg STATA, but please say in the text which
version you used. For articles that include explicit statements of the quality of evidence and strength
of recommendations, we prefer reporting using the GRADE system.
f. Discussion: To minimise the risk of careful explanation giving way to polemic, please write the
discussion section of your paper in a structured way. Please follow this structure: i) statement of
principal findings of the study; ii) strengths and weaknesses of the study; iii) strengths and
weaknesses in relation to other studies, discussing important differences in results; iv) what your
study adds (whenever possible please discuss your study in the light of relevant systematic reviews
and meta-analyses); v) meaning of the study, including possible explanations and implications for
clinicians and policymakers and other researchers; vi) how your study could promote better
decisions; vi) unanswered questions and future research
g. Footnotes and statements
Online and print publication: All original research in The BMJ is published with open access. Our open
access policy is detailed here: http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/forms-policiesand-checklists/copyright-open-access-and-permission-reuse. The full text online version of your
article, if accepted after revision, will be the indexed citable version (full details are at
http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/about-bmj/the-bmjs-publishing-model). The print and iPad BMJ will

carry an abridged version of your article. This abridged version of the article is essentially an
evidence abstract called BMJ pico, which we would like you to write using the template downloadable
at http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/bmj-pico. Publication of research on bmj.com is definitive
and is not simply interim "epublication ahead of print", so if you do not wish to abridge your article
using BMJ pico, you will be able to opt for online only publication. Please let us know if you would
prefer this option. If your article is accepted we will invite you to submit a video abstract, lasting no
longer than 4 minutes, and based on the information in your paper’s BMJ pico evidence abstract. The
content and focus of the video must relate directly to the study that has been accepted for
publication by The BMJ, and should not stray beyond the data.
