Manuscript ID BMJ.2016.031738 entitled "Impact of statin-related media coverage on the use of statins: an interrupted
time series analysis using UK primary care data" with Mr. Matthews as contact author.
This research article manuscript attempts to quantify how a period of intense media coverage affects initiation and
cessation of statin therapy. I find this topic very important and interesting to general medical readers.
This topic has been recently discussed in other, already published research articles, which the writers have correctly
noticed and cited. What this work adds is the use of prospectively collected, complete data from primary care database
instead of questionnaires. Also, the two negative control analyses the authors have done to exclude other variables
playing a role in this change observed, is noteworthy. Additionally, the writers have approximated the impact on public
health.
Despite well-documented benefits of statins, discontinuation of statin medication is common among primary and
secondary prevention patients. This undesirable quitting of statin therapy is likely to reduce any benefit of medication
and increase the risk of cardiovascular events. This work affords information on the impact of health stories in media on
the health behaviour of GP and/or patient. Because statin medication is common, this work matters to clinicians,
patients and policy makers. Drugs do not work if patients do not take them.
Research Question is defined clearly and answered appropriately. However, overall design of study could be even more
interesting if the study population would be described in detail. The authors assure that their database containing 6.9 %
of the UK population is broadly representative of the UK population but how about in other populations? I suggest to add
the numbers of participants (for example in figure 2) into each subgroups: age group, gender, diagnosis of DM and
especially the length of prescription, since according to previous studies the decision concerning the continuation of
statin-use is commonly made during the first year of treatment. To help comparison with previous studies, I suggest
separate analyses on new users (continuous prescription length <1 year) and others ≥ 1 year.
Participants or their conditions were not adequately described as mentioned above. The strength of this study is that is
has taken into account the CVD risk score. A major limitation of this study is its reliance on registered data only. As a
result, it is not possible to control for co-existing behaviour-related risk factors, such as, for example, obesity, smoking
and alcohol use, which could have affected the risk of discontinuation.
The interrupted time series method requires more explanations to general medical readers. Also, I find the cessation
definition to be too tight. Could the writers add references for this cut-point they have used? Additionally, according to a
previous register study, 47% of the statin discontinuers restarted medication within 1 year. Further studies are needed
to find out long-term effects of media debates.
Results are presented clearly and they answer the research question. As mentioned before, the definition of cessation
appears to be uncommon. Are statins in UK available by prescription only? This should be mentioned or described, if
not.
Conclusions are sufficiently derived from the data even though impacts on GP behaviour could be discussed more
closely. The message remains clear though. References are up to date and relevant, no glaring omissions noticed.
What this paper adds – section reflects what the paper says but I miss more deep interpretation of the clause “We also
observed a reduction in the proportion of patients having a cardiovascular disease risk score recorded, in the period after
the media coverage, suggesting other important impacts on GP and/or patient behaviour” What kind of other impacts?
Any examples or reasons?
Finally, the main document is fluent and it includes important information. It reads well and has a clear message. It
could be shortened and unnecessary repetition avoided. I suggest this paper to be accepted for publication.
