This is an interesting and important study, as the impact of the media on use of medicines, particularly statins, is a
growing concern. While there have been previous large studies of the effect of the media on statin use that have used
dispensing data, this study provides a different perspective by having access to detailed clinical information on CVD
events and CVD risk score testing, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the differential effects of the media by
primary and secondary prevention.
Overall the manuscript was well written and the methods are sound, but my main question is why didn't the authors look
at the rate of initiation/cessation during the exposure period? Looking at Figure 1, during this time there appears to be
lower than expected rates of initiation. It seems likely that if the media coverage did affect statin use, that the effect
would be greatest during the coverage, rather than afterwards. In a similar vein, why didn’t the authors separate the
post-exposure period for the initiation analysis into 6 month periods as they did for cessation? Once again, it appears
from Figure 1 that for primary prevention, initiation rates may be different in the first six months vs the second six
months (hence the finding of a significant positive trend).
I thought that it was an interesting finding that there was a drop in the proportion of patients having a recorded risk
score; thus, there is a risk that patients who would be eligible for statin therapy are not being identified. I think this is
an important finding, and if possible included in the abstract.
A few things that I think could be clarified:
1. How was an incident CVD risk score or incident CVD event defined? Could individuals have more than one “incident”
event, or did the authors use only the first observed event during the study period? Could eligible individuals appear
both in the primary prevention analysis and the secondary prevention analysis?
2. How were patients with diabetes defined?
3. Regarding the secondary prevention analysis, could patients have received their first prescription while in hospital,
and therefore not be captured by the primary care data?
4. The authors stratified the cessation analysis by length of continuous prescription, with the maximum category 4+
years. Did all patients have at least 4 years of lookback time to accurately categorise their statin use?
5. It would be useful to report some characteristics of the population (age, sex, diabetes). For instance, Figure 2 could
include the number of individuals in each category.
