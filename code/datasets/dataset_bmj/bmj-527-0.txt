This seems very relevant to patients and caregivers. We hear all the time about the implementation of
EHRs and this is a valid question - whether the "focus" of caregivers is diverted and that patients can
suffer adverse outcomes. Great concept.
Caveat: this is my first peer review so the below are largely my thoughts. This seems to be a well
designed study so I'm not sure how I can be helpful; these were just questions that came up for me.
The July effect and the weekend effect are mentioned - does their study correct for these effects? One
hospital reported a more than doubling of mortality in the five months after implementing an EHR.
(Citation 17) Their evidence seems to show that it may not have been due to the implementation of the
EHR, but the introduction of this single case doesn't fit with the overall findings of the paper, and these
effects aren't discussed. Maybe outside the scope of this paper, but these notes do seem to run counter
to the findings of their study and further explanation of "why" would be interesting. These are noted
more in the discussion I see.
I see they identified hospitals in subgroup analyses, but are there different results between their two
criteria: hospitals which implemented EHRs and hospitals which switched to a new one? As a patient, am
I better off seeking treatment at a hospital that has just implemented an EHR, or one that has just
switched vendors?
Might these results be different for different demographic patient populations? They used medicare data,
but in facilities that see largely privately insured patients, would the hospital be more or less equipped to
manage their patients and the EHR implementation? Possibly another study.
Also possibly another study, but their results beg the question of whether Epic systems are simply easier
to implement. If the 14 epic sites were implementing product from a different vendor, would the results
change? Maybe that's for marketing folks to figure out, but as a patient, I think it would be relevant to
me to know if I'm admitted to a hospital that is implementing an Epic EHR I have less to worry about
statistically than if I'm admitted to one implementing an EHR from Cerner.
Further discussion of advanced planning and clinical resiliency would be beneficial to readers planning to
implement.
I may have missed a note on geographical distribution of the hospital regions that were studied, but this
may bear mentioning in the limitation if the sites were geographically localized.
I think the first word in this sentence of the abstract should be "The": This purpose of this study was to
assess the short-term impact of inpatient EHR implementation on patient outcomes of mortality,
readmissions and adverse safety events.
