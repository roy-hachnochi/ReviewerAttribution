This manuscript makes the important point that general community measures against one respiratory
infection will probably have non-specific effects against all respiratory infections. The same
phenomenon was noted during SARS in Hong Kong in 2003, in this article:

While reductions in influenza incidence are consistent with an important impact of community
measures against COVID-19, the degree of impact may differ -- COVID-19 has a higher inherent
transmissibility (R0 of 2-3 perhaps, vs 1.3-1.5 for seasonal influenza), better survival in the
environment, and a longer natural history (incubation 5-6 days vs 1-2 for influenza). Changes in
health-care seeking behaviors or laboratory testing practices could also lead to apparent changes in
influenza incidence.
The findings are useful because many parts of the world already have influenza surveillance in place,
and can monitor this to see whether their public health measures are having an effect. If the public
health measures do not have an effect on influenza, they will probably not have an effect on
COVID-19.
