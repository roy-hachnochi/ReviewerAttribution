This is an important RCT that will contribute to a significant and most likely positive change in obstetrics'
practice. As mentioned by the authors, atobisan is becoming widely used for ECV with few if any
evidences supporting this practice.
The design is appropriate. Blinding would have been very difficult to achieve.
Power is sufficient and well supported.
Data are clearly reported.
Limitations are well addressed and conclusion are appropriate.
I would suggest to clarify two small points:
1) What do they mean by third trimester or less than 7 days vaginal bleeding? Please clarify
2) They can't speculate that the second mortality is not related with ECV without having a specific
reason for the death.
