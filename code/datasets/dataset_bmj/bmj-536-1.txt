I have re-reviewed Paul and coauthors' manuscript and believe they have made substantial improvements recommended
by the reviewers. I think it would be an important contribution to the literature for surgery versus SABR for early stage
lung cancer, and does incorporate approaches that distinguish it from previous propensity matched analyses of SABR
versus surgery. However, I have a few more comments/suggestions:
Abstract
1) The 'participants' section of the abstract states that "all patients....undergoing SABR or thoracoscopic
lobectomy"...but they have left out sublobar resection patients.
Results
1) lines 15-19 regarding your secondary analysis is confusing...I don't understand how there "were 2,253 patients
undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy (562 wedges, 92 segments, and 1,599 lobes)....did you mean thoracoscopic

resection?
2) Need to state that your 3-year CSS approached significance, the way it is written now (lines 45-56) makes it sound
like it was significant.
3) I think the findings of Appendix Table 8 should be written out into the results section. It appears as if there is room to
do so, and I think this comparison of wedges versus segmentectomies will add to the novel contribution of the
manuscript, as well as further the discussion/theme of "is it the cancer or the comorbidities that are causing the deaths
among these patients?".
Discussion
1) I think the first paragraph is a little misleading regarding the major findings of their study. The statement "CSS was
higher, however not significant" should be rephrased. I think they should comment on the OS differences, and mention
trends towards significance for the CSS, and what this may mean. Using terms like "was higher" or "tended to be higher"
suggests there was a significant difference for CSS when there was not...and to juxtapose statements like "was higher,
but not significant" is a little confusing.
Thank you for the opportunity to review this work!
