Dear Editor,
Thank you for the possibility to re-review this article about associations between alcohol consumption and fecundability.
I find the authors have responded to my prior comments very well and the paper has improved after all the revisions.
I have only few additional comments:
1) The effect estimate for spirits (>2 vs. 0 drinks) consumption is quite similar (0.85, 95% 0.61-1.17) to the estimate for
>=14 drinks vs. 0 for total use (0.82, 95% 0.60-1.12). However, the interpretations of these findings are different; total use
>=14 drinks is stated harmful, but no effect is observed for spirits use. Perhaps the authors should re-word the conclusions
regarding spirits use in a way that it also suggests harmful effects.
2) Although in the stratified analyses the groups by alcohol consumption categories were rather small in numbers, the
association was seen particularly among nulliparous women. I think this finding and possible reasoning for it should be
mentioned in the discussion. If words need to be cut, perhaps delete some of the result estimates of the other studies from the
discussion.
3) Figure 1 is very nice and indicates the harmful effects but also the impresicion of the association. I didn't find a reference to
Figure 1 in the text, which I think should be on page 13 where results related to the figure are mentioned.
