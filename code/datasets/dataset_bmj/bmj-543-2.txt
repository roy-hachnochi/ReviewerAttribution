The authors prospectively investigated the comparative effectiveness of cardiac CT and ICA in patients with suspected
CAD and atypical angina or chest pain who were clinically referred for ICA. They assessed the impact of CT on procedural
complications, diagnostic yield of ICA, length of stay, and radiation dose. The authors reached to the conclusions that in
patients with atypical symptoms suggestive of CAD requiring ICA, CT reduced minor but not major procedural
complications compared with ICA and also shortened the length of stay. CT was associated with reduced invasive
angiographies and increased diagnostic yield of this procedure but did not lower radiation exposure. However, there are
some major comments that need to be addressed.
Major comments:
1. As mentioned in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients with atypical chest pain and two positive functional tests
were excluded from further randomization. First of all, the authors should state clearly what the definition of so-called
“two positive functional tests” is. What is the functional test (treadmill test, stress CMR, stress nuclear imaging, and
stress echo)? This should be clarified since functional tests are definitely important modalities for guiding treatment.
2. As noted in figure 1, there was a big proportion of patients that have been excluded due to having two positive
functional tests (n=114, accounting for 15% of initially eligible population). As I understand, those patients were highly
likely to have obstructive CAD. This could therefore lead to the inclusion bias that the majority of patients with atypical
chest pain and obstructive CAD has already been excluded from the very first step. The overall incidence of obstructive
CAD in both groups was lower (13%) than suggested by pre-test probability (34.3%), this could be ascribed to the
reason that mentioned above. So the true population here was patients with atypical chest pain and without two positive
functional tests. Thus, I doubted that we could be able to reach the current conclusion.
3. One of the main conclusion was CT reduced minor but not major procedural complications compared with ICA and
also shortened the length of stay. It was apparently due to much less ICA performed in CTA group rather than CTA
provides anatomical details that help interventional cardiologists to avoid procedure-related complications such as
coronary dissection, perforation, stent under-expansion and et al during PCI. As mentioned above, the reason why ICA
was much less performed was a big proportion of patients with obstructive CAD has already been excluded by functional
tests. So again, I doubted the true value of CTA here that could reduce the minor procedural complications in patients
with atypical chest pain.
4. I wonder that whether there was any uninterpretable case due to compromised image quality. Please clarify.

Abstract:
Page 3, line 24, In “What this study adds”, the authors referred the cohort to patients with intermediate pretest
probability of CAD. However, according to the inclusion criteria, it should be patients with atypical chest pain that were
referred for ICA. In addition, as stated in table 1, there were a small proportion of patients with either low- or highpretest probability of CAD in both CTA and ICA groups.
Methods:
1. How many patients underwent two functional tests prior to randomization? Please clarify.
2. The authors should add the scan protocol of MR as well.
3. Was there one reader or two readers reading with consensus?
