Comments on the research paper of BMJ.2016.032983
1.Originality:
The work have added enough to what is already in the
published literature.
The study represents the first systematic assessment of both iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic injuries shortly before and after a
cancer diagnosis. As searched at PubMed of MEDLINE by the key words and the paper title has proved, up to now, there is no
report on these subjects.
what is already in the published literature:
Injury is one of the leading causes of non-cancer mortality in cancer patients. Iatrogenic injuries are common in cancer and
have been shown to increase mortality among patients with colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers. Increased risks of selfinjury, mainly suicide, and accidental death, especially during the first year after diagnosis, have also been reported among
cancer patients. The vulnerability to suicide and accidental death might be triggered by both the disease symptoms and the
overwhelming psychological stress experienced when being diagnosed with a cancer.
2.Importance of work to general readers:
This work has mattered well and timely to clinicians, patients, teachers, or policymakers. The general journal,BMJ, is the right
place for publishing it.
As the cancers have been the commonly encountered diseases by the public. Which have been causing heavy damage to public
health and their quality of life. And up to now, cancer prevention, early diagnosis and treatment have not reached to
the satisfied level. Though injury is one of the leading causes of non-cancer mortality in cancer patients.But the syndromes of
cancer patients injuries have not been paid attention to by the related classes to cure it. But, now, the work BMJ.2016.032983,
has the first systematic assessment of both iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic injuries shortly before and after a cancer diagnosis, a
nation wide study. The significant iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic injuries of cancer patients must arouse the clinicians, patients,
teachers, or policymakers to manage to make prevention and cure.While the BMJ is just the media to transmit and bring the
problem of cancer patient injuries to the table of health care classes and policymakers. Which is the important step to prevent
and cure. Since the iatrogenic injuries of cancer patients are easy to prevent and cure.
3.Scientific reliability
As the study includes the nationwide design, well developed and trustworthy data collection from national data center, large
sample size, the prospectively and independently collected information, as well as the high specificity and sensitivity of the
register-based diagnoses of cancer and injuries, greatly limiting the potential for selection and information biases. The withinindividual comparison of statistical analysis where each patient served as his or her own control further eliminated potential
influence of shared and unmeasured risk factors between cancer and injuries.
So the research question has clearly defined and appropriately answered.And the scientific reliability has reached.
4.References are up to date and relevant. Have not found any glaring omissions.
5. Abstract/summary/key messages/What this paper adds have mainly reflected accurately what the paper says.
6.The Overall design of study,Participants studied,Methods,standard,Results,Interpretation and conclusions are nearly
adequate. But need some revisions as follow:
(1). The work included740,114( eliminated 19,200 patients with incomplete information, leaving 720,901 in the final
analyses)patients with a first cancer diagnosed during 1991-2009 in Sweden. So the time period in the paper must be 19912009. While the paper some where said the research time period is during 1990-2010.
(2). In:What this study adds section:
”This is the first to systemically demonstrate the high burden of severe iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic injuries” should be
changed into: This is the first to systemically demonstrate the highly increased risks of iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic injuries.
Because the work did not research on how the financial burdens are.
(3). The title should changed into: Injuries shortly before and after a cancer diagnosis: nationwide register-based study. So in
the article, at this situation, the word “immediately” should be eliminated.
(4). The article should not use the words: Severe Injuries, simply use the word of Injuries. Because the article do not classifies
severe injuries or mild injuries. Since the inpatients care for injuries can not define as Severe Injuries.
(5). In Ascertainment of Injuries section:
“Since fatal injuries were not possible during the pre-diagnostic period given the study design, we excluded from the analyses
all fatal injuries for which a death record was identified at the time of hospital discharge.” Which is not strict. So the fatal
injuries during the pre-diagnostic period should not excluded from the analyses.
(6). There are lots of irregular words on the paper:
--In INTRODUCTION section second paragraph, “or after cancertreatment” should be “or after cancer treatment”.
--Table 2: “IatrogenicInjury” should be Iatrogenic Injury.
-- Before the conclusion section: The within-individual comparison where each patient served as his or her own control further
eliminated potential influence of shared and unmeasured riskfactors between cancer and injuries. The riskfactors should be risk
factors.
--In Non-Iatrogenic Injuries section,
“compared to thepre-diagnostic period” should be changed to compared to the pre-diagnostic period.
-- In Definitions of Time Periods section,
The Swedish Cancer Register provides little information regarding the course of cancer diagnostic process, otherthan the date
of diagnosis. “otherthan”should be in formal character form “other than”.
So I , the reviewer, advises the editors that the research paper can be accepted after authors make revisions.
With best regards!
