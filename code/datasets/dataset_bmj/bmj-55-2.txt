Overall, this is a somewhat useful paper. I see very few technical problems with it.
This paper is a bit of a laundry list of things. The authors acknowledge this is a rapid scoping of
potential impacts. That's somewhat helpful. But, it would be good to have some numbers from the
literature. (Perhaps future papers).
My specific comments are pretty minor:
page 5: "Restrictions on public transport will also prevent access to essential services for people without
a private car"
I might tone this down by saying "may also restrict access to". Clearly a restriction on public transport
will not "prevent" access to essential services for someone without a private car... but lives within
walking distance to a hospital and grocery store.

It seems increasing crime is not an issue, at least in many places in the US with data available:
