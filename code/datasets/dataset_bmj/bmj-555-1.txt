The authors’ responses are fine. Looking through the new text I noted some minor points:
1. When quoting numbers of patients per groups with some feature it is helpful also to give % as
the denominators vary – see especially foot of p11, foot of p12, and the Abstract.
2. P15: As described this isn’t really an alternative randomization approach – it’s just that those
who declined to be in the randomised trial (I don’t like “refused”) were included in cohort for
parallel follow up. This is not a new design – several studies have done this over many years.
3. I’m not keen on phrases like “reaching significance” or “approaching significance” on p11. They
reinforce the false belief that only results with P<0.05 are meaningful.
4. In addition, the text needs some subediting – I haven't commented on minor issues like the
word “survivals”.
