I read with great interest the manuscript from Gallagher et al. (BMJ.2016.033015). The authors
present an updated review and broad meta-analysis of the literature of ischaemic conditioning and
the potential effect on clinical outcomes. The manuscript is well written and the authors have used
state of the art methods including pre-specified factors analysed for potential heterogeneous
effects, assessment of quality using GRADE and tests for small study effects. However, I have one
major concern regarding the way the authors have pooled populations, settings (e.g. surgical and
non-surgical, cardiac and non-cardiac surgery) and specific modalities of ischaemic conditioning.
The authors are aware of these potential heterogeneous factors and have done subgroup analysis
and meta-regression, however, I do not believe that one can justify such pooling of clinically
markedly different settings, populations and interventions. I would definitely recommend the
authors to split up the analysis based on the clinical setting and type and time of ischaemic
conditioning, even though the power will drop, and not present an overall analysis of all included
studies, which is less clinically relevant.
Minor comments
L50/P6: The authors state that ”eligibility was not restricted on the basis of language of
publication”. In the appendix table 1 the search is limited to English language. Could you elaborate
on this?
L44/7: An explanation of the GRADE system would be highly relevant to the reader. Likewise, in
appendix table 3 – what are the definitions of the quality assessment categories.
L23/P8: how come the authors chose proportion with diabetes? Other comorbidities might be just
as relevant.
Figure 2: I would recommend the authors to add the I-square estimate in the figure (2).
