This paper examines the effect of air pollution, specifically PM10, on mortality in China. The justification for a new multicity analysis was well made.
Wind speed is not a confounder of the pollution-mortality association, because although it is associated with air pollution
is not directly associated with death (to the best of my knowledge). It may be an effect modifier by increasing
exposure.
Temperature is a potential confounder and was fitted using a spline, but with no lag. There is a well known delayed
association between temperature and death, so to fully adjust for temperature I would expect to see a lagged effect,
perhaps up to 14 to 21 days prior to exposure.
For the national effect I expected the beta slope to be a random effect with a varying effect in each city centred around a
mean effect (equation at top of page 6).
There was a focus on a binary split between results that were statistically significant or not, but I don't find this approach
useful. Also a lot of subgroup analysis were based on only cities with a statistically significant result, which is not
justified and seriously undermines generalisability. As the authors later say there is a problem with only statistically
significant studies being published, but then they make the same selection in their subgroup analysis.
Would the authors share the data if the paper were accepted?
Minor comments
- The analysis adjusted for long-term trends using year. A more elegant solution would be a smooth spline for time with
2 degrees of freedom. Using year gives disjointed estimates between the end of December and start of January, whereas
a spline allows for a gradual change in death rates.
- page 3, line 16, largest cities in terms of area or population?
- page 4, lines 9 to 21, I didn't think this detail on the DSPS was necessary
- page 4, line 52, 'obtained' not 'collected'
- page 5, line 12, there's no mention of the Poisson distribution but I assume this was used given the log link in the
regression equation
- page 6, line 43, seven degrees of freedom is very large and means that we expect the weather-death associations to
have six change points, however most studies show a U- or V-shaped association with just one change points
- page 7, line 46, the estimate in Xuzhou appears to be negative and statistically significant
- page 9, lines 27 to 41, this was a long list of numbers, it would be better to highlight a few interesting/unusual results
- page 11, line 43, 'associated' not 'correlated'
- Figure 4, missing city label for top result
- Figure 5, units needed on x and y-axis
- Figure 6, units needed on x-axis
