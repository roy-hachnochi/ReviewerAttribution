The authors assessed the associations between exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM10) and all and cardiorespiratory (CVR) mortality in 38 Chinese cities ranged from mega to medium sizes, using time-series analysis study
design. The authors derived daily PM10 concentrations from government reported air pollution index (API) in these
selected study cities with Disease Surveillance Point System (DSPS) data available, for the period between 2010/1/1 to
2013/6/30. Collectively, the study reported city-specific and pooled estimates for all and CVR mortalities associated with
increased PM10 exposures, and age and gender stratified estimates. The study rational and some of the results are of
importance, and time-series analysis is a conventional method in assessing acute effects of air pollution. However, the
analysis is largely based on the death counts collected in population within DSPS network but not city-wide, which may
only cover partial population in each study city thus may greatly bias the overall effects across cities and in the pooled
estimates. In specific, I have summarized some of the issues below:
Firstly, as reported in Table 1, the mean daily counts of total mortality were 21.8, 21.8, and 19.2 in three mega Chinese
cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, which are significantly lowered than the daily counts of total mortality
in published time-series analysis conducted in these cities (Chen et al 2012; Huang et al 2012; Tao et al 2012). As
stated in the manuscript, DSPS network covers several districts in study cities, therefore the effects in estimated in large
to medium sized cities can be biased due to underrepresented study population.
Secondly, though the pooled estimates suggested significant increases in total and CVR mortality per PM10 exposures in
this study; however, the city-specific effects were statistically significant in one third of the study cities for same day
exposure, suggesting the pooled estimates may be biased by the estimates in a few cities.
Further, the technical interpretations of study rational, novelty, and results shall be strengthened.
