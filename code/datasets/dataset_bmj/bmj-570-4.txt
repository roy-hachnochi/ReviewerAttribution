The authors assess the relationship between daily mortality and PM10 particulate pollution in 38 large Chinese cities
between 2010 and 2013. I have some comments on the analysis and presentation of the data.
1. Figure 5 shows the relationship between mortality and PM10 concentration as a quartic curve in PM10 (Equation (3)).

The simpler models (Equations (1) and (2)) assume that mortality increases linearly with PM10, i.e. that the effect on
mortality of a unit change in PM10 is the same whatever the mean value of PM10, yet Figure 5 shows that this is not the
case. The different cities, which will have different mean values of PM10, ought to have different regression slopes
depending whereabouts on the curve they are. Thus the comparisons of regression coefficients in Figures 2 and 3 are all
confounded by the mean PM10 levels in the different cities. Figure 6 confirms this relationship, as stated on page 14
”that the air pollution effects are smaller in the more polluted cities”. For this reason Equations (1) and (2) need to be
extended, perhaps by including a quadratic in PM10.
2. The models of mortality count should be fitted using Poisson regression.
3. It would be better to use random effects rather than fixed effects to summarise differences between cities.
4. The relationship between mortality and PM10 is tested at different daily lags. It is likely that a combination of lags is
the best solution, and this time series approach needs to be explored.
5. Similarly, time lags in weather conditions need to be investigated. Does adjusting for temperature adequately deal
with seasonal effects? It would be interesting to see the spline curves fitted for each weather variable.
6. Using dummy variables for year will introduce discontinuities at year end – better to use a spline of continuous time.
7. The subgroup analyses based on statistical significance should all be removed – significance is not a good basis for
focussing on particular cities and will introduce bias.
8. The presentation of the forest plots can be improved. They need to be ranked in order of effect size, which will
immediately demonstrate the largest and smallest effects. In addition, when different factors are being compared, e.g.
lag in Figure 2, or respiratory vs non-respiratory mortality in Figure 3, or age and sex in Figure 4, the different factors
need to be adjacent and grouped for each city, e.g. Guangzhou lag 0, lag 1, lag 2, etc, so that the within-city differences
are easy to see. There is no point in using different symbols to distinguish between significant and insignificant effects.
9. The text on page 9 is almost unreadable, with long lists of numbers to two decimal places. Given the width of the
confidence intervals the numbers would be sufficiently precise to one decimal place (perhaps omitting the CIs), and most
of the numbers can be omitted as they are already in the tables.
10. Coming back to Figure 5, the fitted CVR curves for the elderly and females are almost identical, whereas the curve
for males is appreciably lower. This is worthy of comment, not least because the Discussion states that there is no
significant sex effect. Is there an interaction between age and sex? Are there many more male than female deaths, so
the PM10 effect in females is downweighted? It would also be interesting to test if the impact of PM10 on mortality was
age and/or sex-specific – does PM10 have a larger impact on the elderly?
11. Table 1 gives a few summary statistics for the 38 cities, but the units are not given. Information about population
and mortality rate by age and sex, and coverage by DSPS, also needs to be added. Do give some thought about how to
rank the cities in the table – perhaps by mean PM10. Listing them alphabetically would waste information.
