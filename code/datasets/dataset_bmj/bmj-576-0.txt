Response 1: I am satisfied with this response. It is much clearer for me now what the model is
doing, and I agree that it allows patients with no values beyond baseline to still be included. I
had wrongly thought, from the description given, that baseline had also been adjusted for as a
continuous covariate as well as an outcome response. That would be wrong. But I can see that
your use of the word ‘factor’ relates to just an indicator variable, so that you can see the mean
baseline scores and contrast them with follow up scores. This is acceptable, and I am happy
now.
Response 2: again, fine, thank you.
I have no further comments, and I thank the authors for their consideration.
