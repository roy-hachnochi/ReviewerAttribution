As acknowledged by the authors, the most informative analysis is in women with a history of breast cancer. However,
that can't be listed as the 'primary' study population because that's not what the authors specified in the original
protocol. While I understand this, many of the sensitivity analyses that were done on the overall population should be
repeated in the breast cancer population; otherwise they are not as informative as they should be. I'll grant that
because the planned primary analysis was not in the most informative population, performing these sensitivity
analyses with a sensitivity analysis (women with breast cancer) makes it more challenging to write a compelling
narrative.
Nevertheless, I believe that this paper adds important evidence to the literature.
Title: I would remove the word "effect", since (lack of) effect is being inferred rather than observed.
My view is that using the term "ITT" in a non-randomized study does more harm vis-a-vis providing false reassurance
to those familiar with RCTs than it does good in using terminology familiar to those with RCTs.
Page 40, line 36: Would change "Our findings imply" to "Our findings suggest" and change "does not impair" to "may
not impair".
