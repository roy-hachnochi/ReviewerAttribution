In the present paper, the authors performed a systematic review of
trials with very large effects, followed by larger trials, to assess
whether the former provide enough evidence such that further (bigger)
trials are unnecessary.
I am not really surprised by the conclusion but I do think that these
"negative" findings are worth publishing. I particularly appreciated
the discussion. I still have a couple of comments below.
1. I don't really get the argument why the relative risk was
preferred over the odds-ratio (p.7, l 20-23). Actually I think that
both outcome measures could have been included in the systematic
review (an OR > 5 is a big effect irrespective of the frequency of
the outcome.)
2. It would be nice to have a more systemic display of the PPV for
different cutoff values, either in a table or in a graphic.
3. The authors note that "there were only rare instances where an
initial VLE in a trial from a primary outcome forest plot was
followed by a large trial" (p. 16, l. 6-9).
Do the authors think it would be worth it to perform a similar
systematic review including more outcome measures, e.g., hazard
ratio, odds-ratio > 5 or other cutoff?
4. p.13, l. 2-4, "Very forest plots assessed mortality."
Mortality is more likely assessed using survival analysis
techniques
