This study attempts to answer an important question of developing and validating a risk prediction model for VTE
occurrence in the early post-partum period. The authors have put forward a valid argument for the rationale in
developing a tool to target thromboprophylaxis at higher risk women.
The study design is an appropriate method to answer the question.
PopulationTwo large databases were utilized in the derivation and validation of the tool.
The authors importantly used a separate population to validate the risk prediction tool which improves the validity of the
decision tool.
I believe the exclusion of women with missing data i.e. birth weight was acceptable.
I understand from the previous study in Blood the authors appear to identify around 84% of the cases of VTE. Do the
authors know whether this includes patients found with aysmptomatic VTE, found on opportunistic screening.
Have the authors calculated the risk of missing around 1:7 VTE may have on the risk model.
Do the authors know how accurate their method is in identifying VTE risk in the Swedish population database?
Results
What are the confidence intervals for the sensitivity and specificity for the model? Would be helpful to understand how
precise the results are.
Would calculating likelihood ratios be useful here? e.g. LR+ 1.96 for English model and LR- 0.49
Discussion:
Though the authors state their complex model could be integrated to a user friendly calculator, still many hospital
records are not entering data into electronic patient records, so clinicians would be required to enter this data into
another system. Is another 4% improvement in sensitivity compared to simple to apply protocols be worthwhile to
identify patients with an uncommon condition, and an undefined reduction in risk associated with LMWH prescribing.
The authors state there is no significant change in PP VTE in English data suggests inadequate use, could it also not
suggest that thromboprophylaxis is not that effective in reducing symptomatic VTE?
Other comments
What is already known-targeted prophylaxis reduces risk of VTE not prevents, as events can still occur despite
thromboprophylaxis (is there any evidence prophylaxis reduces VTE in post partum period or is it extrapolated from
medical and surgical patients).
What was the rate of VTE on patients prescribed thomboprophylaxis? If significant patients were on thromboprophylaxis
does this not itself potentially affect the model by reducing risk of VTE, so when applying the prediction tool to a
peripartum patient not on prophylaxis it might underestimate the risk to the individual patient?
Could the authors demonstrate a lower rate of VTE for those patients on thromboprophylaxis who had similar risk
factors. Is it a cost-effective treatment?
What is the number needed to treat to reduce one VTE?
From the large database if there were women on LMWH what were the complication rates? as to provide true informed
consent the risks and harms both need to be understood by the patient.
