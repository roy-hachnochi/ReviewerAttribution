The authors present a robust systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical outcomes after
surgical vs transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients at low to intermediate risk of
perioperative death.
The question is important. Currently TAVI is a much hyped option for aortic stenosis and is
increasingly used in this population (which is beyond the recommended use of this intervention in
current guidelines). There is limited and heterogeneous evidence on outcomes, particularly over
the long term and particularly presented in a way that makes honest conversation about the
options feasible. This review sought to address this.
The findings are of interest. 4 trials and 3179 patients with median 2 year follow up makes this a
small to moderate sized meta-analysis. Data were extracted according to pre-specified and
registered outcomes as decided by a panel that included patients. Transfemoral TAVI showed
significant reductions in life threatening bleeding and AF (though the significance of this AF is
questionable) and small reductions in stroke and mortality. However there were large increases in
pacemaker insertion and small increases in heart failure symptoms and risk of reintervention. The
absolute and relative estimates as well as their degree of certainty are clearly presented in the
paper. Importantly, the paper shows how poorer outcomes with the transapical TAVI approach
compared to transfemoral seems to muddy the waters of many important outcomes.

The methodology and presentation of this paper appear sound. The authors correctly identify that
the main limitation is the small number of included patients and the limited length of follow up
available. There is also bias and missing data evident from the available trials and the data are of
dubious quality for those low risk patients (many of whom may not have consented to be entered
into trials).
I would make a suggestion regarding to conclusion on p18. I think it is questionable whether
younger patients would still be compelled by the apparent benefits of TAVI seen in this data. SAVR
has long term registry follow up which can easily be compared to national mortality figures to
identify the probable useful lifespan of the implanted valve (see:

This is not yet the case for TAVI and the prospect of needing repeated valve interventions as I get
older would worry me.
Of course, the first question is whether TAVI should be recommended (or offered) at all in this
population given the above uncertainty. From this data we can say there may case for older
intermediate risk patients. However for younger and low risk patients I can’t see how such activity
can be justified from the available evidence. “Clinical drift” with new and exciting interventions has
meant that we are probably providing such treatment anyway and since this is happening, these
decisions should be informed properly. As the authors begin to suggest in some places, the
appropriate option for each patient will depend not just on the patient and clinician’s assessment of
the risks presented in this review but also the individual’s level of peri-operative risk, the
appropriate valve type, the availability of transfemoral TAVI and their age. I think this warrants
further discussion either in this paper or in a linked editorial (probably taking into account other
datasets that will be published with this one).
