The present Reviewer read with interest the report by Dr Siemieniuk. The topic is of interest and
the authors made a large effort to perform it while however there appear to exist major points to
be addressed.
1) The authors conducted Transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in low and
intermediate risk patients. Overall 4 trials were included. A recent meta-analysis by Gargiulo has
been published in Annals Internal Medicine, including the same trials, where the impact of TAVI
including the analysis in low and intermediate risk patients was also explored. Furthermore aside
from RCTs the authors conducted a separate analysis of observational data, given the limited
evidence from RCTs. Therefore, while of interest, at a first look the present article while interesting
lacks of novelty and includes less amount of data and it comes later than the other meta-analysis.
2) Although meta-analyses on controversial topics or subgroups are welcome to have some
findings, it must be recognized that the value of having a meta-analysis with two studies for

certain subgroups, like in the present article, is disputable. To corroborate this consideration is that
among these two studies, one has the largest statistical weight (>90%) and the other study has
very limited influence on the meta-analytical estimate; therefore, it turns out that the metaanalysis has almost identical estimates as those derived from the original study.
3) Follow-up was quite variable across studies (3 to 24 months); this complicates the
interpretation of survival and other outcomes data. This variability can introduce unpredictable
sources of biases.
4) The authors present Kaplan curves survival estimates but no individual data have been made
available, since it was not stated to be individual data analysis throughout the manuscript;
therefore this prompts caution in interpreting these data.
Hope these comments have been useful.
