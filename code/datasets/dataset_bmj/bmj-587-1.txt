This study used data from the Fetal Growth Longitudinal Study component of the international Intergrowth
21 project to produce a standard of fundal height-for-gestational age. As with previous standards for fetal
and newborn growth produced from this project, the present chart represents a major improvement over
existing charts due to the study’s rigorous design, data collection procedures, and analytic approach. I
believe that the results from this research therefore have the potential to lead to major improvements in
screening for poor fetal growth, particularly in lower-resource settings.
Main comments
1. I agree with the decision to create a standard rather than a reference. However, given the likely link
between fetal growth restriction and preterm birth (e.g., Zeitlin et al [BJOG 2000; 107:750-58], Morken et
al [AJOG 2006; 195: 154-161], it seems surprising to use the growth of preterm births to create a
standard. Please justify why preterm infants were not excluded from a population intended to describe
‘healthy’ growth.
2. On a related note, it would also be helpful to provide a rationale as to why pregnancies with serious
post-recruitment adverse maternal conditions such as pre-eclampsia were excluded, but not pregnancies
with serious post-recruitment adverse neonatal events such as neonatal death.
3. I think it’s important to provide some comment on what thresholds of this chart should be used in the
clinical setting to identify high risk pregnancies. On reference charts, the 10th percentile has commonly
been used as a threshold to screen for growth restriction, but should the same threshold be used on a
standard given that the population has been highly selected to include only healthy pregnancies? Individual
sites or health care providers may be reluctant to adopt a new standard in the absence of guidance on how

they should be used to trigger referrals.
Minor comments
1. The case for combining anthropometric measurements from geographically diverse study sites into a
single, global chart has been made in previous work by this team, and I don’t think it needs to be repeated
in the present paper. However, some basic descriptive information on the distribution of SFH for each site
(e.g., by presenting the 3rd, 50th, and 97th centiles of SFH at term for each of the 8 sites in Table 1)
should be presented. This would help to alleviate potential concerns about meaningful between-site
differences.
2. The manuscript would benefit from discussion on the reliability of SFH measurements (i.e., inter- and
intra-observer variation) and its implications for use of the chart. Further, information on the reliability of
SFH measurements taken under the close-to-ideal circumstances of this study would be interesting. How
much intra-observer variation was there between the two SFH measurements taken at each visit? What
does this difference correspond to in terms of differences in percentiles assigned?
3. Given that the relationship between SFH and gestational age was linear, would it not be more
parsimonious to model gestational age with a linear term in a standard (multilevel) linear regression
model?
4. It would be helpful to clarify what is meant by the term ‘exact weeks’ (e.g., in the column for Gestational
Age in Table 2). I'm assuming 36 exact weeks means '36 weeks +0 days'?
5. In figure 3, suggest making the y-axis ticks & labels (currently every 5 units) correspond with those on
the x-axis (every 2 weeks' gestation) to better visualise the extent to which, e.g., 32 weeks lines up with
32 cm.
