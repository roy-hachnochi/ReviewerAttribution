This is a very good study and very nicely summarized in the manuscript.
Despite the mentioned limitations, the authors used the best available source of information to identify associations
between periconceptional use of SSRIs and specific group of CHD for certain offspring polymorphisms affecting four
known pathways leading to the respective group of CHDs (folate, homocysteine and glutathione/transulfuration
pathways). The statistical model seems to make use of all available variables that could produce a confounding effect,
but due to the complexity of the model this reviewer would recommend a separate evaluation by a statistician familiar to
the advanced methodology used in this study.
One minor comment that could strengthen the reported associations would be the information regarding the effects of
the identified polymorphisms on the functionality of the respective genes.
