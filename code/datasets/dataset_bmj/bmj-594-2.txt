As a 58 year old female patient who has undergone regular lung CT scans and CT/PET scans over
the past 12 years, due to pulmonary neuroendocrine tumours, I am very interested in the findings
of this study. In particular, in reducing the amount of radiation whilst maintaining an effective dose
for screening/diagnostic purposes, is one which all clinicians should consider for, and with their
patients. This would be relevant to other patients like myself and those caring for patients who
need to understand the risks of lung CT screening.
• I am a little surprised to see such young asymptomatic women enrolled in the original 10 year
screening study. Although clearly this paper does not deal with the protocol or ethics of the original
study, I find it difficult to imagine that there was not already evidence of younger women being at
higher risk of developing radiation cancers from high dose or repeated CT screening.
• The information in this paper is extremely technical but the discussion does offer a

recommendation to not screen younger asymptomatic women and also concludes that more
studies are required to determine optimal doses based on models that take into account an
individual patient's gender/weight/body type. In the UK I am not certain if lung CT screening
programmes have the support of the NHS or clinicians and in any case, for me, I would have not
met the criteria as I was neither a smoker in the high risk category or old enough to be enrolled.
My first solid tumour would not have been found from such screening.
• The outcomes that are being measured in the study are important to me as a patient because I
need to be informed of the risk to me of developing radiation induced lung and other major
cancers. To date this has not happened but the assumption has always been that my clinicians had
tools and data to guide them in reducing this risk as much as possible.
• As mentioned earlier I think the recommendation is particularly relevant for younger women and
despite it's technical language I do think this paper could be introduced to stimulate discussion
between patients and clinicians as it does provide some useful ways of describing and comparing
risk.
• There was no patient involvement in this study which is understandable as the study aim was to
use 10 years of data to evaluate radiation exposure and estimation of LAR of cancer. The overall
discussion however, may have benefited from patient's views and input because the information it
provides is increasingly important for informed consent.
