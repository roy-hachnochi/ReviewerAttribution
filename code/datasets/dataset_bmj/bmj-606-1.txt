I have re-reviewed this manuscript. The responses to my previous review are not fully
addressed and I have additional comments.
The authors refer to their work as a “decision model”. They conclude that restricting TKR to
patients with more severe symptoms (SF-12 PCS <35) would be the optimal scenario given
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold of $200,000. Readers, and in particular
health care decision makers and politicians, may easily misinterpret that SF-12 PCS scores
could be used to determine individual eligibility for TKR. As pointed out in my previous review
which the authors agree with, the decision to undergo surgery should be individualized and
based on patients’ individual capacity to benefit and risk of disabilities. Therefore, I would
suggest to the authors to consider changing the denotation of the model.
In the response to my previous review, the authors argue for not including costs for
productivity loss and informal care referencing two 20 years old opinion-forming articles. The
authors do not provide the rationale for not including costs for productivity loss and informal
care; they merely provide the references. The given references argue that costs for
productivity loss are included in the HRQoL estimates and also base some of the
argumentation on friction cost methodology. My understanding is that most health
economists today support the human capital methodology which as far as possible includes
all indirect and non-medical direct costs.
Table 3 is difficult to understand. There were multiple measures during 96 months. What do
the estimates refer to? Is it the average effect of TKR on the different outcome parameters
during the whole period or is it at 96 months? What is considered the preoperative value?
Since measures were taken at baseline and then at 12 month intervals up to 5 years, it is
likely that the deterioration leading to the decision to undergo surgery seen in many patients
is not captured in this cohort. Also, some surgical patients will then be measured very close
to the surgical intervention when pain and function temporarily may be bad.
The authors used imputation for missing values. This is a source of uncertainty. How
complete was the data?
As commented on in my previous review, both abstract and results section say they present
effect “effect size”:
“Quality-of-life generally improved after TKR, with small effect sizes (SF-12 Physical
Component Summary [PCS]: 1.70 [95% CI 0.26 to 3.57]; Western Ontario and McMaster
Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC]: -10.69 [95% CI -13.39 to 8.01]; and Knee injury and
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]: 9.16 [95% C 6.35 to 12.49]) becoming larger with
decreasing preoperative functional status.”
I believe the use of effect size is misleading here because I assume most readers would refer
to a standardized measure of effect size (such as Cohen’s d). This was pointed out in my
previous review as well.
The authors have not satisfactorily addressed my previous comment about other surgical
interventions (other than TKR such as osteotomies, unicompartmental knee replacement,
and arthroscopic procedures). If those were performed in any patients then costs and
outcomes need to be included in the analysis as well. They commented that this was not
within the scope of the study. However, if patients that were in the “non-surgical” group, and
they had a surgical intervention such as a unicompartmental knee or an osteotomy, then
their outcomes and cost are expected to differ from those who did not undergo any surgical
intervention.
I acknowledge they have included some/data on the use of complimentary/alternative
medicine. However, information on the mainstay of non-surgical treatment of knee
osteoarthritis is not included in the model; usage and corresponding cost data on
physiotherapy and patient education is missing. This was pointed out in my previous review.
Medication usage only covers NSAIDs, cox inhibitors, and paracetamol. Many knee OA
patients are on other medications such as opioids and glucosamine. For a comprehensive
health economic assessement I believe such medication need to be included.
Other frequently used non-surgical treatment options are intraarticular injections (such as
cortisone and viscosupplementation products). Costs and complications due to those

treatments were not accounted for here.
The authors use data from the National Joint Registry of England and Wales to estimate
revision probability. First, NJR is too young to give provide long-term revision risk estimates.
Second, revision rate data of the NJR is not validated. Thirdly, revisions does not cover all
reoperations following TKR. Costly complications and procedures/hospitalizations such as
debridement and lavage without implant exchange following an infected TKR will not be
captured within NJR.
It is not clear how the fact that WOMAC and KOOS are overlapping is dealt with in the
statistical analyses. Since KOOS is an extension out of WOMAC, it does not make sense to
include both measures in the same multivariate analysis. This issue needs to be clarified.
The response to my comment about ceiling effect refer to follow up. Many early osteoarthritis
and TKR patients hit the ceiling on many PROMs instruments, both generic and condition
specific.
The authors keep stating this is a contemporary cohort. This study reflects OA care 10 years
ago. Much advancement in non-surgical and surgical care has been made since then, with
implications on costs and outcome measures. Transferring conclusions on current knee OA
care based on these data must be done very carefully.
Despite 66 pages manuscript and more than two full working days on trying to understand
this study, I’m still confused about the methodology and how the authors came to the results
on which they build their conclusions. The study involves many uncertainties, questionable
assumptions, and obvious flaws.
I certainly agree that the increasing use of TKR is problematic. Even though the referenced
study does not support the statement from the introduction “This disproportionate increase in
TKR practice has been attributed to expanding eligibility to include less symptomatic
patients.6” I agree that this is one explanation for the increasing incidence of TKR in most
populations. However, the way forward is not to restrict patients based on PROMs cutoffs.
The methods to determine what patients will benefit substantially and when during course of
OA disease is optimal to proceed with TKR must be based on individual capacity to benefit,
risk of disutility and preferences. Decision-making tools for this purpose are desirable.
