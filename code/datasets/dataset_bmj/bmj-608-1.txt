The performance of doctors trained overseas compared to that of doctors trained in the country in which they practice - the US
or the UK in particular - is important to patients and providers alike. By comparing the outcomes of care for selected Medicare
patients treated by international medical graduates (IMGs) and those trained in the US, a picture emerges in which the IMGs
essentially performed as well and maybe even a little better than their home grown counterparts.
The study, which uses routinely collected data, is thoughtfully constructed. There is no reason to suppose that the data are
influenced at the stage of collection and coding by an awareness of the origin of the Hospitalist responsible for the care of the
patient. The statistical methods employed are appropriate and not overly elaborate, allowing the reader to understand the
logic and limitation of their application.
Given the quality of the data and the analytical methods that make allowance for many sources of variance in the outcome
data such as hospital type, level of service specialisation etc., the findings appear sound. Whether differences in outcome
might be present in other forms of illness management (psychiatry, intensive care, geriatric care) where cultural affinity may
play a more prominent role is a residual question of interest - but that would require a different study.
I found only one typo (!) and the paper is really well written. The diagrams are clear, well labelled and easy to understand. I
would recommend its acceptance without change.
