The current version of the manuscript has improved in general clarity and has corrected some incorrect
analyses that assumed independence. I believe the authors have adequately replied to reviewers’
comments. There are however some relatively minor issues that I believe still need to be addressed:
1) The use of a Composite Outcome – treatment/mortality. In the Discussion the comment regarding the
use of a composite outcome is partially adequate. It would be useful to explain if there are any
disadvantages of using a composite. Particularly since this outcome is dominated by the ‘treatment’ part as
the number of deaths are relatively few.
2) The use of Youden index to define thresholds is adequate but please can you clarify in the text if the
thresholds were identified so that the Y index was maximised?
3) From the description of the data it was not entirely clear to me that Glasgow, Odense and Trouro
provided data – those at low risk still entered information although the management of these individuals
was different to those in other centres. In the Discussion there should be a statement as to how this might
bias the results or if this is not relevant (with similar treatments being given to this group in other
centres).
4) Missing data per score is reported but it is not clear in the report how this was handled. It is mentioned
at several points in the manuscript that the authors used ‘complete case’ analysis such that only
participants with ALL SCORES were included. This needs to be re-stated in the Results, possibly using some
form of flowchart/figure to describe this.
5) Supplementary Table 5 – please provide p-values instead of stating ‘NS’ (Not Significant).
