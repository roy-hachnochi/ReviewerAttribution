This paper is to estimate PM10 effects on daily mortality and explore the heterogeneity of them in 38
cities in China. They found significant overall effects and CVD effect was greater than non-CVD effects.
Older people had a higher risk than younger people. I think most of the results were expectable from
the previous studies. One of the contribution of the paper is that they provided results of the 38-cityanalyses and meta-(regression) analysis to compare the PM10 effects related to other environmental
and factors socio-economic factors. I think the authors presented this point effectively in the
manuscript.
The authors applied pretty standard methods and the results are also expectable. The most important
contribution of the paper is that they performed direct 38-city-analyses. To improve the quality of the
paper, meta-regression analysis should be strengthened. They considered GDP, share of workers
employed on construction industry (I think this variables is somewhat unexpected. Please add some
reasons why it was included.), PM10 level, North indicator. How about other information? Meteorological
factors like mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, wind speed, environmental, industrial, and
other factors could be considered. Statistical significance is not very important, but general trends are
more important.
Iâ€™m also interested in using API. Have you tried to use it? Some results or discussions would be helpful.
