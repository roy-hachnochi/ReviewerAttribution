This is a pharmacoepidemiological study of antidepressant use in the province of Quebec. Overall I think the study is
well done and I have no major concerns about the methodology of the study. They provide detailed data on a subject
for which there is little published data with this level of information.

My only suggestion to the authors is to explicitly state why they are concerned about off label use of antidepressants.
What are the specific safety concerns related to off-label prescribing of antidepressants that they authors feel
prescribers should beware? SSRIs as a class are a safe group of medications. It makes sense clinically that citalopram
would be useful for anxiety disorder given its similarity to escitalopram, even though it does not have an indication for
anxiety, while escitalopram does. The lack of official indication status for many drugs is a reflection of the cost to apply
for official indications status, and drug companies not wanting to pay this cost when they know physicians will use their
product anyway. With the TCAs there are concerns about overdose and cardiac toxicity, but in general the doses used
for pain and migraine and a fraction of the antidepressant dose, usually in the range of 10 to 50 mg, rather than the
hundreds of milligrams used for depression. A discussion of specific safety concerns related to off-label antidepressant
use would be helpful to educate the reader.
