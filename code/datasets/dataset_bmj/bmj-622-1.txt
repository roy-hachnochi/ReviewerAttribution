The manuscript has improved markedly since my previous review. It is now much easier to read
and to follow. The definitions are much clearer and are consistent throughout. I now only have
minor comments.
1. The use of KOOS4 instead of each individual subscale is reasonable, but the reason for using
only 4 of the 5 subscales (ie, not including the ADL subscale) is not clear. Is this (ADL) subscale
not sensitive in patients with meniscal pathology?
2. Figures 1 and 2 are not visible on the PDF supplied (appear as black squares)
3. A sensitivity analysis using the definition of TT and DT from the protocol is still missing. I think
it is important to include an analysis based on the original definition in order to address criticism
of selective reporting bias.
