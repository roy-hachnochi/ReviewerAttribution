The study’s aim is to employ multiple analytical approaches to account for the healthy candidate bias
in assessing ICD effectiveness. In a later stage this could be relevant for patients and carers. At this
point however the results are not translated to general practice and further research is necessary.
The outcome suggests that ICD use is associated with a lower adjusted mortality of patients older than
81 years. But no intervention is given for today’s practice which is “expanded coverage for ICDs as
primary prevention of SCD among HF patients”. Will this lead to decreased coverage in the other age
groups until proven otherwise?
It would also be interesting from a patient perspective to take into account the disadvantages of ICD
implantation (as prevention) vs the benefits. Also the impact of the moment of implantation of ICDs
would be an interesting addition.
