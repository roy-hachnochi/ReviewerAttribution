Dear Editors,
Chen et al present work evaluating the effect of ICD on mortality in Medicare patients implanted with
ICDs during an unplanned admission.
The authors are to be congratulated on exploring this question; this situation and population
represents an increasing fraction in "real world" ICD implants, and has not been addressed in clinical
trials. Within limits (acknowledged by the authors), the results demonstrate a lack of benefit from
ICDs implanted in older patients during unplanned admissions.
The study population, "control groups", methods statistical analyses and conclusions are valid and
applicable to the question being asked. The only caveat I have is the noninclusion of CRT (a substantial
minority), as the mechanisms of benefit may be different.

Limitations aside, this work forms a solid basis for further inquiry and builds on the authors prior
work.
Thank you
Ravi Ramani
