Methods
The authors state that "Participants in both groups were prescribed multi-modal
analgesia in addition,
including paracetamol and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (unless
contraindicated)"....Please add details about additional analgesics in each group.
Results:
1. Table 1: please add the p-value of the difference between the groups, for example
in the baseline mean VAS score (4.5 vs 5.5) is it statistically significant difference?
2. Do you have data regarding nosea and vomiting? please add.

Discussion
In summary, patients that received higher dose of mo had better pain relief (some of
them had lower VAS to begin with). This is to be expected. The PCA enabled the higher
doses.
"This study found that PCA provided more effective analgesia than routine care in
emergency patients who are admitted to hospital with abdominal pain....." please add:
by administering higher dose of mo.
