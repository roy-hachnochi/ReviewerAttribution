Pain and its control is of the greatest importance to patients. As a sign of current or
developing heath problems it is a key factor in prompting patients to seek medical
attention. It is widely understood among the general population that good, effective
tools (drugs, etc.) for the relief of many kinds of pain are available, so expectancy for
relief is high. Optimising use of these tools clearly makes sense as part of good clinical
care and to enhance patient comfort and satisfaction. The best patient care often
results from patient and clinician working in partnership with professional staff
relinquishing some of their authority to better meet the patient's perceived needs.
Wherever possible, patients should be given the opportunity of choice in treatments,
although for some patients (those who are gravely ill or uncomfortable in making
decisions) this might inflict an additional burden and they would prefer to have their
health managed entirely by experts.
This study, where participants are randomised to one arm where standard treatment is
applied (TAU group) or to another which permits a measure of personal control in their
own therapy (PCA group), in some ways reflects this no choice/choice scenario, albeit
group allocation was imposed by the researchers. What is gratifying in the outcome is
that where partial patient control was exercised, pain relief appears to have been
superior and patient satisfaction higher. More analgesic was used by the PCA group
which could be a downside. There are several possible reasons for the favourable
reaction in the PCA patients which are not discussed but which may include a feeling of
"ownership" in the intervention and of satisfaction that they had contributed personally
to their treatment.
No overt statement in the text is made to the role, if any, of patient/public/carer input
to the development, etc of the project, but perhaps this is made in the separate
protocol paper (no. 22 in ref. list)?
