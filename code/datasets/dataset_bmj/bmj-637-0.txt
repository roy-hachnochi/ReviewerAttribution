This is a well-written nationwide study with compete data on hospitalizations and drug
exposures aiming to evaluate the potential excess risk of serious infections in patients
with IBD during the first year of treatment with anti-TNF agents. The authors conclude
with an optimized methodology to an increased risk of overall serious infections within
the first 90 days following treatment initiation.
Major remarks
1. Anti-TNF agents are initiated in patients with IBD when IBD is uncontrolled. This
period is intrinsically associated with a markedly increased risk for intestinal infections
(peritonitis, abscesses originating form uncontrolled intestinal lesions), general sepsis
(originating from deep vein catheters for instance). In addition, the inflammatory and
undernutrition state together with the use corticosteroids (that independently promote
infections) are very frequent during this period and may worsen substantially the
potential properc effect of anti-TNF agents on the infection risk, even after adjustment
for steroid use. Therefore, it would be more prudent to entitle the article “increased
risk of serious infection during the first 90 days of exposure to anti-TNF agents” rather

than “association between TNF….”
2. The true definition of a serious infection is an infection that can kill the patient. In
this context, restricting the study to infections that require hospitalization is a very
good surrogate marker because it is very unlikely in western countries to dye from
infection without prior hospitalization. This could be introduced or discussed
somewhere
3. The risk of serious infection under anti-TNF therapy beyond the 3-month period of
treatment induction is an independent important question for clinicians, with less
expected biases due to the initial period of IBD activity. The 365-period includes the
90-day period and cannot fully address this point. Have you the possibility in your
population to assess the risk of serious infection during the second year of treatment?
If so, we would also be happy to know the number of patients needed to be enrolled in
the cohort to be adequately powered for detecting a 1.2, 1.5 or 2.0 adjusted HR
compared to patients non exposed to anti-TNF.
Minor remarks
1. What about cases of death by infection in the study population?
2. It is unclear whether the Danish Drug Prescription Registry excludes the
prescriptions of infliximab
3. Introduction: It is unfair to state that serious infections are not properly recorded in
randomized controlled trials. The point is that it is not possible distinguish in RCT
reports between infections due to uncontrolled intestinal lesions and inflammation due
to IBD ,and infections directly promoted by the anti-TNF agents, like in the present
study
4. Could the trend towards the female predominance for infections be explained by an
excess of urinary and gynecological infections? What about a sensitivity analysis
excluding these infections?
5. Are day-hospitalizations for routine infusion of anti-TNF excluded from the analysis
of care-consumption confounders?
6. Table 1, subheading ‘IBD medications’. The legend seems inappropriate
