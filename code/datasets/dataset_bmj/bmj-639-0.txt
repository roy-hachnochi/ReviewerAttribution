This is an excellent revision. I only have a few further comments:
Hazard ratios relate to the whole follow-up period, and yet in various
places (especially the abstract) the authors infer it is time-point specific
(‘… with mesh has a higher chance of having a re-intervention (HR 1.47,
1.21 to 1.79) at one year...). In other words, it does not relate to just
one year, but also at all times up to one year. Please address this
throughout by changing the language (e.g. could say: throughout the
first year, patients with mesh had an increased risk ….). If the authors
want to report a comparison at a particular time-point, then the different
in survival % at one year between the matched groups is more pertinent.
I suggest this is also added, as derived from Figure 2B.
Abstract should detail the matching factors used in the propensity score
approach (i.e. detail the confounders adjusted for)

My biggest issue: the authors do not discuss any other potential
confounders that may still be affecting their results, in their Discussion.
The HR is attenuated from the unadjusted analysis to the propensity
score analysis – could additional confounders attenuate it further? This
needs serious discussion and thought.
Best wishes, Richard
