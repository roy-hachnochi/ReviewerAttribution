Thank you for providing me with an opportunity to re-read this manuscript. As initially noted
this is a rigorously conducted meta-analysis, on an interesting topic which is gaining interest
from both researcher and the public alike.
The manuscript now demonstrates much more clarity ; the methods have greater transparency
and the results are well presented. The additional information regarding confounding variables
and acknowledgement of limitations provides a well-balanced and comprehensive article. The
accuracy and attention to detail has been greatly improved, making the manuscript a pleasure
to review. I believe the research will be of interest to the BMJ readership
