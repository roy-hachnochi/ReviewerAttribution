I start by saying that the PDF of the submitted article (which I used for my review below initially)
does not seem to match the track changes version of the submission (labelled v2 in the
supplementary material). That is, the PDF version does not contain most (perhaps any) of the
changes highlighted in yellow. I’m not sure what has gone on there, but I spent 2 hours going
through the PDF version and only at the end, when looking through the supplementary material,
did I identify this discrepancy. I therefore do not know which version is right for me to be
reviewing! However, I have checked whether the track changes version addresses my concerns,
and it does not. Therefore, I think my comments below still stand.
Following the response to comments, it is interesting to see that the odds of immediate death (on
day of birth) are larger at weekends than during the week. But this information is only given in
the response to comments, and I can’t see it detailed in the actual article! This is one of a few
examples of where the authors have only gone part of the way to addressing my comments. No
propensity score analysis was done; it’s still not clear how missing data was handled (not multiple
imputation it seems); and clustering multiple babies from the same woman is still not accounted
for. As mentioned, the reporting of the methods is still not adequate – for example, even though
they respond to the comments, they have not always revised the paper in the same way (e.g.
details about missing data and clustering are still missing in the paper) Therefore, I am not
convinced the article is robust enough for the BMJ as it stands. I’m sorry to say that. I suggest
further revisions and clarification are still needed:
1) The authors say that missing data was handled by the regression analysis, but it is not clear
how. They say in their response:
“Missing data is not a significant problem in HES data due to the coding process and rules. For
some variables, there are “unknown” responses which are accounted for the regression model.
The extent of “unknown” values is given in Table 2. As described above, coding practice is not
influenced the day of admission/birth so missing values are not likely to bias the results”
Was ‘missing’ given its own category? Would the results be different if a multiple imputation
approach was used? We need to know for robustness. I searched the article for ‘missing’ and
can’t see anything.
2) The authors still do not do a propensity score analysis, which is a real shame as I still feel the
paper would be far stronger as a result. They say: ‘We did not undertake propensity score
analysis but did validate the key results by using alternative methodological approaches (e.g.
difference case-mix adjustment and use of hierarchical models). Such analysis would not address
the limitation of residual confounding bias.’
I agree that a propensity score model won’t solve the issue of potential residual confounding, but
when matched propensity score analysis is done, the adjustment for confounding is less prone to

influence of extreme individuals (i.e. those can’t be matched) in one of the groups than the
regression models used. I think I would, at the very least, note the potential to consider
propensity score analyses in the future for this type of study, and to explain why you did not do
this.
3) I do not understand why an analysis that accounts for clustering of multiple babies for the
same woman does not converge. The authors infer this is due to such woman only being 2.9% of
the total number. However, this still represents 36,679 babies, which is enormous. Is it because
there are so few events in this set of babies? We need an explanation, and full details in the
paper that you tried to do this but it did not work, as otherwise the paper could be severely
criticised.
4) Please present the unadjusted odds ratios in the table; it is only one additional column and it is
not clear, as it stands, whether the ORs presented are unadjusted or adjusted anyway.
5) The immediate deaths analysis is important and should be reported in the paper, surely? Or
am I missing it somewhere? Otherwise, if death occurs 3 days later, then how do we know it was
due to being born on a Saturday or something that happened on the Monday? The immediate
death is therefore more pertinent.
6) The abstract conclusion infers causality – there is no mention of the potential for residual
confounding. I am disappointed by this, as in their response the authors clearly say that they
have noted the limitations of their work more clearly now; yet this is not evident here.
7) What this study adds says that the paper gives the ‘most comprehensive evaluation …’ – but
with no accounting for clustering, no propensity score analysis, no multiple imputation of missing
values, etc I can’t agree with this statement. Please tone down.
8) The abstract says that 750 and 450 perinatal and maternal deaths extra occur at the weekend:
but over what period? One year? Each weekend? Please be absolutely clear, and give confidence
intervals for these pivotal numbers. And be clear what the population size these numbers relate
to. 750 extra deaths out of how many total deaths, in a population of size of …
9) I am still unclear, and I think the methods are still unclear in the paper, how events were
defined in relation to the day of the week. So if a woman was admitted on a Saturday but had the
event on a Tuesday, is this classed as a week day event? I think it is, but it needs to be explicitly
stated.
10) Further, another important issue that I think is unresolved. Please clarify how the days prior
to the event are accounted for (if at all). For example, could the authors count for each individual
how many weekend days they were exposed to? Then, they could look at including the number of
weekend days as a covariate in a model, and (After adjustment for other things) ascertain
whether there is an association between the number of weekend days of exposure and the rate of
event.
This is interesting for two reasons:
(i) it is another way to examine if there is an indication that weekend care is having a negative
impact on the whole (not just on the day of delivery itself).
(ii) it may be that, after you adjust for the number of days exposed to weekend care, that the
effect of the actual day of delivery disappears. Or it could be that both day of delivery and the
number of exposure days are important, which would be revealing.
11) The analysis described as follows it not clear enough to me still: ‘Using regression analysis on
just the reference days (Tuesdays), probabilities of in-hospital perinatal death and puerperal
infections (maternal) were derived. By matching these probabilities for each Tuesday admission,
based on the mother’s or neonate’s characteristics, indirectly standardised estimates for the
outcomes as if those non-Tuesday cases had had similar rates as their Tuesday counterparts were
calculated.’
- How was matching done? How close did the probability have to be in order to be matched? Was
the matching random?
- For deriving the predictions, what covariates were included? How were missing values dealt
with?
- Indirectly standardises estimates … of what? Odds ratios? Proportions? And How were they
derived?
12) “The most common day for giving birth is a Thursday (15%...)” – can we have a CI please for
this estimate, otherwise this is just an observation. The CI should be very narrow given the large
sample size.
13) “Much of the difference is explained by number of elective …’ – please refer to the figure
where this is apparent
14) In their responses, the authors make the important statement that immediate death is also
higher in those born at weekends. But
15) The discussion says that the estimates of weekend effect are likely to be an underestimate – I
don’t see the justification for this at all. Residual confounding is one reason why it may be an

overestimate.
16) Throughout the article, the authors use ‘rate’ when they really mean % or proportion. A rate
is the number of events per period of time. Here though they look at the % with an event BY one
time-point (e.g. by 3 days).
I'm sorry to be so negative, but these are all genuinely important concerns and areas of worry for
me. I sincerely hope these comments help improve the robustness and interpretation of the
article moving forward.
