BMJ H7N9 nosocomial transmission
Dr. Fang et al described the first possible nosocomial transmission of H7N9 virus infection through
detailed epidemiological and laboratory investigation, which is of interesting to further understand the
transmission and evolution characteristics of the emerging virus. However, some major issues need to be
addressed before drawing above-mentioned conclusion.
1. The other route of infection rather than nosocomial transmission should be excluded. There was case
with H7N9 virus infection whose incubation period may be longer for up to 12days. Therefore, the daily
activities of the second patient should be investigated carefully. For example, where did the second
patient eat? In hospital (the food prepared by the hospital or prepared by his wife at home and then took
to the hospital), or outside in caf√© near the hospital? As for the exposure history of the second patient,
the interviewee was the second patient himself, his family member, doctors and nurses, or other persons
should be clarified. Were there any live poultries, especially free-range chickens or ducks, in the village
the second patient lived? Did he have any outside activities during his hospitalization in hospital A?
2. From the epidemiological perspective, the fundamental cause of the second patient was admitted to
hospital A was unclear. The aggravated COPD and bronchitis may be due to virus infection because the
blood testing showed a normal WBC counts and a slight increased CRP (47.1 mg/L). Unfortunately, no
pathogenic testing was conducted during his first hospitalization. When he was admitted to hospital D,
the blood testing showed a very elevated WBC counts with obvious left shift of neutrophils, which may be
due to a subsequent bacterial infection. The laboratory testing result for pathogen showed that only virus
RNA could be detected while virus was not able to be cultured successfully before the oseltamivir
treatment, which implied that the virus load of the second patient was very low. This meant that the
patient may be with an advanced stage of illness course.
3. The second patient developed fever on February 24th. His throat swab sample was collected on
February 25th. The testing result of the sample was positive for H7N9 using qRT-PCR. However, no virus
was cultured from the patient especially under the condition that the products of PCR were able to be
sequenced. Meanwhile, no blood sample was collected. However, the blood samples were collected from
a doctor and a nurse who also were considered the close contacts of the index patients. How to explain
these obvious nontraditional situations and incomprehensible shortcomings?
4. With regard to the identity of virus from the two patients, it was not enough just to compare the
genetic sequence of the two patients. Control virus stains which isolated at the time of February 2015
and from local patients and affected live poultry market or their environment is needed. In addition, it
was better to list the similarity both nucleotide and amino acid between the two patients.
5. According to the description, we have reasons to believe that the suspected infection with H7N9 virus
of the doctor and nurse who were considered as the close contact of the index patient was ruled out.
First, the HI titer of the doctor reached 1:40 the first day he developed symptom as the time interval is
too short for antibody generation. Second, it was impossible for the HI antibodies to disappear in five
days later. The probable reasons for these were due to the cross-reaction or poor laboratorial testing
techniques.
6. It was not convincing to share the same ward as the possible infection route of the second patient
provided that he acquired his infection from the index patient. A more detailed investigation was needed
to find out whether they shared common medical equipment.
7. Please give the definition of close contacts
8. Both the binding specificity of H7N9 virus (Figure 3) and the key mutations associated with virulence
and mammalian adaption (The Table) 2had been had been demonstrated in previous studies. There is no
distinctiveness for these three viruses from other isolated strains of H7N9.
9. I could not fully understand the second sentence in page 13. Maybe some important words were
missed.
10. There were some errors in Table 1.
