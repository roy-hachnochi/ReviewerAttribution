Originality and Importance of work to general readers
The review summarises a huge amount of data from a geographically wide area and over a span of many
years and assesses the effects of interventions widely used and with potential public health implications.
Given its potential impact, it should matter to the general reader.
The review will provide important information for identifying the future research questions, but I think
the review could do so much more strongly than it does now.
Research Question - clearly defined and appropriately answered?
I thought the research question is clearly defined (to evaluate the non-specific and all-cause effects of
BCG, DTP and MV) – but the interpretation that the effect of DTP could not be assessed because it is
almost always co-administered with OPV, seems to indicate that it should have been clearer. The
observations made by our group and the hypotheses formulated in 2007 (Fine PE. 'Non-specific effects of
vaccines'--an important analytical insight, and call for a workshop. Trop Med Int Health 2007; 12(1): 14.) are based on DTP +/- OPV. The data points available and the question which can be assessed is
DTP+/-OPV, and that should be assessed.
The secondary questions: “to examine any modifying effects of sex, age at vaccination, sequence in
which vaccines are given, and prior or coadministration of vitamin A” receive little attention in the
presentation and I have struggled to assess whether these questions are appropriately answered. For the
sex-differential effects I do not understand the rationale for looking at merely at vaccine estimates in
girls versus the same estimates in boys, thereby excluding studies which have reported the female-male
mortality ratio among children by the most recent vaccine.
Scientific reliability
Design and Participants studied
The organisation of the data into birth cohorts to have independent observations has clearly been a
difficult exercise. I have below pointed out a couple of places where I believe that papers have been
grouped wrongly together.
Methods - adequately described?
The algorithm for selecting the estimates is described and the estimates presented for the three vaccines
– but not for interactions and sequence of vaccines analysis.
Results - answer the research question?
Clear presentation of the main results in the text, but not in the abstract (see below).
The results for the analysis of effect modification (details below) could be clearer (see specific comments
below).
For the specific data points extracted, the direction of bias is not presented/discussed, but would mostly
serve to dismiss a result. However, there are many examples where the bias would lead to presenting
more conservative estimates, and in these instances I think it should be emphasised that the bias does
not explain away a finding. For example, on page 65, it is reported that there is high risk of bias due to
retrospective collection of vaccination data. I presume that this means that a child surviving is more
likely to have a vaccine registered and therefore that any vaccine would be associated with a beneficial

effect.
Interpretation and conclusions
A preliminary report which has summarised the review has been available online since April 2014. When
comparing the results from the review previously made available, there is a general down toning of the
results. The previously published review it was presented that there was consistent evidence of beneficial
effects of BCG and MV: “The results indicated a beneficial effect of BCG on overall mortality in the first 612 months of life” and “There was consistent evidence of a beneficial effect of measles vaccine, although
all observational studies were assessed as being at risk of bias and the GRADE rating was of low
confidence”. In the previous version the contrast to the description of the DTP results: “The findings were
inconsistent, with a majority of the studies indicating a detrimental effect of DTP, and two studies
indicating a beneficial effect.” With the present wording the contrasting results between the live BCG and
MV and the inactivated DTP vaccine does not convey this results. “There is insufficient evidence to draw
firm conclusions about the effect of DTP vaccine on all-cause mortality, in part because it was almost
always administered with oral polio vaccine.” The abstract therefore does not convey the picture of the
opposite effects of the vaccines which is shown in the results section:
BCG: “The clinical trial results, including two from low birth weight infants and two in native American
children in the 1930s and 40s, suggested a beneficial effect of BCG on mortality (average RR 0.70; 95%
CI 0.49 to 1.01). The average for the nine observational studies (follow-up mostly within the first year of
life) was RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.69; inconsistency (I2) = 63%, although all these studies were
considered at high risk of bias.”
DTP: “The majority of studies indicated a potential deleterious effect of DTP on mortality, and three
individual results had 95% confidence intervals that excluded no effect (one beneficial, two harmful). The
average effect was RR 1.38 (95% CI 0.92 to 2.08).”
MV: “Directions of effect in these trials, as well as a fourth clinical trial in Nigeria, pointed towards a
beneficial effect of measles containing vaccine (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.07; I2 = 0%). The 18
observational studies that were not excluded consistently estimated the effect of measles-containing
vaccine on mortality within the first 2–5 years of life to be beneficial, with average halving of mortality
risk (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.63; I2 = 62%).”
In the present paper, that the majority of the estimates are studies classifying to have a high risk of bias,
cannot explain such opposing effects of the different antigens in studies using the same methodology to
estimate the effect of BCG, DTP and MV – and for many of the studies within the same cohorts.
This should be discussed, and reported in the abstract and in the “what this paper adds.”
It is concluded that further research is warranted, but only randomised trials: “we favour limiting future
studies to those randomized trials that can be ethically and practically conducted. These views were
supported by SAGE recommendations in April 2014 (13)”. To me it is not clear which document is
referred to in ref 13 – in
http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2014/april/1_NSE_Backgroundpaper_final.pdf?ua=1
under research agenda observational studies are still in play:
“There was a view that further observational studies with inherent and substantial risk of bias would be
unlikely to provide conclusive evidence about putative non-specific mortality effects. However, if
observational studies are to be contemplated, their design and analysis should mimic what would be
undertaken if it were to be a randomised controlled trial. Future studies should draw upon a broad
investigator pool and from a wide range of geographic locations and burden of disease settings. The
development of standardized protocols for both RCTs and observational studies of mortality effects, that
address now well-recognised bias issues, should be considered.”
By limiting the studies to randomised trials which can be ‘ethically and practically’ conducted, we will be
waiting many years still. We need more observational studies to motivate and justify trials, and with
increased awareness of the potential bias we should hopefully see better designed observational studies
in the future.
Specific comments
Page 4: Why are the medium and high titre measles vaccines excluded? If the search is for biological
evidence it does not seen logical to exclude them (and when evidence for DTP is downgraded because it
is almost always assessing the effects of OPV+DTP vs no DTP the policy argument does not seem to
hold.)
Page 5: Within study interactions between vaccine effects and sex are computed – but many studies
have reported sex differences in mortality following vaccination and could potentially contribute to this
analysis
Page 6: The “too high” risk of bias is excluded – but is still allowed to contribute in the sex differential
effects analysis. I do not understand the rationale for this – by adding noise to the analysis we are
unlikely to detect a possible effect.
Page 7: “three studies did not report OPV co-administration” – but only 2 references
Page 7: Vaccination sequence results. The references explain which studies of BCG-out-of-sequence were
included in figure 5 – but I missed information about how the estimates were extracted.
For MV/DTP out of sequence this becomes even harder. There are 5 studies in Figure 5 DTP+MV vs MV
after DTP, but only 4 references provided. I think the last one must refer to ref 43 (which is grouped with
reference 34 – with which there is no overlap), but the numbers reported seem to differ (1043 children in
the DTP/DTP+MV) – but number of deaths is given as the number with 6 months of follow up for all
children. Again here it would, a description of how the results were extracted could be helpful. Could this
information not be provided in an appendix?
Page 8. Effect modification – again here trying to disentangle where the different studies come from is

difficult. The references are few and details are provided only on sex differential estimates through Figure
6.
Thoughout the paper there is a mentioning of vitamin A status – it is presumably meant to be vitamin A
supplementation?
Page 9. The discussion states the consistency between the few RCT and the observational studies: “Only
limited clinical trial evidence was available for BCG and measles-containing vaccines. This was broadly
consistent with the larger body of evidence from observational studies. However, many types of bias may
have influenced the results of these observational studies.” But it provides no interpretation of how these
biases which are presumably the same for BCG, DTP and measles vaccine can produce so opposite
results – and how these are commonly seen in the same birth cohort.
The reference to that a substantial proportion of studies are from Guinea-Bissau, and that the effect may
not hold elsewhere could be tested in the data – when looking at the Forest plots, I do not see anything
to suggest that this is the case.
“The studies typically took place in communities with many years of use of these vaccines. As a result, a
combination of direct vaccine effects and herd immunity means that these communities had low
incidences of the diseases targeted by the vaccines, so that the substantial net benefits of routine use of
these vaccines may not have been apparent”. This should mean that an observed effect would be nonspecific, rather than specific? However, not all the studies are after long term use of the vaccines.
Page 10: “We do not believe that the available evidence supports a change in either the choice of
vaccines or the timing or sequence of immunizations routinely administered to infants and children. We
believe calls to alter the immunization schedule so as to maximize any possible beneficial effects of BCG
and measles vaccine or to minimize any possible deleterious effects of DTP vaccine on all-cause mortality
are premature.” When the BCG vaccine recommended at birth is only given after 1 month, there may still
be reason to alter the actual timing though the at-birth-recommendation may not have to be changed?
Appendix 2
Page 25: Some formatting of the references has not worked “ENREF_7_....” etc
Page 29: Guinea Bissau 1989-1999: Ref 18, 35-39 – but the estimate included in DTP calculation is from
the war, 1998-99. Therefore it should not exclude the possibility of using the estimates (possibly for
some age groups only) from reference 37.
Page 31: Guinea-Bissau 1999-2002: Ref 42,44,54: The quoted estimate (Ref 54) is from 1999-2006
(children aged >12 months on 15 May 2006) – and in the rural areas. There is no overlap between this
study and ref 42 (enrolment of children 6-18 months from September 2007 in the rural areas) or the
paper ref. 44 which is based on the urban area data.
Page 32: Guinea-Bissau 1978-83, refs 60-62: It states Quinhamel – but that seems to be only for (b, ref
61) – (a, ref 60=69) is Bandim1.

The review is based on data extraction 2 years ago – Papers 24, 42, 43, 52, 54 have been published.
Ref 60 is the same as ref 69
Appendix 3
Page 43: Bangladesh 1986-2001: Stated here + Fig 2 that the estimate includes 9704 children –
however as I read the paper these are the children vaccinated 0-60 days, and are compared to these are
the children classified as unvaccinated.
Page 45: “Risk ratio (adjusted)= 0.5 (0.34, 0.75) Table 3 adj results BCG vs unvaccinated, first visit*” what does the * mean?
Page 49: Guinea-Bissau 1990-96 – ref 11. For this cohort I am wondering why this estimate is used –
rather than the adjusted estimate from ref 14?
Page 53: Anthopological examinations – presumably anthropometric?
Page 56: Bangladesh 1986-2001: I cannot find the N=670? Is it correct? It is stated in figure
Page 62: Guinea-Bissau 1990-96 for this cohort I am wondering why this estimate is used – rather than
the adjusted estimate from ref 14?
Page 64: Guinea-Bissau 1989-1999(18, 35-39) – seems to should have been 1998-1999? The reported
estimate is from war time Bissau, 1998-99. Reference 37 presents data from non-overlapping birth
cohorts, and presents data on OPV vs DTP+OPV – hence the data which allows to disentangle the effects
of OPV and DTP+OPV is not utilised.
Page 65: “Overall: High risk of bias (likely confounding; retrospective collection of vaccination data)” –
this would presumably mean that more vaccines are registered in survivors and therefore that the
estimate for any vaccine should be beneficial. Hence the bias should be towards no effect rather than a
negative effect?
Page 66: “Overall: High risk of bias (unadjusted analysis; co-intervention with MV)” – but according to
Figure 3 it is very high. What is correct?

Page 68: Anthopological examinations – presumably anthropometric?
Page 69: Regarding the estimates from ref 23, Lehmann’s study from Papua New Guinea : “Overall: High
risk of bias (TO ADD)”. There seems to be something missing here.
I have some remarks:
1) Children enter the study at 29 days – but the criteria for entry is being registered <60 days
2) The vaccination status of a child is determined from linkage between the demographic surveillance
data and vaccination card filled out during the vaccination sessions. Cards of children which have not
linked were sent back to the field: “If no identity or social number was recorded on a clinic card, office
staff gave demographic details to reporters to provide the identity number at future meetings. This was
done repeatedly until identity and place of residence was established. Further error checks on
immunization and clinic visit dates were performed regularly and overseen quarterly by one of the
authors (DL). Following this intensive process of identification and error-checking, if there was no clinic
card linked to a child on the demographic database, it was concluded that the child had not been
vaccinated.”
Hence, vaccination status is presumed know for all children – including the 546/4048 who have not been
linked and of whom 21% die, 21% are censored due to migration and 43% due to the end of study. In
the vaccinated group 3% died, 8% were censored due to migration and 26% due to the end of study.
Based on these data I would conclude that the being unvaccinated is highly linked to exit from the study,
and that a “moderate risk of bias in the measurement of vaccination” is not correct – there seems to be
survival bias in this analysis. I would presume, that vaccination status is more often updated for children
who survived and remained in the study than for those who left.
Also, supporting that vaccination status may depend on other factors, background factors did not differ
markedly between the groups: “There were no significant differences between vaccinated and
unvaccinated groups with regard to sex, region, birth order, recent birth spacing, the proportion with an
older sibling who died, and twin status. More children born to women aged 24–34 years were
unvaccinated compared with children born to either older or younger mothers (2 = 12.4, 2 d.f., P =
0.002).”
3) Even if there was no survival bias, I believe that the extracted estimate is flawed: The estimate
extracted comes from children with registered BCG vaccine less than 6 months, and hence the
vaccination card must have been linked to the demographic surveillance data. However, the analysis
starts at 29 days and BCG coverage increases from 48% at 28 days to 80% - thus 40% of the children in
the analyses are included from day 29 because they will later have a BCG vaccine registered.
While the estimated extracted for BCG does not have the same problem of conditioning on the future
possible survival bias would remain a problem here. The extracted MV estimate effect comes from the
same model after 6 months of age these result are not affected from conditioning on the future, but
possible survival bias would remain a problem here.
For these reasons, I believe that this study should have been excluded due to a very high risk of bias.
Page 71: “High risk of bias in measurement of vaccination (children with no information included as
unvaccinated, and further bias towards null from landmark approach)” – the bias towards null increases
the confidence in the direction of the result. Directionality would have been good to see for all the
extracted estimates.
Page 72: Sample description contains some notes (#1468) (#3869) which there are no corresponding
footnotes to.
Page 73: RCT of MV vs IPV (not OPV). Sample description contain note (#2202) which has no footnote.
Page 77, ref 1: “High risk of bias due to departures from intended interventions (16% received additional
DTP doses after MV” But the Bangladesh paper by Breimann reports results censoring after subsequent
vaccinations: “To remove a potential interaction of late (after 9 months of age) DTP or BCG immunisation
with effect of measles vaccine, we did an additional analysis, in which we censored data collected after
immunisation with DTP or BCG when either of these immunisations occurred after 9 months of age; 8152
children had received DTP or BCG after 9 months of age. This analysis showed measles vaccine to be
associated with reduced risk of mortality (hazard ratio 0•61; 95% CI 0•44–0•85; p=0•004).” (Page
2209)
Page 81: “Very high risk of bias due to departures from intended interventions (high proportion of coadministration with MV)” – should probably be (high proportion of co-administration with DTP)
Page 84: Reference given as no 69 – but same as 60

vaccine coverage, vaccine timeliness, and child survival: an observational study.” The Lancet Global
Health 2014; 2(8): e478-87. In the grouping it has been grouped with ref 42 and 44 – but it does not
overlap with these cohorts.
