Statistical Review BMJ.2015.024934.R1
First, please note that I am working with three of the authors of this manuscript on a collaborative project
(Ben Van Calster, Dirk Timmerman and Tom Bourne). I believe that I have given a fair judgement of the
paper, but please be aware of this potential conflict of interest.
The authors report the experience of a cohort of women presenting with threatened miscarriage where the
first US scan revealed a pregnancy of uncertain viability, and validate and develop ultrasound criteria that
can be used to identify pregnancies which are nonviable.
1. I found it challenging to identify the flow of women through the initial ultrasound presentations through
to the second ultrasound examination. Presentation as a flow chart would greatly assist.
2. The current paper lacks a description of the analytical plan in the methods section. I would have liked to
see a clearer divide in the paper between previously proposed which are being validated, and new criteria
which are being derived from the data collected in this cohort. My understanding is that of the proposed
criteria in Table 4, only the 1st, the 3rd and the 4th are validations of existing criteria, all the others appear
to be new or modified criteria. It is also not clear what strategy was used to derive the new criteria.
3. I wondered why the authors did not present 95% confidence intervals of the positive predictive values.
These statistics are the most informative to a woman and clinician, and it is important to be aware of the
uncertainty with which they are estimated. In some cases, the number of women in the cohort meeting
each criterion is very small, and thus the confidence intervals will be quite wide. For example, the initial
scan criteria are based on detecting 0/12 and 0/17. 95% confidence intervals on these predictive values
extend upwards to 26% and 20% respectively, so I am not as confident as the authors that they have
conclusively shown these criteria to be robust. Whereas the positive predictive value for absence of heart
activity on two consecutive scans has an upper limit of 2.5%, which is much more convincing.
4. Given the difficulties in obtaining evidence for some of the criteria due to the small number of women
involved, I wondered whether combining data with that from other studies in a meta-analysis would be
possible and helpful? Perhaps not for this paper.
5. I found it hard to identify data in the paper supporting all of the criteria that are evaluated, particularly
those which combine size by gestation age, size and growth, and size and absence of embryonic heart
activity. There are lots of numbers given in the text, but it would be much preferable to have the evidence
presented in tables like Table 2 and 3 for each of the criteria. There is a risk that the “numerical sentences”
in the text end up being ambiguous which presenting the data in a table avoids.
6. It would be interesting to add a discussion about the yield associated with the different criteria. For
example, there appear very few cases where a definitive diagnosis can be made on only the first scan, and
the greatest yield is from noting on the second scan that a miscarriage has occurred (interesting it is not
stated as a criteria that total absence on the second scan is perfectly predictive – is it too obvious? ).
7. The authors have replied to the journal already concerning the informative drop-out. I would encourage
more detail from their additional analysis to make its way into the paper.
