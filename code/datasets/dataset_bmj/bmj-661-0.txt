1. This is an interesting paper demonstrating conclusively the continuing relevance of stage to outcome in breast cancer,
even in the epoch of anthracyclines and taxanes. It is based on substantial and high quality data, and analyses are
appropriate. I have only a few minor questions and comments. The first of these relates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Is there any data on this? Some tumours have presumably been downstaged as a result of neodjuvant chemotherapy. If
data are available it would be interesting to know if their prognosis is the same as other tumours of the same
pathological stage.
2. It is noted that there is more chemotherapy use in the later period, despite the tumours being of less advanced stage.
This gives rise to two questions: first, is this partly related to neoadvuant therapy and its downstaging effect; second, if
not, is the increased use of chemotherapy mainly a phenomenon of larger and node positive cancers?
3. We also found that stage remains important in the epoch of systemic therapies (Duffy et al, Breast Cancer
Management 2013), albeit with less detailed data than here. This may be worth referring to in the discussion section on
comparison with other studies.
4. Is there any data on detection mode (screening/symptomatic), as this has been observed to be a prognostic factor in
other studies?
