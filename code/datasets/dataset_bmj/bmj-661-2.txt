The Authors of the manuscript "Influence of tumour stage at breast cancer detection on survival in modern times: a
population based study in 173,797 patients " described the impact of tumour size and nodal status in two time cohorts of
patients with early breast cancer.
The work is well written and well structured . The results are quite clear.
The main strength of the work is the great numer of patients included in the analysis.
However I have some comments and suggestions for the Authors.
1) In the Table 1 is reported the distribution of tumour size in the two cohorts. It could be helpful to analize the
differences between the two cohorts excluding the in situ cancers.
2) I suggest to report , if available , how many tumour sizes were pathologically-defined and how many cases were
defined with “other” methodologies.
3) The Table 1 is very long, so I suggest to remove B&R grade of ductal carcinoma in situ , not useful for the aims of the
work.
4) The Authors should limit the redundancy of the results in the discussion section; they should to widen the comments
about their results but also the comparison with the already published studies.
5) Tumor size and lymph node status are well known prognostic factors. In the recent past these two features of the
breast cancer were the only ( or the main) factors influencing the choice of adjuvant therapies. In the last decade the
biological/pathological features of the tumour and the subtyping of breast cancer became more relevant for the
phisicians choices. Nonetheless also recent international guidelines (i.e. Tailoring therapies - improving the management
of early breast cancer: St GallenInternational Expert Consensus on the Primary Therapy of Early Breast Cancer 2015 –
Coates AS. et al.) didn' t forget the importance of tumour burden for the choice of adjuvant therapies.

Therefore the main limitation of this work is into the final message and the potential low impact in the choice of adjuvant
therapies by oncologists.
Authors should further discuss this point and to draw more attention on what the present work add to available literature
