Should orphan status be considered a special expedited review pathway? The premarket regulatory
impact of this designation on drug development and review time should be minimal –the most
substantive incentives are related to market exclusivity after approval.
The Introduction could probably be made more concise, with a clear description of the 4 expedited review
pathways, the major (clinical) implications for premarket regulation, and then the study objective.
Ideally, this paper could be oriented more clinically – several times issues in trial design and postmarket
safety are raised. Are there any data (either published in the literature or available to the authors) on
differences in clinical trial design, or endpoints studied, or postmarket safety risk between new drugs
approved or not approved through any of these four expedited review programs (besides the authors’
study of orphan status designation for cancer drug approvals)?
It should be made clearer that medications could qualify for one or more expedited review programs.
