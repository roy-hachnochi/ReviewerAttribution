This is a well constructed multicenter randomized blinded trial assessing the effects of low and high dose betahistine versus
placebo on multiple outcome measures in patients with definite Meniere's Disease (MD) as defined by AAO and Barany criteria.
The methods are clear and the analysis and results are well described. I have only a few requests of the suthors to conside for
clarificationr:
1.Please state the duration of MD prior to enrollment for each treatment group. It would be desirbale to see a balanced
duration of symptoms of MD in each group prior to enrollment such that one group did not have a proportionately earlier or
later stage MD when starting the trial.
2.How did the authors screen for retrocochlear disease in their subjects (MRI, ABR)? There are cases of small intracanalicular
or even intralabyrinthine schwannomas that mimic MD and routine clinical care for all patients with asymmetric hearing loss is
the consideration of retrocochlear or intracochlearlesions.
3.How was "postural vertigo" differentiated from BPPV in your analysis? There is an increased incidicne of BPPV in MD and I
would assume these posiitonal attacks would be excluded if they are cuased by canalithiasis.
4.How complete were the daily diaries for vertigo reporting? Did the patients report their symptoms regularly each day or wait
and fill in daya at a time? In my experience with diary studies, it is important that the subjects enter data on a regular basis.
5.How were missing data points handled? For instance, if a subject skipped five days in a month in their diary, were these days
counted as "failures=vertigo" or just not analyzed. Missing data points is always a struggle in large trias likethis one and the
proper management of messing data is critical. Please expand in the manscript how these missing data were handled.
