This is clearly an important topic. The statistical analyses appear well done, with clustering and
heterogeneity appropriately modelled for example. However, I have some suggestions for improvement:
1) I found this a tough read, and (as a non-specialist) I found it hard to identify the question and
distinguish the definition of ‘at risk’ from the outcome. For example, the language appears inconsistent
(predictors, indicators, patients at risk could all be used to describe the patients of interest, but it took a
long time to realise indicators meant the outcome) such that the start-point and end-point (outcomes)
were not always clear. The ‘indicator’ language is especially problematic, to me.
Eg at the start of the stats methods, it says ‘ For each indicator, a binary outcome variable categorised for
each patient at risk as triggering an indicator or not’
So for each indicator, the definition of the outcome is the indicator present or not – but upon a first read, I
thought the indicator was a coding for those identified at risk, and then the outcome was an actual
prescribing error in this subset. Indicator is commonly used in the BMJ or other journals to indicate those at
higher risk, so this is incredibly confusing and needs to be addressed.
2) Key statistical measures like ‘ICC’ and ‘reliability’ (based on the ‘prophecy formula’) are hard to translate
to clinical meaning. I would urge the authors to either explain these better, or focus primarily on the
summary %s and the distribution.
3) In relation to this point, the authors focus in tables on the summary %s from the analyses. These are
the summary %s across all the practices. Whilst this itself is important, I think of more importance is the
variability (heterogeneity) of the %s across the practices. This is what the authors are alluding to by
focusing on the ICC, but it would be far better to actually quantify the range of the %s across practices by
a 95% prediction interval for the potential true % in a new practice. This would reveal, with better clinical
meaning, the distribution of true %s. At the moment, the distribution is summarised by the range of
OBSERVED %s. But this is inappropriate as it is too wide, as it accounts for sampling error (chance) due to
a restricted sample size in each practice. Therefore, a 95% prediction (akin to that in meta-analysis, see
ref [1] below) would be more intuitive, for the TRUE %s. This can be added to Table 2
[1] Riley RD, Higgins JP, Deeks JJ. Interpretation of random effects meta-analyses. BMJ. 2011;342:d549.
4) The design of the study also warrants clarification please. I think it is cross-sectional of sorts, but then
looks back upto 6 months (?) to ascertain prescribing practices. But what time-point is chosen for each
individual to be ‘at risk’. For example, are all times looked at, and what if the patients could be included at
multiple time-points (e.g. at risk at time 1, 5 and 6 – were the same patients then included at multiple
time-points to see if they had the outcome? And if so, how was the correlation of individuals accounted for?
In other words, the sampling frame needs to be much clearer to me. Similarly, if individuals were are risk
for 2 or more prescribing errors, then how was the correlation accounted for?
Or is the outcome just yes or no for each patient, with ‘yes’ meaning 1 or more errors?
e.g. confusingly the authors say ‘the proportion of patients triggering each indicator was calculated
individually’ – how can the proportion of all patients be calculated individually? Do the authors mean, of the
total patients in each practice, they first identified those at risk and then, of these, which were exposed to
a prescribing error (indicator)?
Are the ‘at risk’ group all patients in all practices?
5) The analyses seem well done, for example with clustering of patients within practices accounted for, and
the heterogeneity in effects (and prevalences) accounted for across practices. Given the authors, I
expected this to be good. But better description of the variability across practices, in terms of the
prediction interval of the true %, is needed.
I hope my comments helps improve the article further.
