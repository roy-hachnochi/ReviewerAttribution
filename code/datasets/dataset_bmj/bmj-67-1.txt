In this very large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, the authors aimed to explore: (1) Is
prediabetes associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and CVD in the general population
and in patients with history of ASCVD? (2) Are different definitions of prediabetes related to differing
prognosis?
I think this study is of general medical importance given the high prevalence of both prediabetes and
cardiovascular disease worldwide. The study is well performed and the manuscript is well written. I have
some suggestions for revision.
1. The authors used a very broad term “blood glucose” to search. Why not just focus on “prediabetes”.
This search strategy may result with a large amount unrelated items.
2. In generational population, the associations of prediabetes and the risk of CHD and stroke were not
presented in the text (only presented in Figure 1C and Figure 1D). If you have sufficient space, may be
a brief description would be better.
3. It is interesting that no difference was observed for the risk of stroke in patients with baseline ASCVD.
In the 31 studies from ASCVD patients, how many of them included patients with previous stroke?
4. It is also very interesting that in patients with ASCVD, the risk of all-cause mortality associated with
prediabetes was higher in Asians than in non-Asians (consistent evidence from both meta-regression
and subgroup analysis). Are there any underlying pathophysiological mechanisms to explain this
difference?
5. Keep digits after the decimal point of the P value consistent (e.g. P>0.1, and P>0.10)
6. In the conclusion, the authors stated that “prediabetes, especially IGT, is associated with an increased
risk of all-cause mortality and CVD in both the general population and ASCVD patients.” This should be
cautious, as there was not significant heterogeneity was observed among different definitions of
prediabetes.
