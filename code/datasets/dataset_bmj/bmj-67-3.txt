Thank you for inviting me to review this interesting paper. Huge work done by an excellent team
majored in clinical evidence medicine. This study is an extension of their prior work, which was published
in BMJ in 2016. Compared with previous study, novel findings in the present study including: 1.
Reporting that in general population, IGT carried a higher risk of all cause mortality, CHD, and stroke
than IFG. In patients with IFG-ADA, the risk is mainly driven by an FPG range of 110–125 mg/dL. These
results are important for future selection of those at high risk for prevention trials. 2. Providing evidence
for inclusion of HbA1c as a criterion for diabetes and prediabetes. 3. First systematic review and
meta-analysis to report that prediabetes is also associated with an increased risk of mortality and
cardiovascular outcomes in patients with established ASCVD.
Major
I suggest to further calculating the population attribution fraction (PAF) associated with prediabetes, at
least for the primary outcomes.

> Page 7, line 30. risks should be risk
> Page 9, line 46. ‘the pooled results were then combined and compared for heterogeneity.’. ‘then
combined’ is redundant, as the terms ‘pooled results’ in meta-analysis means that the results is
combined.
> Page 11, line 9. it seems quite strange for “p<0.04”, as statistical significance was set at 0.05. Is it by
typing error?
> Page 15, line 22. “the risk of composite cardiovascular events and CHD increased in” should be “the
risk of composite cardiovascular events and CHD was increased in…”
