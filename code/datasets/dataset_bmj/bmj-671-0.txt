Generel comments
This study by Lind et al examines the effect of liraglutide as an addon therapy in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus who were treated with multiple daily insulin injection (MDI) and with inadequate
glycemic control. It is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted between 20132014. Primary outcome measure is changes in HbA1C from baseline to week 24. Among other outcome
measure are changes in weight, fasting plasma glucose, and total daily basal insulin use.
The main finding of the study is a reduction in HbA1C by 1.1% in the liraglutide group compared to the
placebo group. Furthermore a reduction in weight and insulin dose in liraglutide group was observed.
I have the following general comments
1) The study is well designed and well performed. Previous studies have focused on the additive effect
of GLP-1 analogues in patients with basal insulin treatment and this study examines the additive effect
in patients with multiple daily insulin injection. The results are important and relevant for readers of a
general journal.
2) Where did the followup visits take place? In hospital, in primary care, or both? Please clarify in
methods section.
3) Was the compliance to the study medication assessed?
4) In the abstract under the “Main outcome measure”, maybe omit or rephrase the following: “The

hypothesis that liraglutide is superior to placebo in reducing was stated before study start”.
Minor comments
- Authors could consider another race classification since it is mainly a Swedish population
- Is this a phase II or phase IV study?
