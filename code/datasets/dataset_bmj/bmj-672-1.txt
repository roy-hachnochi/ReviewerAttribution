This study measured the proportion of female first authors from 1994 to 2014 in 5 general medical journals. My main
concern is with the choice of journals (JAMA, NEJM, Annals of Internal Medicine, Archives of Internal Medicine and The
Lancet). Of these, 4 are published from the US and, although all publish research from around the world, I would guess
that US research predominates. This is a major weakness of the study making it hard to know how generalisable the

results would be outside the USA. Another weakness of the study is that it did not record the country in which the
authors were working -- this would have been helpful to determine whether there are geographic influences as well as
changes over time.
The article is clearly written and the methods are well described. However, I do not have the statistical expertise to
judge the appropriateness of the regression techniques used. I also wonder (but perhaps this shows my lack of statistical
knowledge) whether regression was really necessary, or whether the raw findings shown in the tables would not suffice.
(I personally feel that they speak for themselves.)
The 1st paragraph is focused entirely on the USA. To make the article of more interest to an international audience,
comparisons from other countries are needed. However, since 4 of the 5 journals studied are American, I suggest that
the findings will be of most interest to US readers.
The finding that women were more under-represented in NEJM than the other journals is intriguing but this study does
little to explain the possible reasons for this. I suggest it would be interesting to get a comment from the journal editor
on possible reasons for this.
Although two previous studies are cited, there are, in fact, several similar studies considering gender imbalance in
publications among specific disciplines (rather than general medicine). It might be helpful to mention these.
