This is an interesting and substantial manuscript. It is of high value and adds to the existing
literature base. The diseases considered are sufficiently common, and the methodological
insights on trial design sufficiently generic, to justify publication in a general medical journal.
It spotlights two very important issues.
Firstly, shows us that the RCT data demonstrates that an affordable, widely applicable
intervention has an effect in reducing heart failure admissions whilst maintaining neutrality for
mortality in heart failure. In an era in which future therapeutic advances will be hard-won, this
has the potential to help readers make better decisions.
Secondly, it offers a useful insight into why the observational studies are disparate with the RCT
data and provides a nice example of the importance of considering study methodology when
surveying the literature for therapeutic decision making. The article reads well and makes sense,
though there is a challenge here in succinctly presenting a large and complex dataset.
I have the following suggestions
*** Shorter introduction?
The introduction is perhaps slightly wordy and I would favour a pithier description highlighting
the current disparity between what is seen in RCTs and observational data.
I agree with the first paragraph of page 6 regarding prescription bias and handling of
observational data but I suggest it be replaced with a couple of sentences defining adjustment
and propensity-matching (i.e. only what is necessary to understand the next part of the paper).
The other aspects might be better decanted into the discussion.
***Need to clearly identify which therapeutic question (throughout the manuscript)
There are effectively three therapeutic groups here - HF (in AF), HF (in SR) and AF (no HF). It
could even be thought of as a Venn diagram with HF as one circle and another overlapping circle
as AF. A three row table or diagram illustrating the current status quo may be helpful to set the
scene. It may be that there are no particular types of a particular study for a particular group but bringing this to the attention of the reader is itself important.
I struggled slightly throughout the manuscript as to which (or all) therapeutic groups were being
referred to at different points. I recognise that it is reasonable to look at the observational vs
RCT issue across all therapeutic questions groups, but the clinical implications are specific to
these three groups. I would, at each stage of the paper, split the consideration of data into 1)

observational vs RCT and 2) clinical with subgroups of for different clinical questions.
*** Move some statistical methodology to an online appendix?
The methodological statistical description is detailed but I would favour this level of detail in an
online appendix with only what is absolutely necessary in the main paper. Some of the detailed
statistics are beyond my individual expertise in checking, but the methodology seems welldescribed and the results are both plausible and consistent.
*** Minor points with Figures
Figure 2 is of high-value, but at present the many words detract slightly. I would suggest moving
the RR and HR across to the numbers of the right. I would then have have simple labels of
observational vs randomised controlled (perhaps with an exaggerated gap in between) and then
to the right of observational “unadjusted” then “adjusted” then “propensity-matched” above each
other. The reader needs to appreciate the clear message that any form of statistical processing
applied to observational data has not matched the RCT result.
Figure 3 is again strong. What does the size of circle represent? I can’t find an explanation in the
legend or text.
Supplementary Figure 2 - I wonder whether for panels A and B, having x-axis run from -20 to
+20 and -70 to +70 respectively might highlight the asymmetry in DM and diuretics more clearly
(accepting it generates some white space on the left of the figure panels - but this may help
understanding).
Supplementary Figure 7 - This appears to combine RCT and observational data into overall risk
ratios. Unless I have missed the point of the Figure I am against this. The authors demonstrate
very nicely why observational data should not be treated as the same currency as RCT data - yet
this Figure would seem to contradict this approach.
*** Discussion
I agree with the message of the discussion, but wonder if it might be shortened slightly. The
clinical recommendations could be summarised in a shorter offering. There is a broader message
which the authors do mention - but I think there is opportunity to draw important parallels with
other contemporaneous issues within cardiology.
At the root is a failure at multiple levels in our community to be clear that observational data, no
matter how plentiful, is an insecure basis for therapeutic decision-making and that the results of
observational studies are often a function of trial design more than the intervention. I continue
to be concerned that societal guidelines consider large observational data sets and RCTs as the
same level of evidence.
We are now seeing a recurrent pattern, at least to some extent, in a number of different silos
within cardiology.
1. Renal denervation for hypertension ( Shun-Shin MJ et al, Removing the hype from
hypertension. BMJ 2014 Mar 6;348:g1937. doi: 10.1136/bmj.g1937.)
2. Echo selection for CRT (Nijjer SS et al The limit of plausibility for predictors of response:
application to biventricular pacing. JACC Cardiovasc Imaging 2012 5:1046-65 - and then
Ruschitzka F Cardiac-resynchronization therapy in heart failure with a narrow QRS complex.
NEJM 369:1395-405)
3. Intra-aortic balloon pumping (Ahmad et al Intra-aortic Balloon Pump Therapy for Acute
Myocardial Infarction: A Meta-analysis. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 175:931-9.)
4. Angioplasty vs thrombolysis in STEMI (Sen S et al Why does primary angioplasty not work in
registries? Quantifying the susceptibility of real-world comparative data to allocation bias. Circ
Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2012 5:759-66.)
The common theme is that disparate findings between RCT and observational data (and within
observational data) has, in retrospect, been substantially explained by methodological
differences and a failure to exclude bias, even with complex statistical processing.
Drawing parallels with other areas of cardiology in which we are experiencing conflict between
studies which are explained by methodology (listed above) might provide a bit more context,
though I accept that, in practical word-limit terms, it might be better suited to a related
editorial.
