This systematic review provides interesting evidence on the diverging results from studies with
differing designs and methodologies, and highlights the problem of bias in observational studies.
The review appears to have been suitably carried out. In general, the selection procedure, the
extraction of data, and the statistical methodology used, are all appropriate.
There are just a few points which require some clarification, and one analysis which the authors
might consider amending.
1. The studies included were restricted to those published in English. Could this have introduced
any bias in the systematic review?
2. The paper assesses results from observational studies with different statistical methodological
approaches as well as results from RCTs. The main results are clearly presented for each type of
study/methodology. However, for some of the sub-analyses (eg cardiovascular death –
observational studies) it is unclear which results have been combined.
3. The statistical analysis is described well and I consider it appropriate that this explanation is
kept in the main body of the paper (see review by Cole).
4. The number of studies and their contribution to the various analysis sets is, at present rather
confusing. For example, Figure 1 shows 42 studies included in the meta-analysis, whereas T,able
2 shows 41 studies included in the analysis of ‘all-cause mortality’ (the primary outcome). In
addition, the 28 ‘unadjusted observational’ studies listed in Table 2 do not appear to match the
29 studies (providing 33 analyses) listed in Supplementary Figure 1. These apparent anomalies
should be explained.
5. Summary results for mortality are (correctly) separately provided for the various analyses of
observational studies and the RCTs. However, those for hospitalisations are not. This seems
inappropriate given the main message of the paper (namely, observational studies have a higher
degree of bias, with controlled trials providing higher quality data).
