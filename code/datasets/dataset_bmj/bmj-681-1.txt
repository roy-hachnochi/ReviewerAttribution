The revised paper sounds good. More detailed epidemiological investigation regard to the possible infection
source of the second case was added. But there are still some questions needed to be clear.
What were the results of serological test for the index case?
Whether the second patient infected with H7N9 virus or not was critical to the whole study. As the authors
claimed, the second patient developed fever on February 24th. His throat swab sample was collected on
February 25th. The testing result of the sample was positive for H7N9 using qRT-PCR. However, no virus
was cultured from the patient especially under the condition that the products of PCR were able to be
sequenced (here I wonder what the CT value for the second case was). That was a little ridiculous. As we
know, false positive result due to contamination occurred frequently while performing PCR.
The genetic distance between the two cases was little long, especially the HA and NA. Provided the second
case acquired infection from the index case, then the genetic distance showed in phylogenetic tree should
be more close at all segments due to they were obtained before oseltamivir treatment.
What were the results of serological test for the second cases? Paired sera samples for the second patient
should be collected according to the rules (Line 3-6, page 7).
How to explain the both obviously elevated white blood cell counts (17.8 Ã—109/L) with left shift and Cresponse protein (233mg/L) of the second patient while he was admitted on hospital D (Line 17-18, page
10), which strongly suggested he might infect with bacteria rather than viruses.
