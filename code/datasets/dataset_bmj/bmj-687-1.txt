How many of these studies are clinical trials?

Only 1:
Use of alpha-blockers and the risk of hip/femur fractures.
Souverein PC, Van Staa TP, Egberts AC, De la Rosette JJ, Cooper C, Leufkens HG.
J Intern Med. 2003 Dec;254(6):548-54.
PMID: 14641795
Is this trial registered?
Re: it is not a clinical trial, this study is described as a "Population-based case-control study"
(reference 13 on this submitted paper)
-I think that the manuscript BMJ.2015.028205 adds very important evidence in an area of many
uncertainties (safety and effectiveness of alpha-blockers).
Registries of pharmacological surveillance (e.g., RzISK.org) could provide additional evidence.
I agree with the author's conclusion.
