This is a simple and relatively light hearted cohort study. It provides an enjoyable vehicle for an important
educational message regarding regression to the mean and the effect this can have in clinical medicine.
The study design is solid and the participants and methods clearly described.
The results answer the research question. The interpretation, that the 'curse of the rainbow jersey' is best
explained by regression to the mean, is open to debate. The statistical analysis seems to support a
combination of the marked man theory and regression to the mean equally, and in my opinion this
combination is more consistent with what we see in sport: there is no doubt a recent winner would be
monitored and covered more closely, not just during the year in the rainbow jersey but also in subsequent
years. Regression to the mean in terms of endurance sport ability could be expected to take longer than a
year, but the rate of apparent decay could be increased by this closer attention over the next few years.
This is a matter of opinion not resolvable based on the data presented.
It should be noted that an unpleasant but unavoidable undertone in professional cycling through the
majority of the years studied is abuse of performance enhancing substances and methods. It is possible
that this widespread issue could affect the results studied and have some pertinence to 'the curse'. This
unfortunate aspect is somewhat of an elephant in the room when reading the paper, and I think would be
in the forefront of many readers minds. I would be interested in the authors opinion as to whether this
should be briefly mentioned or addressed to avoid it detracting from the papers impact.
