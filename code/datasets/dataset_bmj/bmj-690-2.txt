I really enjoyed reviewing this paper; it is a really imaginiative idea, underpinned by some rigorous
statistical methodology & does generate a meaningful conclusion.
My only critisism would be the equal weighting given to race victories; should Grand Tour victories, and
other notable successes such as one day Classic victories not be given greater weighting in the analysis?
Otherwise a fantastically imaginative paper!
