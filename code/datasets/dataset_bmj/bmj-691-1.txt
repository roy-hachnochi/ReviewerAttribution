This paper has a good methodology to address the question they are looking to answer – “What is the concordance
of hip pain with radiographic OA?”. However, although this paper reinforces previous work demonstrating the
relatively poor correlation between radiographic changes of osteoarthritis and patient’s symptoms, I do not feel this
is appropriate for publication in this journal (which has a general readership) but think it would be more appropriate
for a musculoskeletal journal since the main application of their findings is in the context of classification criteria for
OA.
Furthermore the authors make two key assumptions, to justify their approach, that are not well supported by the
literature
1) The model the authors are proposing is one where OA is a fundamentally pathological process and therefore you
would expect “hip pain is predictive of hip OA”. There is a substantial evidence base indicating that OA is a
metabolically active process of bone healing in response to a variety of potential insults to the cartilage. This healing
model suggests that the active remodelling process is sometimes (but not always) associated with pain and the
subsequent radiographic changes are merely reflective of previous remodelling. The model therefore predicts that
the radiographic changes (particularly the specific changes identified in the Kellgren –Lawrence grading) may or
may not be associated with any ongoing pain. Radiographic changes should therefore only show a limited correlation
with current pain – as the authors acknowledge in referencing Birrell’s work that showed that severe radiographic
changes are found in 3% of the population without any associated pain. In fact an experience of previous frequent
hip/groin pain should be the predictor of future radiographic change in the ipsilateral hip, rather than current
changes; that is not what this study is set up to address.
2) The authors suggest that their study is clinically relevant because, in a patient presenting with hip/groin pain, the
non-operative clinical management is substantially different in patients with or without radiographic changes of OA.
Given that clinical criteria for the diagnosis of OA (such as the ACR criteria – groin pain, normal ESR and impaired
internal rotation) are often used, in studies looking at non-operative approaches, it is not possible to draw such a
conclusion. The authors mention local injections of the hip which have, at best, a weak evidence base in OA and
have not been compared between patient groups with and without radiographic changes. NSAIDs are not
recommended as standard treatment for either hip OA or for hip bursitis. Furthermore the clinical presentation of
hip bursitis is characteristically different. This therefore calls into question whether it is of any clinical relevance to
the practitioner whether the radiographic findings match the clinical picture. Essentially a management strategy of
escalating analgesia (+/- NSAID), regular exercise/physiotherapy, weight reduction and smoking cessation would be
equally applicable with our without radiographic changes. This study is therefore of more interest to a
musculoskeletal interest group where it may interest readers to review the current classification criteria for OA.
3) Furthermore the authors suggest that “inadequate recognition of OA has consequences”. The data they cite
suggests that it is in fact hip pain, that is inadequately managed, that has consequences (decreased functional
status etc). The learning point for a reader should be that it is key to manage hip pain effectively and imaging will
generally add little to the clinical reasoning reasoning process. Whether asymptomatic radiographic changes of hip
OA correlate with the outcomes they cite is not demonstrated – the healing model would suggest it should not.
4) The presence of ongoing hip pain (as discussed in the paper) and radiographic hip OA is a requirement for
consideration of surgical intervention. This is an indication that any healing response is failing to resolve the
underlying problem. However Nilsdotter’s work has shown that the severity of the radiographic changes does not
correlate with surgical outcome.
Overall this study indicates that clinicians should probably use clinical criteria to diagnosis hip OA and manage
hip/groin pain with aggressive conservative management strategies. Radiographic imaging is probably only an
indicator of previous metabolically active remodelling processes and does not correlate well with current pain.
Imaging is therefore only of limited clinical benefit, possible helping clinicians to decide whether to proceed to
surgery when conservative management approaches have failed. Musculoskeletal specialists should consider more
clearly differentiating the syndrome that is clinical hip OA from the radiographic findings (perhaps calling the
radiographic changes something different) in order to allow better understanding of the interaction between the two
processes.
