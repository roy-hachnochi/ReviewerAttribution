The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis about the risk of hypoglycaemia
related to the addition of a DPP4-inhibitor to sulphonylurea derivatives. The authors address a very
interesting issue and have an important message. The risk of overall hypoglycaemia would increase
with 50% when a DPP4-i is added to SU therapy.
The systematic review and meta-analysis is well conducted, but I have some issues I would like to
address. Please find my comments below.
• General: the article is not so well written and flow could be improved. Please note that
hypoglycaemia is an uncountable noun. Please solicit help from a native English speaker to improve
English and flow.

• Title: the current title is: “Risk of hypoglycaemia related to DPP-4 inhibitors plus sulphonylureas:
systematic review and meta-analysis”. I would suggest to change this into “Risk of hypoglycaemia
related to the addition of DPP-4 inhibitors to sulphonylureas: systematic review and meta-analysis”.
The studies that were included in the review investigated the effect of adding DPP4-I to SU therapy.
• Introduction: I would suggest that you add information about hypoglycaemia incidence in patients
with type 2 diabetes on sulfonylurea monotherapy and DPP4-i monotherapy. This will help the
reader to interpret the increased risk of hypoglycaemia that was found in the current review.
