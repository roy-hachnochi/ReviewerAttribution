The authors have undertaken a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the relative risk of

hypoglycemia as an adverse effect of diabetes treatment with DPP-4i + SU in clinical trials that
compared this treatment vs. placebo + SU. 10 studies published between 2007 and 2013 were
included. Their finding show that the both the relative and absolute risk of hypoglycemia associated
with DPP-4i treatment in combination with SU is high and they conclude that this risk should be
taken seriously.
The study is relevant, interesting, rigorously performed and clearly described. I have only minor
comments.
- Methods/Eligibility criteria. Make it clear that only studies that included placebo + SU in the control
arm were eligible.
- Please already list in methods the brand names of DPP4i treatments that were eligible.
- Page 11, line 27. You write that the results for low doses of DPP-4i were not significant. That's true,
but the estimate was still elevated and further down in the same paragraph you mention that no
heterogeneity was found between low and high doses. Thus, this statement, although correct, is
slightly misleading as the results are in line with there still being an elevated risk even with low doses
of DPP-4i.
- Figure 2 is redundant, the same results are made clear in the forest plot (fig 3).
- Consider ordering the studies in fig 3 by chronological calendar year instead of strength of
association. It is telling that the first study is the strongest as well.
- Can table 1 and 2 not be combined?
