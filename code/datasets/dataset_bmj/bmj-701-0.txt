This is a well written paper presenting a meta-analysis on the subject of secondary malignancies after radiotherapy for
prostate cancer. The methods of analysis and its details are clear and well done and the conclusions are sound. The report will
be a contribution to the literature on this subject.
I would like to make 2 points however
On page 22 the authors discuss the possible decreased role brachytherapy may play for the development of second cancers
but this information is not mentioned in abstract. In the discussion on page 21 it is only highlighted that this association is
weaker for brachytherapy.
In addition, the authors strongly state in their discussion on page 22 how IMRT " HAS AN INCREASED RISK OF SECONDARY
MALIGNANCIES DUE TO RADIATION LEAKAGE:
surprising that the authors report this here in the discussion when these studies are not based on any actual data but
theoretical modeling studies which have never been demonstrated clinically. They are simply estimates based on equations not

validated clinically. These references to IMRT should be omitted from the paper since studies have not demonstrated higher
risks of IMRT in clinical practice.
