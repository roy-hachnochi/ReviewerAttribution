If this systematic review/meta-analysis contained non-overlapping studies, my comments would be relatively minor. However,
the SEER database was used in 11 of the included studies. The authors seem to have followed a sensible approach to avoid
over-counting by selecting one study for each scenario, using various criteria defined on page 8. Iâ€™m not sure how differently I
would approach this, but could the authors comments on how this will affect their results - if at all? Would carrying out
additional sensitivity analyses, using alternative approaches for study selection for the SEER studies be useful to confirm their
findings? I fully appreciate, that doing this, things could get quite messy. But it feels messy anyway (not made easier by
examining different primary chance, different lag periods, and different rx modalities), as different SEER reports are being used
in different analyses, which whilst they have reported this in the appendix, it naturally feels messy.
P11 L10 - They quote 24 reports from SEER - not 11.
Figure 2 shows the Forest plot for bladder cancer, where are the others for colorectal cancer, rectal cancer, lung cancer etc .
Whilst including all the possible Forest plots for each cancer and each time point in the main text will be
overwhelming/unnecessary, they should be made available in online appendices (as supporting information). Similarly for
radiotherapy modality, summary results are presented in Table 3, but the Forest plots should also be presented, again as
supplementary material.
Adjusted hazard ratios are reported, but what confounders have been adjusted for in those studies which reported
adjustment?
There was no attempt to explore the observed heterogeneity (e.g. conducting a meta-regression), merely a few comments in
the Discussion. Did the authors not explore this in more detail, and more formally? The risk of bias assessment is all fine, but
as per my previous comment on heterogeneity, could the results from the risk of bias assessment be used (see Hopewell et al,
2013). Given the nature of the included studies, being data from observational studies/registries,
