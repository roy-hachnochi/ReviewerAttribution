“Fluoroquinolone use and serious arrhythmia: a Danish -Swedish cohort study”
Importance of the subject
Ciprofloxacin has been widely used to treat a wide variety of infections of urinary tract, soft tissue and
bone, and respiratory system. Several trials and case reports raised the concern about fluoroquinoloneinduced QTc interval prolongation and increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. In this large cohort
study Dr Inghammar M et al address important question regarding safety of fluoroquinolones and risk of
cardiovascular arrhythmia. This concern is of importance to the patients and clinicians in almost all
medical and surgical specialties.
Originality
Ciprofloxacin is associated with better safety profile on cardiac repolarization compared to other
fluoroquinolones. In-vitro, ciprofloxacin didn’t prolong QTc interval using recommended oral doses. In a
post marketing surveillance, the crude rates for incidence of ciprofloxacin-induced cardiac arrhythmia
was 0.3 per 10 million prescriptions. Ciprofloxacin didn’t appear to increase the risk of cardiac death with
264,626 prescriptions, compared with amoxicillin (Hazard ratio = 0.95 (0.52-1.73), p = 0.87) in a study
by Ray W et al 2012. So, the results of the current study are not unexpected. However, this trial is the
largest to date that specifically address the question regarding the safety of this widely prescribed drug
and provided more evidence for treating physicians regarding its safety.
Methods
The research question is well-defined. The study design was good with large well matched cohort of
patients, and excluded confounding factors that can affect the results. However, there is always a
concern for selection bias, where treating physician will choose not to treat high risk patients with
fluoroquinolone. This is can a limitation of these retrospective cohort trials.
Results
The results are well presented and showed no increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia with fluoroquinolones
compared to penicillin V. However, generalization of the results and conclusion to fluoroquinolones may
not valid. Ciporlofxain represented 83% of the fluoroquinolones prescriptions. The potency of
fluoroquinolones on cardiac repolarization is variable in vitro, animal and human trials.
