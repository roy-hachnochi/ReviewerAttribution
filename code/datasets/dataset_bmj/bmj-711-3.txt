This modeling exercise should confront the body of evidence accumulated over the past 25 years, as
well as the conclusions of the 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report. The methodology applied in this
kind of modeling exercise was appropriate in 1991, but scientific evidence accumulated since then has
rendered invalid its application in 2015.
An exercise in modeling, while not providing actionable information, can make an important contribution
to scientific progress. Their value, however, depends upon the validity of the underlying assumptions
upon which the model is based. To be make a meaningful contribution, this model must provide
compelling evidence that each of its underlying, separate components are valid.
For example, does blood pressure to CVD events have a linear relation to outcomes in the general
population? To my knowledge, there is no evidence that reducing systolic BP to less than 140 mmHg is
beneficial. In fact, in several randomized trials, reductions to less than 140 mmHg have led to increased
morbidity and mortality. Thus, there is no support for the hope that the vast majority of adults could
benefit from reducing pressure – and some evidence of potential harm.
Moreover, the model assumes that reduction of sodium, from any starting level, will have the same
effect on blood pressure. Unfortunately, a substantial body of evidence that this is not the case. Indeed,
the blood pressure effect is very different with meaningful blood pressure reduction with a 1 gm fall in
sodium intake (about 1/3 of average daily intake) producing a 2 –3 mmHg fall in average systolic BP.
By contrast, with intakes less than the fall is less than 1 mmHg. Moreover, individual variation, including
a rise in pressure includes a rise in pressure. would presumably effect th
As for the CVD effect, over the 30 years, findings in more than 30 studies involving a 500,000 subjects
throughout the world, is consistent with a “J” shaped relation of sodium intake to health outcomes. This
is, of course, consistent with the pattern for all other essential nutrients. The usual range, 2.5 – 5g/day
is associated with optimal health outcomes, with increased risk (both physiological and CVD events)
increasing above and below that range. Interestingly, above 6g.day, increased CVD and all cause
mortality is found only in those with hypertension. Below 2.5, increased CVD mortality is most common
in the healthiest 60 – 70% of the population. There is no evidence that intakes of less than 2.5 grams/d
is associated with superior health outcomes compared to those with 2.5 – 5.0 g/day.
This data and the multiple adverse effects associated with too little sodium intake, and the well
demonstrated dissociation of blood pressure and morbidity and mortality, in multiple observational
studies, led the Institute of Medicine to specifically conclude that “blood pressure is not a surrogate for
the health effects of sodium reduction”.
This modeling exercise should confront the body of evidence and IOM (2013) report conclusions. The
methodology was appropriate in 1991, but the accumulation of scientific evidence since then has
rendered invalid its application in 2015.
A small point is that the claim of falling sodium intake in Great Britain needs to be understood in the
context of time. Comparing 2 points in time might leave some unaware that, over a wider period,
average Sodium intake has varied widely within the worldwide range of 2.5 – 5.0 g/day and over a
wider time frame there has not been a reduction in sodium intake.
