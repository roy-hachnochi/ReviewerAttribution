The response to reviewers is very comprehensive, and I am happy with their response and the
sensitivity analyses reported show consistent findings.
However, I am not happy with the actual revision because they do not refer to any of the sensitivity
analyses that we asked them to do, such as looking at continuous trends and multiple imputations and
including adjustment factors individually (Rather than as a score).
The sensitivity analyses need a separate section in the Methods and the Results, and detailed results
can be given in the online material. Given that the authors show us, in their response to comments,
that the sensitivity analyses show consistent conclusions to those originally shown, this is an important
message and will improve the robustness of their findings for the BMJ reader.
Also, Tables 2 and 3 do not actually define the numbers within the tables as RRs

I’m sure the author can address these final issues.
Best wishes, Richard Riley
