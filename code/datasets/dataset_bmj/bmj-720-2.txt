This paper considers the cardiovascular risks of antidepressant medication in adults. It presents the findings of a
cohort study of almost a quarter of a million UK adults aged 20-64 with a first diagnosis of depression, and examines
the risks of MI, CVA and arrhythmia in relation to different classes of and individual antidepressants. Data are drawn
from the well-respected QResearch database of primary care electronic records, with supplementary information on
cause of death from the Office of National Statistics. The authors provide a clear and cogent description of their
methodology, including inclusion/exclusion criteria, confounders and statistical methods of analysis. The key elements
of analysis include comparison of risks of adverse cardiovascular events when taking vs. when not taking
antidepressants. Findings are presented clearly. There is a thorough and well-balanced discussion of study strengths
and limitations - the latter including possibilities of selection bias for lofepramine, and relatively small numbers on high
dose citalopram - and of the implications of the findings for clinical practice.
This is a strong and well-presented paper, which provides convincing evidence that in adults aged 20-64 there are low
risks of adverse cardiovascular events associated with antidepressant medication in general, and with SSRIs in
particular. The specific evidence in relation to higher dose citalopram is potentially significant in policy terms, and is
likely to be of interest to US and European drug monitoring agencies in view of existing advice regarding risk of
prolonging QT intervals: the authors are suitably cautious on the implications of their findings. The suggestive
evidence that SSRIs, especially fluoxetine, may reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in adults is intriguing,
and worthy of further investigation.
