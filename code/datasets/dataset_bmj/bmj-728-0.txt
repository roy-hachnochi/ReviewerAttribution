Very interesting analysis of real-world data. The study's aims, the outcomes being measured, and
the issues and questions the paper addresses, are relevant not only to high-risk HF individuals, but
to broader worldwide public health.
Over the counter NSAIDs are mentioned on manuscript page 13, and that led me to wonder if the
NSAIDs tracked in the study were all prescription strength, or if they varied in strength from
prescription to OTC. If the increased HF risk applies only to prescription strength NSAIDs, then
knowledge of this risk needs to focus on providers - if the increased risk is the same if taking OTC
NSAIDs, then there is a larger public health education campaign that needs to occur.
I would have liked to have seen gender differences reported in the results - e.g. men are at
greater for risk for HF if prescribed diclofenac, while women are at greater risk if prescribed
indomethacin.
In the results section of the abstract, the "estimated adjusted odds ratio of...of HR hospitalization
associated with current use of any NSAID was 1.20" - is that 1.20 a decimal expression of the
ratio? Should it be written as a ratio instead - 12:10 ? Or change to percent increased risk (roughly
20%) ?
