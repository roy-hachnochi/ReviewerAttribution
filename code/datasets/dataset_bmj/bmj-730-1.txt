Dear Editor,
Many thanks for asking me to have a look at the manuscript. Firstly, I wanted to apologise to the authors and

yourself for taking a month to do this. I missed a week of work with a flu type illness and have spent the last 2
weeks catching up.
The authors look at the the outcomes of patients following VF / persistent VT requiring a DC shock. The study
addresses the changes in guidlines and practice regarding when to deliver a second shock if the first shock fails should it be deferred and follow CPR (current guidelines) or be administered straight away.
The approach is a retrospective registry review, finding that since 2004, there has been very good adherence to
new guidelines advocating a delay in second shock until after CPR has been performed, but that this was not
associated with improved survival. The authors note that the evidence upon which the current guidelines is based
relies on animal models and human research which has been dominated by studies looking at out of hospital
arrest, where "downtime" without CPR is much higher.
Overall, the study is well written and informative. There are some complex statistics and I would recommend that
a dedicate statistical review of this paper is performed.
In terms of areas where the paper could be improved, the section in the abstract for design / setting and
participants needs to be more informative. The authors must clearly state that this is a retrospective study.
In the abstract and in the methods, it is unclear to me what the "Get with the guidelines - Resus" registry actually
is. It is described with an abbreviation of IHCA, but I cannot see what that stands for (I would guess in hospital
cardiac arrest?), but this needs to be spelt out. Where the registry is based also needs to be spelt out - I presume
it is in the USA from the authors affiliations?
The authors comment that in hospital VF and VT arrest is monitored in the majority of cases. Much of their
argument is based around this - if it is a monitored arrest, then defib will be performed far more quickly and
maybe the need for CPR before the second shock is less is the premise. Certainly in my experience in the UK,
plenty of VF/ VT arrests are monitored, but some are not. Furthermore, a monitor on a patient at their bedside
which is not linked to the nurses station on the ward may detect the arrhythmia quickly, but how long it will take
for someone to see it and take action is variable!
In terms of the years over which this study was performed (2004-2012), there have been improvements seen in
defibrillator technology and technique. In the UK, over that period, we have seen the phasing out of defibrillator
paddles and the introduction of self adhesive pads. Monophasic defibrillator technology was also phased out,
being replaced by biphasic devices. Along with this, as the authors discuss, there have been changes in guidelines
and overall, survival to hospital discharge rates are higher. However, the success of the first shock in producing
return of spontaeneous rhythm is very low in the current study and it is unclear to me why this should be so.
Certainly, the literature and my own experience would suggest that a shock delivered within a minute of the VF /
VT starting is about 90% successful. In this study it was less than 70%.
Overall this study suffers with the limitations of being retrospective in nature - in essence, it is hypothesis
generating (although it should be noted that much of the resuscitation literature is either small trials or
retrospective in nature) and should prompt further work to investigate the findings further. I do not think that
this paper alone is practice changing in this regard therefore my personal view is that it would be better placed in
a resus journal rather than a general medical journal.
Many thanks for asking me to review this paper
