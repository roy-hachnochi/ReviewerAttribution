The paper has been revised to take account of most of the previous statistical issues. The problem of the
lack of pre-pregnancy data remains however, but this cannot be rectified.
I agree that the authors have acknowledged this lack of data as one of the limitations of the study and
have tried to address this by carrying out limited sensitivity analyses. Therefore, I would say that the
paper is probably acceptable.
