This is an important paper. I recommend acceptance and publication as rapidly as possible.
SARS-CoV-2 is a serious infection in pregnancy, carrying, as these authors report, a one percent
mortality for the mother. Current information about it, is based on hospital-based series and case
reports, which are biased in two ways. Firstly there is selection bias as to what cases get reported.
There is also a serious risk of duplicate publication.

The present series is original since there have been no case series or case reports in the scientific
literature from the UK. It is likely that UKOSS is notified of all cases and therefore this is the first paper
to give a reasonable estimate of the rate of this infection in pregnancy. Cases are reported to UKOSS
anonymously, so these cases will inevitably overlap with future case series from the UK. This is
unavoidable. The authors make this clear.
Since the pandemic is ongoing the UKOSS database is of course constantly being added to. The authors
acknowledge this. It is not a reason to delay publication.
The paper is beautifully written. I could not find any typos.
My only minor quibble is that the odds ratios and confidence intervals are given to two decimal places.
For some this leads to excessive precision I would suggest that all such numbers were given to two
significant figures. This should not be a reason to delay publication.
