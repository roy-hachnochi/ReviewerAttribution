This paper captures the fragmentation and confusion that has been such a problem in mounting a
coherent response to the COVID pandemic. However, as is common with papers on public health
arrangements in the UK, it faces the not inconsiderable challenge of presenting clearly the diversity
among the four nations. To take just one example, the second paragraph refers to how government
responses have undermined long established systems, but in fact the paper is mainly discussing the
situation in England. It is not clear that the criticisms are addressed, to the same extent, to the
governments in Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast. Consequently, it may be better if the paper
concentrated on England but included the point that things are done differently elsewhere, perhaps
with the material on the devolved nations in one or more boxes. An alternative might be a series of
flowcharts for the four nations, with a few sentences on areas where this differs in ways that have
implications for disease control.
The inclusion of all four countries in the main text makes what is already a confusing situation even
more so. To review this paper I spent some time looking up the legislation and, as far as I can see,
what happened was that there was a change in the regulations in 2010, as described in the paper, but
this was essentially to bring them up to date. Then came the 2012 Act, which led to the creation of
PHE. Somehow, and at some point in time that I cannot quite fathom, the organisation to whom the
disease should be notified shifted from the local authority to the health protection team at PHE. This
seems to have cut the local authority out of the loop. After quite a bit of searching I gave up trying to
find how this happened as the 2012 Act seems very vague on public health overall. So, if I am
correct, we have a de jure responsibility to notify the local authority and a de factor responsibility to
notify PHE, with formal mechanisms for the two to communicate. Or have I missed something?
Then there is the issue of commercial laboratories, which seem to be even more disconnected. Im not
sure, however, that we need so much detail about all the companies involved. Does Table 2 add
much?
The specific issues about what constitutes a COVID case raise a different set of issues and should be
separated. The paper makes no mention of the WHO definition of a COVID death – can the authors
clarify how this links to the definition being used for cases in the UK: “a death resulting from a
clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no
period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death. A death due to COVID-19 may
not be attributed to another disease (e.g. cancer) and should be counted independently of
pre-existing conditions that are suspected of triggering a severe course of COVID-19.”
In summary, I suggest concentrating on England, simply using the other nations to show that it can
be made to work. Then consider a diagram setting out the flows that should take place and identify
where there are (many) blockages. Then, if possible, make some proposals as to how to overcome
them.
