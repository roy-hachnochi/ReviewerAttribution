∙ Are the questions the paper addresses relevant and important to patients and/or carers?
This review examines papers which report the development of serological tests to identify those with
immunity for COVID – 19 using several serological techniques including LFIA, ELISA and CLIA. The
questions asked / discoveries reported within the paper are all important and relevant for patients.
Findings included:
- very few papers provided results using samples that would be used in a point of care test.
- no publications actually carried out the LFIA test at point of care.
- there was considerable patient bias, with only 3 / 39 studies including outpatients.
- ELISA and CLIA tests were more sensitive than LFIA, but in general sensitivity was lower than
expected. Sensitivities also depended on when the test was performed with regards to symptom onset.
- Specificity was generally high, although in cases of suspected COVID-19 the CLIA test may be less
specific and other viral infections could give false positives with the LFIA tests.
The authors use these findings to conclude that sero-diagnositic tests should be used with caution,
particularly those marketed as a point of care test. This is important information that doesn’t often get
passed on to the general public, and so there is always an assumption that everything is fit for purpose
all the time. The fact that there are serious misgivings raised within this paper is information that should
be made public as soon as possible.
• Are there topics or issues that are missing, or need to be highlighted more?
The authors are very thorough, within the limitations imposed by the available data. One concern was
that of the 5016 papers originally identified by literature search, only 39 could be included in the review.
The vast number were excluded because of irrelevant titles, abstracts or as they were duplicates. Of the
275 that were full text reviewed, most were excluded because of the lack of reference tests, because of
reporting accuracy and irrelevant index tests. It is not possible for the authors of this review to rectify
any of this, but it perhaps could be highlighted more, so that general awareness of heterogeneous
reporting methods can be increased. This finding definitely highlights the need for some way to
systematically compare all the tests under identical conditions so that a more meaningful picture about
the way in which the tests perform can be obtained.
• Is the treatment or intervention suggested or guidance given something which patients/carers can
readily take up? or does it present challenges?
All the tests reviewed were carried out within a clinical setting rather than by patients themselves.
Indeed, only 3/39 papers explored the use of samples from outpatients. The effectiveness of these tests
in the community is unknown, especially as most were trialled using pre-processed samples (i.e. serum).
It may be hoped that a simple test will be developed for use by individual patients, but this test would
need to be highly specific / sensitive to rule out anomalies that could be introduced by the patients /
carers themselves.
• Are the outcomes described/measured in the study important to patients/carers? Are there others that
should have been considered?
The outcomes described are of great importance to patients, carers, medics and the procurement teams
alike. The finding that few tests have been trialled in a true clinical setting, with an unbiased patient
population, using samples that are easily obtained in an outpatient clinic is extremely concerning, and
needs to be made known. In fact, the authors go as far to say that ‘available evidence does not support
the continued use of existing point-of-care-sero-diagnostics’. If any test is continually used but gives

incorrect results it could contribute to further spreading of the coronavirus, especially within the more
vulnerable population.
• Do you have any suggestions that might help the author(s) strengthen their paper and make it more
useful for doctors to share and discuss with patients/ carers?
There are many technical terms within the paper that are well known within the scientific / medical
worlds, but which may not be understood by the general population. This is paper is aimed more at the
medical practitioners, research professionals and those who are procuring the serological tests rather
than individual patients. Whilst it is important to communicate the knowledge that serological tests may
not be as accurate as patients would suppose them to be, this paper is not necessarily one that medics
would share directly with patients.
• Do you think the level of patient/carer involvement in the study could have been improved? If there
was none do you have ideas on how they might have done so?
Due to the retrospective nature of the research described in this paper it would be difficult for these
authors to increase the level of patient / carer involvement. The only way in which this could be done
would be in a future study that trialled the tests independently, using each test under identical
conditions. If this were to happen, then patients / carers could be involved at the sample collection
point, both within outpatient clinics, community and other points-of-care.
