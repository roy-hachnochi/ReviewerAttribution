The authors provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of sero-diagnostics for covid-19. I have
some comments mainly on the presentation.
1. One of the exclusion criteria was fewer than five participants per study. In practice the smallest
included studies had 16 patients, but even this is surely far too small to draw any useful conclusions.
Please justify the cut-off of five, or alternatively raise it to something more realistic.
2. The text accompanying Figure 1 says "We identified 4969 unique titles. We excluded 4696 based on
title and abstract screening and 238 after full-text review. 39 studies15-53 met inclusion criteria." It's
striking that none of these numbers except 39 appear in Figure 1, which means the reader has to do
sums to reconcile text and figure. Please make the figure more reader-friendly.
3. The results on pages 6-7, based on Table 1, are hard work to read and would be better in a table.
Incidentally the many percentages would be clearer formatted as % (numerator/denominator) rather
than the other way round, since the percentages are the main focus.
4. Anyone with a calculator will quickly find that the sensitivities and specificities in Tables 2 and 3 do
not match those based on TP, FN, TN and FP. It needs stating in the text that as the results are based
on the random effects model, the numbers do not match exactly. However one extreme example looks
odd - Chen, Zhang in Table 2 has TP=7 and FN=0 implying 100% sensitivity, yet the tabulated value is
94% with CI 60%-99%, i.e. excluding the observed sensitivity.
5. It will important in the future for the specificity to be appreciably greater than 99%. As it is, several
tests achieve 99% but this is very different from say 99.4%. I think it would be worth giving the
specificities in Table 3 that are between 99.1% and 99.9% to one decimal place precision rather than
rounding them, to make this clear. Obviously 100% can remain as 100%.
6. Note that Table 3 should have specificity not sensitivity in the title.
7. Tables S5 and S6 include tau-squared values to between four and six significant digits of precision. I
am unconvinced that tau-squared adds much useful anyway, but claiming this degree of precision makes
no sense.
8. The many forest plots in Figure S2 show all the specificities crammed up against 100%, making it
hard to distinguish between them. Is there a way of presenting them on a scale that is stretched
approaching 100%, analogous to the log scale for risk ratios? For example, plotting sp% at the point
100 - sqrt(sp%(100-sp%)) has this effect. It's just a thought...
9. Coronoviruses on page 6 line 6 needs attention.
