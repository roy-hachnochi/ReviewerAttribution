The authors touch on the issue of how some clinicians may feel pressured into prescribing medications,
which have not been well-studied. As such, taking action may be detrimental if the effects of a potential
treatment are not well understood. Could the authors elaborate more on this key issue? For example,
could they discuss how clinicians are responding to this approach?
As an ongoing project, it appears the authors have strong foresight in addressing anticipated issues.
They have taken a number of steps to ensure the work can be updated and maintained in a sustainable
manner.
Moving forward, one of the key aspects of this study will be the sub-analyses. Over the long-term, more
information pertaining to different subsets of patients could help improve precision of treatment.
