This paper explains the mental health responses to the two major incidents in UK and
discusses about their differences and the challenges extracted from them. These
challenges are common in disaster mental health responses also in the other countries
and important to be shared widely in an academic field.
Minor comments
Key message 1 seems overstatement. This paper discusses about the differences in the
mental health responses following the two major incidents. The differences mentioned in
the paper were mainly stem from the differences in the two incident characteristics. The
responses to the 2017 attack was not necessarily “improved”. If there are any concrete
“development” or “improvement” in disaster mental health responses in UK since 2005,
please explain it.
Please explain about “IAPT” briefly in the text (p3, l51).
In the text, “596 adults returned at least one questionnaire” (p2, l47), but the
corresponding number in Table 1 was 565. Why?
