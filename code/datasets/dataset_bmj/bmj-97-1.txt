It was a pleasure to have to opportunity to review the paper titled “Financing NCD
Prevention and Control: the role of economic evidence in supporting policy decisions”. This
article makes the case that economic returns to NCD prevention and control should be use
to promote domestic financing of NCD interventions. This article addresses and important
issue: the burden of NCDs are rising, we have good interventions to address many NCDs,
but we need to mobilize funding to do so. Think paper provides great details on specific
cases and the authors are clearly very knowledgeable about this issue. However, I had
trouble identifying the main points of the article during my first read and I think the
arguments could be made more clearly. I have some specific suggestions for doing so
below.
1.
The abstract does not make the point of the article clear. The abstract only talks
about economic issues with this sentence “Putting countries in the driver’s seat through
establishing investment cases incorporating not only economic but political concerns…".
The rest provides supporting information, but the point that that information is supporting

is never made explicitly. I suggest re-structuring to put more emphasis the economics
case for investing in NCDs.
2.
The main point of the first paragraph of the intro was not completely clear to me.
After reading the full article I understand that making the point that domestic financing is
vast majority of health financing is important. However, I think the article should start off
discussing the growing burden of NCDs, the fact that we have great interventions to
address this, and that we need to mobilize funding. For example, paragraph 3 would be
better placed as paragraph 1. The current paragraph 1 might be better placed in the next
section because it makes the point that domestic investment is important.
3.
I expected the third section to report on case studies and to be specific to the
Americas. However, several paragraphs in there make the general case for using
economic arguments and do not appear specific to be specific to the Americas. For
example, page 6 lines 26-34 are not specific to the Americas. I suggest moving up to the
discussion of economics in the prior section on page 5.
Minor comments:
4.
Page 4 line 34: NCD acronym should be placed after first use
5.
Page 4: “The economic losses associated with untreated NCDs are at $47 trillion
between over the two decades from 2010”. Are these out of pocket expenditures or losses
from a societal perspective (e.g. lost wages or DALYs?)
6.
Page 4: “SDG targets” should be explained (i.e. what are the targets for NCDs?).
Also SGD should be written out in first use.
7.
Page 5: Lines 14 and 15 make the same point as 19 and 20. I suggest dropping
14 and 15.
8.
Page 5 line 26: “NCDs to not lie…” should be “NCDs do not lie…”
9.
Page 5 Line 28: Sustainable Development Goal should be SDG after first
appearance
