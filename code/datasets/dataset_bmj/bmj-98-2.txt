Comments to Editor:
The revised manuscript is improved. However, to answer the research question in this study,
cause specific hazard models may be more appropriate. I would recommend editors to
discuss with statisticians who are experts in survival data analyses. The manuscript is too
long; the length of each section can be reduced. Readers are easily lost and wonder what
the key message is. Also, I personally don’t agree with the authors’ justification that
representativeness is less important than the diversity of exposure.

Comments to authors:
The revised manuscript is improved. The authors did a good job addressing reviewers’
concerns. Several problems remain.
1.
As explained by the authors, most cohorts are not representative of the source
populations. However, this does not provide justification for the statement that
representativeness is less important than the large variation of the exposure, even for
investigating the etiology of an epidemiologic association. The exposure distribution is
inherent to the included sample. Selective sample leads to selective exposure distribution
which may bias the estimates. It’s difficult to know to whom the study findings can be
applied.
2.
An individual may consume two or more sugary beverages, but this doesn’t preclude
the authors from performing individual beverage analyses, because sugar from other sources
is adjusted in modeling. Individual beverage analyses can guide beverage selection. People
need to drink, but which beverage to choose for reducing cancer risk?
3.
The authors are interested in the first cancer event. Cause-specific hazard models
may be more appropriate here, because each cancer is a competing risk for all other cancer
types. Mortality is also a competing risk. Traditional cox models assume all competing risks
are the same as loss-to-follow-up or death. This assumption may be inappropriate. Without
appropriately accounting for competing risks may lead to biased estimates. There is a good
tutorial article (Austin PC et al. 2016. Circulation), although it’s written in the context of
cardiovascular disease. The rationale is the same.
4.
In order to accommodate reviewers’ comments, a lot of texts have been added.
However, this makes the paper very long and prevents readers from getting key messages
easily. Word counts are not provided, but it is likely to exceed the word limit.
