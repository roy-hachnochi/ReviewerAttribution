protocol for the development of the strengthening the reporting of pharmacogenetic studies (strops) guideline: checklist of items for reporting pharmacogenetic studies

abstract
introduction large sample sizes are often required to detect statistically significant associations between pharmacogenetic markers and treatment response. meta-analysis may be performed to synthesise data from several studies, increasing sample size and consequently power to detect significant genetic effects. however, performing robust synthesis of data from pharmacogenetic studies is often challenging due to poor reporting of key data in study reports. there is currently no guideline for the reporting of pharmacogenetic studies. the aim of this project is to develop the strengthening the reporting of pharmacogenetic studies (strops) guideline. the strops guideline will facilitate the conduct of high-quality meta-analyses and thus improve the power to detect genetic associations.

methods and analysis we will establish a preliminary checklist of reporting items to be considered for inclusion in the guideline. we will then conduct a delphi survey of key stakeholder groups to gain consensus opinion on which reporting items to include in the final guideline. the delphi survey will consist of two rounds: the first round will invite participants to score items from the preliminary checklist and to suggest additional relevant items; the second round will provide feedback from the previous round and invite participants to re-score the items. following the second round, we will summarise the distribution of scores for each item, stratified by stakeholder group. the steering committee for the project and representatives from the key stakeholder groups will meet to consider the results of the delphi survey and to finalise the list of reporting items. we will then draft, pilot-test and publish the strops reporting guideline and accompanying explanatory document.

introduction
pharmacogenetic studies investigate associations between genetic variants and treatment response for a particular drug of interest, in terms of both benefits (therapeutic effect) and harms (adverse effects). the aim of performing such studies is to identify ways that drug efficacy may be maximised, and that toxicity may be minimised. if a significant association between a genetic variant and a treatment response outcome is identified, patients may eventually be genotyped in clinical practice before being prescribed a certain treatment. the healthcare provider may then refer to the results of the genotyping test when determining whether to prescribe the drug, and if prescribed, the appropriate dosage of the drug. such an approach is known as ‘personalised medicine’.

outcomes from pharmacogenetic studies are often likely to be complex traits; genetic influence may be explained by several genetic variants each having only a small effect on outcome. consequently, large sample sizes are typically required to detect statistically significant associations between a genetic variant and treatment response. meta-analysis improves sample size and consequently increases the power to detect significant genetic effects. however, significant differences are often observed between pharmacogenetic studies in terms of the genetic variants investigated, definition of genetic subgroups and outcomes, and assumptions made in the analyses for example about the underlying mode of inheritance. this can significantly reduce the number of studies available to contribute to a single meta-analysis. this problem is compounded by poor reporting of key data in study reports. for example, if the authors of a particular study do not report the number of participants in each genotype group and outcomes for each genotype group separately, it may not be possible for researchers conducting a systematic review to include this study in a meta-analysis. furthermore, lack of reporting of participants’ ethnic backgrounds can also severely hinder investigations of heterogeneity, which form a key part of any systematic review and/or meta-analysis. genetic associations are likely to vary according to ethnicity; it is therefore recommended that meta-analyses are always stratified by ethnicity, and pooling of results should only be performed if effect estimates for different ethnic groups appear sufficiently similar.1

the aim of our project is to develop a guideline for the reporting of pharmacogenetic studies and an explanatory document using methodology proposed by equator (enhancing the quality and transparency of health research).2 such a guideline would facilitate the conduct of high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses, thus improving power to detect genetic associations.

methods and analysis
we (the steering committee) will develop the guideline for pharmacogenetic studies in five stages:

establish a preliminary checklist of reporting items to be considered for inclusion in the reporting guideline for pharmacogenetic studies (stage 1).

conduct a delphi survey to gain consensus opinion on reporting items to be considered within a reporting guideline for pharmacogenetic studies (stage 2).

hold a consensus meeting to consider the results of the delphi survey and to finalise the list of items for the reporting guideline (stage 3).

develop and publish a high-quality reporting guideline and a detailed explanatory document (stage 4).

dissemination activities to raise awareness of the published guideline, including presenting the guideline at relevant conferences (stage 5).

stage 1: preliminary checklist of reporting items
we will establish a preliminary checklist of reporting items by:

including items from existing relevant guidelines: existing relevant guidelines will be identified by considering all guidelines listed on the equator website,3 under the clinical area of genetics. two authors (mr and alj) will assess existing guidelines to be relevant if they are applicable to pharmacogenetic studies from their experience of reviewing and undertaking meta-analyses of pharmacogenetic studies. we will include items from these existing guidelines in our preliminary checklist if they ensure transparency of reporting of pharmacogenetic studies and consequently will enable future evidence synthesis.

supplementing this list with any additional items thought to be important: additional items will be identified by consideration of the quality assessment checklist for pharmacogenetic studies developed by jorgensen and williamson,4 and through discussion among the steering committee.

providing an explanation and/or example of each reporting item: one author (mr) will draft the explanation and/or example for each reporting item. this will ensure that each reporting item is clear to participants in the delphi survey.

all members of the steering committee will review and approve this preliminary list of reporting items and explanations/examples before the delphi survey begins.

stage 2: delphi survey
design
the delphi process will consist of two rounds of electronic-based survey, response and feedback. the first round survey will include scoring of reporting guideline items from the preliminary list formed at stage 1 and will invite additional items not included in this list. a second round survey will then be undertaken providing feedback from the previous round and inviting participants to re-score these items. any additional reporting items identified by participants in the first round will be included for scoring by participants in the second round of the delphi process.

participants
we will invite three groups of stakeholders to participate in the delphi survey. stakeholder groups will be chosen to encompass all aspects of pharmacogenetic research.

1. those who undertake primary pharmacogenetic research

we will ask members of pharmacogenetic networks, such as the pharmacogenomics research network (pgrn) and the uk pharmacogenetics and stratified medicine network, to participate in our delphi survey. we will perform searches to identify these networks and contact experts in the field to ensure that all major networks across the globe are identified.

2. those who systematically review pharmacogenetic research data

we will email the contact authors of systematic reviews of pharmacogenetic studies identified by searching pubmed, using appropriate search terms such as ‘pharmacogenetics’, ‘pharmacogenomics’, ‘systematic review’ and ‘meta-analysis’. we will consult an information specialist (eleanor kotas) to design the search strategy. we will ask these authors to complete the survey if they participated in the data extraction and/or data synthesis of the review, and we will also ask this author to forward the survey on to other authors who participated in the data extraction and/or data synthesis.

3. those who publish pharmacogenetic research

we will identify these individuals by contacting the editors-in-chief of key pharmacogenetic journals. we will perform searches to identify key journals, using search terms ‘pharmacogenetics’, ‘pharmacogenomics’, ‘precision medicine’, ‘personalised/personalized medicine’. we will also consider journals listed on the ‘the scimago journal & country rank’ portal5 under the subject category ‘genetics’. we will contact experts in the field to ensure that we have not missed any key journals. we will ask the editors-in-chief to participate in the survey themselves and also to forward the survey on to editors at their journal.

the decision of how many individuals to invite to complete a delphi survey is not based on statistical power and often must be a pragmatic choice.6 generally, there should be good representation of experts from the key stakeholder groups who have a deep understanding of the relevant issues. our aim is to maximise the number of participants who complete the delphi survey to ensure that the total number of participants within each stakeholder group is sufficiently large to yield a meaningful statistical analysis.

for the stakeholder group of primary researchers, we are confident that a sufficiently large number of individuals will complete the survey; two of the networks (the pgrn network and the uk pharmacogenetics and stratified medicine network) whose members we will invite to complete the survey together have over 1000 members. for the stakeholder groups of systematic reviewers and journal editors, we hope that the snowballing technique, that is asking review authors and editors-in-chief to forward the survey on to other individuals, will ensure that the number of participants in these groups is sufficiently large.

recruitment process and ethical considerations
we will email the individuals listed above with information about the strops project and the delphi process and an invitation to complete round 1 of the delphi survey within 3 weeks (see online supplementary file 1). we will inform invitees that participation in the survey is optional and that we will assume informed consent if an invitee responds to round 1 of the survey. we will inform invitees that all data will be anonymised, and we will allocate a unique identification number to each participant in the delphi survey. when registering for the study on the survey website, participants will also be asked to tick a box if they agree to participate in the study.

we will send a reminder email at the end of the second week to prompt completion of the survey. we will not be able to send a reminder email to individuals who received forwarded invitations, as we will not have contact information for these individuals at this stage. all participants who complete the first round of the delphi survey will be invited to participate in the second round. however, we will inform invitees that completion in the first round does not necessitate completion in the second round, and we will remind participants of the first round that this is the case, when we invite them to complete the second round.

if attrition rates (the degree of non-response to the second round of the survey) are high, either for a particular stakeholder group or overall, then we will adopt strategies to increase response rates. generally, a response rate of around 80% for the second round of a delphi survey can be considered satisfactory in most scenarios.6 strategies for increasing response rates to round 2 may include sending personalised reminder emails, offering acknowledgement in the published reporting guideline and extending the period of time for which the second round is open.

if participants who do not respond to round 2 have different opinions to participants from the same stakeholder group who complete both rounds, then attrition bias has occurred and this will affect the results of the delphi survey. if response rates to round 2 are less than 80%, we will investigate the risk of attrition bias. we will calculate average round 1 scores for each participant, and then plot these scores according to whether participants completed round 2 or not for each stakeholder group. we will visually examine these plots to assess the likelihood of attrition bias.

participant characteristics
we will ask participants to provide their name, email address and their consent to be acknowledged as a participant in the delphi survey in publications arising from this project. demographic data regarding the participant’s profession and previous involvement with reporting guideline development will be collected; all demographic data will be anonymised.

delphi scoring
participants will be asked to score each of the reporting guideline items listed using a scale of 1 to 9, with 1 to 3 labelled ‘not important for inclusion in the guideline’, 4 to 6 labelled ‘important but not critical for inclusion in the guideline’ and 7 to 9 labelled ‘critical for inclusion into the guideline’.7 participants will also be given the option to score a reporting guideline item as ‘unable to score’ if they are unable to offer an opinion as to whether the item is important or not.

software
the delphi survey will be conducted using delphimanager, a web-based system designed by the comet initiative ( http://www.comet-initiative.org/delphimanager/) to facilitate the building and management of delphi surveys.

delphi round 1
reporting guideline items will be presented in the order in which they would be addressed in the pharmacogenetic study report and will be grouped under relevant headings (ie, title and abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion and other information). participants will be asked to score each item as described previously. participants will also be given the chance to add items that they believe should be included in the reporting guideline.

round 1 analysis
for each item, the number of participants who have scored the item and the distribution of scores will be summarised. participants who scored an item as ‘unable to score’ will be excluded from the analysis for that particular item. we will review all additional guideline reporting items listed by participants to ensure that they are not covered by the existing list of reporting guideline items. additional reporting guidelines items that are not already covered will undergo formal review and discussion by the steering committee, and if appropriate, will be added to the list of reporting guideline items presented in round 2.

delphi round 2
in round 2, each participant who participated in round 1 will be shown the number of respondents and distribution of scores for each item from round 1, for each stakeholder group separately. participants will also be reminded how they personally scored each item in round 1. participants will be asked to consider the responses from other delphi participants and to re-score the items.

in addition, if a participant changes their score from ‘not critical’ in round 1 to ‘critical’ in round 2 or from ‘critical’ in round 1 to ‘not critical’ in round 2, they will be asked to provide their reasoning for this change.

additional items identified as part of round 1 will be scored by participants in round 2.

round 2 analysis
for each item, the number of respondents and the distribution of scores will be summarised. participants who scored an item as ‘unable to score’ will be excluded from the analysis for that particular item. we will assess the possibility of attrition bias occurring by comparing item scores from participants who completed round 1 only, to item scores from participants who completed both round 1 and round 2. we will also examine changes in scores between rounds and summarise the reasons given for changes from ‘critical’ to ‘non-critical’ and vice versa.

consensus definition
guideline reporting items will be prioritised if at least 70% of participants score them as ‘critical’. the rationale for this threshold is that consensus that an item ought to be included in the reporting guideline requires agreement by the majority regarding the critical importance of the outcome. this threshold for consensus has been used previously in the development of the cos-star reporting guideline.8

stage 3: consensus meeting
the steering committee and one or two representatives from each stakeholder group will meet to consider the results of the delphi survey and to finalise the list of items for the draft reporting guideline. representatives from each stakeholder group must have completed both rounds of the delphi survey. furthermore, we aim to include at least one non-uk representative from each stakeholder group in the consensus meeting. the meeting will be conducted via conference call.

at the meeting, mr will present a summary of the results of how each stakeholder group had scored each reporting guideline item (from stage 2), and the number of stakeholder groups who achieved consensus. meeting attendees will discuss each reporting guideline item in turn and will make a decision on whether to include the item in the reporting guideline or not. items that reached consensus from all stakeholder groups in the delphi survey will be considered first. each remaining item will then be considered in turn according to the number of stakeholder groups where consensus was achieved, that is, the next batch of items to be considered will be those that reached consensus in all but one stakeholder group.

stage 4: development and publication of reporting guideline and explanatory document
we will draft the initial reporting guideline and the explanatory document concurrently. the purpose of the explanatory document is to provide the meaning and rationale for each reporting item alongside examples of good reporting practice. for each item, we will also document the origin of the item (steering committee or delphi participants) and the degree of consensus achieved from the delphi survey.

we will pilot-test the draft reporting guideline with researchers who are yet to publish the findings of their pharmacogeneticstudy and with researchers who have already published a pharmacogenetic study. we will identify these individuals by contacting pharmacogenetic researchers based at the university of liverpool and by contacting authors of published pharmacogenetic studies listed on pubmed. we will incorporate feedback on the content, format and usefulness of the guideline from these researchers in the final reporting guideline.

stage 5: dissemination of the reporting guideline
dissemination activities will include presenting the final reporting guideline at conferences relevant to pharmacogenetic research.

patient and public involvement statement
the strops guideline will be developed without patient involvement. patients were not invited to contribute to the writing or editing of this document for readability or accuracy.

discussion
we plan to conduct our project using robust methodology for developing reporting guidelines proposed by the equator network.2 using such methodology will ensure that the resulting reporting guideline is useful and widely disseminated. the equator approach includes a face-to-face consensus meeting, which follows the delphi survey. this meeting often involves the steering group and a selection of stakeholders who took part in the delphi survey. simera et al 9 conducted a survey of authors of 37 reporting guidelines and reported that the median number of people participating in consensus meetings for these reporting guidelines was 22. due to a lack of funding for this project to cover travel and accommodation costs, we will be unable to arrange a face-to-face consensus meeting including such a large number of participants. our consensus meeting will only involve the members of the steering committee (n=6) and one or two representatives of the key stakeholder groups, and the meeting will be conducted via conference call. we will invite a large, international and multidisciplinary cohort to participate in the delphi survey, so that meeting attendees are able to base their decisions on the opinions of this wider cohort.

we will prioritise items for inclusion in the guideline if at least 70% of participants score them as ‘critical’. although the choice of this threshold is somewhat subjective, pre-specification of the threshold in this protocol ought to provide assurance that we will not define consensus in a post-hoc way, and therefore our own opinions will not bias the results of the delphi survey.10

there is currently no guideline for the reporting of pharmacogenetic studies that has been developed using a widely accepted robust methodology. the final guideline will not only improve the transparency of reporting of pharmacogenetic studies but also facilitate the conduct of high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and thus improve the power to detect genetic associations. with the increasing number of meta-analyses of pharmacogenetic studies that are being undertaken, it is important that reporting of key data in study reports is improved in order to allow robust synthesis of the studies.

abstract
objective: to develop core outcome sets (cos) for studies evaluating interventions for (1) prevention and (2) treatment of postpartum haemorrhage (pph), and recommendations on how to report the cos.

design: a two-round delphi survey and face-to-face meeting.

population: healthcare professionals and women's representatives.

methods: outcomes were identified from systematic reviews of pph studies and stakeholder consultation. participants scored each outcome in the delphi on a likert scale between 1 (not important) and 9 (critically important). results were discussed at the face-to-face meeting to agree the final cos. consensus at the meeting was defined as ≥ 70% of participants scoring the outcome as critically important (7-9). lectures, discussion and voting were used to agree how to report cos outcomes.

main outcome measures: outcomes from systematic reviews and consultations.

results: both delphi rounds were completed by 152/205 (74%) participants for prevention and 143/197 (73%) for treatment. for prevention of pph, nine core outcomes were selected: blood loss, shock, maternal death, use of additional uterotonics, blood transfusion, transfer for higher level of care, women's sense of wellbeing, acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention, breastfeeding, and adverse effects. for treatment of pph, 12 core outcomes were selected: blood loss, shock, coagulopathy, hysterectomy, organ dysfunction, maternal death, blood transfusion, use of additional haemostatic intervention, transfer for higher level of care, women's sense of wellbeing, acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention, breastfeeding, and adverse effects. recommendations were developed on how to report these outcomes where possible.

conclusions: these cos will help standardise outcome reporting in pph trials.

introduction
over 250 000 women die each year from complications of childbirth.1 postpartum haemorrhage (pph) is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide.2 it is usually defined as blood loss of ≥ 500 ml from the genital tract within 24 hours after childbirth.

interventions for pph have been evaluated in a large number of studies. however, evidence is difficult to interpret and compare across studies due to variations in the outcomes measured by researchers. in a study looking at outcomes reported in pph trials published between 1997 and 2015, 121 trials for prevention of pph used 68 different primary outcomes.3 the most commonly reported outcome was assessment of blood loss, with more than ten different cut‐offs specified at times ranging from 30 minutes to 48 hours. there were few data on short‐ and long‐term morbidity or mortality, and few patient‐reported outcomes.

reduction in maternal mortality is part of the sustainable development goals set by the united nations.1 one strategy for achieving this is to ensure that the most effective evidence‐based therapies are used to manage pph, and that global standards follow evidence‐based guidelines.1 recommendations can only be robust if they are based on good‐quality evidence, where interventions are compared using indicators that are standardised and that are important measures of wellbeing.

the aim of this project was to develop consensus among international stakeholders on a set of core outcomes that should be used in trials and systematic reviews to evaluate (1) preventive interventions and (2) therapeutic interventions for women with pph. a secondary aim was to provide guidance on how to report these core outcomes.

methods
the project was registered prospectively with the core outcome measures in effectiveness trials (comet) initiative4 and funded by the british medical association. the protocol was peer‐reviewed by the comet team and funding body. ethics approval was not required.5 the manuscript has been reported in line with the core outcome sets (cos)‐star guidelines for cos reporting.6 methods are summarised in figure s1 and further details are available in appendix s1.

the steering committee included two obstetricians (sm, za), a midwife (ac), and two methodologists/statisticians with expertise in development of cos (jk, pw). a scientific advisory group (sag) was set up to provide multidisciplinary expert input and an international perspective (16 members from ten countries and seven stakeholder groups; appendix s1). seven stakeholder groups were agreed a priori to be relevant to the project (obstetricians, midwives, anaesthetists, haematologists, neonatologists, health strategists/methodologists, and women's representatives).

identification of participants for the delphi survey
our aim was to involve as many participants as possible, with a minimum of ten in each stakeholder group to allow numbers to be meaningful, taking into account possible attrition in round 2.7 the same participants were asked to take both the prevention and treatment pph surveys. participants were identified from published trial reports and cochrane reviews on pph. invitations were also sent through the core outcomes in women's and newborn health (crown) initiative journal editors mailing list.8 women's representatives were invited through the national childbirth trust parent support group (uk) and personal contacts. further invitations to stakeholders were sent out by snowballing with suggestions from the sag, authors contacted and targeted participants. the sag also took a modified delphi survey separately. this was a methodological investigation to assess the impact of group size and number of panels on selection of outcomes for a cos, and will be the subject of a separate paper.

identification of outcomes
to identify outcomes relevant to pph, two systematic reviews of randomised trials were undertaken – one evaluating interventions for prevention of pph (na and za), the other, treatment of pph (sm and za; details in appendix s1). all published outcomes were considered for inclusion in the cos.

the reviews identified 121 randomised trials with 160 different outcomes for prevention of pph and 16 randomised controlled trials with 95 different outcomes for treatment of pph. outcomes were classified under overarching domains (blood loss assessment, mortality and morbidity, use of additional interventions and resources, women's and clinicians’ views, adverse outcomes, and neonatal outcomes). duplicate outcomes were removed, similar outcomes were combined, and variations in methods of reporting each outcome were noted (tables s1 and s2). two outcomes, women's and healthcare professionals’ views, were added by the steering committee. a total of 35 outcomes for prevention of pph and 31 outcomes for treatment of pph were entered into round 1 of the delphi.

delphi survey
a two‐round, anonymised electronic delphi survey was designed on delphimanager9 to obtain consensus on the importance of each outcome among stakeholders. it was decided a priori that results of the delphi would be used to inform the face‐to‐face stakeholder meeting where a final cos would be agreed.

each outcome was listed in the survey with its plain language summary. participants were asked to rate the importance of each outcome between 1 and 9 on a likert scale, with 1–3 being ‘not important’, 3–6 being ‘important but not critical’ and 7–9 being ‘critically important’ to report in trials, or select unable to comment. this scale is recommended by the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation working group.10 participants were invited to suggest additional outcomes for consideration for the cos in round 1 using free‐text responses.

potential participants were invited to register for the study via e‐mail, and the delphi survey was e‐mailed to those who registered. the closing date was set 4 weeks after each round and an e‐mail reminder was sent on days 14, 21, and 28. nonresponders in round 1 were not invited to participate in round 2. nonresponders in round 2 were sent additional emails to improve response rate.

in round 2, participants were able to view anonymised results from the first round, presented as the distribution of scores for each outcome in each stakeholder group separately. this allowed participants to reflect on their choices before completing the second round of the survey. additional relevant outcomes suggested by participants in round 1 were added to round 2 (16 for prevention and 18 for treatment; figures s2 and s3).

we defined consensus for the delphi a priori based on guidance in the comet handbook.7 for inclusion in the cos, outcomes required at least 70% of participants in each stakeholder group to score the outcome as critically important and < 15% to score the outcome as not important. outcomes excluded from the cos required at least 70% of participants in each stakeholder group to score the outcome as not important and < 15% to score the outcome as ‘critical’. if outcomes did not meet either criterion they were classified as outcomes with no consensus.

face‐to‐face meeting
the final phase of the project was a face‐to‐face consensus meeting (liverpool, uk, 16–17 august 2016). twenty‐five people attended the meeting, and each stakeholder group was represented: five obstetricians, three midwives, four women's representatives, five health strategist/methodologists, one anaesthetist, one haematologist, and one neonatologist (appendix s1). findings of the survey were presented and participants were given an opportunity to discuss each outcome. consideration was given as to whether the outcome was relevant in all settings and for all women recruited. outcomes could be re‐named or reconfigured if there was full consensus at the meeting to do so. participants then scored each outcome between 1 and 9 on the likert scale, for inclusion or exclusion in the cos with an anonymous voting system using electronic keypads. consensus at the meeting required a majority of 70% of participants to score the outcome as critically important (7–9) for its inclusion in the cos.

methodology for how to report outcomes
consensus on how to report the cos outcomes was developed on day 2 of the meeting by an expert committee (n = 20; appendix s1). the aim was not to create new definitions but to select a preferred method of reporting the outcome among existing methods in published literature where possible and to make research recommendations where this was not possible.

we used recommended standards on how to report summary results for trial reporting11 and considered the specific metric on how to measure the outcome, the method of data aggregation (continuous or categorical) and the time frame in which to measure the outcome. variations in outcome reporting were presented and expert presentations were delivered. options were discussed, and scored. consensus was defined a priori as > 70% of participants voting for a preferred option of reporting, and majority view was defined as > 50% of participants preferring one option from among the top three options, thereby indicating the strength of the recommendation.

results
survey participants came from 36 different countries (figure s4), and represented all seven stakeholder groups. for round 1 of the delphi, 205 participants responded to the prevention of pph survey and 197 to the treatment survey. round 2 was completed by 74% (152/205) and 73% (143/197) of participants, respectively (table 1). overall, 77% of those who took the survey had exposure to pph either through personal experience or through caring for women who had experienced pph. among women's representatives, 41% had experienced a pph.

assessment of outcomes for the prevention and treatment of pph cos is shown in figure 1. delphi consensus was reached for including five outcomes in the cos for prevention of pph and ten outcomes in the cos for treatment of pph. no outcomes fulfilled criteria for exclusion. there was no consensus on the remaining outcomes. after discussing these results at the face‐to face meeting, the final cos included nine outcomes for prevention and 12 outcomes for treatment of pph. at least one outcome from each domain was included in both cos, and there was significant overlap in outcomes included between the two cos.

pph prevention cos
for the evaluation of interventions for prevention of pph, the final cos outcomes are presented in table 2. at the stakeholder meeting, all outcomes that met the delphi consensus criteria were included in the cos except for hysterectomy. although stakeholders at the meeting agreed that hysterectomy was an important outcome, it was not felt to be critically important in the context of trials for pph prevention because it is a very rare event. although rare but critically important outcomes are also important to include in a cos, and the outcome ‘maternal mortality’ has been included, there was consensus that the pph prevention cos would be more informative if it captured other measures of maternal morbidity for which data were more likely to be available from trials rather than having a cos with few data available for multiple outcomes. blood loss was thought to be an important outcome for pph trials to report, although difficulties in assessing it were acknowledged. four additional outcomes were included in the pph prevention cos subsequent to stakeholder discussions and voting. two of these outcomes, ‘use of blood transfusion’ and ‘use of additional uterotonics’ were borderline for inclusion in the delphi survey (table 2). the outcomes ‘transfer to intensive therapy unit’ and ‘transfer to a higher facility’ in the delphi were reconfigured at the stakeholder meeting to ‘transfer to a higher level of care’ to capture data on an escalation in the level of care required for the woman, which, it was recognised, would depend on the initial setting of the woman. there was also consensus among stakeholders at the meeting that patient‐reported outcomes, although not included in the delphi consensus, were important to include in the cos, and this was strongly advocated by the women's representatives. it was felt that these should capture a woman's sense of wellbeing, as well as acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention. among outcomes in the neonatal domain, there was consensus that breastfeeding would be an important outcome as a pph may impact on a woman's wellness and ability to establish or maintain breastfeeding if she intended to breastfeed, or there could be a potential impact of the intervention on breast milk itself.

pph treatment cos
for the evaluation of interventions for treatment of pph, the final cos is presented in table 3. nine of the ten outcomes that met the delphi consensus criteria were included in the final cos. two very similar outcomes – ‘shock’ and ‘maternal resuscitation due to shock’ – were both included by the delphi survey. hence, consensus at the stakeholder meeting was to include ‘shock’ only in preference to ‘maternal resuscitation due to shock’ as the latter would be more complex to measure. the outcome disseminated intravascular coagulation was renamed as coagulopathy based on recommendations by haematologists because coagulopathy is the more accurate term; disseminated intravascular coagulation does not have a validated definition in pph and constitutes only a small subset of coagulopathies associated with pph. multiple organ failure was renamed as ‘any organ dysfunction’, in line with the recommendations of the world health organization (who) on how to capture severe pregnancy complications including organ dysfunction in the who near‐miss approach for maternal health.12 a number of outcomes in the delphi survey aimed at capturing failure of initial treatment – for example, use of additional medical or advanced surgical interventions such as balloon insertion or uterine artery embolisation or ligation. however, at the meeting it was recognised that type of escalation of therapy would depend on the trial intervention itself – medical or surgical. therefore, these outcomes were reconfigured into the outcome ‘use of any additional haemostatic intervention’ to capture failure of the trial intervention itself, as this would be applicable to all trials, regardless of the intervention they were evaluating. the other outcomes added were a woman's sense of wellbeing and acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention, and breastfeeding as specified above in the prevention of pph cos.

how to report cos outcomes
the expert committee recommendations on how to report the cos outcomes are presented in table 4, along with explanations. most recommendations were agreed by consensus. those agreed by majority view included reporting of hysterectomies specifically carried out to stop pph, to avoid confounding data with hysterectomies carried out prophylactically or for other indications. for time frames for measuring outcomes, there was consensus that in the context of randomised trials, outcome data should be collected from the point of randomisation. the time limit up to which outcomes should be measured was left to triallists for most outcomes, to accommodate for local protocols and resource availability. however, a majority view recommendation was put forward for blood loss to be assessed (measured or estimated) up to cessation of active bleeding, as this is an area where standardisation is particularly lacking and time‐frame selection is likely to impact on data significantly. for hysterectomy, the majority recommendation was to report it at least up to hospital discharge as most hysterectomies are likely to occur by that time in the context of pph.
for the patient‐reported outcomes and breastfeeding, it was felt by the stakeholder groups that further work was needed to develop tools to capture what aspects of these outcomes were most important to women in the context of a pph.

discussion
main findings
consensus on pph cos was developed among an international panel of stakeholders through a delphi survey and face‐to‐face meeting. for the evaluation of interventions for prevention of pph, nine core outcomes were selected and for treatment of pph, 12 core outcomes were selected. expert committee recommendations where developed on how to report each outcome where possible, and a research agenda was set for two outcomes where this was not possible.

strengths and limitations
this project has several strengths. first, the methodology was defined a priori based on guidelines by the comet initiative.7 the delphi exercise has the advantage of including views of a larger number of geographically distant participants. participants in the delphi were still able to consider the views of other stakeholder groups in round 2, to reconsider their opinion without being overly influenced by domineering individuals. results were further refined at the face‐to‐face meeting, which allowed for rich discussions as well as the ability to debate and persuade others. second, stakeholders came from a range of relevant specialties. importantly, consumer representatives, who are sometimes overlooked in similar projects,23, 24 were included at all stages of the process. there was representation from both those who had and had not experienced pph. our parent representatives impacted the final cos outcomes by influencing other stakeholders at the face‐to‐face meeting to include patient‐reported outcomes. third, there was representation from a wide range of countries of variable income status in the delphi and at the face‐to‐face meeting, so that the cos developed would be applicable across different settings. fourth, we have developed cos for both prevention and treatment of pph to cover the full spectrum of pph intervention trials. it is not surprising that there is significant overlap in outcomes selected for the two cos. however, the pph treatment cos appropriately includes more outcomes that capture significant maternal morbidity in the presence of an established pph. and finally, a cos often tells researchers what outcomes to use, but not how to report them, making it difficult to achieve adequate standardisation; we have developed expert committee recommendations on how to report the outcomes selected for pph cos to provide better guidance to researchers.

the limitations of this project are that outcomes were obtained largely from systematic reviews and participants in the delphi exercise; we did not conduct formal interviews with women. second, we asked participants to identify one key stakeholder group to which they belonged. some participants may have belonged to more than one stakeholder group and this may have influenced how they scored outcomes, but data are not available to explore this further. third, representations from each stakeholder group were not equal; this may have impacted on the outcomes selected. finally, although we have developed guidance on how to report cos outcomes, these recommendations are from a small group of experts, and have not been subjected to the same rigorous delphi process in a large group. however, it is debatable whether a delphi process is the optimum method for developing consensus on how to report outcomes. more complex discussions may need to be undertaken for consensus on measurement instruments by stakeholders who may be different from those partaking in the ‘what to measure’ delphi. generic methodological guidelines on how to select standardised instrument measures for outcomes have recently been published.25 they recommend identifying all possible measurement instruments for an outcome, and selecting one with high quality of evidence for good validity and internal consistency, that is feasible to measure in the target population. these guidelines have not yet been applied prospectively for cos in maternal health. our systematic reviews identified the different ways in which cos outcomes have been reported, and the feasibility of applying the instruments in an international setting was considered when making recommendations on how to report outcomes. although validity may be excellent for the more objective outcomes included in the cos, such as units of blood transfusion or maternal death, measurement tools for other outcomes such as blood loss are well known for their poor accuracy.

interpretation
to our knowledge, there is no other published cos for pph. these cos include outcomes that capture meaningful morbidity (shock, hysterectomy, organ dysfunction) and mortality. they also include outcomes with high event rates upon which sample size calculations could be based for smaller studies (blood loss, use of additional uterotonics, blood transfusion). resource use may be assessed through use of additional interventions and level of care such as intensive therapy unit’ use. patient‐reported outcomes (wellbeing and satisfaction) and breastfeeding are also captured but require further qualitative research on how best to measure these outcomes. until further data are available, we would encourage researchers to clearly report the measures that they have used.

although these outcomes aim to assess the impact of interventions evaluated on severity of pph, some outcomes may be influenced by local practices. for example, thresholds used for transfusing blood or transferring a woman for higher level of care may vary across trial settings and studies. for such outcomes we would encourage authors to interpret results bearing the potential impact of local practices in mind.

we would recommend that researchers evaluating interventions for pph should report these cos outcomes as a minimum, along with any other outcomes of interest to their study. where these cos are not reported, researchers are encouraged to provide an explanation, for transparency and to reduce the risk of reporting bias. future trials evaluating interventions for pph should report any barriers identified to data collection for these cos outcomes. cos may be updated to provide guidance in response to such feedback.

conclusions
the pph cos, developed through an international multidisciplinary effort, will help standardise outcome reporting in this area, and facilitate comparison of data across studies, to guide clinical practice. we recommend that researchers evaluating interventions for pph prevention and treatment should report these cos outcomes as a minimum, along with any other outcomes of interest. further work is needed on how to best to report women's sense of wellbeing, acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention and breastfeeding in the context of pph.

abstract
background: improving the completeness of reporting of biomedical research is essential for improving its usability. for this reason, hundreds of reporting guidelines have been created in the last few decades but adherence to these remains suboptimal. this survey aims to inform future evaluations of interventions to improve adherence to reporting guidelines. in particular, it gathers editors’ perceptions of a range of interventions at various stages in the editorial process.  
methods: we surveyed biomedical journal editors that were knowledgeable about this topic. the questionnaire included open and closed questions that explored (i) the current practice of their journals, (ii) their perceptions of the ease of implementation of different interventions and the potential effectiveness of these at improving adherence to reporting guidelines, (iii) the barriers and facilitators associated with these interventions, and (iv) suggestions for future interventions and incentives.
results: of the 99 editors invited, 24 (24%) completed the survey. involving trained editors or administrative staff was deemed the potentially most effective intervention but, at the same time, it was considered moderately difficult to implement due to logistic and resource issues. participants believed that checking adherence to guidelines goes beyond the role of peer reviewers and were concerned that the quality of peer review could be compromised. reviewers are generally not expected to focus on reporting issues but on providing an expert view on the importance, novelty, and relevance of the manuscript. journals incentivising adherence, and publishers and medical institutions encouraging journals to take action to boost adherence were two recurrent themes.
conclusions: biomedical journal editors generally believed that engaging trained professionals would be the most effective, yet resource intensive, editorial intervention. also, they thought that peer reviewers should not be asked to check rgs. future evaluations of interventions can take into account the barriers, facilitators, and incentives described in this survey.

introduction
transparent and accurate reporting of research is essential for increasing the usability of available research evidence. reporting guidelines (rgs) can be useful tools to help authors report research methods and findings in a way that they can be understood by readers, replicated by researchers, used by health care professionals to make clinical decisions, and included in systematic reviews1. since the inception in 1996 of the consolidated standards of reporting trials (consort) for the reporting of randomised controlled trials (rcts)2, more than 400 rgs for different study types, data, and clinical areas have been developed. these rgs can be found in the library of the enhancing the quality and transparency of health research (equator) network3.

biomedical authors’ adherence to rgs has been observed to be suboptimal4. consequently, in recent years various stakeholders have proposed, and sometimes evaluated, the impact of different types of interventions to improve this adherence. these interventions were identified and classified in a recently published scoping review5. we found that the strategies most widely used by journals have been shown not to have the desired effect6–9 and this highlighted the need for the implementation and evaluation of the other interventions proposed5.

this paper reports a survey aimed to inform the future evaluation of interventions to improve adherence to rgs. in particular, we focused on interventions that can be implemented at various points in the editorial process. our specific objectives were to explore the perceived ease of implementation of different interventions and the potential effectiveness of these at improving adherence to rgs; to map the barriers and facilitators associated with these interventions; to determine possible solutions to overcome the barriers described, and to identify further editorial interventions that could be implemented and subsequently evaluated.

methods

participants
purposive sampling was used to recruit biomedical editors that were expected to be knowledgeable and experienced in the topic we aimed to explore. we recruited participants not based on their representativeness of all medical journals but on the fact that they were “information-rich cases”10.

participants were sampled from three sources: (i) editors of journals that had published studies describing interventions to improve adherence to rgs identified in our scoping review5, (ii) members of the methods in research on research (miror) network with current editorial positions and (iii) editors of the top-10 journals (based on impact factor) of bmj publishing group which, apart from being one of the partner institutions of miror, has published the main rgs2,11–13) and has traditionally performed research to improve the transparency and quality of biomedical publications14. the authors of this survey who met the eligibility criteria were excluded as potential participants.

recruitment
the survey was only open to editors that we invited to participate. we contacted three editors (including the editors-in-chief) of each of the sampled journals, as well as individual editors from the group (ii) above. by replying to our invitation email, participants could suggest further editors that they considered could contribute to the survey. to contact editors not known to us we sought email addresses in the public domain. the survey was not advertised on any website.

survey administration
the survey was administered by surveymonkey15 and was open between 27 november 2018 and 24 february 2019. participants were sent a personalised email inviting them to complete an online survey investigating their opinions about different editorial interventions to improve author adherence to rgs. each invitation was tied to a unique email address. two reminders to complete the survey were sent to non-responders at four and eight weeks after the initial mailing.

participants could edit their responses while completing the survey. however, they could not re-enter the survey once it was completed as no two entries from the same ip address were allowed. we did not offer any incentives for completing the survey.

response rates
we recorded the view rate of the invitation email (subjects opening the invitation email/subjects invited), the response rate (subjects completing the survey/subjects invited), and the completion rate (subjects completing the survey/subjects completing the first question of the survey).

questionnaire development
our previous scoping review5 identified 31 interventions targeting different stakeholders in the research process. for use in this survey we chose a smaller subset of nine interventions that could be implemented during the editorial process as our focus was on journal editors’ perceptions (see box 1).

box 1. interventions included and their targets
a. interventions targeting authors:

• a requirement for authors to submit a completed rg checklist (using all appropriate extensions, if applicable) indicating the page numbers where each item is addressed (intervention 1)

• a requirement for authors to submit a populated rg checklist with text from their manuscript in order to facilitate the peer review process (intervention 2)

• a requirement for authors to highlight in the manuscript where each rg item is addressed (intervention 3)

• a requirement for authors to include new subheadings within their manuscript corresponding to different rg items within the traditional imrad format (introduction, methods, results, and discussion) (intervention 4)

• a requirement for authors on submission to use a freely available writing aid tool that guides authors through the rg checklist items, shows the key elements that need to be reported, and includes examples of adequate reporting (e.g. cobweb) (intervention 5)

b. interventions targeting peer reviewers:

• instruct peer reviewers to use the appropriate rgs when assessing a manuscript (intervention 6)

• instruct peer reviewers to scrutinise the completed rg checklist submitted by the authors and check its consistency with the information reported in the manuscript (intervention 7)

c. interventions targeting editorial staff:

• an evaluation of the completeness of reporting by a trained editor (or editorial assistant), who would return incomplete manuscripts to authors before considering the manuscript for publication (intervention 8)

d. interventions targeting authors, peer reviewers, and editors:

• training for authors, peer reviewers, and editors on the importance, content, and use of rgs (e.g. the equator network toolkits) (intervention 9)

the survey combined open and closed response questions to seek participants’ perceptions of a series of interventions to improve authors’ adherence to rgs that could potentially be implemented during the editorial process. we pilot tested the draft survey questionnaire with two collaborators of the miror project who currently hold editorial positions. they were asked to review the survey for its clarity and completeness and to provide suggestions on how to improve its structure.

based on feedback from the pilot we decided not to include the intervention “implementation of the automatic tool statreviewer16” since participants were not aware of this software and stated that their perceptions would strongly depend on details about how it operates which are not publicly available.

the survey combined open and closed response questions to seek participants’ perceptions of a series of interventions to improve authors’ adherence to rgs that could potentially be implemented during the editorial process. we structured the questionnaire (see figure s1, extended data17) as follows:

part 1: current practice. participants were asked to describe the measures their journal currently takes to improve adherence to rgs.

part 2: perceptions of nine potential interventions. participants were asked to indicate on 5-point likert scales (i) how easy it would be (or was) to implement these interventions at their journals (1-very difficult, 2-moderately difficult, 3-neither difficult nor easy, 4-moderately easy, 5-very easy) and (ii) how effective they thought the interventions would be (or was) at improving adherence to rgs if these were implemented at their journals (1-very ineffective, 2-moderately ineffective, 3-neither ineffective nor effective, 4-moderately effective, 5-very effective). we included images to clarify meanings and context to prompt participants to think about the benefits and drawbacks of the interventions. free text boxes were included so participants could justify their responses.

part 3: identifying the barriers and facilitators. participants were asked to choose which intervention they considered potentially the most effective for their journal at improving adherence to rgs. they were asked to describe (i) why they thought that intervention would be the most effective, (ii) what the main difficulties in implementing that intervention would be, and (iii) how they would try to overcome these difficulties.

part 4: further interventions. participants were asked for further suggestions of possible interventions, including modifications and combinations of the interventions previously discussed.

part 5: demographic questions.

the survey was distributed over 18 pages with 1 to 3 items per page. these items were not randomised.

data analysis
for quantitative data (part 2 of the questionnaire), we used r version 3.6.018. as these data were ordinal, we calculated medians together and the 1st and 3rd quartiles. we excluded from the analysis one questionnaire where the participant just opened the survey and left without answering any question. we did not exclude any questionnaire based on the amount of time that the participant needed to complete it.

for qualitative information, the lead investigator (db) used the software program nvivo 1219. we mapped the barriers and facilitators for each of the interventions explored, as well as other key themes such as the incentives for the use of rg and the implementation of further editorial strategies. the initial mapping made by the lead investigator was discussed with another investigator (ss) and subsequently refined.

for part 1 of the survey (current practice) the unit of measure were the journals and therefore editors of the same journal were grouped. this was due to the fact that participants’ answers represented an overarching policy and not an individual’s opinion. for all other parts of the survey (part 2 to part 5), we analysed editors’ responses independently, no matter what their journal was.

ethics approval & informed consent
the research committee of the governing council of the universitat politècnica de catalunya (upc) granted ethical approval for this study (reference ec 01, date 2 may 2018).

in the invitation email, we informed survey participants that (i) the completion of the survey indicated consent to participate, (ii) they were free to stop and withdraw from the study at any time without providing a reason, (iii) the estimated time to complete the survey was 15 minutes, (iv) any identifiable information obtained in connection with this survey would remain confidential, and (v) the results would be submitted for publication and the anonymised dataset would be made publicly available in the zenodo repository. the original dataset was kept in a password-protected folder in google drive.

reporting guidelines
we consulted the checklist for reporting of results of internet e-surveys (cherries)20 and the consolidated criteria for reporting of qualitative research (coreq)21 guidelines to produce this research report.

results
of the 99 editors invited, 42 opened the invitation (view rate 42%), and 24 completed the survey (response rate 24%) from the 25 who started it (completion rate 96%). the average time spent completing the survey was 15 minutes (sd = 8.5 minutes). among the 24 participants who completed the survey, nine (37%) worked for seven different journals that had published studies on improving adherence to rgs, seven (29%) worked for five top-10 bmj journals, four (17%) were members of the miror network that hold editorial positions in four journals, and a further four (17%) were suggested by other participants based on their expertise on the topic and were editors of three different journals. the 20 journals represented in the survey are listed in table 1.

participants had a variety of editorial roles (editor-in-chief, senior editor, associate editor or others). most of them were involved in manuscript decision-making and had less than 15 years of experience as journal editors (see table 2). the anonymised responses from all 24 participants can be accessed in zenodo22.

current practice
respondents worked at 19 journals. most respondents’ journals (11/19, 58%) request authors to submit a completed rg checklist with page numbers indicating where the items are addressed when they submit their manuscript. a further seven (37%) instruct but do not request authors to do it, and one (5%) does not request or instruct authors. among the journals requesting the submission of checklists, four (4/11, 36%) also explicitly ask peer reviewers to use the completed rgs when assessing manuscripts, one (1/11, 9%) asks peer reviewers general questions about the completeness of reporting, and one performs an evaluation of the completeness of reporting by a trained editor using rgs before the initial decision is made on the manuscript. we observed no incongruences between the answers of editors from the same journal. some respondents mentioned that in their journals (n=4) the interventions described were only applicable to the study types corresponding to the most established rgs (consort, prisma11, or strobe12) for trials, observational studies and systematic reviews respectively.

perceptions of nine potential interventions
the mean scores for perceived ease of implementation and potential effectiveness for each intervention are shown in figure 1.

figure 1. scores for perceived ease of implementation and perceived effectiveness.
box plots show the 1st, 2nd (medians, represented as blue horizontal lines), and 3rd quartiles of the data. the whiskers extend up to 1.5 times the interquartile range from the top (bottom) of the box to the furthest datum within that distance. interventions whose names are shown in red target authors, those in brown target peer reviewers, the one in grey target editors or administrative staff and the one in green targets all these stakeholders. box 1 shows a detailed explanation of each intervention.

the two most common interventions were considered the easiest ones to implement: the median scores (1st, 3rd quartiles) for requesting authors to submit checklists with page numbers (intervention 1) and for asking peer reviewers to use rgs (intervention 6) were 5 (q1: 4, q3: 5) and 4 (q1: 3, q3: 5), respectively. by contrast, interventions related to training (intervention 9), editor involvement in checking completeness of reporting (intervention 8) and reformatting of the text based on rg requirements (intervention 4, intervention 5) were considered the most difficult to implement.

an evaluation of the completeness of reporting by a trained editor was considered the most effective intervention at improving adherence to rgs (median: 4, q1: 4, q3: 5) and the two targeting peer reviewers (interventions 6 and 7) were perceived as being the least effective (median: 4, q1: 2, q3: 4; median: 3, q1: 2, q3: 4).

identifying the barriers and facilitators
this section presents the perceived barriers and facilitators of the interventions considered and editors’ suggestions for making the interventions more effective. table s1 in extended data17 shows a full description of these.

a) interventions targeting authors (1–5)

the main barriers associated with all of the interventions targeting authors was that authors have to state their adherence to the relevant rg and this does not equate to actual compliance. moreover, it is resource intensive for journals to check that these requirements are appropriately met by authors. some editors highlighted that interventions 3, 4, and 5 would involve special formatting of the submitted manuscript, which could be cumbersome for authors given that manuscripts are often submitted to multiple journals with different formats before being accepted. this is particularly relevant for journals with high rejection rates as it could cause frustration for authors. some participants mentioned logistical issues as their journal’s manuscript tracking system is not set up to accommodate these interventions. in addition, changes in the manuscript’s format could be incompatible with the journal’s house style.

intervention 1 was generally considered quick and straightforward for authors, but several participants indicated that there is published empirical evidence of little effectiveness if the checklist is not assessed by a trained editor or administrator5–8.

as interventions 3, 4, and 5 force authors to tailor the manuscript to rg requirements, participants reported that these could make editors’ and peer reviewers’ jobs easier as the manuscript would be better structured. importantly, readers would also be able to locate information more easily. some editors pointed out that, to make these interventions effective, journals would need to provide templates to authors or to integrate these interventions in the submission system. however, some of these interventions (interventions 2 and 5) were seen as more effective if they were implemented earlier on in the research process, prior to writing the manuscript.

b) interventions targeting peer reviewers (6, 7)

most respondents were negative about the potential effectiveness of implementing the two interventions targeting peer reviewers (intervention 6 and 7) as they felt these would create too much additional work for reviewers. participants were concerned that the quality of peer review could be compromised as reviewers are not expected to focus on reporting issues but on providing an expert view on the importance, novelty and relevance of the manuscript. furthermore, peer reviewers may not know which rgs to use and, even if they do, the effectiveness would be dependent on their willingness to use rgs and their expertise in applying them. several participants indicated that this work should be delegated to paid editorial staff.

c) interventions targeting editorial staff (8)

this intervention was considered difficult to implement but potentially effective. the main facilitating factor for its successful implementation was that it is performed by a paid or trained professional, which lends credibility to the intervention, reduces the workload of unpaid peer reviewers, and avoids authors overclaiming adherence. the main barriers outlined for this intervention were (i) the budget issues the journal would need to face to train or hire additional editorial staff that could perform the evaluation, especially if the journal receives a large volume of manuscripts, (ii) the editorial delays it may cause, and the (iii) the potential inefficiency of assistant editors or administrators having to delegate decisions in case of doubt, given that sometimes assessing completeness of reporting is a subjective task.

to make this intervention more feasible for journals, editors suggested that the completeness of reporting evaluation could be performed only for manuscripts that are sent out for peer review and, it could be focused on a few core items (different for each rg) that would enable reproducibility. if this intervention was implemented in a journal that requires the submission of a completed checklist, editors could take advantage of the checklist to locate information.

d) interventions targeting authors, peer reviewers and editors (9)

training was seen as a potentially effective intervention but difficult to implement. some participants highlighted that training with follow up sessions would be resource intensive for journals, and especially difficult to enforce. one participant mentioned that credits (such as cme credits23) could be used to recognise hours of training. the fact that sometimes the editorial staff is based in different places and zones makes it crucial to consider flexible forms of training, such as online courses. as an example, the equator network toolkits section provides resources for authors, peer reviewers and journal editors24. however, some participants emphasised that training should also be delivered by research institutions and medical centres.

further interventions and incentives for authors and journals
when asked about further potentially effective interventions that were not discussed in the survey, some editors mentioned statreviewer, a reading tool that automatically assesses adherence to rgs and is currently under evaluation16. other respondents also mentioned the possibility of combining some of the interventions discussed in the survey, such as requiring the submission of checklists and trained editors assessing the responses with the information reported in the manuscript.

moreover, several incentives for authors were listed, including (i) discounts on article processing charges (apcs) for authors that comply with rg requirements, (ii) academic institutions including rg use in the promotion and tenure files, and (iii) credits (such as cme credits23) to recognise hours of training on the use of rgs. journals could also be encouraged to implement certain interventions if (i) there is empirical evidence that these interventions actually improve the reporting quality of the papers or (ii) publishers or the international committee of medical journal editors (icmje) mandate these as a condition of submission to their journals. even if some of these interventions are proven to be effective, some respondents reported that it is essential to convince publishers that improving the quality of reporting is a worthy investment to resource.

discussion
this survey explores biomedical journal editors’ perceptions of the practical aspects of the implementation of different interventions to improve adherence to rgs.

several messages arise from this study. first of all, most editors agreed that the most effective way to improve adherence to rgs is for journals to involve trained editors or administrative staff. interventions targeting these stakeholders were considered to be difficult to implement for most journals, either because of logistic or resource issues. however, improving the performance of editorial staff is critical25 and has been shown to have a positive impact on completeness of reporting in the context of a dentistry journal26. to make these type of interventions more feasible, journals could implement them only for manuscripts that are sent out for peer review. the editorial staff could also take advantage of the rg checklists submitted by authors, that could be automatically populated with text using specific software such as the the tool proposed by hawwash et al.27

most editors considered that checking reporting issues is beyond the role of peer reviewers. given the voluntary nature of peer review, requiring reviewers to use rgs would cause an additional workload that could compromise the overall quality of the reviews. if checking reporting issues becomes a standard exercise for peer reviewers, some editors are concerned that peer reviewers may be less likely to comment on important aspects of a manuscript, such as its novelty, clinical interest or implications. furthermore, as finding peer reviewers is becoming increasingly difficult for editors28, these requirements could make them even less willing to review papers. additionally, some editors considered that the average peer reviewer does not have enough expertise to go over rg requirements.

we observed that the interventions perceived as potentially most effective improving adherence to rgs appear to be more difficult to implement. conversely, the most common strategies seem to have been implemented based on their feasibility and not on their potential to improve completeness of reporting. this could be one of the reasons why they have failed to achieve the desired results6–9). some of our respondents insisted that a key element is that journals, universities, and medical institutions find ways to incentivise author’s compliance with rgs. at the same time, the scientific community needs to find ways to convince publishers that improving the quality of reporting is a worthy investment so that publishers can encourage their journals to adopt strategies to boost completeness of reporting. a recent article indicates that implementing rgs through the editorial process may increase the number of citations to the research reported29.

a common observation by the survey participants was that the effectiveness of the interventions proposed could depend on the types of articles considered. while rgs for randomised trial protocols, randomised trials or systematic reviews are more established, some others, including most rg extensions, are not well known to the stakeholders involved in the publication process. for this reason, it is important for journals to be clear in their “instructions for authors” on what rgs they mandate.

it is noteworthy to mention that, regardless of how checklists are implemented in the editorial process and who has to engage to make the interventions successful, the evaluation of completeness of reporting is a subjective task. this is mainly due to the fact that rgs are not originally designed as evaluation tools but as guidance for authors on how to report their research. for this reason, evaluators could sometimes have different views on whether authors are providing enough information to consider that certain rg items are adequately reported.

this study is subject to several limitations. the response rate was low (24%). however, researchers in health science have witnessed a gradual decrease in survey participation over time30, especially among health professionals due to the demanding work schedules and increasing frequency of being approached for surveys31. some recent surveys in the field of peer review show even lower response rates (10–20%) among researchers, peer reviewers and readers32,33. it is also noteworthy that we took a pragmatic approach to identify relevant editors and the sample was small due to not many having conducted or published research on improving adherence to rgs. whilst n=24 is a small number, the detailed and rich responses that we received showed a high level of engagement with the topic. despite having the option to increase the sample size by contacting more editors at a lower level of hierarchy in the journals we targeted, we decided not to do it based on the response rate of the survey. that approach would have changed our sampling frame and we would potentially have had less experienced editors commenting. we took that decision as the purpose of the survey was to tap into the experience of those who had tried interventions or had shown interest in this area, instead of seeking a representative sample of editors.

connected with this, we could expect survey participants to be more prone to adopt interventions than general biomedical editors. however, their experience could also make them more critical of certain strategies that appear to be more effective than they actually are. this could be the case for the intervention of requesting authors to submit checklists on manuscript submission, which has become popular among medical journals despite having little or no impact on completeness of reporting6–9). editors with less experience of editorial strategies to improve adherence to rgs might expect authors and peer reviewers to respond to certain interventions in a different way than they would do.

we encourage researchers to perform further evaluations of interventions in collaboration with biomedical journals, such as the rct our research team is currently undergoing34. our study aims to evaluate the effect on completeness of reporting of a trained researcher assessing during peer review the consistency between the consort checklists submitted by authors and the information reported in the manuscript, and providing authors with a report indicating any inconsistencies found.

providing high quality evidence of the effectiveness of different interventions at improving adherence to rgs and discussing how to make them less burdensome are key aspects needed to convince all stakeholders that this effort is worth it.

conclusions
biomedical journal editors generally believed that engaging trained professionals in the process of checking adherence to rgs would be the most effective, yet moderately resource intensive, editorial intervention. also, they thought that standard peer reviewers should not be asked to check rg requirements.

future evaluations of interventions to improve adherence to rgs can take into account the barriers, facilitators, and incentives for implementing editorial interventions that are described in this survey.

summary
background
the suitability of disease activity indices has been challenged, with growing interest in objective measures of inflammation.

aim
to undertake a systematic review of efficacy and safety outcomes in placebo‐controlled randomised controlled trials (rcts) of patients with crohn's disease.

methods
medline, embase, cinahl and cochrane library were searched until november 2015, for rcts of adult crohn's disease patients treated with medical or surgical therapies. data on efficacy and safety outcomes, end‐point definitions, and measurement instruments were extracted and stratified by publication date (pre‐2009 and 2009 onwards).

results
one hundred and eighty‐one rcts (110 induction and 71 maintenance) were identified, including 23 850 patients. about 92.3% reported clinical efficacy endpoints. the crohn's disease activity index (cdai) dominated, defining clinical response or remission in 63.5% of trials (35 definitions of response or remission). cdai < 150 was the commonest endpoint, but reporting reduced between periods (46.4%‐41.1%), whilst use of cdai100 increased (16.8%‐30.4%). fistula studies most commonly reported fistula closure (9, 90.0%). reporting of biomarker, endoscopy and histology endpoints increased overall (33.3%‐40.6%, 14.4%‐30.4% and 3.2%‐12.5%, respectively), but were heterogeneous and rarely reported in fistula trials. patient‐reported outcome measures were reported in 41.4% of trials and safety endpoints in 35.4%. many of the common adverse events relate to disease exacerbation or treatment failure.

conclusions
trial endpoints vary across studies, over time and are distinct in fistula studies. despite growth in reporting of objective measures of inflammation and in patient‐reported outcome measures, there is a lack of standardisation. this confirms the need for a core outcome set for comparative effectiveness research in crohn's disease.

1 introduction
defining the key outcomes of therapeutic interventions and the best way to measure those outcomes is essential for clinical and regulatory decision‐making. due to the complexity of crohn's disease and the multitude of treatments, a number of different outcomes and outcome measures have been reported in clinical trials including symptom scores, composite disease activity indices and quality of life questionnaires.1, 2 decision‐making also relies on the availability of good information on the unintended effects (harms) from treatments.

heterogeneity in reporting of outcomes or measurement instruments within clinical trials may hinder the comparison of results within systematic reviews and inhibit the meaningful interpretation of individual studies.3 one way to mitigate this problem is the introduction of an agreed minimum set of standardised outcomes, to be measured and reported in all trials for a particular condition, referred to as a core outcome set.4 there is no core outcome set for crohn's disease, although a model has been proposed for classifying outcomes for all inflammatory bowel diseases using the world health organisation international classification of functioning, disability and health (icf).5 recently, the international consortium for health outcomes measurement developed a “standard set” for inflammatory bowel disease with recommendations for the pragmatic measurement of outcomes in routine care to support benchmarking.6 also recently published is a study protocol for the development of a core outcome set for inflammatory bowel disease7 and a core outcome set for fistulising crohn's disease,8 indicating the importance of this research area. future trial design and core outcome set development for crohn's disease would benefit from a systematic synthesis of outcome reporting across published clinical trials, incorporating statistical testing and consideration of adverse events.

in this study, we systematically reviewed the literature to extract data on the outcomes and measurement instruments used, and the safety outcomes reported, in randomised clinical trials (rcts) of treatments for crohn's disease. our aims were to explore the extent of heterogeneity among existing trials, to examine time trends in reporting and to generate insights to support future trial design and core outcome set development. our results extend beyond the recently published literature in this area by including a broader set of interventions, offering statistical testing of time trends in outcome reporting and bringing new evidence on harms reporting in crohn's disease.8, 9

2 methods
2.1 systematic search
we registered review protocols with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (prospero) database (crd42016027656 http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero) and the core outcome measures in effectiveness trials (comet) database (http://www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/867).

we conducted a systematic electronic search of the cochrane register of controlled trials (central), embase, medline and the cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature (cinahl) until november 2015, with no date limits. the disease term “crohn's disease” and the key word “outcome” were used. see tables s1 to s4 for detailed search criteria.

2.2 eligibility criteria and study selection
randomised control trials of drug therapies (corticosteroids, 5‐asas, immunosuppressants, biologics and antibiotics), surgery and nondrug therapies (enteral nutrition, complementary and alternative medicine, probiotics and prebiotics) were included, as were rcts of treatments for complications (strictures, fissures, abscesses and perforations). eligible trials were conducted in adult patients (aged 18 or over) with crohn's disease. studies of inflammatory bowel disease populations were eligible provided outcomes were reported separately for crohn's disease. studies had to be published as full text in english.

duplicates were removed after a complete list of rcts was generated. two reviewers (hc and jk) independently assessed the sample of 100 studies against eligibility criteria at the title and abstract screening stages and resolved discrepancies by discussion. a random sample of 100 was selected for review due to time constraints. the sample was generated by assigning each article a number and using a random number generator. there were no issues found when screening the 100 articles and the primary researcher (hc) screened the remaining papers independently. full copies were obtained of all potentially eligible studies and reassessed against eligibility criteria by the primary researcher (hc). reference was made to the second reviewer (jk) where needed.

2.3 data collection
data were extracted from the studies by the primary researcher. a randomly generated sample of 10 studies were reviewed and data extracted by the primary researcher and the secondary researcher (jk) checked the extraction. no inaccuracies were found in the data extraction of the sample of 10 papers and the primary researcher extracted data from the remaining papers independently. studies were categorised as induction or maintenance with subcategories of medical vs surgical induction and maintenance of medically induced vs surgically induced remission. rcts focusing solely on patients with fistulising disease were flagged to identify differences in reported outcomes. efficacy and safety outcomes were recorded as reported as primary or secondary outcomes, or not specified as either. the efficacy outcomes were categorised in line with the method used by ma et al10 as clinical or composite‐clinical, endoscopic, histologic, biomarkers and patient‐reported outcomes (pros). safety‐related outcomes were recorded as primary or secondary outcomes.

adverse event reporting was recorded in specific categories: adverse events, serious adverse events, treatment‐related adverse events, treatment‐related serious adverse events, study withdrawal, abnormal laboratory results and adverse events by preferred term according to the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra).11 study withdrawals were categorised as due to adverse events, serious adverse events, treatment‐related adverse events, treatment‐related serious adverse events, treatment failure (insufficient therapeutic effect, exacerbation of crohn's disease, development of complications or need for additional therapy, surgery or hospitalisation) or other reasons (protocol noncompliance, lost to follow‐up, prohibited medicine use or withdrawal of consent).

a critique of the methodological quality of the studies was unnecessary, as this project did not involve synthesis of outcome data.

2.4 synthesis of results and analysis
a comprehensive record of efficacy and safety outcomes was generated and organised by outcome type. our main analysis of efficacy outcomes focused on those designated as primary or secondary endpoints. we adopted a similar approach for safety‐related outcomes but also analysed all reported data for adverse events and study withdrawals. adverse event reporting was considered at two levels of the meddra hierarchy: system organ classification (soc) and higher level group term, the latter of which is considered a clinically relevant grouping of meddra preferred terms.11 adverse events were grouped by meddra higher level group terms and ranked in the order of frequency of reporting. the top 10 ranked higher level group term adverse events were compared by trial type and drug class.

a secondary analysis considered the reporting of outcomes were not specified as primary or secondary endpoints. to mirror the increased focus on the importance of mucosal healing,12 the number of studies that reported additional endoscopic or histologic outcomes or the faecal calprotectin biomarker was assessed.

the proportion of studies reporting each type of outcome was calculated, by trial type. the results were stratified by into pre‐2009 and 2009 onwards and the changes over time in reporting were summarised in matrix form with outcome categories listed in rows and frequency of outcome reporting plotted in greyscale on a time axis.10 the statistical significance of any changes between time periods in outcome reporting was tested using the chi‐squared test (with 1 df, the critical value of chi is 3.84).

the review was reported in line with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (prisma) statement and harms the checklist.13, 14

3 results
3.1 systematic search results
the search identified 9561 unique records (figure 1) and included 181 rcts (characteristics in table s5). induction of remission was the focus of 110 studies: 104 (94.5%) through medical15-118 and six (5.5%) through surgical approaches119-124(table 1). nine (of 110, 8.2%) induction studies solely treated patients with fistula with medical36, 64, 79, 86, 91, 110, 113 or surgical119, 120 therapies.

maintenance of remission was the focus of 71 studies: 52 (73.2%) sought to maintain remission achieved through medical therapies125-176 and 19 (26.8%) aimed to maintain surgically induced remission.177-195 one study aimed to maintain medically induced remission in fistula patients.146

in total, 23 850 patients were involved in the studies, with median follow‐up of 16 weeks (iqr: 8.0‐25.1) in induction studies and 52.0 weeks (iqr 48.0‐60.0) in maintenance studies. over 30% of studies were published after 2009 (56 of 181, 30.9%). biologics were the intervention of interest in 33.7% studies (61), either as monotherapy or in combination.

table 2 shows a summary of the primary and secondary outcomes reported in crohn's disease rcts and highlights the wide range of outcomes and outcome measures. the reporting of outcomes not specified as primary or secondary endpoints was common (158 studies, 87.3%) and was consistent across the two time periods.

3.2 efficacy outcomes
3.2.1 clinical or composite‐clinical
clinical or composite‐clinical efficacy outcomes were reported as primary or secondary endpoints in 92.3% of trials, which was consistent across the two time periods (figure 2a).

clinical response was reported by 70.0% (77) induction studies, 75 (of 104, 72.1%) medical and two (of six, 33.3%) surgical interventions (table s6). clinical response was reported less frequently in maintenance trials (31 of 71, 43.7%) but was more common in studies of maintenance of medically induced remission (26, 50%) than surgically induced (5, 19.3%). clinical response was an outcome in 80% (eight) of studies of patients with fistulae.

clinical remission was reported in 65.5% (72) of induction studies (all medical) and 19.7% (14) of maintenance studies. clinical remission was not reported as a trial endpoint in surgical studies or studies of fistula patients.

disease relapse or worsening was a primary or secondary outcome in 12.7% of induction studies (13 medical and one surgical) and 38 (73.1%) studies of maintenance of medically induced remission. recurrence was reported in 14 (73.7%) maintenance studies of surgery‐induced remission and one (16.7%) surgical induction study.

fistula response and remission were commonly reported in fistula studies (nine (90%) and six (60%), respectively). overall, 14 (12.7%) induction studies and one (1.4%) maintenance study reported fistula response and 10 (9.1%) induction and two (2.8%) maintenance studies reported fistula remission.

corticosteroid sparing and corticosteroid‐free remission were reported in 11 (10.6%) and eight (7.7%) medical induction studies and three (5.8%) and four (7.7%) maintenance studies of medically induced remission respectively. all studies, with one exception,173 were published prior to 2009.

the crohn's disease activity index (cdai) dominated as the primary measurement tool for primary and secondary outcomes with 77.9% (141) of studies reporting its use, which was common across both induction (86, 78.2%) and maintenance (55, 77.5%) studies. the use of cdai to measure primary and secondary outcomes reduced from 79.2% of studies pre‐2009, to 75.0% from 2009 onwards, although the chi‐squared value of 0.4 demonstrates that this was not a statistically significant result at the 95% confidence level. outcome definitions using the cdai were heterogeneous with 35 different definitions of response or remission reported (table s6). cdai 100 was the reported response measurement in 38 (21.0%) studies, only one before 2000.21 cdai 70 was also reported in 38 (21.0%) studies, all but three after 2001. the remission benchmark cdai <150, was the commonest (81, 44.8%), but reporting reduced between the two time periods (46.4%‐41.1%). conversely, the reporting of cdai 70 and cdai 100 increased between the periods (20.8%‐21.4% and 16.8%‐30.4% respectively). the increase in cdai 100 reporting was statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (chi‐squared value of 4.29). fistula studies most commonly reported the change in cdai score (5, 50%).

other tools used less frequently to measure clinical response or remission include the harvey bradshaw index,19, 28, 48, 49, 87, 100, 118, 131, 157, 196 physician global assessments19, 20, 25, 48, 99, 111, 180 and the van hees activity index19, 41, 66, 87, 131 (table 2). the perianal disease activity index was used in four (40%) studies of fistula patients and in one nonfistula study. 36, 64, 91, 94, 120

there were 30 definitions of disease worsening or relapse, or recurrence using the cdai, many of which required the cdai to exceed a benchmark level such as 150, 200 or 250, with or without an increase from baseline score (table s6). the need for additional therapy and/or surgery were commonly used to define worsening or relapse of disease.

studies of penetrating disease most commonly used physician assessments of draining fistulas (50% [9, 90.0%] or 100% [6, 60%] reduction from baseline) as trial endpoints. two (20.0%) studies of fistula patients used imaging techniques, mri and diagnostic ultrasound, to assess response, one in each time period.64, 120

3.2.2 endoscopy
the reporting of endoscopic outcomes doubled between the two time periods, from 14.4% to 30.4% of studies (figure 2a). this increase was statistically significant with a chi‐squared value of 6.31 (95% confidence level). endoscopic outcomes were reported in 31% (22) of maintenance trials, with reporting more likely in studies of surgically (19, 100.0%) than medically (3, 5.8%) induced remission. endoscopic outcomes were infrequently reported in induction trials (13, 11.8%) and in trials in penetrating disease (1, 10.0%).120 reporting of endoscopic outcomes is a more recent phenomenon in induction trials, with their first use in a study reported in 2000, as compared with 1984 in maintenance trials.

endoscopic recurrence was the most frequent endpoint, especially in maintenance trials (19, 26.8%). only two induction studies122, 123 reported endoscopic recurrence, both of which involved surgery. endoscopic response was more frequently reported in induction trials (10, 9.1%) than in maintenance trials (6, 8.5%). endoscopic mucosal healing was reported in two (1.8%) induction88, 111 and two (2.8%) maintenance162, 189 studies and endoscopic remission in one (0.9%) induction study.102

endoscopic recurrence was commonly defined with the rutgeerts endoscopic score>=2 (14, 7.7%),122, 179-181, 183, 185, 187, 188, 190-193, 195 although many benchmarks were used (table s7). endoscopic outcomes in induction (and fistula) trials report changes in the crohn's disease endoscopic index of severity (cdeis) score (9, 5.0%)40, 69, 73, 76, 93, 98, 102, 112, 120 or changes in the simple endoscopic score for crohn's disease (ses‐cd) (4, 2.2%)88, 98, 111, 120 in place of the rutgeerts score. the d'haens162 and marteau191 endoscopic scores were used infrequently.

endoscopic outcomes were reported in 13.3% of studies (24) as additional outcomes and reporting increased pre‐2009 to 2009 onwards (12.0%‐16.1%), with the reporting growth exclusively in maintenance studies. this result was not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (based on a chi‐squared test value of 1.58).

3.2.3 histology
histology‐based outcomes have shown a statistically significant increase between the two periods (chi‐squared test statistic of 5.86) (figure 2a), but remain uncommonly used (11, 6.1%) and are unused in studies of fistula patients. three (medical) induction studies (1.7%)62, 102, 112 reported histologic response, one maintenance study (1.9%) of medically induced remission162 reported histologic remission and four maintenance studies (21.1%) of surgically induced remission179, 182, 188, 193 reported histologic recurrence. three induction studies (1.7%)40, 62, 97 and one maintenance study (1.4%)194 reported outcomes related to cytokine expression in mucosal tissues. a number of histology scores are used including d'haens,62, 112, 182, 188 dieleman102 and reguiero193 (table s8). the reporting of histologic outcomes as additional outcomes increased between the time periods from 3.2% of studies to 7.1%, but this is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.

3.2.4 biomarkers
biomarker outcomes were reported in 39 (35.5%) induction studies, 38 (36.5%) medical interventions and one (16.7%) surgical120 and 21 (29.6%) maintenance trials. reporting has increased over time with 35.7% of trials since 2009 reporting a primary or secondary biomarker outcome (figure 2a). however, this increase was not statistically significant. only one (10.0%) study of penetrating disease reported a biomarker outcome.120 serum c‐reactive protein was the most reported biomarker (34, 18.8%), followed by serum erythrocyte sedimentation (16, 8.8%). faecal calprotectin was reported as an outcome in only two studies (1.1%),66, 101 one in each time period. the biomarker was an additional outcome in three (1.7%) further trials,114-116 all reported between 2014 and 2015.

3.2.5 patient‐reported outcomes
patient‐reported outcomes (pros) were reported in 47 (42.7%) induction studies, 45 (43.3%) medical induction studies and two (33.3%) surgical induction studies.120, 121 reports of pros were similar in studies of fistula patients (4, 40.0%). primary or secondary pros were reported in 28 (39.4%) maintenance studies, 24 (46.1%) of medically induced remission (46.1%), and four (21.1%) of surgically induced remission.179, 189, 190, 194 the use of pros has increased over time, although not with statistical significance at the 95% confidence level, with almost half of rcts reporting a primary or secondary pro since 2009 (figure 2a). quality of life was the most common outcome, reported in 40.3% (73) of studies (table s9). the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (ibd‐q) was frequently used to record quality of life (59, 32.6%), and typically outcomes were specified as the final score or changes in the score (from baseline, mean or median). the use of ibd‐q to measure pros increased from 30.4% to 37.5% between 1979‐2008 and 2009‐2015. the growth in use was in maintenance studies (25.5%‐50.0%), whilst its use in induction studies reduced (33.3%‐28.1%). whilst the overall change in ibdq use and the decline in induction trials were not statistically significant at the 95% level, the increase in ibdq studies in maintenance trials was significant (chi‐squared test value of 0.89, 0.28 and 4.25 respectively). reporting of ibd‐q in studies of fistula patients was in line with the overall average (3, 30.0%).

other tools for measuring quality of life included the short‐form 3640, 50, 106, 120, 121, 153, 160, 161, 169, 173 and its components,50, 121, 169 patient global assessments,48, 91, 179 the gastrointestinal quality of life index,111, 121 the hamilton depression scale81, 95 and the short ibdq.46, 120 patient diaries were used to measure outcomes related to bowel symptoms,38 defaecation functions19, 46, 86, 96 and pain19, 46, 86 (table 2), with reports comparatively high (2,20%) in fistula patient studies.86, 120

3.3 safety outcomes
safety outcomes were specified as primary or secondary outcomes in 42 (38.2%) induction studies, 38 (36.5%) medical and four (66.7%) surgical.119-122 twenty‐two maintenance studies (31.0%) also reported primary or secondary safety outcomes. safety outcome reporting increased from 32.8% of studies pre‐2009 to 41.1% between 2009 and 2015, although the increase was not statistically significant. safety‐related primary and secondary outcomes were reported in three (30.0%) studies in fistula patients, all since 2010.119, 120, 189

adverse events were the most common primary and secondary outcomes, reported in 39 (35.5%) induction and 22 (31%) maintenance studies. the reporting of adverse events as a primary or secondary endpoint was most frequently the totality of adverse events but some studies looked for specific treatment‐related adverse events or reported the stopping of treatment due to adverse events.

3.3.1 adverse events
reporting of any adverse events occurred in 88 (80%) induction studies and 61 (85.9%) maintenance studies. all of the fistula studies reported adverse events. reporting of adverse events increased slightly between the two periods from 80.0% to 87.5%. serious adverse events were reported in 60 (54.5%) induction and 31 (43.7%) maintenance studies, and were higher in fistula patient trials (6, 60.0%). the reporting of serious adverse events in studies increased from 46.4% before 2009 to 58.9% from 2009 to 2015. treatment‐related adverse events (including serious events), were reported in 69 (62.7%) induction and 44 (62%) maintenance studies. six (60.0%) fistula studies reported treatment‐related adverse events. the reporting of treatment‐related adverse events (including serious) grew from 56.8% to 66.1% between the time periods respectively. none of the changes in reporting of adverse events was statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.

gastrointestinal adverse events, including the exacerbation of crohn's disease and gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, were the most commonly reported adverse events by meddra soc, reported in 85 (77.3%) induction trials and 57 (80.3%) maintenance studies. the 10 most commonly reported adverse events by higher level group term (hlgt, a clinically relevant grouping) are shown in table 3. gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, including nausea, vomiting and pain, were reported as adverse events in 65.2% (118) of studies. two other higher level group terms within the gastrointestinal conditions were in the 10 most reported: gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions (71, 39.2%), which includes crohn's disease exacerbation as an adverse event, and gastrointestinal motility and defaecation conditions (63, 34.8%). joint disorders, another higher level group term possibly related to crohn's disease and the failure of treatment, were reported in 32.6% (59) studies.

3.3.2 adverse events by intervention group
five of the 10 most commonly reported adverse event groups for all therapies were also in the top 10 across all intervention groups (table 3). gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, infections (including anal abscess, post‐operative wound infection, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection and pneumonia) and headaches, the three most common adverse event groups for all trials, were ranked in the top four most reported for all trial subtypes. gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions (crohn's disease exacerbation) and gastrointestinal motility and defaecation were also commonly reported across all trial subtypes.

general system disorders, such as fatigue, pain, flushing, oedema, chills, influenza like illness, were commonly reported only in trials of medical induction or maintenance of medically induced remission interventions. neurological disorders, such as dizziness, dysgeusia, paraesthesia, syncope and somnolence, and epidermal and dermal conditions, such as rash, pruritis, skin disorder, erythema and eczema, were in the list of ten most recorded adverse event groups across all trials, but were only commonly reported in medical induction trials.

body temperature, specifically pyrexia, was one of the 10 most commonly reported adverse events in induction trials, but not maintenance. procedural related injuries and complications, such as post‐operative ileus, post‐procedural haemorrhage, post‐procedural complication, infusion‐related reaction, anastomic leak and the need for therapeutic procedures and support care, such as surgery, hospitalisation and fistula repair, were only commonly reported in surgical induction and post‐operative maintenance trials.

3.3.3 adverse events by drug class
gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, and infections were the only two adverse event groups that were consistently ranked in the 10 most commonly reported across all drug classes (including cam, dietary and prebiotic/probiotic interventions) (table 4). general system disorders, such as fatigue, asthenia, pain and chills, gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions (crohn's disease exacerbation) and joint disorders were in the 10 most common adverse events across all but one drug class (corticosteroids, immunosuppressives and cam respectively).

headaches were one of the 10 most common adverse event groups in all drug classes except antibiotics and prebiotics. gastrointestinal motility and defaecation conditions were one of the 10 most commonly occurring adverse events across all drug groups, with the exception of corticosteroids and immunosuppressives.

differences between drug classes and from the overall average were found. skin appendage conditions were the fourth most common adverse events for 5‐aminosalycylic acid (5‐asa) therapies, specifically alopecia and night sweats. skin appendage conditions were the second most common adverse event grouping for corticosteroids, including acne, alopecia, hypertrichosis, hyperhidrosis and abnormal hair growth. adrenal gland disorders, specifically cushingoid, cushing's syndrome, adrenal disorder and adrenal suppression, were the most common adverse events recorded by group and lipid metabolism disorders (lipohypertrophy) and were the fifth most common for corticosteroids. neither adverse event group was commonly reported in any other drug class.

for the antibiotic drug class, bacterial infectious disorders (specifically clostridium difficile infection and furuncle) were the third most common adverse events, and were not common for any other drug class. therapeutic procedures and supportive care, specifically surgery, hospitalisation and abscess drainage, were the third most commonly reported adverse event group for antibiotics, as it was for dietary treatments. procedural related injuries and complications (procedural complication and feeding tube complication), gastrointestinal haemorrhages and gastrointestinal stenosis and obstruction, were also ranked the third most common adverse event groups for dietary treatments.

commonly occurring adverse events, unique to immunosuppressive (ranked fifth and above) were white blood cell disorders, specifically leukopenia and lymphopenia. body temperature conditions (pyrexia), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (back pain, fistula and anal fistula) and hepatobiliary investigations (including alanine aminotransferase increased and liver function test abnormal) were also in the top five most commonly reported adverse events for immunosuppressives, although each was also commonly reported in other drug classes.

injuries were the fourth most commonly reported adverse event groups for cam and prebiotic or probiotic trials. however, with underlying terms including stab wound and road traffic accident, these are likely to be unrelated to the interventions.

surgical interventions offer a different pattern of adverse events, as shown in table 3. infections are most commonly reported, followed by procedural related injuries and complications (including post‐operative ileus, post‐procedural haemorrhage, post‐procedural complication, infusion‐related reaction and anastomic leak), and therapeutic procedures and supportive care (surgery, hospitalisation, adhesiolysis and abscess drainage). gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, which are generally very commonly reported in drug classes (ranked first to third most common), are the fourth most common adverse event for surgical interventions, along with headaches and a number of other adverse event groups (table 3).

3.3.4 study withdrawals
withdrawals were most frequently reported due to adverse events (102, 56.4%) and least frequently for serious adverse events (7, 3.9%). withdrawals due to treatment failure were reported in 41.4% of studies, and in 45.9% of studies for reasons related to noncompliance and loss to follow‐up, the reporting of both reduced between periods (45.6%‐32.1% and 52.0%‐32.1% respectively). withdrawals due to treatment‐related adverse events (including serious) were reported by 13.8% (25) studies, but the proportion fell from 15.2% to 10.7% between the two time periods. the reduction in the reporting of study withdrawals was common across all categories except serious adverse events, which rose slightly from 3.2% to 5.4% of studies. it was not possible to test the increase in serious adverse events for statistical significance, as the requirement for 80% of numbers to be over five was not met. no changes in reporting reached statistical significance, except the reduction in withdrawals due to other reasons, which was significant at the 95% confidence level (chi‐squared test value of 6.14).

4 discussion
we conducted a comprehensive and independent systematic review of the outcomes and outcome measures reported in rcts of interventions for crohn's disease, summarising data from 181 rcts. a key strength of our review was the focus on synthesising data on safety outcomes and adverse events, which goes beyond anything reported previously in the literature. furthermore, we have not only described temporal trends in outcome reporting but have tested the statistical significance of these findings. our results demonstrate that trialists have adopted a wide and variable approach to outcomes measurement and highlight commonalities and differences in the reporting of adverse events between a variety of interventions to induce or maintain remission in crohn's disease. these results provide insights to guide future trial design and support core outcome set development.

the cdai was developed over 40 years ago as a composite measure incorporating symptoms, signs and simple laboratory parameters.197 it was the dominant measurement instrument used in the published trials, but with substantial variation including 35 definitions of response or remission. whilst this observation highlights a need for greater standardisation of endpoints, the cdai per se is increasingly regarded as suboptimal as an endpoint for comparative effectiveness research and regulatory approval. the index does not correlate closely with objective signs of inflammation or with mucosal healing at endoscopy.198, 199 the time trends we observed in clinical trials outcomes reporting, specifically the statistically significant increase in endoscopy and histology outcomes reporting, illustrate how the emphasis is shifting towards inclusion of discrete, objective measures of the inflammatory process. whilst the use of cdai overall has shown nonstatistically significant growth, the use of cdai 100 has significantly increased, highlighting a continued interest in this measure of response. this confirms that the cdai 100, which is a 100 point reduction in cdai score, is increasingly preferred to the cdai 70 (70 point reduction in response), as a measure of response.200

c‐reactive protein is a routinely employed biomarker in clinical practice and was frequently reported among clinical trial outcomes, albeit rarely as a primary outcome (five studies). however, c‐reactive protein lacks sensitivity for active intestinal inflammation in crohn's disease,201 and this limits its value as a primary endpoint. there remains active exploration of alternative serum markers of disease activity202 but our review suggests no strong candidate has emerged.

stool biomarkers offer potential to reliably measure gut‐related inflammation and in recent years faecal calprotectin has become available in routine ibd practice.203 uncertainty remains as to its performance properties particularly for measuring small bowel, rather than colonic, disease activity204 and research continues to explore other stool assays to measure the inflammatory process.205 faecal calprotectin was reported as an endpoint in only two trials included in this review.66, 101

we found a statistically significant increase in the report of endoscopy and histology‐based outcome measures over time, albeit they remained at a low level and without emergence of a standardised approach. this heterogeneity likely reflects the current suboptimal psychometric properties of individual measurement tools, both for endoscopic and histologic scoring systems.206, 207 in addition to the cost and invasiveness of ileocolonoscopy, endoscopy is not able to fully characterise small bowel disease or quantify the overall extent of intestinal inflammation in crohn's disease. there is a growing body of research on the potential use of quantitative imaging such as ct and mri,208 but only one trial included in this review included radiological outcomes.120

patient‐reported outcome measures (proms) were reported as endpoints in almost half of studies reported since 2009, although commonly as a secondary outcome (60, 33.1%) rather than a primary outcome (10, 5.5%). questionnaires administered in clinical trials ranged from ‘generic” (eg eq‐5d) and “disease specific” (eg ibd‐q) health‐related quality of life instruments to tools focusing on individual domains (eg fatigue impact score). the ibd‐q was the most frequently reported prom in the trials (85% of studies reporting proms) and there was a statistically significant increase in its use for measuring outcomes in maintenance studies over the time of the review (from 25.5% to 50.0%). however, it was not developed according to the latest fda recommendations for product labelling claims.209 new disease‐specific proms tools are under development to meet the stringent guidelines and enable proms to support future regulatory approvals of licencing for crohn's disease.

our review covered data for safety outcomes in clinical trials and we found substantial heterogeneity in reporting, which highlights the challenges in categorising adverse events for a complex, chronic condition with a variable disease course and multisystem manifestations. lack of treatment efficacy in crohn's disease may manifest with a diversity of symptoms, which are difficult to distinguish from genuine treatment side effects. many of the most commonly reported adverse events, such as gastrointestinal signs and symptoms and gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions may reflect disease course. nevertheless, these data demonstrate differences in the adverse event profile of different intervention groups and should support renewed attempts to define disease‐ and intervention‐specific adverse events and to standardise safety outcomes as discrete endpoints. this is an important consideration for future core outcome set developers.

our results highlight how the reporting of outcomes in trials in fistula patients align with overall reporting. the use of proms and safety‐related endpoints is common across all trials, regardless of disease type. clinical response was less commonly measured by cdai, and more frequently measured by fistula closure and the pdai. these three outcome measures were the most commonly used in fistula trials identified by this review, which supports the findings of a recently developed core outcome set for fistulising disease.8 biomarker, histology and endoscopy outcomes were rarely used in fistula trials and are not included in the core outcome set either, contrary to the general shift in outcomes reporting in crohn's disease trials. however, patient reports (eg incontinence and drainage) were more common endpoints in trials of fistula patients than in nonfistula trials, and their importance is borne out in the core outcome sets, which lists several proms to be reported in future trials.

our review independently supports the key findings of a recently published systematic review of outcomes in crohn's disease.9 we confirm heterogeneity in definitions of response and remission and the need for a core outcome set to standardise endpoint definitions. both studies identified the use of cdai as the most popular outcome measurement tool overall and of ibd‐q as the most commonly used prom. our results confirm statistically significant increases in the use of cdai100 across all trials and of ibd‐q reporting in maintenance trials across the time periods of the review. similarly, the cdeis and the ses‐cd are highlighted as endoscopic tools most used in induction trials and rutgeerts in post‐surgical trials. both reviews confirmed the common use of c‐reactive protein and increasing use of biomarkers.

however, our study had less restrictive inclusion criteria, leading to inclusion of a larger number of rcts (181 vs 116) with a wider variety of interventions included. our research included dietary, cam, probiotic/prebiotic and surgical interventions, which results in extra heterogeneity in our findings. our results are arguably more extensive, particularly in the reporting of safety‐related outcomes and adverse events, and go beyond the descriptive in the analysis of changes between time periods by including statistical testing. furthermore, we focused on primary and secondary endpoints (with supplementary analysis of other outcomes), whereas ma et al considered all outcomes in a singular analysis. this results in differences in the breadth and depth of scope of the reviews and some nuances in key findings between the two studies. for example, ma et al found that a higher proportion of studies used cdai, which likely reflects the requirement that trials must have used cdai (or the harvey‐bradshaw index) at enrolment to be included. their focus on a more restricted range of therapies may also explain the higher proportion of studies reporting adverse events, as our results included trials of less traditional therapies. ma et al also found that cdai 100 was more prevalent as a measure of response than in our results (although we found a statistically significant increase in use over time), and reported an increased use of faecal calprotectin. these results may reflect some more recent trials included in their review. the use of cdai as a requirement for trial inclusion in their systematic review reduces the ability of the ma et al review to assess changes in the use of cdai. we have been able to include such analysis in our paper, and confirm a statistically significant increase in cdai100, whereas the use of cdai overall has remained relatively consistent.

our study has limitations. whilst it includes a comprehensive listing of outcomes from available crohn's disease trials, we cannot account for publication bias. the results would have been strengthened by the consideration of nonrandomised controlled trials and observational studies. in particular, this would help to characterise important longer term harms. we did not assess the validity or reliability of the outcome measures identified in the review, although this would form a part of any core outcome set development process.

our study confirms the variability that exists in reporting of outcomes in published clinical trials of interventions for crohn's disease. these data provide a comprehensive resource to support current efforts7 to redefine optimal outcomes and measurement tools to be included in future studies of comparative effectiveness.
