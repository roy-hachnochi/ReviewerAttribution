abstract
obesity has been consistently associated with a greater colorectal cancer risk, but this relationship is weaker among women. in the uk biobank, we investigated the associations between body size (body mass index [bmi], height, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio) and body fat composition (total body fat percentage and trunk fat percentage) measurements with colorectal cancer risk among 472,526 men and women followed for 5.6 years on average. multivariable hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%ci) for developing colorectal cancer (2,636 incident cases) were estimated using cox proportional hazards models. among men, when the highest and lowest fifths were compared, bmi (hr = 1.35, 95%ci: 1.13–1.61; ptrend < 0.0001), waist circumference (hr = 1.66, 95%ci: 1.39–1.99; ptrend < 0.0001), waist-to-hip ratio (hr = 1.58, 95%ci: 1.31–1.91; ptrend < 0.0001), total body fat percentage (hr = 1.27, 95%ci: 1.06–1.53; ptrend = 0.002), and trunk fat percentage (hr = 1.31, 95%ci: 1.09–1.58; ptrend = 0.002) were associated with greater colorectal cancer risk. for women, only waist-to-hip ratio (hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.33, 95%ci: 1.08–1.65; ptrend = 0.005) was positively associated with colorectal cancer risk. greater body size (overall and abdominal adiposity) was positively associated with colorectal cancer development in men. for women, abdominal adiposity, rather than overall body size, was associated with a greater colorectal cancer risk.

introduction
a substantial body of evidence has shown that excess adiposity is associated with a greater risk of developing colorectal cancer. a meta-analysis of 30 cohort studies reported that a 5 kg/m2 increment in body mass index (bmi) was associated with greater risk of developing colon cancer in both sexes, but that this relationship was weaker among women (relative risk [rr] = 1.12, 95% confidence interval [95%ci]: 1.07–1.18) compared to men (rr = 1.30, 95%ci: 1.25–1.35)1. in the same meta-analysis, bmi (per 5 kg/m2 increment) was related to rectal cancer risk for men (rr = 1.12, 95%ci: 1.09–1.16) but not women (rr = 1.03, 95%ci: 0.99–1.08)1.

potential reasons for a weaker relationship between adiposity and colorectal cancer among women compared to men are not clear. it has been suggested that hormone replacement therapy (hrt) use, which has been consistently associated with lower risk of developing colorectal cancer2, may counteract the detrimental effects of excess adiposity on colorectal tumorigenesis3. support for this hypothesis was provided by the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition (epic) study which found that larger waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio were associated with a greater risk of developing colon cancer among non-hrt users only, with no relationship observed for hrt users4. however, inconsistent findings have been reported in other studies which have investigated whether hrt use modified the relationship between obesity and colorectal cancer5,6. additional studies with large numbers of incident cases are required to investigate how adiposity relates to colorectal cancer risk among users and non-users of hrt.

body fat composition measurements that distinguish between adipose and non-adipose mass can be estimated using bioelectrical impedance. such technologies, however, have previously been unavailable in large-scale prospective cohort studies so it is uncertain how body fat composition parameters relate to colorectal cancer development.

in the current analysis, we prospectively investigated the associations between colorectal cancer risk and body size (bmi, body weight, height, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio) and body fat composition (total body fat percentage and trunk fat percentage) measurements in the uk biobank study. the uk biobank is a large prospective cohort study including over 500,000 participants. the large number of incident colorectal cancer cases provided substantial statistical power to investigate the body size and colorectal cancer relationships according to hrt use, physical activity levels, and across colorectal cancer subsites.

materials and methods
study participants
the uk biobank aims to investigate the genetic, lifestyle, and environmental causes of a range of important diseases7,8. men (n = 229,182) and women (n = 273,474) aged 40 to 69 years who were registered with the nhs between 2006 and 2010 were recruited in 22 study centres across the uk. ethical approval for the uk biobank was obtained from the north west multi-centre research ethics committee (reference number 06/mre08/65), the national information governance board for health and social care in england and wales, and the community health index advisory group in scotland. all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of these approvals. at recruitment all participants gave informed consent to participate in uk biobank and be followed-up, using a signature capture device. during the baseline recruitment visit, participants were asked to complete a touchscreen self-administered questionnaire, which included questions on socio-demographics (including age, education and townsend deprivation score), health and medical history, lifestyle exposures (including smoking habits, dietary intakes, physical activity, and alcohol consumption), early life exposures, and medication use. exclusions prior to the onset of analyses included: participants with prevalent cancer at recruitment (n = 27,058) and those with missing body size and composition measurements (n = 3,072). therefore, our analysis included 472,526 participants (217,700 men and 254,826 women).

body size and composition measurements
at the baseline assessment centre visit, trained staff used standard procedures to collect and record the body size and composition measurements. body weight was measured using the tanita bc-418ma body composition analyser. participants were asked to remove their shoes and heavy outer clothing before weighing9,10. height was measured in a barefoot standing position using the saca 202 device. bmi was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in metres. waist circumference and hip circumference were measured using the wessex non-stretchable sprung tape measurement. waist-to-hip ratio was calculated by dividing waist circumference by hip circumference. the tanita bc-418ma body composition analyzer (tanita, tokyo, japan) was used to assess bioelectrical impedance measures including total body fat percentage, and trunk fat percentage.

colorectal cancer case ascertainment
cancer cases within the uk biobank cohort were identified through linkage to national cancer registries. complete follow-up was available through 30th november 2014 for england and wales and 31st december 2014 for scotland. cancer incidence data were coded using the 10th revision of the international classification of diseases (icd-10). proximal colon cancer included those within the caecum, appendix, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, and splenic flexure (c18.0–18.5). distal colon cancer included those within the descending (c18.6) and sigmoid (c18.7) colon. overlapping (c18.8) and unspecified (c18.9) lesions of the colon were also included. cancer of the rectum included cancer occurring at the rectosigmoid junction (c19) and rectum (c20).

statistical analysis
hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) were estimated using cox proportional hazards models. age was the primary time variable in all models. time at entry was age at recruitment. exit time was age at whichever of the following came first: colorectal cancer diagnosis, death, or the last date at which follow-up was considered complete. models were stratified by age at recruitment in 5-year categories, townsend deprivation index fifths, and region of the recruitment assessment centre. possible non-proportionality was assessed using an analysis of schoenfeld residuals11, with no evidence of nonproportionality being detected. the associations between body size and body fat composition measurements with risks of colorectal cancer, colon cancer, proximal colon cancer, distal colon cancer, and rectal cancer were analysed separately for men and women. heterogeneity of associations across anatomical cancer subsites was assessed by calculating x2 statistics.

participants were grouped into sex-specific fifths of bmi, body weight, height, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, total body fat percentage, and trunk fat percentage. in additional analyses, each body size and composition measurement was modelled on the continuous scales (bmi [per 2.5 kg/m2 increase], body weight [per 5 kg increase], height [per 10 cm increase], waist circumference [per 5 cm increase], waist-to-hip ratio [per 0.25 increase], total body fat percentage [per 5% increase], and trunk fat percentage [per 5% increase]), and bmi was also modelled according to predefined categories (<22, 22–<25 [reference group], 25–<30, 30–<35, ≥35 kg/m2). the multivariable models were adjusted for physical activity (metabolic equivalent tasks [met] hours/week; fifths), smoking status and intensity (never; former; current [<15 cigarettes/day]; current [≥15 cigarettes/day]; current [intensity unknown]; unknown), alcohol consumption frequency (never; special occasions only; 1–3 times/month; 1–2 times/week; 3–4 times/week; daily or almost daily; unknown), family history of colorectal cancer (no; yes; unknown), prevalent diabetes (no; yes; unknown), regular aspirin/ibuprofen use (no; yes; unknown), qualifications (none; national exams at age 16 years [cses/o-levels/gcses or equivalent]; vocational qualifications [nvq/hnd/hnc] or optional national exams at ages 17 to 18 years [a-levels/as-levels or equivalent]; other professional qualifications; college/university degree; unknown), ever use of hrt (no, yes, unknown), and frequency of red and processed meat consumption (<2 times/week; 2–3 times/week; 3–4 times/week; ≥4 times/week; unknown). trend tests across body size and composition measurement fifths were calculated by assigning the median value of each category and modelling as continuous terms in cox regression models.

the body size and colorectal cancer associations were further assessed across subgroups of ever hrt use, menopausal status (pre-menopausal and post-menopausal), prevalent diabetes (no or yes), and physical activity levels (met hours/week; thirds). interaction terms (multiplicative scale) between these variables and body size were included in separate models; the statistical significance of the cross-product terms were evaluated using the likelihood ratio test. to evaluate possible reverse causality, cases diagnosed within the first two years of follow-up were excluded in sensitivity analyses. statistical tests used in the analysis were all two-sided and a pvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. analyses were conducted using stata version 13.1.

results
after a median follow-up time of 5.6 years, 2,636 incident cases of colorectal cancer (1,516 were in men and 1,120 were in women) were diagnosed. of these cases, 1,731 were colon tumours (874 proximal colon, 769 distal colon, and 88 overlapping or unspecified) and 889 were rectal tumours. compared with those in the lower fifth, men and women in the highest bmi fifth were less physically active, less likely to be never smokers and frequent alcohol consumers, less likely to have attained college education or university degree, and more likely to be regular aspirin/ibuprofen users and more frequent consumers of red and processed meat (table 1). in addition, ever hrt use was higher for women in the highest bmi fifth compared to those in the lowest fifth (table 1).

body size and colorectal cancer risk
among men, higher bmi was associated with elevated colorectal cancer risk in the multivariable models (hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.35, 95%ci: 1.13–1.61; ptrend < 0.0001) (table 2). a similar positive relationship was observed when pre-defined bmi categories were used (hr for bmi ≥35 kg/m2 versus 22–<24.9 kg/m2 = 1.37, 95%ci: 1.07–1.76; ptrend < 0.0001) (data not shown). the positive relationship between bmi and colorectal cancer risk was most apparent for colon cancer versus rectal cancer (pheterogeneity = 0.17), and for proximal colon versus distal colon cancer (pheterogeneity = 0.14), but these differences did not reach statistical significance (table 2). for women, bmi was not associated with colorectal cancer risk (hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.11, 95%ci: 0.89–1.38; ptrend = 0.81) (table 3). similar relationships were found when pre-defined bmi categories were used (hr for bmi ≥35 kg/m2 versus 22–<24.9 kg/m2 = 1.03, 95%ci: 0.79–1.34; ptrend = 0.43) (data not shown), and across anatomical subsites (colon versus rectal pheterogeneity = 0.30; proximal colon versus distal colon pheterogeneity = 0.17) (table 3).

weight was associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer among men (hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.57, 95%ci: 1.29–1.91; ptrend < 0.0001), but not women (hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.11, 95%ci: 0.89–1.38; ptrend = 0.56) (tables 2 and ​and3).3). for men, this positive relationship was slightly stronger for colon cancer versus rectal cancer (pheterogeneity = 0.09) and for proximal colon versus distal colon cancer (pheterogeneity = 0.08), although these differences did not reach statistical significance. among women, no differences in the weight and colorectal cancer relationship was found across anatomical subsites (colon versus rectal pheterogeneity = 0.18; proximal colon versus distal colon pheterogeneity = 0.12) (table 3). height was not associated with colorectal cancer risk among men (hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.01, 95%ci: 0.85–1.19; ptrend = 0.67) and women (hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.11, 95%ci: 0.90–1.37; ptrend = 0.30), with similar relationships found across anatomical subsites (all pheterogeneities > 0.20) (tables 2 and ​and33).

among men, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio were associated with a greater risk of colorectal cancer (waist circumference: hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.66, 95%ci: 1.39–1.99; ptrend < 0.0001, waist-to-hip ratio: hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.58, 95%ci: 1.31–1.91; ptrend < 0.0001) (table 2). similar strength positive relationships were observed across anatomical subsites (colon versus rectal: waist circumference pheterogeneity = 0.27, waist-to-hip ratio pheterogeneity = 0.42; proximal colon versus distal colon: waist circumference pheterogeneity = 0.27, waist-to-hip ratio pheterogeneity = 0.61) (table 2). for women, greater waist-to hip ratio was also associated with an elevated colorectal cancer risk (hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.33, 95%ci: 1.08–1.65; ptrend = 0.005) (table 3). this positive relationship for waist-to-hip ratio was of similar magnitude for colon cancer and rectal cancer (pheterogeneity = 0.84), and for proximal colon and distal colon cancer (pheterogeneity = 0.24) (table 3). among women, waist circumference was positively related to colorectal cancer risk, although this relationship did not quite reach statistical significance (table 3). although no relationship was observed for waist circumference and rectal cancer in women, no heterogeneity was observed when compared with tumours in the colon (pheterogeneity = 0.35). waist circumference was positively associated with proximal colon cancer risk in women (hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.49, 95%ci: 1.04–2.14; ptrend = 0.04), but not distal colon cancer risk (pheterogeneity = 0.15).

body fat composition and colorectal cancer risk
among men, higher total body fat percentage and trunk fat percentage were associated with greater colorectal cancer risk (total body fat percentage: hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.27, 95%ci: 1.06–1.53; ptrend = 0.002, trunk fat percentage: hr for highest versus lowest fifth = 1.31, 95%ci: 1.09–1.58; ptrend = 0.002) (table 2). these positive relationships were stronger and reached statistical significance for colon cancer, but not for rectal cancer (total body fat percentage pheterogeneity = 0.21; trunk fat percentage pheterogeneity = 0.24), and for proximal colon cancer, but not distal colon cancer (total body fat percentage pheterogeneity = 0.90; trunk fat percentage pheterogeneity = 0.64) (table 2). for women, total body fat percentage and trunk fat percentage were not associated with colorectal cancer risk (table 3).

sensitivity and sub-group analyses
the positive association observed between waist-to-hip ratio and colorectal cancer among women was evident among never users of hrt (hr per 0.25 increase = 1.42, 95%ci: 1.02–1.95) and ever users of hrt (hr per 0.25 increase = 1.60, 95%ci: 1.14–2.23) (pinteraction = 0.27) (table 4). similarly, the association of bmi and waist circumference with colorectal cancer did not differ across hrt use groups (pinteractions > 0.12). the associations between bmi, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio with colorectal cancer risk were similar across subgroups of physical activity levels, prevalent diabetes status, and menopausal status (all pinteractions > 0.10) (table 4). similar relationships were also observed when colorectal cancer cases diagnosed during the first two years of follow-up were excluded from the analyses (data not shown).

discussion
in this prospective analysis of uk biobank participants, overall and abdominal adiposity body size and composition measurements were positively related to colorectal cancer risk among men. for women, only greater abdominal adiposity was associated with elevated colorectal cancer risk, and this relationship did not differ by hrt use.

our finding that bmi was positively related to colorectal cancer risk for men is in accordance with a large body of epidemiological evidence1,12. for women, we observed no association between bmi and colorectal cancer development, which is inconsistent with a recent analysis from the million women’s study (n = 18,518 cases)13 and two meta-analyses of >30 individual prospective studies1,12. this suggests that the null finding we observed between bmi and colorectal cancer among women may be the consequence of insufficient follow-up time and recorded case numbers that are necessary to detect the weak-to-moderate strength association which has previously been reported.

we found that greater abdominal adiposity measurements were positively related to colorectal cancer risk in men and women, findings consistent with the epic study and meta-analyses of prospective studies1,4, but inconsistent with the findings from a national institutes of health (nih)-aarp diet and health study analysis that reported positive associations for waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio for men, but null relationships for women6.

this was the first large-scale study to investigate how body fat composition measurements relate to colorectal cancer risk. analyses of total body fat percentage and colorectal cancer revealed similar relationships to those observed for bmi. for men, greater total body fat percentage was associated with elevated risks of developing colorectal cancer and colon cancer, a finding in that is in accordance with results from a swedish cohort study which reported a rr of 1.54 (95%ci: 1.06–2.23; p-trend = 0.012) for colorectal cancer (n = 584 cases) when the highest and lowest fourths were compared14. for women, we observed a null relationship between colorectal cancer risk and total body fat percentage, a result consistent with a sub-study of 11,124 post-menopausal women (n = 169 cases) from the women’s health initiative15. for trunk fat percentage, we found a positive relationship with colorectal cancer and colon cancer risk for men, and null associations for women. in general, our results for body fat composition were consistent with our findings for body size measurements.

it is not known why the positive relationships between adiposity and colorectal cancer are weaker and more inconsistent for women. one proposed explanation, is that greater exposure to estrogens in women may mitigate the potential tumorigenic effects of excess adiposity on the colorectum3. experimental and epidemiological studies suggest that estrogens are potentially protective against the development of colorectal cancer16–20, while in observational studies, ever use of hrt has been consistently associated with lower colorectal cancer risk2. in the epic study, abdominal adiposity was only associated with greater colon cancer risk among non-hrt users, with no relationship observed for hrt users4. however, in the current uk biobank study, we found no evidence that hrt use modified the abdominal adiposity and colorectal cancer relationship, as we observed consistent positive relationships among users and never users of hrt. there is evidence that the different formulations of hrt (e.g. estrogen only or estrogen plus progestin) may have distinct associations with colorectal cancer risk21,22. we did not have information on the formulation of hrt used which may explain why we did not observe effect modification of the abdominal adiposity and colorectal cancer relationship by hrt use.

nonetheless, it remains possible that higher endogenous circulating levels of estrogens found in women may lessen the impact of adiposity on colorectal cancer development. most recently, a case-control analysis nested within the women’s health initiative found that higher levels of endogenous circulating estradiol and estrone were associated with a lower colorectal cancer risk in post-menopausal women who were non-hrt users23. in the same study, the positive waist circumference and colorectal cancer relationship was strengthened, and became statistically significant, after the multivariable models were additionally adjusted for endogenous circulating estrogen concentrations23. this suggests that higher endogenous circulating estrogen concentrations may mask the body size and colorectal cancer relationship in post-menopausal women, and that future studies investigating how adiposity relates to colorectal cancer development in post-menopausal women should incorporate estrogen measurements to limit the effects of this confounding bias23.

the biological mechanisms that underlie the relationship between adiposity and colorectal cancer development are uncertain. adiposity is associated with metabolic and endocrinologic abnormalities, such as alterations in insulin and insulin-like growth factor signalling. experimental and epidemiological evidence indicate that hyperinsulinemia and elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor- 1 (igf-1) may promote colorectal tumorigenesis by stimulating mitogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis24–30. excess body weight is considered a chronic inflammatory state characterised by increased adipose secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (il-6), which has been shown to promote tumour initiation in experimental models31. higher adiposity is also inversely related to the secretion of adiponectin, an adipose tissue secreted adipokine which has been shown to lower secretion of inflammatory cytokines, improve insulin sensitivity, and inhibit cell growth and angiogenesis32,33. in epidemiological studies, higher adiponectin levels have, in general, been associated with lower colorectal cancer risk34,35.

the current analysis represents one of the largest single studies investigating the relationships between body size and composition with colorectal cancer risk to date. this was the first time that bioelectrical impedance measurements, that distinguish between adipose and non-adipose mass, have been used on such a large-scale to assess how total body fat percentage and trunk fat percentage relate to colorectal cancer development. the large number of incident colorectal cancer cases allowed analyses by hrt use, physical activity levels, diabetes status, menopausal status, and tumour anatomical site, and the detailed phenotypic information collected from uk biobank participants enabled us to carefully adjust for known colorectal cancer risk factors. a limitation of our analysis is that body size and composition measurements were collected from all participants on one occasion; however, with an average follow-up of 5.6 years it is unlikely that body measurements would have changed markedly during this time to substantially alter our results.

in conclusion, in this prospective analysis of uk biobank participants, which used the most comprehensive panel of anthropometric measurements of any study to date, greater body size (overall and abdominal adiposity) was positively associated with colorectal cancer development in men. for women, abdominal adiposity, rather than overall body size, was associated with a greater colorectal cancer risk, and this relationship was unaffected by hrt use. the null result observed for the bmi and colorectal cancer among women may have been a consequence of insufficient follow-up time and recorded case numbers to detect the weak-to-moderate strength association which has previously been reported. our findings add to the large body of evidence which supports the promotion of weight control in population-wide cancer prevention programmes.

organic food consumption and the incidence of cancer in a large prospective study of women in the united kingdom

abstract
background:
organically produced foods are less likely than conventionally produced foods to contain pesticide residues.

methods:
we examined the hypothesis that eating organic food may reduce the risk of soft tissue sarcoma, breast cancer, non-hodgkin lymphoma and other common cancers in a large prospective study of 623 080 middle-aged uk women. women reported their consumption of organic food and were followed for cancer incidence over the next 9.3 years. cox regression models were used to estimate adjusted relative risks for cancer incidence by the reported frequency of consumption of organic foods.

results:
at baseline, 30%, 63% and 7% of women reported never, sometimes, or usually/always eating organic food, respectively. consumption of organic food was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of all cancer (n=53 769 cases in total) (rr for usually/always vs never=1.03, 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.99–1.07), soft tissue sarcoma (rr=1.37, 95% ci: 0.82–2.27), or breast cancer (rr=1.09, 95% ci: 1.02–1.15), but was associated for non-hodgkin lymphoma (rr=0.79, 95% ci: 0.65–0.96).

conclusions:
in this large prospective study there was little or no decrease in the incidence of cancer associated with consumption of organic food, except possibly for non-hodgkin lymphoma.

main
organic food production involves avoiding artificial fertilisers and pesticides and using crop rotation and other forms of husbandry to maintain soil fertility, control weeds and diseases. all food sold as organic in the united kingdom must be certified as organic by approved organic control bodies (defra, 2013). the market for organic foods in the united kingdom has grown rapidly during the last 20 years: sales of organic food products totalled £100 million in 1993/4 and over £2 billion at the peak of the market growth in 2008 (soil association, 2004, 2009). since 2008, sales of organic food in the united kingdom have declined slightly, but still account for a significant share of the market (defra 2012; soil association, 2012). dairy and ‘chilled convenience’ products and fresh fruit and vegetables are the most commonly purchased organic products (soil association, 2013). the main reason for consumers to buy organic food is because they believe it to be healthier (soil association, 2013).

a systematic review on organic food (smith-spangler et al, 2012) compared pesticide residues between organic and conventional crops, and found that organic foods were less likely to be contaminated with any detectable pesticide residue. this review (smith-spangler et al, 2012) and another (dangour et al, 2009) also compared the nutrient composition of organically and conventionally produced crops and found little difference for most nutrients, except a higher content of phosphorus in organic foods.

occupational pesticide exposure has been linked, albeit not conclusively, with a higher risk of certain cancers, particularly non-hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and breast cancer (dich et al, 1997; mostafalou and abdollahi, 2013). smith-spangler et al (2012) noted a dearth of studies examining organic food consumption in relation to health outcomes, and to our knowledge, no study has investigated organic food consumption in relation to cancer risk.

in this study we investigated the relationship between the reported frequency of consumption of organic food and subsequent cancer incidence, overall and for 17 individual cancer sites or types in a large prospective study of middle-aged women in the united kingdom.

materials and methods
participants and data
in 1996–2001, 1.3 million middle-aged women who had been invited for breast cancer screening at screening centres throughout england and scotland joined the million women study by completing a study questionnaire and by giving written consent. women have been re-surveyed about 3, 8, and 12 years after recruitment. full details of the study design and methods are described elsewhere (the million women study collaborative group, 1999), and study questionnaires can be viewed at www.millionwomenstudy.org.

all study participants are flagged on the national health service central registers, so that cancer registrations and deaths are routinely notified to the study investigators by the office for national statistics, england and the information services division, scotland. this information includes the date of each such event and codes the site and morphology of the cancer according to the international classification of diseases (icd)-10 and icd-0.

the study was approved by the oxford and anglia multi-centre research ethics committee.

baseline data on the consumption of organic food
at the 3-year survey, completed in 2002 on average, women were asked ‘do you eat organic food?’ with four possible categorical responses: ‘never, sometimes, usually, and always.’ women were also asked if they had changed their diet because of illness in the previous 5 years.

the same questions were asked at the 8-year survey.

statistical analysis
the baseline for follow-up for this analysis was the 3-year survey when organic food consumption was first reported. the end of follow-up for cancer incidence was 31 december 2011. eligible women contributed person-years from baseline until the date of registration with the cancer of interest, date of death, date of emigration, or end of follow-up, whichever was soonest. in addition, women diagnosed with any cancer other than the cancer of interest (except non-melanoma skin cancer) during the follow-up period were censored at the date of diagnosis of that cancer.

we examined cancer incidence in relation to frequency of consumption of organic food for all cancers combined (except non-melanoma skin cancer) and for 16 of the most common cancer sites or types of cancer: oral cavity and pharynx (c00–c14), oesophagus (c15), stomach (c16), colorectum (c18–c20), pancreas (c25), lung (c34), malignant melanoma (c43), breast (c50), endometrium (c54), ovary (c56), kidney (renal cell carcinoma) (c64), bladder (c67), brain (c71, c75.1–c75.3, c72, d32, d33, d35.2–d35.4, d42, d43, and d44.3–d44.5), non-hodgkin lymphoma (c82–c85), multiple myeloma (c90), and leukaemia (c91–c95). we also examined the incidence of soft tissue sarcoma (c49) in relation to the frequency of consumption of organic food; this is a rare cancer but we analysed it because there was a prior hypothesis.

at the 3-year survey, 751 975 women reported their consumption of organic food. we excluded women diagnosed with any cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer (c44) before baseline or who reported having changed their diet because of illness within the 5 years before baseline (128 895 excluded). for analyses of endometrial cancer, women who had a hysterectomy were excluded (157 755 excluded). for analyses of ovarian cancer, women who had a bilateral oophorectomy were excluded (72 059 excluded).

cox regression models using attained age as the underlying time variable were used to estimate relative risks for incident cancer by the reported frequency of consumption of organic foods at baseline. all analyses were stratified by age, geographical region (10 regions corresponding to the areas covered by the cancer registries), and socioeconomic status (in fifths, based on the townsend deprivation index (townsend et al, 1988)). analyses were adjusted for body mass index (bmi; <25 kg m-2, 25–29 kg m-2, and ⩾30 kg m-2); height (<1.60 m, 1.60–1.64 m, and ⩾1.65 m); smoking status (never, past, current <10 cigarettes per day, current 10–14 cigarettes per day, current 15–19 cigarettes per day, and current ⩾20 cigarettes per day); alcohol intake (none, 1–5, 6–10, and ⩾11 drinks per week); strenuous physical activity (never/rarely, less than once per week, and once or more per week); parity (0, 1, 2, and ⩾3 full-term pregnancies); age at first birth, (<25, 25–29, and ⩾30 years); fibre intake (grams per day, in fifths:<9.6, 9.6–12.2, 12.3–14.6, 14.7–17.5, and ⩾17.6); and type of meat eaten (none, poultry only, and red or processed meat). we assigned women with missing data for these adjustment variables to a separate category. missing data accounted for <3% for any variable, except for bmi (7.3%) and alcohol consumption (11.3%). information on socioeconomic status, height, parity, strenuous physical activity, and age at menarche was collected from the recruitment survey. information on bmi, smoking status, alcohol consumption, fibre intake, and meat intake was collected from the 3-year survey. to investigate reverse causality, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding the first 3 years of follow-up. analyses for breast cancer were additionally adjusted for hormone replacement therapy use (never, past, current, and not known) at baseline. for all cancers, we also restricted the analysis to women who reported never consuming organic food at baseline and at the 8-year survey, compared with women who reported usually or always consuming organic food at both study time points.

for individual cancer sites, relative risks are presented in the form of a plot, comparing women who usually/always ate organic food and women who sometimes ate organic food with women who never ate organic food. the position of the square indicates the value of the relative risk, and its area is inversely proportional to the variance of the logarithm of the risk in that group, indicating the amount of statistical information for that group alone. in figure 2, because more than two groups were compared, variances were estimated by treating the relative risks as floating absolute risks, yielding group-specific confidence intervals (g-s ci) (easton et al, 1991). the method does not alter the relative risks but enables valid comparisons between any two exposure groups, even when neither group is the reference group. when only two categories are compared (as in the text), conventional confidence intervals are used.

we also examined the risk of non-hodgkin lymphoma by the reported frequency of organic food consumption at baseline (usually/always vs never) according to sub-groups of socioeconomic status, bmi, smoking status and other factors.

results
in total, 623 080 women reported their frequency of consumption of organic food at baseline, had not been diagnosed with any cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer) before baseline, and had not changed their diet because of illness in the last 5 years. at baseline, 30% (n=187 451) of women reported never eating organic food, 63% (n=390 040) reported sometimes eating organic food, and 7% (n=45 589) reported usually or always eating organic food. table 1 shows characteristics of these women and information about follow-up. after a mean follow-up time of 9.3 (s.d. 2.2) years, 53 769 incident cancers occurred.

women who reported usually or always consuming organic food were more likely to report that they participated in strenuous physical activity, and were less likely to smoke or eat red and processed meat than women who reported never consuming organic food. there were smaller differences in socioeconomic status and other characteristics by reported frequency of organic food consumption.

figure 1 shows the percentage of women who reported usually or always consuming organic food at baseline by geographical region of breast screening centres. the percentage of women who reported usually or always consuming organic food was higher in the south and south west than in scotland and the north of england, although these differences were moderate.

an average of 5 years after baseline, 64% of women again reported their consumption of organic food. among women who reported usually or always consuming organic food at baseline only 3% reported never eating organic food 5 years later. among those who reported never eating organic food at baseline, only 1% reported usually or always eating organic food 5 years later. therefore, those reporting never or usually/always at baseline are distinct groups with little overlap between them 5 years later. we have focussed on the comparison between these groups.

figure 2 shows the associations between reported consumption of organic food and risk of 16 individual cancers, listed in icd order, stratified by age, region and socioeconomic status, and adjusted for smoking, bmi, physical activity, alcohol intake, height, parity, age at first birth, fibre intake, and type of meat intake. compared with women who reported never eating organic food, there was a small increase in risk of breast cancer among women who reported usually or always eating organic food (rr: 1.09, 95% ci: 1.02–1.15), but a decrease in risk for non-hodgkin lymphoma (rr: 0.79, 95% ci: 0.65–0.96). there were 213 cases of soft tissue sarcoma in total; compared with women who reported never eating organic food (n=65 cases), the rr of soft tissue sarcoma for women who reported usually or always eating organic food (n=21 cases) was 1.37 (95% ci: 0.82–2.27, p=0.2).

when we further adjusted the breast cancer analysis for hormone replacement therapy use at baseline (never, past, current, and not known) the rrs and 95% g-s cis were essentially unchanged: 1.00 (0.97–1.03), 1.06 (1.04–1.08), and 1.09 (1.03–1.15) for women who reported never, sometimes, or usually/always eating organic food, respectively.

in a sensitivity analysis excluding cancers diagnosed in the first 3 years of follow-up, there was still a significantly increased risk of breast cancer among women who reported usually or always eating organic food compared with women who reported never eating organic food (rr: 1.09, 95% ci: 1.01–1.17). for non-hodgkin lymphoma in those who reported usually or always eating organic food, the reduced risk was still statistically significant (rr: 0.79, 95% ci: 0.64–0.99).

we also examined the risk of all cancer in women who reported usually or always consuming organic food at baseline and at the 8-year survey (n=53 479) compared with women who reported never consuming organic food at both surveys (n=17 624). among these women, during an average of 5.2 years of follow-up after the 8-year survey, 3846 incident cases of cancers occurred. the rr for all cancer for women who reported usually/always consuming organic food at both surveys was 1.00 (95% ci: 0.92–1.09) compared with women who reported never consuming organic food at both surveys.

figure 3 shows the relative risk of non-hodgkin lymphoma in women who reported usually or always consuming organic food compared with never consuming organic food within various sub-groups of women, for example, upper socioeconomic status and lower socioeconomic status, and smokers and non-smokers. the associations were similar across all sub-groups examined.

discussion
in this large prospective study of middle-aged women in the united kingdom followed for 9.3 years with just over 50 000 incident cancers, we found little evidence for a decrease in the incidence of all cancers associated with usually or always consuming organic food, except perhaps for non-hodgkin lymphoma.

a systematic review comparing organic foods to conventional produce found that organic produce had a 30% lower risk for contamination with any detectable pesticide residue (smith-spangler et al, 2012). in terms of health-related outcomes, the systematic review found that small cross-sectional (n=49) (curl et al, 2003) and cross-over (n=23) (lu et al, 2006) studies in children have shown significantly lower levels of organophosphate pesticide metabolites among children on organic diets compared with conventional diets. however, the review found no studies that have compared pesticide exposure among consumers of conventional compared with organic foods in adults.

exposure to pesticides in the general population, excluding occupational and accidental exposure, is mainly via residues on food. regular testing of the food supply in the united kingdom is undertaken to monitor levels of chemical residues in foods. the concentration of pesticide residues found in foods is generally low. the latest available report from the pesticide residues committee, for the quarter ending december 2012, shows that pesticide residues were detected in 30% of food samples tested, but were above the maximum permitted level in only 1% of the food samples (the expert committee on pesticide residues in food, 2012). the international agency for research on cancer has classified some of the detected pesticides, such as ddt (international agency for research on cancer, 1991) and chlorothalonil (international agency for research on cancer, 1999), as possibly carcinogenic to humans. owing to a lack of data, some of the other pesticides that were detected are not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans (international agency for research on cancer, 1991).

some, but not all, epidemiological studies have shown a higher incidence of non-hodgkin lymphoma with occupational exposure to certain pesticides (baris and zahm 2000; bassig et al, 2012). these studies have been limited by small sample size and errors in obtaining accurate measurements of cumulative pesticide exposure. we found a 21% lower risk of non-hodgkin lymphoma in women who reported usually or always eating organic food compared with women who reported never eating organic food. this lowered risk remained after excluding the first 3 years of follow-up. the analyses were adjusted for a range of personal characteristics of women, including dietary fibre and meat intake. in addition, the associations for non-hodgkin lymphoma were similar within sub-groups of socioeconomic status, bmi, height, smoking, alcohol, exercise, fibre intake, red and processed meat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake. however, we performed multiple tests and therefore we cannot rule out chance as an explanation for this finding.

epidemiological studies have reported higher risks of soft tissue sarcoma among farmers and forestry workers, and with exposure to herbicides and organochlorine compounds (dich et al, 1997). our results showed no significant association between organic food consumption and risk of soft tissue sarcoma. however, only 213 cases of soft tissue sarcoma accrued during follow-up and we had limited power to detect an association with organic food consumption.

small studies conducted in the early 1990s suggested a link between pesticide exposure and increased risk of breast cancer (falck et al, 1992; wolff et al, 1993), although later studies have not confirmed this association (ingber et al, 2013). our findings do not support the hypothesis that breast cancer risk might be reduced with lower pesticide exposure as we observed a slightly higher risk of breast cancer in women who usually or always ate organic food compared with women who never ate organic food. women who reported consuming organic food were of a higher socioeconomic status, consumed more alcohol, and on average had slightly lower parity than women who never ate organic food, and these factors are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. although we adjusted for nine potential confounding factors including alcohol and socioeconomic status, the relative risk of 1.09 could well be because of residual confounding. it is also possible that women who reported frequently consuming organic food are more likely to attend breast cancer screening and therefore are more likely to be diagnosed with screen-detected breast cancer, which could account for the slightly higher risk of breast cancer in those that reported usually or always consuming organic food.

reporting of consumption of organic food at baseline remained reasonably stable 5 years later. never and usually/always were distinct groups at baseline with little overlap between them 5 years later. however, we do not have any information on how long women in our study had been consuming organic food before baseline. consumption of organic food was related to various factors including geographical region, with a slightly higher proportion of women in the south and south west of england reporting usually or always eating organic food compared with women in the north of england and scotland. consumption of organic food was also related to certain individual characteristics including smoking, exercise, and red and processed meat consumption. however, all analyses were adjusted for these potential confounders.

this is a very large study with virtually complete follow-up and with detailed information on potentially important confounders including smoking, deprivation, reproductive and hormonal factors, body size, dietary factors, and other health indicators. approximately two-thirds of women in the million women study responded to the 3-year survey and answered the question on organic food. the main differences between responders and non-responders to the 3-year survey were the proportion of current smokers at recruitment (16% vs 28%) and the proportion of women in the upper third of socioeconomic status at recruitment (36% vs 29%). this would, however, not affect the comparisons here, especially as we adjust for smoking and socioeconomic status. a limitation of this study is that the frequency of organic food consumption was self-reported. however, there is likely to be a true difference in organic food consumption in the extreme frequency categories, that is, between those that reported never consuming organic food, and those that reported usually or always consuming organic food, and it is the comparison between these two groups that we have focussed on. in addition, we do not have information on the types of organic food eaten, such as fruits and vegetables, dairy products, or meat. uk sales data indicate that dairy and chilled convenience products account for 31% of the organic food market, and fruit and vegetables account for 23% of the organic market (soil association, 2013). a systematic review on organic food found that organic fruit and vegetables are less likely to contain detectable pesticide residues (smith-spangler et al, 2012); however, we did not test blood or tissue samples from our participants to confirm that women who reported usually or always consuming organic food had lower exposure to pesticides than those who reported never consuming organic food.

as far as we are aware, this is the first cohort study to examine the association between the consumption of organic food and the risk of cancer, and is particularly relevant given that health concerns have been identified as the primary motivation for consumers’ purchase of organic food (hughner et al, 2007). in summary, we did not find a reduced risk of cancer overall, or for 16 specific cancer sites or types among women who usually or always consume organic food. however, we did find a reduced risk of non-hodgkin lymphoma. replication of this result is needed but future prospective studies would need to be extremely large and to follow participants for long periods (e.g., a cohort of 500 000 people followed for a decade) to have sufficient power to examine the association between organic food consumption and non-hodgkin lymphoma. blood markers of pesticide exposure could also be examined in relation to reported organic food consumption and risk of non-hodgkin lymphoma.

foods, macronutrients and breast cancer risk in
postmenopausal women: a large uk cohort
abstract
background: the role of diet in breast cancer aetiology is unclear; recent studies have
suggested associations may differ by estrogen receptor status.
methods: baseline diet was assessed in 2000–04 using a validated questionnaire in 691 571
postmenopausal uk women without previous cancer, who had not changed their diet recently. they were followed by record linkage to national cancer and death databases. cox
regression yielded adjusted relative risks for breast cancer for 10 food items and eight macronutrients, subdivided mostly into five categories of baseline intake. trends in risk across
the baseline categories were calculated, assigning re-measured intakes to allow for measurement error and changes in intake over time; p-values allowed for multiple testing.
results: women aged 59.9 (standard deviation (sd 4.9)) years at baseline were followed
for 12 (sd 3) years; 29 005 were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. alcohol intake
had the strongest association with breast cancer incidence: relative risk (rr) 1.08 [99%
confidence interval (ci) 1.05–1.11] per 10 g/day higher intake, p ¼ 5.8  1014. there were
inverse associations with fruit: rr 0.94 (99% ci 0.92–0.97) per 100 g/day higher intake,
p ¼ 1.1  106
, and dietary fibre: rr 0.91 (99% ci 0.87–0.96) per 5 g/day increase,
p ¼ 1.1  104
. fruit and fibre intakes were correlated (q ¼ 0.62) and were greater among
women who were not overweight, so residual confounding cannot be excluded. there
was no heterogeneity for any association by estrogen receptor status.
conclusions: by far the strongest association was between alcohol intake and an increased risk of breast cancer. of the other 17 intakes examined, higher intakes of fruit
and fibre were associated with lower risks of breast cancer, but it is unclear whether or
not these associations are causal.
introduction
breast cancer incidence is generally greater in high-income
than low-income countries.1,2 much of this variation is
due to reproductive factors such as parity and breastfeeding, together with variations in screening and diagnosis,2,3
but other risk factors might be involved. many studies
have explored the possible role of diet, with the main hypotheses being that risk may be increased by high intakes
of alcohol, fat, meat and dairy products, and that risk may
be decreased by high intakes of fibre, fruits and vegetables.4 there is now convincing evidence that alcohol
increases the risk of breast cancer.5 a recent systematic
review of prospective studies concluded that there was no
definite evidence that any other dietary factors were associated with the risk of developing breast cancer, although
there was limited evidence that relatively high intakes of
vegetables might decrease the risk of estrogen receptornegative (er-ve) breast cancer.6 another recent review
concluded that high intakes of red and processed meat
intake may be risk factors for breast cancer.7
we report here results from an analysis of the relation
between intakes of a wide range of foods and macronutrients and breast cancer incidence among postmenopausal
women in the million women study, a large prospective
study in the uk. to cover the most prominent hypotheses
for effects of diet on breast cancer risk,4 we examined risk
in relation to 18 dietary items and macronutrients (meat
type and quantity, fish, milk, cheese, yogurt, eggs, fruit,
vegetables, alcohol, energy, percentage of energy from
protein, dairy protein, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, free sugars and dietary fibre). associations were examined overall for any invasive breast cancer, and
separately by er status.
methods
study population
participants in the million women study were recruited
from women invited to the national health service (nhs)
breast screening programme in england and scotland between 1996 and 2001. a total of 1.3 million women aged
56 years [standard deviation (sd) 6] on average joined the
study by completing the recruitment questionnaire, which
asked about social, demographic and lifestyle factors.
postal re-surveys have been done every 3–5 years and
online questionnaires about dietary intake have been
administered since 2010. the study was approved by
the oxford and anglia multi-centre research ethics
committee, and all women gave written consent. further
details are on the study website.8,9
assessment of diet
an average of 3.3 years after recruitment, women were
sent a questionnaire which updated information collected
at recruitment and collected new information on diet. this
3-year re-survey, which asked for the first time about
dietary intakes, was completed in 2000–04 and is the baseline for the analyses reported here. participants were asked
about their usual diet during a typical week, including
about 130 quantitative or semi-quantitative questions (see:
http://www.millionwomenstudy.org/files/mws-web2.pdf).
nutrient intakes were calculated by multiplying the frequency of consumption of each food by the specified portion size and the nutrient composition of that item. the
short-term repeatability of most of the diet questions was
good, and in comparison with intakes of nine macronutrients estimated from 7-day food diaries (with portion
sizes weighed or assessed by comparison with photographs), the median energy-adjusted correlation coefficient
was 0.55 (range from 0.27 for polyunsaturated fat to 0.75
for alcohol).10
for these analyses we categorized reported intakes at
baseline into five groups except for fish, where three categories were used: no fish; any fatty fish (salmon, sardines,
kippers/herring, trout, and mackerel]; and non-fatty fish
only [tuna, cod/haddock, ‘fish & chips’ and other seafood).
for meat, the five categories were of the type of meat
consumed: never ate meat; ate poultry but no red meat
key messages
• in this large prospective study, we systematically examined associations of 10 foods and eight macronutrients with
breast cancer risk, overall and by estrogen receptor status.
• the strongest finding was a positive association of alcohol consumption with breast cancer risk, in line with previous
evidence.
• none of the 17 other foods and macronutrients examined was strongly associated with breast cancer risk; both fruit and
fibre intakes, which are correlated, showed inverse associations with risk, but it is unclear if these associations are causal.
• for none of the dietary items examined was there evidence of heterogeneity by estrogen receptor status.

(with red meat comprising beef, lamb, pork, beefburger/
hamburger, kidney, and liver/pate´); consumers of red meat
but no processed meat; consumers of red meat and at least
one type of processed meat (bacon, ham or sausages); and
consumers of red meat and at least two types of processed
meat. for other foods the categories were selected to provide substantial numbers in each of the five groups, while
respecting the integer nature of some of the data (e.g. items
of fruit consumed per day). vegetables comprised cooked
vegetables (except potatoes) and salad items/raw vegetables; and fruit comprised fresh fruit, dried fruit and stewed
or tinned fruit. for the eight macronutrients studied here,
the cut-points for the five groups were quintiles of intake.
in supplementary analyses we examined breast cancer risk:
by types of fruit and sources of fibre (for sources of dietary
fibre, the mean intakes were from the baseline questionnaire because the coding of food subgroups and composite
foods was not directly comparable to that in the 24-h dietary assessment data); by intakes of alcohol, stratified by
intakes of fruit and fibre; and by intakes of soya foods and
types of vegetables.
repeat measures of intake in each baseline category
were derived from a web-based 24-h dietary assessment
tool, the oxford webq,11 completed by 19 478 women on
average 10 years after baseline and before the end of follow-up.
ascertainment of breast cancer
participants were followed by record linkage to the uk
nhs databases on cancer registrations and deaths.
data for england were provided by nhs digital and the
office for national statistics, and for scotland by the
information services division, nhs scotland. information
on estrogen receptor (er) status of the incident breast
tumours was provided by public health england/national
cancer registration and analysis service; this information
is incomplete, particularly during the early years of followup. overall 1% (n ¼ 7647) of the cohort has been lost to
follow-up. and individuals contributed person-years until
they were lost. diagnoses were coded to the international
classification of diseases, 10th revision (icd-10). the
endpoint for this study was incident invasive breast cancer
(icd-10 c50).
statistical analysis
the dietary factors examined were consumption of 10
food groups including alcohol, and eight macronutrients or
subtypes of macronutrients. associations between intakes
of food groups and macronutrients were examined by
calculating spearman non-parametric correlation coefficients. for analyses of relative risk of breast cancer, women
were generally divided into five baseline categories of food
or nutrient intake. for estimating trends in risk, the food
and nutrient intakes assigned to each baseline category
were the means in each baseline category re-measured in
the 24-h dietary recall (for women with more than one
24-h dietary recall, data were used just from the first). this
non-parametric approach reduces the impact of regression
dilution bias and other forms of measurement error.12
woman-years were calculated from the date the baseline dietary questionnaire was completed up to whichever
came first: diagnosis of cancer, emigration, death, loss to
follow-up or the last date when cancer incidence data were
complete. the last date of follow-up was 31 december
2014. cox regression models with time in study as the underlying time variable were used to estimate rate ratios
(rrs) and 99% confidence intervals (99% cis) of breast
cancer by dietary factors. analyses were stratified by year
of birth, region of residence (10 geographical regions in
england, and scotland) and calendar year of completion of
the dietary questionnaire, and adjusted for dietary energy
intake (fifths), socioeconomic group (fifths, based on the
townsend score13), body mass index (<25, 25–29.9,
30 kg/m2
), height (<160, 160–164.9, 165 cm), alcohol
consumption (except for the analysis of alcohol and risk;
none, 1–2, 3–6, 7–14, 15 drinks per week), smoking
(never, past, current <15, current 15 cigarettes per day),
age at menarche (11, 12–13, 14–15, 16 years), strenuous exercise (none, 1 per week, >1 per week), parity and
age at first birth (parity 0, 1–2, 3 cross-classified by age
at first birth <25, 25–29, 30 years), highest education
(none, technical, secondary, tertiary) and ever use of hormonal therapy for menopause (no, yes). the non-dietary
data were from the 3-year re-survey, except for socioeconomic group, strenuous exercise and height, which were
from the recruitment questionnaire. to ensure that the
same women were being compared in all analyses, the
small number with a missing value for each particular variable were assigned to a separate category for that variable.
in analyses of factors with more than two categories,
rrs were treated as floating absolute risks, allowing estimation of group-specific confidence intervals for all categories including the reference group.14 this method allows
any two exposure groups to be compared. most dietary
variables considered here have no natural baseline category, so the middle category was used as the reference
group. for trends in breast cancer risk per specified increment in dietary intake, conventional cis are used (for alcohol, the estimates of linear trend were in drinkers only,
because non-drinkers may have different characteristics).

heterogeneity in the associations between women with
erþve and er-ve breast cancer was assessed with likelihood ratio tests calculated from case-only models in which
the outcome was defined as erþ or er- disease.
we examined trends in breast cancer risk overall and
subdivided by er status. many tests for trend and
hundreds of relative risks and confidence intervals are presented here, and there is no agreed convention for dealing
with this extent of multiple testing. when examining
trends in breast cancer risk for the 18 dietary items examined, we used the magnitudes of v2 statistics to assess the
strengths of associations and applied a bonferroni correction to nominal p-values by multiplying the values by 18.
some allowance for the hundreds of individual rr estimates in the tables and plots was made by quoting their
99% confidence intervals. in supplementary analyses, we
examined risk by subtypes of fruit and sources of fibre, by
intakes of alcohol stratified by intakes of fruit and
fibre (because it has been suggested that high intakes of
dietary fibre may attenuate the increase in risk caused by
alcohol15) and by intakes of soya foods and types of vegetables. all statistical analyses were performed using stata
statistical software, release 15.1 (statacorp., college
station, tx).
results
the baseline diet questionnaire was completed by 861 918
women. we excluded 47 212 with previous cancer (other
than non-melanoma skin cancer) at baseline and 123 099
who reported at baseline that they had changed their diet
in the previous 5 years due to illness. women with energy
intakes <2100 kj/day (d) (500 kcal/d) or more than
14 700 kj/d (3500 kcal/d) were excluded. after these exclusions, 691 571 women were eligible for these analyses.
table 1 shows their characteristics and average intakes of
food groups, alcohol and macronutrients at baseline, together with details of follow-up. table 2 shows the intakes
of foods, alcohol and macronutrients in relation to nondietary characteristics; intakes of alcohol, fruit and fibre
all tended to be greater among women who were taller,
were not overweight or obese, had fewer children and were
of higher socioeconomic status. compared with women
reporting being in excellent or good health, women in fair
or poor health reported markedly lower intakes of fruit,
vegetables, alcohol and dietary fibre (table s1, available as
supplementary data at ije online). table s2, available as
supplementary data at ije online, shows the correlations
between the food groups, alcohol and macronutrients at
baseline (the latter expressed as percentage of energy intake), and table s3, available as supplementary data at
ije online, shows the mean intakes estimated from 24-h
dietary assessments 10 years after baseline, which confirm
the rankings at baseline.
after 12 (sd 3) years of follow-up, 29 005 women were
diagnosed with incident invasive breast cancer, among
whom information on er status was available for 10 838
erþve and 1658 er-ve breast cancers. figure 1 shows the
rrs for breast cancer in relation to the intakes of eight
food items. there was a positive association with alcohol,
with an rr of 1.08 (99% ci 1.05–1.11, x1

trend ¼ 62.1; p ¼ 5.8  1014) per 10 g/d higher intake
(trend in drinkers only). there was also an inverse association of risk with fruit intake, with a rr of 0.94 (99% ci

) per 100 g/d
higher intake (further results for figure 1 are in table s4,

groups and alcohol separately for erþve and er-ve breast
cancer; there was no significant heterogeneity in associations by er status (table s4, available as supplementary

data at ije online). not all women had information available on er status, but findings in these women did not differ materially from those with available information
(results not shown). breast cancer risk was not associated
with the types of meat and fish consumed (table 3). breast
cancer risk was inversely associated with intake of fresh
fruit [rr of 0.95 (99% ci 0.92–0.98) per 100 g/d higher
intake, x1

juice (table s5, available as supplementary data at ije online). after allowing for multiple testing, breast cancer risk
was not associated with consumption of soya foods or
types of vegetables (tables s6 and s7, available as
supplementary data at ije online).

)
per 5 g/d higher intake (detailed results for figure 3 are in
table s8, available as supplementary data at ije online).
figure 4 shows the associations of intake of these eight macronutrients with risk of erþve and er-ve breast cancer;
there was no heterogeneity in associations by er status
(table s8, available as supplementary data at ije online); in
women without information on er status, results were similar (results not shown). breast cancer risk was inversely associated with the intake of fibre from fruit but not from
other sources (table s9, available as supplementary data at
ije online).
associations of fruit and fibre intake with breast cancer
risk were found separately at five levels of alcohol consumption, and associations of alcohol intake with breast
cancer risk were similar at three levels of intake of fruit
and at five levels of intake of dietary fibre (table s10,
available as supplementary data at ije online).
discussion
we report the results from systematic analyses in a large prospective study of the associations between intakes of 18 dietary factors and the incidence of breast cancer. the positive
association with alcohol consumption (p¼ 5.8 1014) is
expected, given that alcohol is an established cause of breast
cancer.5 the other statistically significant associations, inverse relationships with fruit and dietary fibre intakes, were
considerably weaker than for alcohol (p¼ 1.1 106 and
1.1 104
, respectively, after correction for multiple testing).
intakes of fruit and dietary fibre were strongly correlated
with each other (correlation coefficient 0.62), therefore the
associations of these two dietary items with breast cancer
risk are not independent. in a recent meta-analysis,6 the
intakes of fruit and dietary fibre were also both associated
with a small reduction in breast cancer risk; whereas these
small associations might be causal, it is also possible that
they are largely or wholly due to residual confounding.

in our data, examination of whether there was heterogeneity in dietary associations between erþve and er-ve
breast cancers showed no clear evidence for such heterogeneity. previous studies found no heterogeneity by er status
in the associations of alcohol16 or fruit6,17–19 with breast
cancer risk, similar to our results. previous studies suggested that vegetable intakes were inversely associated
with risk for er-ve but not erþve breast cancer6,16,19; but
we found no significant association of breast cancer risk
with intake of vegetables, and no heterogeneity by er status. for dietary fibre, results by er status from previous
studies are inconsistent.20–24 overall, the currently available evidence shows no consistent differences in associations of dietary factors with breast cancer risk by er
status, but more data are required, especially for er-ve
disease.
chhim et al.15 suggested that a high intake of dietary
fibre might attenuate the adverse effect of alcohol on

breast cancer risk, and a subsequent examination of this
hypothesis in the epic study showed some evidence of
an interaction between the associations of alcohol and
fibre with risk, with a higher relative risk for breast
cancer associated with alcohol in women with a low
fibre intake25; however, our results do not support this
hypothesis.
with 29 000 incident breast cancers in a cohort of almost 700 000 women, this is as far as we are aware the
largest single prospective study of diet and breast cancer
risk. nutritional epidemiology may be subject to selective
reporting biases,26 and therefore we used a systematic approach, assessing the relationships of breast cancer risk
with 18 pre-specified dietary factors and allowing for multiple testing in the interpretation of the findings. other
strengths of this study include the virtually complete
follow-up for cancer over 12 years, the comprehensive assessment of confounders and the use of re-measured

food diaries11 and shown to predict risks of other conditions.27 tests for trend across groups categorised by their
baseline intakes of foods and nutrients mean re-measured

this study showed a strong positive association of

circulating insulin-like growth factor i in relation to melanoma risk in the european
prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition cohort
abstract
insulin-like growth factor (igf-i) regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis, and is thought to
play a role in tumour development. previous prospective studies have shown that higher
circulating concentrations of igf-i are associated with a higher risk of cancers at specific
sites, including breast and prostate. no prospective study has examined the association
between circulating igf-i concentrations and melanoma risk. a nested case-control study of
1221 melanoma cases and 1221 controls was performed in the european prospective
investigation into cancer and nutrition cohort, a prospective cohort of 520,000 participants
recruited from 10 european countries. conditional logistic regression was used to estimate
odds ratios (ors) for incident melanoma in relation to circulating igf-i concentrations,
measured by immunoassay. analyses were conditioned on the matching factors and further
adjusted for age at blood collection, education, height, bmi, smoking status, alcohol intake,
marital status, physical activity, and in women only, use of menopausal hormone therapy.
there was no significant association between circulating igf-i concentration and melanoma
risk (or for highest vs lowest fifth=0.93 (95% confidence interval (ci): 0.71 to 1.22)). there
was no significant heterogeneity in the association between igf-i concentrations and
melanoma risk when subdivided by sex, age at blood collection, bmi, height, age at
diagnosis, time between blood collection and diagnosis, or by anatomical site or histological
subtype of the tumour (pheterogeneity≥0.078). we found no evidence for an association
accepted
between circulating concentrations of igf-i measured in adulthood and the risk of melanoma.

novelty and impact: previous case-control studies have examined the association between
igf-i axis and the risk of melanoma, with inconsistent results. in this first prospective study
on this topic, we found no evidence for an association between circulating igf-i
concentrations and risk of melanoma.
a possible association between the insulin-like growth factor (igf-i) and the risk of melanoma has
been proposed, but with inconsistent results so far. in this prospective study, the authors found no
evidence for an association between circulating igf-i concentrations and melanoma risk. although
details on major risk factors like sun exposure were missing, the large sample size with more than
1000 incident melanoma cases underscores the relevance of the finding.
introduction
worldwide there were an estimated 350,000 new cases of melanoma, and 60,000 deaths from
melanoma in 2015 (1). exposure to ultraviolet radiation (specifically, intermittent exposure),
and phenotypic characteristics such as fairer skin colour, blond or red hair, and multiple naevi
and freckles are established risk factors for melanoma (2-4). there are also other putative or
possible risk factors for melanoma including occupational exposure to chemicals and ionizing
radiation (5).
insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i) is a polypeptide hormone that stimulates cell division and
inhibits apoptosis; it is through these properties that it is thought to play a role in the
development and progression of carcinogenesis (6). prospective studies have shown that
higher circulating concentrations of igf-i are associated with a higher risk of cancers at
specific sites, including the breast (7), prostate (8), and possibly the thyroid (9). three casecontrol studies have examined the relationship between circulating igf-i concentrations and
risk of melanoma, but the results were not consistent. one study found an inverse relationship
between circulating igf-i concentration and risk of melanoma (10), but two studies found an
unexpected positive association (11,12). the results of case-control studies may be unreliable
if the development of melanoma affects circulating igf-i concentrations, or if bias was
introduced in the selection of controls (13). given this uncertainty, we examined the
association between circulating igf-i concentrations measured in adulthood and the
subsequent risk of melanoma in a case-control study nested within the european prospective
accepted
investigation into cancer and nutrition (epic) cohort.

methods
study population
the study design, including the recruitment, blood collection, and follow-up procedures of
epic has been described previously (4). briefly, between 1992 and 2000 approximately
520,000 participants, mostly aged between 35 and 70 years, were recruited from 23 centres in
10 european countries (denmark, france, germany, greece, italy, netherlands, norway,
spain, sweden, and the uk). participants provided information on socio-demographic
characteristics, dietary intakes, and lifestyle factors. the study was approved by the
international agency for research on cancer ethics committee and local ethics committees
in the participating countries. all participants gave written informed consent.
selection of cases and controls
in most centres, follow-up for cancer incidence and mortality was conducted via record
linkage with regional and national registries. in france, germany, and greece, follow-up was
by a combination of methods, including health insurance records, cancer and pathology
registries and active follow-up through study subjects and their next-of-kin (15).
cases were participants who were diagnosed with incident invasive melanoma of the skin
(who international classification of diseases-oncology 3rd edition (icd-o-3) codes 8720-
8790, with 5th digit behaviour code 3 signifying invasive malignancies) during follow-up, and
who had donated a blood sample and had not been diagnosed with cancer (except for nonmelanoma skin cancer) at baseline, and had not been diagnosed with other tumours (except
non-melanoma skin cancer) before the melanoma diagnosis. superficial spreading
melanomas were defined as tumours with icd-o-3 morphology code 8743/3, and nodular
melanomas as those with icd-o-3 morphology code 8721/3. melanomas of the head and
neck were tumours with international classification of diseases 10th edition (icd-10) site
codes c44.0-c44.4, melanomas of the trunk were those with icd-10 site code c44.5,
melanomas of the upper limbs were those with icd-10 site code c44.6, and melanomas of
the lower limbs were those with icd-10 site code c44.7. participants were eligible for
selection as a control if they had provided a blood sample at baseline, and were alive and
without a cancer diagnosis (other than non-melanoma skin cancer) at the time of the
diagnosis of the index case. randomly chosen controls were matched (1:1) to each case using
incidence density sampling (15). the matching criteria were: study centre, sex, age at blood
collection (± 1 year), and date (± 3 months), time of day (± 3 hours), and fasting status (< 3
hours, 3 to 6 hours, > 6 hours) at blood collection. the present study includes 1221 cases and
1221 controls (523 male cases and controls; 698 female cases and controls).
laboratory measurements
approximately 75% of participants provided a blood sample at recruitment (15). in most
centres whole blood was transported to a local laboratory, processed within 24 hours, and
transported to be stored centrally in liquid nitrogen at -196°c at the international agency for
research on cancer. in denmark, all blood samples were stored locally in nitrogen vapour at
-150°c, and in sweden all blood samples were stored in electric freezers at -70°c. in the
oxford cohort, samples were sent at ambient temperature to a central laboratory in norfolk,
uk with a mean transit time of 1.5 days.
igf-i concentration was measured in serum samples, except for the participants from
norway and umeå (sweden), for which citrated plasma and edta plasma samples were
used, respectively. igf-i concentration was measured in the cancer epidemiology unit
(oxford, united kingdom) using the automated ids-isys immunoassay system from
immunodiagnostic systems ltd (tyne & wear, uk) (17). laboratory personnel were blind to
the case-control status of the samples and each case-control set was analysed in the same
batch, together with duplicate quality control samples. the intra- and inter-assay coefficients
of variation were 3.9% and 4.7% at an overall mean concentration of 14.2 nmol/l.
statistical analyses
all statistical analyses were run using stata version 14.1 (stata corp, college station, tx).
participant characteristics were compared between cases and controls, for men and women
separately, using the paired-sample t test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for
categorical variables.
igf-i concentration was logarithmically transformed (using the natural log transformation) to
approximate a normal distribution. among controls only, geometric mean serum igf-i
concentrations by participant characteristics were investigated using analysis of variance
(anova), adjusted for batch, age at blood collection (as a continuous variable), sex,
country, and alcohol intake. tests for linear trends across categories were performed by
scoring categories with consecutive integers.
odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for melanoma by quintiles of sexspecific serum igf-i concentration at baseline (based on the sex-specific distributions in the
controls) were estimated using conditional logistic regression, conditioned on the matching
variables and. in the multivariable model, to allow for finer adjustment for age, the model
was adjusted for age at blood collection (in months, as a continuous variable), as well as
education (primary/none, secondary, degree), height (sex-specific quartiles), bmi (sexspecific quartiles), smoking status (never, former, current), alcohol intake (<1, 1-7, 8-19, 20-
39, >40 g/d), marital status (married/co-habiting, unmarried/not co-habiting), physical
activity (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, active (18)), and in women only,
use of menopausal hormone therapy (current, not current). for all covariates, any missing
values were assigned to a separate category. the odds of melanoma associated with a
doubling of igf-i concentration were investigated as described above but using the logarithm
to the base 2 of serum igf-i concentration.
using conditional logistic regression, conditioning on the matching factors and adjusting for
the covariates listed above (where relevant), we also examined the association between igf-i
and melanoma subdivided by major participant characteristics: sex, age at blood collection (<
55 years, ≥ 55 years), bmi (< 25 kg/m2
, ≥ 25 kg/m2
), height (sex-specific medians: < 176 cm
(men) or < 163 cm (women), ≥ 176 cm (men) or ≥ 163 cm (women)), and age at case
diagnosis (< 60 years, ≥ 60 years). in addition, to investigate the possibility of reverse
causality we examined the association between igf-i and melanoma subdivided by time
between blood collection and diagnosis (< 4 years, ≥ 4 years). finally, to explore whether
igf-i may be differentially associated with sub-types of melanoma, we examined the
association between igf-i and melanoma risk in categories of anatomical site (head and
neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs) and histological sub-type (superficial spreading
and nodular melanoma) of the tumour. for these analyses, controls were assigned to the same
category as their matched case. for the bmi subgroup analysis, participants were only
included if both the case and matched control had a bmi <25 kg/m2
, or if both case and
matched control had a bmi ≥ 25 kg/m2
, with similar rules for the analyses subdivided by
height and age at blood collection. tests for heterogeneity of risk between sub-groups were
performed using the likelihood ratio test, comparing models with and without the interaction
term between the logarithm of circulating igf-i concentration and the variable of interest.
all statistical tests were two-sided, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
results
among men, cases were slightly taller, were more likely to have a university degree, and less
likely to be current smokers, compared to the controls. among women, cases were also
slightly taller, but were otherwise similar to controls with regards to the characteristics listed
in table 1. among the cases, the mean time from blood collection to diagnosis was 6.5 years.
among the controls, geometric mean igf-i concentrations were significantly lower in
women, in those who were older at blood collection, and in those who drank the most alcohol
(table 2). among women, current menopausal hormone therapy users had lower mean igf-i
concentrations. the lowest concentrations of igf-i were in the 1st and 4th quartiles of bmi
and the highest concentrations were in the 2nd and 3rd quartiles. circulating igf-i
concentrations differed by country; participants from the netherlands had the highest mean
igf-i concentrations.
there was no significant association between serum igf-i concentrations and the risk of
melanoma in either the basic model, or in the fully adjusted model, further adjusted for age at
blood collection, education, height, bmi, smoking status, alcohol intake, marital status,
physical activity, and use of menopausal hormone therapy. in the fully adjusted model, the
or for a doubling in igf-i concentration was 1.04 (95% ci: 0.84-1.28, ptrend=0.736) (table
3). when we examined the associations in pre-specified sub-groups, we found no significant
differences in associations by sex, age at blood collection, bmi, height, age at diagnosis, or
years between blood collection and diagnosis, or by anatomical site or histological sub-type
accepted
of the tumour (pheterogeneity≥0.078, for all subdivisions) (table 4).

discussion
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to examine circulating
concentration of igf-i measured in adulthood in relation to the risk of melanoma. we found
no association overall, or for specific anatomical sites or histological sub-types of melanoma.
furthermore, we found no evidence of heterogeneity in the association between circulating
igf-i concentrations and risk of melanoma by sex, age at blood collection, bmi, height, age
at diagnosis, or time between blood collection and diagnosis.
three small case-control studies have examined circulating igf-i concentrations and risk of
melanoma, but the findings were inconsistent (10-12). the reason for the inconsistency in the
results of these case-control studies is unclear, but the selection of controls in a case-control
study can bias the association between exposure and disease (13). in addition, the results of
case-control studies may be influenced by reverse causation bias if the presence of disease
affects circulating igf-i concentrations.
laboratory work has indicated that the igf-i axis may play a role in melanoma progression;
specifically, studies have reported that igf-i enhances survival and migration of melanoma
cells in vitro (19,20). however, the present large prospective study did not find any relation
between circulating igf-i concentrations and the risk of developing melanoma.
the strengths of our study include the large sample size, and the nested-case control design,
which allowed for the collection of blood samples before diagnosis of melanoma. a
limitation of our study is that we did not have information on some of the major risk factors
for melanoma – sun exposure, skin phototype, or family history of melanoma (2-4) – and
therefore we were unable to adjust for these factors in our analysis. however, these factors
would only distort the association of igf-i with melanoma if they were also associated with
circulating igf-i concentrations. in a previous case-control study, adjusting for number of
lifetime blistering sunburns, ability to tan and hair colour did not appreciably alter the
association between igf-i and melanoma risk (11). in addition, in this study we used a single
measure of circulating igf-i concentration, but previous work has shown good
reproducibility of circulating igf-i concentrations over three (intra-class correlation
(icc)=0.86) (21), and five (icc=0.71) years (22). finally, more than 90% of circulating igfi is bound to igf binding protein (igfbp)-3 (23) and we did not measure igfbps in this
study. igfbps may affect the bioavailability and signalling of igf-i, but the regulation of
igf-i action by the igfbps is complex and not fully characterised (6). prospective studies of
breast (7) and prostate cancer (8), have found positive associations with circulating igf-i
concentrations and cancer risk, that were not changed after adjustment for the predominant
binding protein, igfbp-3.
in conclusion, in this large prospective study, which included a total of 1221 cases of incident
melanoma, we did not find any evidence that circulating igf-i concentration measured in
adulthood was associated with the risk of melanoma.

consumption of meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs and risk of ischemic heart disease
a prospective study of 7198 incident cases among 409 885 participants in the pan-european epic cohort
abstract
background:
there is uncertainty about the relevance of animal foods to the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease (ihd). we examined meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs and risk for ihd in the pan-european epic cohort (european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition).

methods:
in this prospective study of 409 885 men and women in 9 european countries, diet was assessed with validated questionnaires and calibrated with 24-hour recalls. lipids and blood pressure were measured in a subsample. during a mean of 12.6 years of follow-up, 7198 participants had a myocardial infarction or died of ihd. the relationships of animal foods with risk were examined with cox regression with adjustment for other animal foods and relevant covariates.

results:
the hazard ratio (hr) for ihd was 1.19 (95% ci, 1.06–1.33) for a 100-g/d increment in intake of red and processed meat, and this remained significant after exclusion of the first 4 years of follow-up (hr, 1.25 [95% ci, 1.09–1.42]). risk was inversely associated with intakes of yogurt (hr, 0.93 [95% ci, 0.89–0.98] per 100-g/d increment), cheese (hr, 0.92 [95% ci, 0.86–0.98] per 30-g/d increment), and eggs (hr, 0.93 [95% ci, 0.88–0.99] per 20-g/d increment); the associations with yogurt and eggs were attenuated and nonsignificant after exclusion of the first 4 years of follow-up. risk was not significantly associated with intakes of poultry, fish, or milk. in analyses modeling dietary substitutions, replacement of 100 kcal/d from red and processed meat with 100 kcal/d from fatty fish, yogurt, cheese, or eggs was associated with ≈20% lower risk of ihd. consumption of red and processed meat was positively associated with serum non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and systolic blood pressure, and consumption of cheese was inversely associated with serum non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

conclusions:
risk for ihd was positively associated with consumption of red and processed meat and inversely associated with consumption of yogurt, cheese, and eggs, although the associations with yogurt and eggs may be influenced by reverse causation bias. it is not clear whether the associations with red and processed meat and cheese reflect causality, but they were consistent with the associations of these foods with plasma non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and for red and processed meat with systolic blood pressure, which could mediate such effects.


clinical perspective
what is new?
we followed up the health of 400 000 men and women in 9 european countries for 12 years to examine the relevance of intake of animal foods to the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease.

higher consumption of red and processed meat was positively associated with the risk for ischemic heart disease.

consumption of the other animal foods examined was not positively associated with risk; intakes of fatty fish, yogurt, cheese, and eggs were modestly inversely associated with risk.

what are the clinical implications?
higher intake of red and processed meat may increase the risk of ischemic heart disease.

substituting other foods for red and processed meat may reduce the risk of ischemic heart disease.

introduction
ischemic heart disease (ihd) is the commonest disease and cause of death in europe.1 the risk of ihd is affected by diet, but there is uncertainty about the relevance of intake of animal foods such as red and processed meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, and eggs. meat and dairy products are major dietary sources of saturated fatty acids; in the united kingdom, for example, meat and meat products contribute 24% of saturated fat intake in adults, and milk and milk products contribute 22%.2 controlled feeding trials have shown that high intakes of saturated fatty acids raise circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, an established risk factor for ihd, suggesting that higher intakes of foods rich in saturated fatty acids may increase the risk of ihd.3,4 meta-analyses of previous prospective studies of meat and the incidence of fatal ihd have suggested that intake of processed meat may be associated with higher risk, whereas intake of unprocessed red meat might not.5,6 for dairy products and eggs, systematic reviews of prospective studies have reported no consistent evidence that higher intakes are associated with a higher risk of ihd.7,8 consumption of fatty fish might reduce the risk of ihd because it is a rich source of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, and a meta-analysis has suggested an inverse association between overall fish consumption and mortality from ihd.9

here, we report the relationships of these foods with the risk of ihd in epic (european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition), a cohort of half a million men and women.10,11 to assess whether associations might be the result of reverse causation, we examined the results after excluding the first 4 years of follow-up. to assess whether associations might be explained by known metabolic risk factors for ihd, we examined the cross-sectional associations of food intake with cholesterol fractions and blood pressure in a subsample of participants, interpreting the relationships of foods with risk with respect to their associations with non–high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol and systolic blood pressure.

study population
epic is a prospective study of ≈520 000 men and women recruited through 23 centers in 10 european countries, mostly between 1992 and 2000.10,11 participants in epic completed dietary and lifestyle questionnaires, and the majority also provided blood samples and had their blood pressure measured. the baseline data were centralized at the world health organization’s international agency for research on cancer in lyon, france. all participants gave written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the ethics review boards of the international agency for research on cancer and the institutions where participants were recruited.10

dietary intake during the year before enrollment was measured by country-specific diet assessment methods, in most centers food frequency questionnaires; these were validated with a standardized, coordinated approach.10 dietary intakes estimated with a standardized and computerized 24-hour recall method were also collected from an 8% random sample across all centers ≈1.4 years after recruitment. the sample was stratified by age and sex, with weighting according to predicted disease rates in these strata, and distributed equally by season and day of the week.12 details of the categorization of foods are given in the online-only data supplement.

assessments of the nondietary variables were based on responses in the baseline questionnaires and categorized into the following groups: smoking (never, former, current <10 or unknown number of cigarettes per day, current 10–19 cigarettes per day, current ≥20 cigarettes per day, or unknown [2.4% of the cohort]); alcohol intake (not current drinker, sex-specific fifths of current intake: cut points in men were 3.5, 9.7, 18.8, and 36.2 g/d; cut points in women were 0.9, 2.8, 6.9, and 13.9 g/d); physical activity (cambridge physical activity index, based on occupational physical activity and cycling/other physical exercise and categorized in approximate quartiles called inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, active, and unknown [2.2%])13; highest education level obtained (none or primary school only, secondary school, vocational qualification or university degree, unknown [4.3%]); employment status (currently employed or student, neither, unknown [11.4%]); and history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (each self-reported: yes, no, unknown [4.2%, 5.5%, and 23.7%, respectively]). body mass index (bmi; <22.5, 22.5–24.9, 25.0–27.4, 27.5–29.9, ≥30.0 kg/m2, and unknown [0.9%]) was calculated from measured height and weight (except for participants in norway and some participants in france and the united kingdom, for whom height and weight were self-reported). baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured in millimeters of mercury by trained personnel (further details are given in the online-only data supplement).14

lipids were measured in stored plasma samples as part of the epic-cvd (cardiovascular disease) case-cohort study, which is nested within epic.11 the subcohort was randomly selected from participants with a stored blood sample, with selection stratified by the 23 epic recruitment centers. details of methods are given in the online-only data supplement.

ascertainment and verification of cases of ihd
the outcome was ihd, defined as the composite of first nonfatal myocardial infarction (mi; international classification of diseases, 10th revision code i21) or death resulting from ihd (international classification of diseases, 10th revision codes i20–i25). incident nonfatal mis were ascertained in each epic center with a combination of record linkage to morbidity or hospital registries and self-reports followed by confirmation with medical records.11 information on vital status was collected from mortality registries at the regional or national level in most centers except in greece, where vital status was ascertained by active follow-up of study participants and next of kin. centers in denmark, greece, italy, norway, and spain validated all suspected cases of mi, whereas centers in france, the netherlands, sweden, and the united kingdom validated a subset of the suspected cases to assess the accuracy of the overall ascertainment process. a range of methods was used to confirm the diagnosis of ihd and included retrieving and assessing medical records or hospital discharge notes, contact with medical professionals, retrieval and assessment of death certificates, or verbal autopsy with the next of kin. the last year of follow-up varied across centers between 2003 and 2010 but was mainly 2008 or 2009.

statistical analysis
of the 518 502 participants for whom data were available, those with no dietary data, no nondietary (lifestyle) data, and those in the top or bottom 1% of the ratio of energy intake to energy requirement were excluded (n=16 837), as were those who had a self-reported or unknown history of mi or stroke at baseline (n=11 308), 23 cases whose date of diagnosis was after the end of follow-up for each center, and 23 participants with no follow-up data. these exclusions left a total of 490 311 participants, and further restricting the data set to epic centers with known values for all of the animal foods (which meant excluding heidelberg, potsdam, naples, and umeå) left a total of 409 885 participants, including 7198 incident cases of nonfatal mi (n=5392) or fatal ihd (n=1806).

follow-up was measured from recruitment until the date of first nonfatal mi or fatal ihd event or censoring at the date of death from other causes, nonfatal non-mi ihd, the date at which follow-up for ihd events was considered complete, or emigration or other loss to follow-up (1.3%). relative risks as hazard ratios (hrs) and their 95% 95% cis were estimated with cox regression models. all analyses were stratified by sex and epic center and adjusted for exact age at recruitment (continuous); smoking; self-reported history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia; physical activity; employment status; level of education; bmi (these last 8 covariates were all categorical variables, with unknown categories added); current alcohol consumption (categorical); and intakes of energy, fruit and vegetables, dietary fiber from cereals, and percent energy from sugars (each continuous). in the main analyses of calibrated food intakes, the results for each animal source food were also adjusted simultaneously for the other animal source foods.

participants were divided into fifths of self-reported intake for each animal food according to the recruitment questionnaire (for any foods with >20% zero values, the categories were approximate fifths), with the quintiles calculated for all included participants, and a trend test was performed by scoring the categorical fifths of intake 1 to 5 and treating this as a continuous variable. to test for whether the data were compatible with a linear trend, we also fitted models with the fifths of intake treated as a categorical variable. there were no significant improvements in fit when we compared the categorical intake model with the continuous (trend test) intake model, suggesting that any associations between food intake and risk were approximately linear. then, to improve the comparability of dietary data across participating centers and to correct for measurement error in relative risk estimates, the dietary data from the subset of participants with 24-hour recalls were used to provide statistically calibrated estimates of dietary intakes for all included participants. hrs were calculated for increments in observed and calibrated intake of each food. observed food intakes were calibrated with a fixed-effect linear model in which center- and sex-specific 24-hour recall data from an 8% random sample of the cohort were regressed on the observed intakes, generating a calibrated intake corresponding to each observed intake.12,15 the sizes of the increments were chosen to approximate the difference in mean 24-hour recall intake between participants in the lowest and highest fifths of observed intake and with reference to the increments used in previous publications such the world health organization’s review of the carcinogenicity of red and processed meat.16

using the results from the mutually adjusted risks model, we estimated the effects of substituting 100 kcal/d of each other animal food for 100 kcal/d of red and processed meat from the ratios of the risk (as measured by the hr) for each food in turn and the risk for red and processed meat.17 for example, if p and r represent the hrs per 100 kcal/d yogurt and per 100 kcal/d red and processed meat in the mutually adjusted risks model, the effect of substituting 100 kcal/d yogurt for 100 kcal/d red and processed meat is estimated by the ratio p/r; the difference in covariance was used to estimate the 95% ci.

to examine whether the overall results might be influenced by reverse causality, we repeated the analyses after excluding the first 4 years of follow-up (ie, with follow-up for all participants beginning 4 years after the date of recruitment). to examine whether associations between the animal foods and ihd risk were consistent across subgroups of other risk factors, we also conducted separate analyses for subsets of sex, smoking status (never, former, and current), prior disease status (participants with or without a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia), age at recruitment (<55, 55–64, ≥65 years), bmi (<25.0, 25.0–29.9, ≥30.0 kg/m2), european region (northern europe: denmark, norway, and sweden; central europe: france excepting provence and southwest france, the netherlands, and the united kingdom; southern europe: greece, italy, spain, provence, and southwest france), and countries with partial (france, netherlands, sweden, and the united kingdom) or complete (denmark, greece, italy, norway, and spain) validation of cases. tests for heterogeneity of trend between subgroups were obtained by comparing the risk coefficients for each subgroup using inverse variance weighting, testing for statistical significance with a χ2 test on k−1 df, where k is the number of subgroups.

to examine whether dietary risk factors might act through major established physiological ihd risk factors, we examined the associations of food intakes with non-hdl cholesterol and systolic blood pressure, calculating mean levels of these biomarkers in each category of animal food intake (using linear regression to estimate least-squares means), with adjustment for age, sex, and epic center.

all analyses were performed with stata version 15.1 (stata corp, college station, tx), and a value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
after a mean follow-up of 12.6 years, there were 7198 incident cases of mi or death resulting from ihd. table 1 shows participant characteristics by sex for all cohort participants and for incident cases. on average, cases were 6 to 10 years older than average for the cohort, with higher mean bmi and lower mean alcohol intake. cases were more likely to smoke; to be inactive, unemployed, and diabetic; and to have elevated blood pressure or proatherogenic lipids, lower mean observed intakes of fruit and vegetables; there were moderate differences in intakes of animal foods.

subgroup analyses
in analyses subdivided by history of diabetes mellitus, previous hypertension, or hyperlipidemia, there was no appreciable heterogeneity in the associations of animal foods with ihd risk except for white fish, but this was not significantly associated with risk in either subgroup (see methods and table ii in the online-only data supplement). in analyses subdivided by smoking status, there was no appreciable heterogeneity in the associations of animal foods with ihd risk except for yogurt, which was inversely associated with risk in current smokers but not in never smokers or former smokers (table iii in the online-only data supplement). in analyses subdivided by age, there was no appreciable heterogeneity in the associations of animal foods with ihd risk except for red and processed meat, which was strongly positively associated with risk in participants recruited at <55 years of age but not in older people (table iv in the online-only data supplement). in analyses subdivided by sex, there was no appreciable heterogeneity in the associations of animal foods with ihd risk except for eggs, which were inversely associated with risk in men but not in women (table v in the online-only data supplement). there was no appreciable heterogeneity in the associations of animal foods with ihd risk subdivided by bmi or by european region (tables vi and vii in the online-only data supplement). there was evidence of heterogeneity by the extent of validation of cases in the associations of dietary intake with ihd risk for red and processed meat and for milk (table viii in the online-only data supplement); for red and processed meat, there was a large and highly significant association with risk in the countries with complete case verification but not in the other countries. for milk, there was a small positive association with risk in the countries with complete verification but not in the other countries.

associations of foods with plasma lipids and blood pressure
in a comparison of the participants in the highest fifth of intake of red and processed meat with those in the lowest fifth of such intake, non-hdl cholesterol was higher by 0.19 mmol/l (4.3%), and systolic blood pressure was higher by 3.3 mm hg (2.5%). for processed meat, the difference in systolic blood pressure between these groups of participants was 3.7 mm hg (2.8%). comparing participants in the highest fifth of intake of cheese with those in the lowest fifth of such intake showed that non-hdl cholesterol was lower by 0.10 mmol/l, whereas the intake of cheese was unrelated to systolic blood pressure (see tables ix and x in the online-only data supplement).

discussion
in this large european cohort, we observed a positive association between red and processed meat intake and risk of ihd, with a 19% (95% ci, 6–33) higher risk per 100-g/d increment in calibrated intake. red and processed meat showed separate (albeit borderline significant) associations with risk, which were each of similar magnitude. the association of risk with red and processed meat was observed after exclusion of the first 4 years of follow-up and in participants without diabetes mellitus, elevated blood pressure, or proatherogenic lipids. these additional results therefore reduce the likelihood of reverse causation or residual confounding. in comparison, a previous meta-analysis of meat intake and risk of ihd reported that unprocessed red meat consumption was not associated with risk of ihd, whereas processed meat was, with a 42% higher risk per 50-g/d increment in intake.5 however, that previous review included only 769 events from 4 studies for unprocessed red meat, including 1 case-control study; for processed meat, it included 21 308 events from 5 studies, but most cases derived from 1 study for which the end point was total cardiovascular mortality rather than incident mi and fatal ihd. a subsequent meta-analysis also concluded that processed meat but not unprocessed red meat was associated with ihd mortality, on the basis of up to 1370 deaths resulting from ihd.6 hence, further work is needed to understand potential reasons for the differences in the results of the current study, which were based on >7000 ihd events.

we observed no clear association of ihd risk with consumption of either white fish or fatty fish (although there were a borderline significant inverse association for fatty fish and a significant inverse association for fatty fish in the substitution analyses; see below). the possible protective role of fish in ihd has been investigated for >30 years. a previous analysis of fish consumption and mortality in epic found no evidence that higher intakes of total, white, or fatty fish were associated with mortality from ihd.18 in contrast, a meta-analysis of 4472 deaths in 17 cohort studies suggested that there was an overall significant inverse association between fish intake and ihd mortality, but the association was not linear, and the relative risk in the highest category of fish intake was not significantly lower than that in the lowest intake.9

dairy products are a major source of dietary saturated fatty acids, but prospective observational studies have generally not shown a higher risk of ihd with a higher intake of foods such as milk, yogurt, and cheese.19,20 we observed no association of milk with risk of ihd, which is consistent with a meta-analysis of 4391 incident ihd cases in 6 prospective studies.21 we observed that yogurt consumption was inversely associated with risk of ihd. however, this association did not persist after exclusion of the initial 4 years of follow-up, and it showed heterogeneity by smoking status, with no association in never smokers (suggesting therefore that the observed association may partly be explained by changes in diet resulting from preclinical disease or residual confounding by smoking). yogurt consumption is associated with healthy dietary patterns, behaviors, and lifestyle factors,22 yet a meta-analysis of 5 prospective studies (number of cases unclear) reported no association between yogurt consumption and risk of ihd.23 we also observed that cheese consumption was inversely associated with risk of ihd; again, this inverse association was not significant after we excluded the first 5 years of follow-up, although the estimate was only slightly attenuated. a meta-analysis of 8 prospective studies with 7425 incident cases showed a lower risk for ihd in participants with a relatively high intake of cheese.24 it has been suggested that cheese has constituents that might act to reduce the risk of ihd, for example, that the calcium in cheese forms insoluble soaps with fatty acids, thus reducing absorption of saturated fatty acids, and that the calcium also binds to bile acids, reducing their enterohepatic circulation and possibly leading to a cholesterol-lowering effect.19,25

egg consumption was inversely associated with ihd risk overall, but this association was no longer evident after exclusion of the first 4 years of follow-up, perhaps because of limited power or because people with preclinical disease may have reduced their egg consumption. a recent meta-analysis of 6 prospective studies including 5847 incident cases reported no association of egg consumption with risk of coronary heart disease,8 whereas a recent large prospective study in china including 31 169 incident cases of ihd reported that egg intake was inversely associated with risk26; it is possible that the risk associations found in the observational studies resulted from the dietary pattern often accompanying high egg intake or the cluster of other risk factors in people with high egg consumption.27

the positive association we observed between red and processed meat and risk of ihd might be related to the saturated fat content of these foods. however, although dairy products are also relatively rich in saturated fats, intake of dairy products was not positively related to ihd risk in this study; in fact there was a suggestion of an inverse association between cheese intake and future risk of ihd. this finding might suggest that different food sources of saturated fat and different proportions of individual saturated fatty acids contained within meat and dairy foods may differ in their impact on risk of ihd, which would affect the interpretation of previous studies of total dietary saturated fatty acids and risk.28 it is also possible that plant sources of protein may be associated with a lower risk of ihd than animal foods,29 and this should be considered in future analyses.

substitution of other animal foods for red and processed meat
our analyses showed that red meat and processed meat were positively associated with risk for ihd, whereas the other animal foods were not associated or were inversely associated with risk. we therefore conducted analyses modeling isocaloric dietary substitutions, which showed that fatty fish, yogurt, cheese, and eggs were associated with significantly lower risks for ihd when substituted for red and processed meat (15%–24% lower risk per 100 kcal substituted per day). plant foods might also be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease than animal foods27 and may be considered in future analyses.

possible roles of plasma lipids and blood pressure
the positive associations of red and processed meat and the inverse association of cheese consumption with the risk of ihd might be explained by the associations of these foods with well-established risk factors for ihd such as cholesterol fractions and systolic blood pressure. compared with participants in the lowest fifth of intake of red and processed meat, those in the top fifth had a higher non-hdl cholesterol by 0.19 mmol/l and a higher systolic blood pressure by 3.3 mm hg; the difference in systolic blood pressure was larger for processed meat than for red meat (3.7 and 2.2 mm hg, respectively), consistent with previous observations and possibly caused by the high salt content of most processed meats.30

on the basis of results from the emerging risk factors collaboration and the prospective studies collaboration,31,32 these differences would be expected to be associated with higher ihd risks of 8% and 12%, respectively. such modeling suggests that the observed (uncalibrated) 13% higher risk in the top fifth of intake of red and processed meat could be readily explained by the differences in blood lipids and blood pressure. other mechanisms might also be involved; for example, higher intakes of red and processed meat might increase the risk of ihd through the conversion of carnitine in meat into trimethylamine oxide.33 compared with participants in the lowest fifth of intake of cheese, those in the top fifth had lower non-hdl cholesterol by 0.10 mmol/l but no significant difference in systolic blood pressure. again on the basis of results from the prospective studies collaboration, this difference in lipids would be expected to be associated with a 4% lower ihd risk, indicating that the observed 12% lower ihd risk in the top fifth of intake of cheese might only partly be explained by standard lipid fractions.

strengths and limitations
strengths of this study are the large number of cases, the prospective design, the wide range of diets across europe, the calibration of the dietary data with 24-hour recalls, and the ability to adjust for major risk factors for ihd and to estimate the impacts of associations with circulating lipids and blood pressure.

as with all observational studies, a potential limitation is that the associations may be influenced by confounding by other risk factors. we have adjusted our results for major risk factors for ihd, including smoking and bmi, as well as socioeconomic factors. however, because the magnitudes of the associations we observed were relatively modest, we cannot discount that the results have been influenced by residual confounding by adiposity, socioeconomic factors, or other unmeasured factors. another potential limitation is that, because of the multicenter design of the cohort, there were some variations in the ascertainment and validation of the end point; the positive association of red and processed meat with risk for ihd was strong in the countries with complete validation of cases. it is also possible that associations of specific foods with risk may vary between populations as a result of differences in associations with other aspects of diet.

conclusions
this large prospective study in europe shows a moderate positive association between consumption of red and processed meat and risk of ihd, and it suggests a modest inverse association between consumption of cheese and ihd risk. it is not clear whether these associations reflect causality, but they were consistent with the associations of these foods with plasma non-hdl cholesterol and for red and processed meat with systolic blood pressure, which could mediate such effects.

association between physical activity and body fat percentage, with adjustment for bmi: a large cross-sectional analysis of uk biobank 
author affiliations
abstract
objectives the objective of this study was to examine if, in the general population, physically active adults have less body fat after taking body mass index (bmi) into account.

participants 119 230 men and 140 578 women aged 40–69 years, with complete physical activity information, and without a self-reported long-term illness, disability or infirmity.

exposures physical activity measured as excess metabolic equivalent (met)-hours per week, estimated from a combination of walking, and moderate and vigorous physical activity. bmi from measured height and weight.

main outcome measure body fat percentage estimated from bioimpedance.

results bmi and body fat percentage were highly correlated (r=0.85 in women; r=0.79 in men), and both were inversely associated with physical activity. compared with <5 excess met-hours/week at baseline, ≥100 excess met-hours/week were associated with a 1.1 kg/m2 lower bmi (27.1 vs 28.2 kg/m2) and 2.8 percentage points lower body fat (23.4% vs 26.3%) in men, and 2.2 kg/m2 lower bmi (25.6 vs 27.7 kg/m2) and 4.0 percentage points lower body fat (33.9% vs 37.9%) in women. for a given bmi, greater physical activity was associated with lower average body fat percentage (for a bmi of 22.5–24.99 kg/m2: 2.0 (95% ci 1.8 to 2.2), percentage points lower body fat in men and 1.8 (95% ci 1.6 to 2.0) percentage points lower body fat in women, comparing ≥100 excess met-hours per week with <5 excess met-hours/week).

conclusions in this sample of middle-aged adults, drawn from the general population, physical activity was inversely associated with bmi and body fat percentage. for people with the same bmi, those who were more active had a lower body fat percentage.

introduction
body mass index (bmi) is a simple index calculated from height and weight, and is usually used as a proxy for body fatness in large epidemiological studies. correlations between bmi and more direct measures of body fatness are generally strong (r>0.70).1–4

observational studies have shown that people who do comparatively more physical activity have a lower bmi than less active people.5 ,6 few large epidemiological studies have directly estimated body fatness, and it is of interest to examine whether more comprehensive measures of body fatness provide additional information above and beyond that which is captured by bmi. previous studies, each of ∼500 young adults, have found that, for a given bmi, athletes have a lower body fat percentage than non-athletes;7 ,8 however, it is unclear whether in the general population of middle-aged adults, those who do more physical activity have a lower body fat percentage than those who do minimal physical activity, after taking into account bmi.

uk biobank is a population-based cohort of 500 000 uk men and women, aged 40–69 years at recruitment. bmi and body fat percentage were measured at recruitment for virtually all participants. for this analysis of data from uk biobank, we aimed first to describe the associations of physical activity with bmi and body fat percentage, and second to determine whether physical activity is associated with body fat percentage, independently of bmi.

methods
subjects
uk biobank is a prospective cohort of ∼500 000 people aged 40–69 years, recruited in 2006–2010 in the uk.9 people aged 40–69 years who lived within reasonable travelling distance of 22 assessment centres were identified from national health service patient registers and invited to participate in uk biobank by attending an assessment centre. permission for access to patient records for recruitment was approved by the national information governance board for health and social care in england and wales, and the community health index advisory group in scotland. a subsample of ∼20 000 participants completed a full repeat of the assessment centre visit between august 2012 and june 2013, ∼5 years after recruitment.10 the uk biobank protocol is available online (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/uk-biobank-protocol.pdf). the touchscreen questionnaire and other resources are also available on the uk biobank website (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/resources/).

anthropometric measurements
at the uk biobank assessment centres, a touchscreen questionnaire was used to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics and lifestyle exposures. socks and shoes were removed and height was measured using the seca 202 height measure (seca, hamburg, germany). weight and estimated percentage fat were measured with the tanita bc418ma bioimpedance device (tanita, tokyo, japan). participants were not asked to fast, nor were they given any specific instructions pertaining to the bioimpedance measures prior to attending the assessment centre. water was available at all times throughout the visit and visits occurred throughout the day (8am–8pm).

physical activity assessment
questions on the touchscreen about walking, moderate physical activity and vigorous physical activity, which were similar to those used in the short form of the international physical activity questionnaire,11 were used to estimate excess metabolic equivalent (met)-hours/week of physical activity during work and leisure time. for each of the three activity categories (walking, moderate physical activity and vigorous physical activity), participants were asked how many days in a typical week they did each of the activities for 10 min or more (for walking: touchscreen question number wp1, uk biobank variable n_864_0_0; for moderate physical activity: touchscreen question number wp2, uk biobank variable n_884_0_0; and for vigorous physical activity: touchscreen question number wp3, uk biobank variable n_904_0_0). for each category, participants who entered one or more days were then asked how many minutes they spent doing those activities on a typical day (for walking: wp1a, n_874_0_0; for moderate physical activity: wp2a, n_894_0_0; and for vigorous physical activity: wp3a, n_914_0_0). for each activity category, the number of reported days was multiplied by the number of reported minutes on a typical day to generate duration of activity in minutes per week.

activity on a typical day of <10 min was recoded to 0 for any of the three categories of activity. for each of the three categories of activity, values of >1260 min per week (equivalent to an average of 3 hours per day) were truncated at 1260.11

total met values for each category from the international physical activity questionnaire short form were: 3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity.11 we report excess mets, which are calculated by subtracting one met from the value for each activity, and represent the energy expenditure above that of an inactive person.12 excess met values were therefore 2.3 for walking, 3.0 for moderate physical activity and 7.0 for vigorous physical activity. excess met-hours per week were calculated by multiplying the excess met value for each activity by the duration of activity in hours per week.11

exclusions
the uk biobank data set used for this analysis included 502 640 participants. participants were excluded from this analysis if they selected ‘prefer not to answer’ or ‘do not know’ to any of the possible six questions on physical activity (wp1, wp1a, wp2, wp2a, wp3 and wp3a) (n=66 625). participants were also excluded from this analysis if they responded to the question: ‘do you have a long-term illness, disability or infirmity?’ with ‘yes’ (n=159 941), ‘prefer not to answer’ (n=1052) or ‘do not know’ (n=11 391), or if they had a missing value for this variable (n=919) (touchscreen question number h4, uk biobank variable n_2188_0_0). in addition, the questions used in the pilot study on the duration of physical activity differed from those in the main study, and participants who answered the pilot version of these questions were excluded (n=2253). based on the international physical activity questionnaire recommendations for data cleaning and processing,11 participants were also excluded from the analysis if the sum of walking, moderate physical activity and vigorous physical activity was >112 hours per week (n=651), leaving a total of 259 808 participants in the present study.

statistics
stata v.14.0 (statacorp lp, college station, texas, usa) was used for all statistical analyses. all analyses were done for men and women separately. participant characteristics were described by level of physical activity (low, <10.0; moderate, 10.0–49.9 and high, ≥50 excess met-hours/week). pearson's correlation coefficients between bmi and body fat percentage were calculated; values of 0.80 or above are considered very strong, values between 0.60–0.79 strong, 0.40–0.59 moderate, 0.20–0.39 weak and 0.00–0.19 very weak.13 multiple linear regression was used to calculate the mean body fat percentage in single units of bmi (eg, 17.00–17.99, 18.00–18.99, 19.00–19.99 kg/m2, etc), adjusted for age (5-year categories: <45, 45–49.99, 50–54.99, 55–59.99, 60–64.99 and ≥65.00 years). groups with 200 or more participants are shown in the figure. multiple linear regression was also used to calculate mean bmi and body fat percentage in categories of excess met-hours per week (<5, 5–9.9, 10–14.9, 15–24.9, 25–34.9, 35–49.9, 50–74.9, 75–99.9 and ≥100 excess met-hours per week), adjusted for age (5-year categories, as above). for the final analysis, we used multiple linear regression to examine the association between physical activity (in excess met-hours per week: <5, 5–9.9, 10–14.9, 15–24.9, 25–34.9, 35–49.9, 50–74.9, 75–99.9 and ≥100) and body fat percentage (continuous variable). bmi (in 2.5 unit categories, eg, <18.50, 18.50–19.99, 20.00–22.49, 22.50–24.99, 25.00–27.49…,42.50–44.99, ≥45.00 kg/m2, etc) and age (5-year categories) were included as covariates. we included a product term of excess met-hours per week (categories, as above) and bmi (in 2.5 unit categories as above) in the model to calculate mean body fat percentage in categories of physical activity within strata of bmi. in additional sensitivity analyses, we adjusted for reported intakes of fruits and vegetables (< 3.00 servings/week, 3.00–3.99, 4.00–4.99, 5.00–5.99, ≥ 6.00 servings/week, unknown), and red and processed meat (<2.00 servings/week, 2.00–2.99, 3.00–3.99, 4.00–4.99, ≥5.00 servings/week, unknown). we also restricted the analysis to those with a university or college degree, and separately, to those who do not have a job that usually or always involves standing or walking or manual work.

we also examined mean bmi and body fat percentage in 5 year age categories. for each age decade separately (ie, participants <50 years, 50–59 years and ≥60 years) linear regression was used to calculate mean body fat percentage in single units of bmi, and to calculate mean bmi and body fat percentage in each category of physical activity (<5, 5–9.9, 10–14.9, 15–24.9, 25–34.9, 35–49.9, 50–74.9, 75–99.9 and ≥100 excess met-hours per week).

to explore the repeatability of self-reported physical activity, including effects of measurement error and possible changes in activity over time, we used a subsample of 10 225 uk biobank participants who were eligible for the current study and who completed a repeat assessment visit ∼5 years after recruitment (see online supplementary tables s1 and s2). for these participants, we calculated excess met-hours per week from their answers to the touchscreen questionnaire completed at the repeat assessment centre visit, as described above. then for each category of excess met-hours per week defined at baseline, we calculated the mean excess met-hours per week at their baseline visit (to assess comparability of the subsample with the full cohort) and the mean excess met-hours per week at the repeat visit (to assess measurement error in reporting physical activity and change over time). the subsample of participants who completed a repeat assessment centre visit ∼5 years after recruitment was similar at baseline to the full cohort with regard to reported physical activity. however, at the repeat assessment, for participants in the highest category of physical activity defined at baseline (≥100 excess met-hours per week), the mean excess met-hours/week was much lower than at baseline (80 compared with 130 for men and women). for the lowest category of physical activity defined at baseline, the mean excess met-hours/week was somewhat higher at the repeat assessment than at baseline (12 compared with 2.6 for men and women). overall, this represents regression to the mean of almost 50% (calculated from the ratio of the range of mean values at the repeat assessment to the range of mean values at baseline). the pearson's correlation coefficients between recruitment and repeat measurements of bmi and body fat percentage in the subsample of participants who completed a repeat assessment centre visit were 0.92 for both bmi and body fat percentage.

supplementary data
all p values were two sided and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
participant flow is shown in figure 1. participants who had a high level of physical activity were older, had a lower bmi, a lower body fat percentage and a higher intake of fruit and vegetables than participants with a low level of physical activity (table 1 and table 2). they were also less likely to have a college or university degree, and much more likely to have a standing or manual job than those with a moderate or low level of physical activity. participants with a moderate activity level were the least likely to be current smokers.

body fat percentage was positively related to bmi (figure 2). the correlation between bmi and body fat percentage was very strong in women (r=0.85), and strong in men (r=0.79). at the same bmi, women had a much higher body fat percentage than men; for example, women with a bmi of 30.00–30.99 kg/m2 had on average 41% body fat, whereas men with the same bmi had on average 28% body fat.

body fat percentage and bmi were inversely related to physical activity (figure 3). men who did <5 excess met-hours of physical activity per week had, on average, a bmi of 28.2 kg/m2 (95% ci 28.2 to 28.3 kg/m2) and 26.3% (95% ci 26.2 to 26.4%) body fat. men who did ≥100 excess met-hours per week of physical activity per week had, on average, a bmi of 27.1 kg/m2 (95% ci: 27.0 to 27.2 kg/m2) and 23.4% (95% ci 23.3 to 23.5%) body fat. women who did <5 excess met-hours per week of physical activity per week had, on average, a bmi of 27.7 kg/m2 (95% ci 27.7 to 27.8 kg/m2) and 37.9% (95% ci 37.8 to 38.0%) body fat. women who did ≥100 excess met-hours/week of physical activity per week had, on average, a bmi of 25.6 kg/m2 (95% ci 25.5 to 25.7 kg/m2) and a 33.9% (95% ci 33.7 to 34.0%) body fat. for men and women, as shown by the r2 values, age and physical activity explained more of the variation in body fat percentage than they did the variation in bmi in this study population; however, age and physical activity only explained a small proportion of the variation in bmi and body fat percentage in this study population, with all r2 values <0.06 (figure 3).

overall, in men, those doing ≥100 or more excess met-hours/week compared with <5 excess met-hours/week had a 1.7 (95% ci 1.6 to 1.7) percentage points lower body fat percentage, on average, after adjustment for bmi and age; in women it was on average 1.5 (95% ci 1.4 to 1.6) percentage points lower. for men and women, within each stratum of bmi, a higher physical activity level was associated with a lower body fat percentage, and the difference in body fat percentage between physical activity categories appeared to be slightly larger at lower bmis (p for interaction using likelihood ratio test <0.001, for both sexes) (figure 4, see online supplementary tables s3 and s4). for a bmi of 22.5–24.99 kg/m2, ≥100 excess met-hours per week versus <5 excess met-hours per week was associated with 2.0 (95% ci 1.8 to 2.2) percentage points lower body fat in men and 1.9 (95% ci 1.6 to 2.0) percentage points lower body fat in women. for men and women, within each stratum of bmi, the mean bmi was very similar across the categories of physical activity.

when we further adjusted for reported intakes of fruit and vegetables, and red and processed meats, or restricted the analysis to those who did not have an active job or those who had a university or college degree, the results were not materially altered. comparing those doing ≥100 excess met-hours per week with those doing < 5 excess met-hours per week, body fat percentage was, on average 1.6 (95% ci 1.5 to 1.7) percentage points lower for men and 1.4 (95% ci 1.3 to 1.5) percentage points lower for women after adjustment for diet quality; 1.7 (95% ci 1.6 to 1.9) percentage points lower for men and 1.6 (95% ci 1.4 to 1.8) percentage points lower for women when restricting analyses to those who had a university or college degree; and 1.6 (95% ci 1.5 to 1.7) percentage points lower for men and 1.4 (95% ci 1.3 to 1.5) percentage points lower for women when we restricted analyses to those who did not have a standing or manual job.

in men, the mean bmi was similar across 5-year age categories; however, the mean body fat percentage was higher in older age groups. in women, the mean bmi by 5-year age categories was slightly higher in older age groups, and the mean body fat percentage was also higher in older age groups (see online supplementary table s5). the association between bmi and body fat percentage was similar in each age decade (see online supplementary figures s1, s2 and s3). the differences in bmi between the extreme categories of physical activity were slightly larger and the differences in body fat percentage were slightly smaller with older age (see online supplementary figures s4, s5 and s6).

discussion
in this large sample of middle-aged british men and women, more physical activity was associated with a lower bmi and a lower body fat percentage, although even men and women who did the most physical activity were, on average, overweight. more physical activity was also associated with a lower body fat percentage within each category of bmi, with an average 1–2 percentage points lower body fat in the most active, compared with the least active individuals. most of the difference in body fat percentage with physical activity was between the very low and moderately high levels of physical activity (<5 and 35–49.9 excess met-hours per week, respectively); there was relatively little difference in body fat percentage between moderately high and very high levels of physical activity (35–49.9 and ≥100 excess met-hours per week, respectively).

the current study is large, and height and weight were measured by trained staff using standardised techniques. we examined whether important lifestyle factors (diet quality, education and job type) which varied by physical activity level might modify the associations between physical activity, bmi and body fat percentage. in each of these sensitivity analyses, the results were essentially unchanged, although because this is an observational study we cannot rule out confounding by other factors. a limitation of the study is that physical activity was self-reported. analysis of the subsample who had a repeat measurement of physical activity ∼5 years after baseline indicates ∼50% regression to the mean, which represents the error in reporting physical activity and true changes in physical activity over time. the likely consequence of regression to the mean in physical activity levels over time is bias of associations towards the null, so that the true association between physical activity and body composition measures is likely to be stronger than that observed in this study. participants were not given any specific instructions prior to body fat measurement. hydration status, exercise and food consumption can have small effects on body fat values measured by bioimpedance; had these factors been standardised between participants, we may have seen slightly stronger associations between body fat percentage and physical activity. the study is cross-sectional, and therefore we can only show associations between reported physical activity and contemporaneous body composition. we cannot infer cause and effect: lower levels of physical activity may lead to greater adiposity, but it is also possible that increased adiposity leads to less physical activity.

previous small studies (n<200), in young athletic populations have found inverse relationships between measures of physical fitness and bmi and body fat percentage.14 ,15 small studies (n∼500) in young adults have also shown that, for a given bmi, athletes have a lower body fat percentage than non-athletes.7 ,8 these findings are, however, of limited relevance to older adults in the general population, who experience the highest burden of obesity-related disease. an analysis of 466 605 participants in the china kadoorie biobank, aged 30–79 years, found relatively weak associations between physical activity and either bmi or body fat percentage: a difference of ∼100 total met-hours per week was associated with 0.15 kg/m2 lower bmi, and 0.48 percentage points lower body fat.16 participants in the china kadoorie biobank differed from those in uk biobank in ethnicity and lifestyle, and also had a lower average bmi (23.4 (sd 3.2) kg/m2 in men; 23.8 (sd 3.4) kg/m2 in women). their physical activity levels were comparable with the middle to upper range of physical activity of uk biobank participants, and in this range we also saw only a small difference in body fat percentage.

variation in bmi in the general population is largely due to differences in body fatness, but by definition it incorporates adipose and lean body mass, and it is therefore difficult to disentangle the roles of adipose and lean mass in associations of bmi with health outcomes. for example, a higher bmi is an established risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer, and probably increases risk through higher circulating sex hormones produced by the enzyme aromatase in the adipose tissue from precursor androgens.17 several cohort studies have also shown that more physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, even after adjustment for bmi, and this finding is often taken as evidence that physical activity is independent of adiposity as a risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer.18 our results suggest, however, that adjustment for bmi may not have fully controlled for adiposity in these analyses.

in conclusion, in this sample of middle-aged british adults who were free from self-reported long-standing illness, men and women who reported doing the most physical activity had a lower bmi and a lower body fat percentage than those who reported doing the least physical activity. we also report new evidence that, for a given bmi, men and women who reported doing more physical activity had a lower body fat percentage; the greatest difference was observed between low and moderate levels of physical activity. bmi incorporates adipose and lean mass, but is most strongly related to adiposity, and consequently is associated with morbidity and mortality from a wide range of diseases. however, to disentangle the possible effects of physical activity and adiposity on disease risk, future research should focus on more specific measures of adiposity.

fluid intake and dietary factors and the risk of incident
kidney stones in uk biobank: a population-based prospective
keywords:

abstract
background: fluid intake and diet are thought to influence kidney stone risk. however,
prospective studies have been limited to small samples sizes and/or restricted measures.
objective: to investigate whether fluid intake and dietary factors are associated with the risk
of developing a first kidney stone.
design, setting, and participants: participants were selected from uk biobank, a populationbased prospective cohort study.
outcome measurements and statistical analysis: cox proportional hazards models were used
to investigate the association between fluid intake and dietary factors and the risk of a first
incident kidney stone, ascertained from hospital inpatient records.
results and limitations: after exclusion, 439 072 participants were available for the analysis,
of whom 2057 had hospital admission with an incident kidney stone over a mean of 6.1 yr of
follow-up. for every additional drink (200 ml) consumed per day of total fluid, the risk of
kidney stones declined by 13% (hazard ratio [hr] = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.85–
0.89). similar patterns of associations were observed for tea, coffee, and alcohol, although no
association was observed for water intake. fruit and fibre intake was also associated with a
lower risk (hr per 100 g increase of fruits per day = 0.88, 95% ci 0.83–0.93, and hr per 10 g fibre
per day = 0.82, 95% ci 0.77–0.87), whereas meat and salt intake was associated with a higher
risk (hr per 50 g increase in meat per week = 1.17, 95% ci 1.05–1.29, and hr for always vs never/
rarely added salt to food = 1.33, 95% ci 1.12–1.58). vegetable, fish, and cheese intake was not
associated with kidney stone risk.
conclusions: the finding that high intake of total fluid, fruit, and fibre was associated with a
lower risk of hospitalisation for a first kidney stone suggests that modifiable dietary factors
could be targeted to prevent kidney stone development.
patient summary: we found that higher intake of total fluid, specifically tea, coffee, and
alcohol (but not water), and consumption of fruit and foods high in fibre are linked with a
reduced likelihood of developing kidney stones.
1. introduction
kidney stones are a common cause of morbidity, with a
lifetime prevalence of 13% in england, with incidence rates
having increased substantially over the last few decades
worldwide [1–4]. taking into account diagnostic and treatment costs and the additional socioeconomic burden from
sickness leave, the fiscal impact of kidney stones on the
wider economy is considerable [5]. kidney stones also have
a high recurrence rate, with approximately half of patients
having a recurrent episode over 10 yr and up to 90% over
30 yr [6,7]. it is therefore important to identify modifiable
risk factors that can be targeted for the prevention of
developing kidney stones.
certain dietary factors are considered to be major contributors to the increasing incidence of kidney stones, specifically a diet low in fibre and high in animal protein, fat,
and sodium [8,9]. additionally, it has been suggested that
increasing fluid intake is an effective method to reduce the
risk of kidney stone formation [10,11]. however, whilst
there have been several prospective studies on diet and
fluid intake and the subsequent risk of developing kidney
stones, they have typically been small or focused on a
narrow range of dietary factors.
to address these limitations, we investigate the association between a wide range of dietary factors and fluid
intake, including specific types of beverages, and the risk
of developing incident kidney stones, as assessed through
hospital inpatient records, in a large uk-based prospective
cohort of half a million participants without prevalent
kidney stones.
2. patients and methods
2.1. population
participants were selected from uk biobank, a populationbased study designed to improve the prevention, treatment,
and diagnosis of a range of diseases and conditions
[12]. between 2006 and 2010, approximately 500
000 women and men aged between 40 and 69 yr attended
one of 22 baseline assessment centres located throughout
england, scotland, and wales. all participants provided
sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related information
collected through touchscreen questionnaires and verbal
interviews, as well as completed a range of physical measurements. electronic signed consent was obtained, which
included consent for on-going linkage to medical and
health-related records.
uk biobank received approval from the national information governance board for health and social care and the
national health service north west centre for research
ethics committee (ref: 11/nw/0382).
2.2. diagnosis of kidney stones
kidney stones were ascertained using hospital inpatient
records, which contain data on hospital admissions, operations, and procedures obtained for the entire cohort from
hospital episode statistics for england, scottish morbidity
record for scotland, and patient episode database for
wales. diagnoses were recorded using the international
classification of diseases (icd) coding system; operations
and procedures were recorded using the office of population censuses and surveys: classification of intervention
and procedures, version 4 (opcs-4) coding system. participants with a kidney stone or renal colic were identified
using icd-10 codes n20 and n23 (as either a primary or a
secondary diagnosis), and opcs-4 codes m09, m14, m26–
28, and m31 (as either a primary or a secondary operative
procedure). the codes are described in detail in supplementary table 1.
2.3. assessment of dietary factors and fluid intake
dietary and fluid intake was self-reported at baseline for all
500 000 participants using a short touchscreen food-frequency questionnaire (ffq), designed to capture “usual”
intake of common food and drink items, as well as to seek
information about common sources of various nutrients
[13]. daily intake of tea, coffee, water, fresh fruit, dried fruit,
cooked vegetables, and salad/raw vegetables, and weekly
intake of oily fish, nonoily fish, processed meat, poultry,
beef, lamb/mutton, pork, cheese, bread, and cereal were
collected. participants were also asked whether they added
salt to their food.
dietary data from the oxford webq, a more detailed
questionnaire than the ffq [14], available for 188 784 participants at either baseline or 2–3 yr after recruitment, was
used to account for regression dilution bias (ie, random
error in estimated intake introduced by fluctuations in
dietary intake over time and/or measurement error using
the ffq). for more detail on the derivation of dietary variables from the ffq and the oxford webq, see the supplementary material.
2.4. covariates
townsend deprivation score was used as an indicator of
socioeconomic status and was assigned to each participant
corresponding to the output area of their residential
postcode at recruitment. educational qualifications, ethnic
background, smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, and
calcium supplementation use were collected via the
touchscreen questionnaire at recruitment. body mass index
(bmi; kg/m2
) was derived from weight (kg) using scales and
standing height (metres) measured during the physical
examination at recruitment.
2.5. statistical analysis
of the 502 638 participants enrolled in uk biobank,
7112 participants with a prevalent kidney stone identified
via either self-report at recruitment and/or hospital inpatient records (ie, with a relevant diagnostic or operation
code before the date of recruitment) were excluded. in an
attempt to account for the possibility that pre-existing
conditions would confound any observed associations, a

further 56 454 participants who reported in the touchscreen questionnaire as making major changes to their diet
over the last 5 yr due to illness were also excluded. this
resulted in an analytical dataset of 439 072 participants (see
fig. 1 for a flowchart of the exclusion criteria).
person years were calculated from the date of recruitment (2006–2010) until the first incident diagnosis of
kidney stones, date of death, or last date of hospital
admission (31 march 2015), whichever came first. cox
proportional hazards models were used to assess the
association between dietary factors as measured using
the ffq at recruitment and subsequent risk of the first
kidney stone. as the analyses presented here generally
involve a comparison of risks across more than two
categories, the floating absolute risk method was used
to estimate the 95% confidence intervals (cis) [15]. tests
for linear trends across the baseline ffq categories of
intake were based on the mean intake derived from the
oxford webq. all models were assessed for the proportionality of hazards assumption using schoenfeld residuals. the main analyses were adjusted for age (in single
years), sex, townsend deprivation score (quintiles), education (no qualifications, cse/o-level/gcse or equivalent,
as/a-level or equivalent, higher education, or other professional qualification), ethnicity (white, mixed background, black, asian, or other), smoking (never, former,
and current), alcohol (never, special occasions only, one to
three times a month, once or twice a week, three or four
times a week, daily, or almost daily), bmi (<18.5, 18.5–
<25, 25–<30, 30–<35, 35–40, and 40 kg/m2
), and
use of calcium supplementation (no and yes). participants
with missing data or who responded “prefer not to
answer/do not know” for any of the covariates were
assigned to a separate category for that covariate. the
proportion of data that was assigned as missing or prefer
not to answer/do not know was <0.5% for each covariate,
with the exception of education (1.7%).
in secondary analyses, dietary factors significantly associated with the risk of kidney stones in the main analyses
were included as covariates in order to explore whether
mutual adjustment for dietary factors affected previously
observed associations. to account for reverse causation,
participants who were censored within the first 2 yr of
follow-up were excluded from the analyses.
all p values were two sided, with statistical significance
set at <0.05. analyses were performed using stata se version 13 (statcorp, college station, tx, usa) and figures were
produced using rstudio version 1.0.136 using the in-house
package “jasper”.

all fluids from the 24 h dietary questionnaire was 1503,
1729, 1942, 2160, and 2484 ml/d (supplementary table 5).
this suggests that despite total fluid, as assessed by the ffq,
being limited to tea, coffee, water, and alcohol intake, this is
nonetheless a reliable indicator of overall fluid intake.
higher total fluid intake was associated with a lower risk
of kidney stones following adjustment for multiple lifestyle
and socioeconomic factors (fig. 2). compared with those
who drank zero to six cups/glasses per day of total fluid, the
hazard ratios (hrs) were 0.72 (95% ci 0.66–0.79), 0.61 (95%
ci 0.55–0.67), 0.62 (95% ci 0.56–0.70), and 0.45 (95% ci
0.40–0.51) for those who drank seven to eight, nine to 10,
11–12, and 13 cups/glasses per day, respectively. this
corresponded to a 13% reduction in risk for each additional
drink per day (equivalent to 200 ml; hr = 0.87, 95% ci 0.85–
0.89).
for specific beverages, we found that higher consumption of tea (hr per 200 ml/d = 0.95, 95% ci 0.92–0.99), coffee
(hr per 200 ml/d = 0.92, 95% ci 0.88–0.95), and alcohol (hr
per 200 ml/d = 0.85, 95% ci 0.82–0.88) was individually
significantly associated with a reduced risk of incident
kidney stones, although no association was observed with
water intake (hr per 200 ml/d = 0.99, 95% ci 0.96–1.03;
fig. 3).
vegetable intake was not associated with incident kidney stones (hr per 100 g/d = 0.94, 95% ci 0.87–1.03), whilst
fruit intake (hr per 100 g/d = 0.88, 95% ci 0.83–0.93) and
fibre intake (hr per 10 g/d = 0.82, 95% ci 0.77–0.87) were
significantly associated with a reduced risk (fig. 4).
consumption of total fish (hr per 25 g/wk = 1.00, 95% ci
0.90–1.12), oily fish (hr per 10 g/wk = 0.97, 95% ci 0.91–
1.04), and nonoily fish (hr per 10 g/wk = 1.04, 95% ci 0.95–
1.13) was not associated with incident kidney stones (fig. 5).
however, total meat intake was associated with an
increased risk (hr per 50 g/wk = 1.17, 95% ci 1.05–1.29), with
qualitatively similar estimates of risk observed for processed meat (hr per 25 g/wk = 1.12, 95% ci 0.97–1.29), poultry (hr per 50 g/wk = 1.22, 95% ci 1.00–1.49), and red meat
(hr per 50 g/wk = 1.19, 95% ci 1.00–1.41), although these did
not reach statistical significance (fig. 5). adding salt to food
(not cooking) was also associated with an increased risk;
compared with those never/rarely added salt to food, those

area is inversely proportional to the variance of the logarithm of the relative risk, providing an indication of the amount of statistical information
available for that particular estimate. ci = confidence interval; hr =hazard ratio.

who always added salt to food had a 33% higher risk (hr =
1.33, 95% ci 1.12–1.58). no significant association was
observed with cheese intake (hr per 25 g/wk = 0.95, 95%
ci 0.82–1.10; fig. 6).
mutual adjustment for dietary factors that were significant in the abovementioned analyses did not make a material difference to the associations found (supplementary
table 6). the associations also remained similar when
excluding participants censored within the first 2 yr of
follow-up, with the exception of vegetable intake, which
was associated with a lower risk of kidney stones after
excluding those diagnosed within the first 2 yr (hr per
100 g/d = 0.89, 95% ci 0.80–0.99, based on 1359 cases; supplementary table 7).
4. discussion
in this uk population-based prospective cohort of over 439
000 middle-aged participants, total fluid intake and a range
of dietary factors were associated with the risk of developing a first incident kidney stone. these results provide
further evidence that diet is a potentially important modifiable factor for the prevention of kidney stone formation.
similar to meta-analyses of previous observational
studies, we found a linear dose-response reduction in
the risk of kidney stones with increasing amount of fluid
intake [10,11]. when compared with fluid intake of zero
to six glasses per day (approximately 1.2 l), individuals
who drank 13 glasses or more (equivalent to 2.3 l) had a
50% reduced risk of developing kidney stones. this level
of fluid intake is similar to that administered in trials,
which have found that increased fluid intake decreases
the recurrence of kidney stones [6]. international guidelines recommend that patients with kidney stones should
increase their fluid intake to achieve a urine volume of
2.5 l/d in order to reduce stone recurrence [16,17]. in our
study, the reduction in risk with total fluid intake was
primarily due to tea, coffee, and alcohol, which is consistent with the findings of a recent meta-analysis [10]. however, in contrast with the findings from the meta-analysis,
we found no association between water intake and kidney
stone risk, which suggests that specific beverages may
have differential effects on kidney stone formation, and
that beverages that exert a diuretic effect (thereby causing urine dilution) or that contain caffeine may be of
particular relevance.
with regard to other dietary factors, we found that
higher meat intake was associated with an increased risk
of kidney stones; however, previous prospective studies
that have focused mainly on animal protein intake have
produced inconsistent findings [9,18–20]. two randomised
controlled trials have shown no reduction in kidney stone

recurrence with a diet low in animal protein, although they
were small, consisting of 99 [21] and 175 [22] participants,
respectively. in contrast, another trial in 120 men found that
a diet low in both animal protein and salt reduced the risk of
recurrent kidney stones by 50% compared with a low-calcium diet [23]. we also found that higher salt intake was
associated with an increased risk of kidney stones, although
findings from other observational studies have been

inconsistent [20,21,27,28]. we also found that higher consumption of fruit and fibre was associated with a significant
risk reduction, as has been reported elsewhere in prospective studies [9,24] but notin the one small trialthat assessed
this in relation to recurrent kidney stones [22]. it is possible
that fruit might reduce the risk through increased urinary
citrate (even from noncitrus fruit) and/or its relatively high
fibre content [25].
strengths of the current study are the large sample size,
wide range of measures available on dietary factors and
possible confounders, and cohort-wide linkage to longitudinal data on hospital inpatient admissions. however, this
does mean that patients who seek treatment solely through
primary care or who do not seek any medical attention are
not captured. whilst this will lead to an underascertainment of cases, it is unlikely that the association with dietary
factors differ markedly between those cases seeking hospital treatment and those who do not.
the availability of detailed data on dietary intake from
multiple 24-h recall questionnaires (oxford webq) suggests
that total fluid intake corresponded well with categories as
defined by the baseline ffq, providing assurances that the
latter is a robust indicator of overall fluid intake. the use of
updated data from the oxford webq meant that we could
take into account random error caused by changes in diet
over time and/or measurement error of the ffq,
whilst the ffq used in uk biobank has been shown to be
a well-established and reliable tool [26], it does not enable
an accurate estimation of nutrient intake, and hence we
were unable to test the association specifically with intake
of dietary calcium or animal protein, nor could we take into
account other dietary factors that may be relevant for stone
disease (eg,types of soft drinks or juice) [27,28]. we also had
insufficient information to explore dietary patterns, and
hence were not able to investigate the hypothesis that a
dash- or mediterranean-style diet is associated with a
lower kidney stone risk [8,29,30].
as many patients diagnosed with a first kidney stone
may modify their diet (eg, by increasing fluid intake) based
on medical advice after their initial diagnosis, our intention
was not to assess the dietary determinants of kidney stone
recurrence, but rather the extent to which dietary factors
influence the risk of developing a first incident kidney
stone. however, in order to examine whether our findings
might have been caused by reverse causation, whereby
participants experiencing symptoms may have changed
their diet (eg, by drinking more fluids) prior to being
admitted to hospital with a kidney stone, we excluded a

priori participants who reported having changed their diet
in the last 5 yr due to illness. we also excluded participants
who were diagnosed within 2 yr of baseline and the results
were not materially altered.
there are some other limitations to this study. no information was available on stone composition (such as uric
acid, calcium oxalate), and hence it was not possible to
investigate whether dietary factors differentially affect the
development of stone subtypes. whilst we were able to take
into account a wide range of potential confounders that did
not make an appreciable difference to the risk estimates,
confounding by other factors remains a possibility and
causality cannot be inferred based on these findings.
5. conclusions
increased fluid intake, as well as consumption of fruit and
foods high in fibre, was associated with a lower risk of
developing a first kidney stone, whilst higher meat consumption and salt intake were associated with a higher risk.
the lower risk of kidney stones observed for tea, coffee, and
alcohol, but not water, might reflect a potential diuretic
effect and warrants further investigation. overall, this study
suggests that the risk of kidney stones could be decreased
through relatively simple dietary modifications.
