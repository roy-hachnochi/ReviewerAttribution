background
people with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk from cardiovascular disease. dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(pufas) are known to reduce triglyceride levels, but their impact on cholesterol levels, glycemic control and vascular outcomes are not
well known.
objectives
to determine the effects of omega-3 pufa supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes, cholesterol levels and glycemic control in
people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
search methods
we carried out a comprehensive search of the cochrane library,medline, embase, bibliographies of relevant papers and contacted
experts for identifying additional trials.
selection criteria
all randomised controlled trials were included where omega-3 pufa supplementation or dietary intake was randomly allocated and
unconfounded in people with type 2 diabetes. authors of large trials were contacted for missing information.
data collection and analysis
trialswere assessed for inclusion. authorswere contacted formissing information.datawas extracted and quality assessed independently
in duplicate. fixed-effect meta-analysis was carried out.
main results
twenty three randomised controlled trials (1075 participants) were included with a mean treatment duration of 8.9 weeks. the mean
dose of omega-3 pufa used in the trials was 3.5 g/d. no trials with vascular events or mortality endpoints were identified. among
those taking omega-3 pufa triglyceride levels were significantly lowered by 0.45 mmol/l (95% confidence interval (ci) -0.58 to -
0.32, p < 0.00001) and vldl cholesterol lowered by -0.07 mmol/l (95% ci -0.13 to 0.00, p = 0.04). ldl cholesterol levels were
raised by 0.11 mmol/l (95% ci 0.00 to 0.22, p = 0.05). no significant change in or total or hdl cholesterol, hba1c, fasting
glucose, fasting insulin or body weight was observed. the increase in vldl remained significant only in trials of longer duration and
in hypertriglyceridemic patients. the elevation in ldl cholesterol was non-significant in subgroup analyses. no adverse effects of the
intervention were reported.
authors’ conclusions
omega-3 pufa supplementation in type 2 diabetes lowers triglycerides and vldl cholesterol, butmay raise ldl cholesterol (although
results were non-significant in subgroups) and has no statistically significant effect on glycemic control or fasting insulin. trials with
vascular events or mortality defined endpoints are needed.

omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) for type 2 diabetes mellitus
people with type 2 diabetes are known to be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (such as heart attack or stroke). type 2 diabetes
mellitus is the fourth leading cause of death in developed countries with a two fold excess mortality and a two to four fold increased
risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. the typical dyslipidemia (abnormality in blood lipids) associated with type 2 diabetes is
a combination of hypertriglyceridemia (high levels of fats (triglycerides) in the blood), low levels of hdl (high density lipoprotein)
cholesterol and abnormal ldl (low density lipoprotein) composition. low levels ofhdl cholesterol and high levels of ldl cholesterol
are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, while the raised levels of triglycerides are less clearly linked to an increased
risk of cardiovascular disease. several pharmacologic approaches have been used to treat diabetic dyslipidemia and standard dietary
approaches focus on restriction of saturated fat and limitation of simple carbohydrate and alcohol intake. in the late 1980s, several
investigators reported on the use of dietary supplementation with fish oil as a means of treating diabetic dyslipidemia. dietary fats and
oils from different sources differ considerably in their fatty acid composition. animal fat is rich in saturated fatty acids, vegetable and
marine oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. most fish oils are of the so-called omega-3 variety (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (pufas)).
we identified 23 randomised trials (maximumduration of eightmonths) including 1075 people in which omega-3 pufa was compared
to a vegetable oil or placebo. none of the trials looked at cardiovascular endpoints in cardiovascular disease or death as an outcome
measure.
the review shows that although some types of fat in the blood are reduced through omega-3 supplementation, others including
ldl cholesterol (which may promote heart disease) were increased. control of blood sugar levels was not affected by the treatment.
there were no other adverse effects of the interventions noted. clinical outcome trials of sufficient duration are required to establish
conclusively the role of omega-3 pufa in type 2 diabetes but our results do not suggest a major harmful effect on the balance of blood
fats and confirm that it has no adverse affect on blood sugar control.

description of the condition
diabetes mellitus is ametabolic disorder resulting froma defect in
insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. a consequence of this is
chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose)
with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism.
long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy,
nephropathy and neuropathy. the risk of cardiovascular disease
is increased. for a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus,
please see under ’additional information’ in the information on
the metabolic and endocrine disorders group in the cochrane
library (see ’about the cochrane collaboration’, ’collaborative
review groups’). for an explanation of methodological terms, see
the main glossary in the cochrane library.
type 2 diabetes mellitus is the fourth leading cause of death in
developed countries with a two fold excess mortality and a two
to four fold increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.
the typical dyslipidemia (abnormality in blood lipids) associated
with type 2 diabetes is a combination of hypertriglyceridemia
(high levels of fats (triglycerides) in the blood), low levels of hdl
(high density lipoprotein) cholesterol and abnormal ldl (low
density lipoprotein) composition (howard 1987). low levels of
hdl cholesterol and high levels of ldl cholesterol are associated
with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd), while the
raised levels of triglycerides are less clearly linked to an increased
risk of cvd. several pharmacologic approaches have been used
to treat diabetic dyslipidemia (ada 1998). these include use of
3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a (hmg co-a) reductase
inhibitors (promoting the removal of ldl cholesterol from the
blood) (pyorala 1997), fibric acid derivatives (exact mechanism
of action unclear, but probably includes stimulating triglyceride
breakdown and ldl cholesterol removal fromthe blood) (elkeles
1998) and niacin (inhibits triglyceride production in the liver and
vldl (very lowdensity lipoprotein) secretion) (garg 1990). standard
dietary approaches focus on restriction of saturated fat and
limitation of simple carbohydrate and alcohol intake (ada 1998).
in the late 1980s, several investigators reported on the use of dietary
supplementation with fish oil as a means of treating diabetic
dyslipidemia (glauber 1988; friday 1989).
description of the intervention
a potential role formarine-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (pufa) in cvd risk reduction first came from observations
of the native inhabitants of greenland (inuits) (mouraoff 1967).
despite ingesting up to 40 percent of calories as fat (predominantly
of marine origin), this population had a lower incidence
of coronary heart disease compared to individuals with similar fat
intake on a more conventional diet (bang 1976). dietary fats and
oils from different sources differ considerably in their fatty acid
composition. animal fat is rich in saturated fatty acids. vegetable
and marine oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. polyunsaturated
fatty acids are characterised by the presence of more than
one double bond (allowing themto stay liquid at very low temperatures).
the designation using n-3 or the greek symbol omega-
3, or n-6 and omega-6, has been applied in the case of fatty acids
with the first double bond three or six carbon atoms from the end
of the chain. most fish oils are of the omega-3 variety and most
vegetable oils are of the omega-6 variety, although alpha-linoleic
acid is an omega-3 fatty acid found in canola oil. the omega-3
fatty acids found in fish oils are predominantly eicosapentaenoic
acid (epa) or docosahexaenoic acid (dha).
how the intervention might work
the beneficial effect of marine-derived omega-3 pufa on cardiac
risk markers and on lowering cardiovascular mortality and sudden
death in the general population have previously been reported in
the gissi-prevenzione (gissi 1999) and dart 1 trials (burr
1989) and in a subsequentmeta-analysis (bucher 2002).however,
the results of a later secondary prevention trial on coronary heart
disease (chd) and mortality (burr 2003) do not support the earlier
conclusions and a subsequent reviewhas also raised doubts that
omega-3 pufa reduce cardiovascular endpoints (hooper 2004).
the possibility of enhanced benefit fromomega-3 pufa in people
with diabetes has been shown in two previous reviews. in a previous
review of the role of omega-3 pufa in diabetes (friedberg
1998), benefit in reducing triglyceride levels was suggested. however,
the authors included non-randomized studies and studies including
people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. their review
included studies up to june 1995. concerns were also raised
about the possibility of harm from omega-3 pufa supplementation.
early non-randomised studies in patients with type 2 diabetes
suggested that omega-3 pufa might be associated with a
deterioration in glycemic control (friday 1989; glauber 1988).
this concern was addressed in the first publication of this systematic
review, which showed that omega-3 pufa supplementation
has no adverse effects on glycemic control (farmer 2001;montori
2000).
why it is important to do this review
the first publication of this cochrane review was limited to randomized
trials involving patientswith type 2 diabetes and included
searches for trials up to september 2000 (farmer 2001). the current
review includes randomised trials searched up to september
2006 and differs to our previous review in the following respects:
• title was changed from ’fish oil in people with type 2
diabetes mellitus’ to ’omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(pufa) for type 2 diabetes mellitus’;
• first author was changed to janine hartweg;
• change in outcomes from baseline to end-of-trial was used
to calculate the pooled effect sizes;
• a further five trials up to 2006 were identified and included
in the analysis;
• two further outcomes are included in addition to those
previously pooled.
we therefore set out to update our previous systematic review of
dietary supplementation using omega-3 pufa among peoplewith
type 2 diabetesmellitus. although our primary aimwas to identify
trials in whichmorbidity was studied, we also identified secondary
aims of establishing the extent to which changes in serum lipids
and deterioration in glucose control occurs following omega-3
pufa supplementation .
o b j e c t i v e s
to assess the effects of omega-3 pufa supplementation on death
and vascular events in peoplewith type 2 diabetesmellitus.we also
wished to establish changes in lipids and whether deterioration in
glucose control occurs.
m e t h o d s
criteria for considering studies for this review
types of studies
papers of any language were considered. trials were eligible if
they were randomized placebo or vegetable oil controlled trials
of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) (including crossover
trials) as the only intervention in participants with type 2
diabetes. as no phase-specific information was available for crossover
trials, data were used only from the first intervention period
to prevent measurements from the second period being affected
by effects carried over from the first intervention period. where
serial measurement of an outcome was given during the intervention
phase, data were obtained from the final measurement since
thatmeasurement was considered the conclusion of the study. the
effect of trial design was explored in a sensitivity analysis.
types of participants
adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
among the participants of trials included in the review was
established using the standard criteria valid at the time of the beginning
of the trial.
types of interventions
trials in which participants were randomised to any type of dietary
supplementation with omega-3 pufa were included. no
restrictions were imposed on dose or formulation, although trials
where the effect of omega-3 pufa could not be separated from
the effect of simultaneously applied interventions, such as exercise
or monounsaturated fatty acids, were not included.
no restrictions were placed on the range of compounds used as
controls in the study. some vegetable oils contain omega-3 pufa,
or complex fatty acids that might be metabolised to form omega-
3 pufa.
types of outcome measures
primary outcomes
• fatal myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death;
• proven non-fatal myocardial infarction;
• coronary or peripheral revascularization procedures.
secondary outcomes
• triglycerides
• total cholesterol
• hdl cholesterol
• ldl cholesterol
• vldl cholesterol
• hba1c
• fasting glucose
• fasting insulin
• body weight
• adverse effects
timing of outcome measurement
primary outcome measures will require studies of long duration
to yield meaningful results. we anticipated that changes in secondary
outcome measures would develop and remain stable over
a short period of time and so we included studies of any duration,
combining studies of short duration (three to eight weeks) and
medium duration (three to six months).
search methods for identification of studies
electronic searches
we searched the specialised register of the former cochrane diabetes
group and the cochrane central register of controlled
trials, as well as an electronic literature search of medline and
embase (from the beginning of each database until april 2007)
in two phases to identify trials involving omega-3.
our original search was conducted for publications from 1966 to
2000, and the second search was conducted up to 2006 using a
protocol that included the cochrane collaboration’s search strategy
for randomized controlled trials (dickersin 1994, adapted for
each database), using a similar search strategy for both phases (see
appendix 1).
we searched for records in all languages.
the bibliographic sections of all publications of included or excluded
trials were searched for additional trials.
searching other resources
dr cr sirtori (milan) and dr e ryan (edmonton, alberta), two
trialists, were consulted in an attempt to identify any other overlooked,
unpublished or ongoing studies. we did not attempt to
contact other authors where the size of the trials was small.
data collection and analysis
selection of studies
the titles, abstracts and keywords of every record were retrieved
to determine the relevant trials. full articles were retrieved for
further assessment if the information given suggested that the trial
(1) included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, (2) compared
fish oil with placebo or vegetable oil, (3) assessed one or more
clinically relevant outcome measures, (4) used random allocation
for the comparison groups. when there was any doubt regarding
these criteria from the information given in the title and abstract,
the full article was retrieved for clarification. when differences in
opinion existed, these were resolved by consensus referring back
to the original article.
the full articles retrievedwere examined independently by the two
investigators to identify relevant trials.discrepancieswere resolved
by consensus.
data extraction and management
two reviewers extracted data from the studies independently. disagreements
were resolved by consensus. the data extraction form
included the type of trial (randomised or cross-over), type of
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) and type of control
(including dose), length of intervention, trial setting, diabetes diagnosis,
baseline characteristics of intervention and control groups
(including age, gender, duration of diabetes, co-morbidity and
complications, and treatment), outcomes assessed and biochemical
outcome data in relation to study duration.
assessment of risk of bias in included studies
two investigators independently assigned quality scores to studies
with discrepancies resolved by consensus. a score developed from
the criteria of jadad and schulz (jadad 1996; schulz 1995) was
used to assess study quality, which had a possible range from zero
to five with a cutoff of two used to designate studies of high versus
low quality. the criteria used were:
• was the study randomised? was the method of
randomisation appropriate?
• was the study double-blinded? were the methods of
blinding appropriate?
• was compliance assessed?
• were there dropouts and withdrawals and were the
numbers and reasons for withdrawal stated? did more than 80
percent of those randomized complete the study?
kappa values were calculated for inter-rater agreement on quality.
data synthesis
extracted data were analyzed using the cochrane reviewmanager
software. quantitative analysis was based on changes in themeans
between baseline and endpoint measures. standard deviation of
the mean difference was calculated from the standard deviations
of the mean at the beginning and end of each trial by assuming
a degree of correlation of 0.5 (rice 1995). trials were included
in the pooled analysis where change data of the intervention and
control groups could be obtained from calculations of the mean
difference and standard deviation (sd).
a fixed-effect model was used for the pooled results. where heterogeneity
was indicated in the pooled analysis, a random-effects
model was applied. effect sizes are presented as weighted mean
differences with 95 percent confidence intervals. heterogeneity
was assessed using the chi-squared test with the significance set at
a p value of < 0.1. where serial measurement of an outcome was
given during the intervention phase, comparisons were made with
the final measurement. where a trial used two sets of doses, included
comparisons of epa and dha, or more than one control
group, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine which
comparison gave the smallest effect size (tramer 1997), which was
then included.
publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot method (egger
1997).
subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
subgroup analyses were planned a priori and undertaken for the
following variables:
• length of intervention (less than two months, longer than
two months);
• dose of omega-3 pufa (more than 2 g eicosapentaenoic
acid (epa), less than 2 g epa);
• type of omega-3 pufa (where epa or docosahexaenoic acid
(dha) was given separately, the result which had the smallest
effect size was included for statistical analysis to prevent sample
• duplication (tramer 1997);
• baseline triglyceride level (studies including only
hypertriglyceridemic patients, studies including not only
hypertriglyceridemic patients).
sensitivity analysis
sensitivity analyses were carried out on:
• quality (two points or less on quality scale (low quality),
more than two points on quality scale (high quality));
• blinding;
• trial design (cross-over versus parallel design studies);
• exclusion of any particularly large study (to see how much
they dominate the results).

studies.
results of the search
we identified 886 citations with their abstracts from electronic
searches carried out in 2006, of which 197 were deemed relevant.
one further trial was found from handsearching. these 197 abstracts
included 38 publications that described 23 trials which are
further detailed below. six of the trials were presented in more
than one publication, accounting for 17 of the published papers.
assessment of publication bias inter-rater agreement
the interrater reliability for the assignment of a quality score was
kappa = 0. 71.
included studies
twenty-three trialsmet inclusion criteria and were included in the
review. the effect of omega-3 pufa on glycemic control and lipid
levelswas the focus of twenty of the included trials. two trials were
designed to assess the effect of omega-3 pufa on vascular physiology;
however, these investigators also reported glycemic and lipid
endpoints (mcgrath 1996; woodman 2002). characteristics of
the included trials are tabulated. vegetable oil comparison groups
included olive oil, safflower oil and corn oil.
characteristics of included studies
the 23 trials included twelve parallel group design (alekseeva
2000; axelrod 1994; hendra 1990; jain 2002; morgan 1995;
mostad 2006; pelikanova 1992; petersen 2002; silvis 1990; sirtori
1997; westerveld 1993; woodman 2002) and eleven cross-over
trials (annuzzi 1991; boberg 1992; borkman 1989; connor
1993; goh 1997; luo 1998; mcgrath 1996; mcmanus 1996;
puhakainen 1995; schectman 1988; vessby 1990). the parallel
group trials ranged in duration from three weeks to eight months.
the cross-over trials had phases that ranged in duration from 2
to 24 weeks. none of the eleven cross-over trials reported phasespecific
data. four trials had a washout period (3 to 8 weeks in
duration) and one of these looked for but did not find a carryover
effect (borkman 1989).of the seven trials that did not have a
washout period, five looked for and two found a carry-over effect
(boberg 1992; mcmanus 1996). five new trials were identified
since the first review was conducted (alekseeva 2000; jain 2002;
mostad 2006; petersen 2002; woodman 2002).
interventions
the dose of omega-3 ranged from 1.08 to 5.2 grams of eicosapentaenoic
acid and 0.3 to 4.8 grams of docosahexaenoic acid. the
omega-3 was usually given in capsules except for one trial in which
a liquid form was used (pelikanova 1992). the dose of vegetable
oil or placebo wasmatched to the dose of omega-3. althoughmost
trials used vegetable oils (including olive oil, safflower oil, linseed
oil and corn oil) one used saline solution as a placebo (pelikanova
1992) and two used diet (alekseeva 2000; jain 2002). in all of
the trials omega-3 was added to the diet rather than being a replacement
for some component of the dietary fat intake, however
one trial reduced the high intake of omega-6 in the patients (jain
2002).
participants
a total of 1075 participants were included in the 23 trials. the
individual trial sample size ranged from 8 to 418. the majority
of participants were male and the ages ranged between 21 and
85 years. most participants had type 2 diabetes of 5 to 10 years
duration and were treated with diet or oral hypoglycemic agents.
few had diabetes-related complications. in three trials, all participants
were hypertriglyceridemic (connor 1993; morgan 1995;
vessby 1990).two other trials included a subset of hypertriglyceridemic
participants and these comprised 46% (schectman 1988)
and 10% (luo 1998) of all participants. individual study exclusion
criteria are outlined in the tables below.
outcomes
no trials were identified that included the primary outcome measures
of fatal myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death, myocardial
infarction or coronary revascularization procedures.
eighteen trials reported data on triglycerides, 17 trials reported
data on total cholesterol, 16 trials reported data on ldl cholesterol,
16 trials reported data on hdl cholesterol, seven trials reported
on vldl cholesterol that could be pooled for analysis.
eight of the 10 cross-over trials and eight of the 12 parallel trials
reported on glycated hemoglobin and five had a phase duration of
less than eight weeks (that is less than the time normally required
for hba1c to stabilize). of the 23 trials identified in this review,
only 18 reported their fasting glucose and six on fasting insulin
results in a way that permitted pooling of data. ten trials reported
on changes in body weight.
missing data
we contacted dr cr sirtori in order to clarify details of the italian
multicenter fish oil study. we were able to obtain unpublished
information about the inclusion of participants with type 2 diabetes,
data about disease duration, the use of oral hypoglycemic
agents and also clarify the issue of duplicate publication by one
of the centres in the multicentre study. we did not attempt to
contact other authors where the size of the trials was small.
details of missing data from each of the included trials are described
in the tables.one trial (silvis 1990) reported total glycated
hemoglobin. this measure was converted tohba1c using the formula
hba1c=0.61 x (reported glycated hb) + 2.1 (nutall 1998;
fairbanks, personal communication). four trials (connor 1993;
jain 2002; schectman 1988; sirtori 1997) reported lipidmeasures
in mg/dl, which were converted to mmol/l (kratz 1998) and two
trials (boberg 1992; vessby 1990) reported only the p value from
which the sd was obtained to calculate the sd of change (rice
1995).
excluded studies
one hundred and ninety-seven of 886 citationswith their abstracts
identified from the electronic and handsearches were deemed appropriate
for further consideration. one further trial was found
from handsearching. one hundred and sixty-four of the 197 abstracts
were excluded because they had multi-factorial interventions
from which the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (pufa) could not be separated, or did not use omega-
3 pufa derivatives (adler 1994; das 1994a; das 1994b; das
1995; dunstan 1997; holler 1996; howard 1987; lee 1994;
morris 1995; okuda 1992; okuda 1996; prince 1997; sirtori
1998; tonstad 1997; urano 1991; zambon 1992), were nonrandomised
studies (friedberg 1998; herrmann 1992; kasim
1988; malasanos 1991; schaap 1991; semplicini 1994; sheehan
1997; shunto 1992; silva 1996; stender 1990; zak 1996), included
patients without diabetes or patients with type 1 diabetes
(bonnema 1995; eritsland 1994; fasching 1991;hamazaki 1990;
lungershausen 1997; mackness 1994; rossing 1996; stacpoole
1989), did not include a placebo arm(fasching 1991; friday 1989;
glauber 1988; kasim 1988; mori 2000; shimizu 1993; shimizu
1995), did not include human participants (yamada 1995), lacked
data or did not report on outcomes that were relevant to this review.
the 12-month follow-up report of the italian multicenter
fish oil study (sirtori 1998) was excluded because it is a nonrandomised
non-placebo-controlled addition to the original trial
(sirtori 1997). the remaining 33 publications described 23 trials
that met the inclusion criteria of this review.
risk of bias in included studies
the trials could be classified by their quality scores into eleven
trials of equal or less than two points (alekseeva 2000; annuzzi
1991; borkman 1989; connor 1993; hendra 1990; jain 2002;
morgan 1995; pelikanova 1992; schectman 1988; silvis 1990;
woodman 2002) and twelve trials of greater than two points (
axelrod 1994; boberg 1992; goh 1997; hendra 1990; luo 1998;
mcgrath 1996; mcmanus 1996; mostad 2006; petersen 2002;
sirtori 1997; vessby 1990; westerveld 1993).
allocation
since randomisation was an inclusion criterion, all trials started
with a score of one. most of the articles of less than two scores
failed to describe the method of randomisation.
blinding
an additional point was assigned for the presence of blinding in
19 trials (axelrod 1994; boberg 1992; borkman 1989; connor
1993; goh 1997; hendra 1990; jain 2002; luo 1998; mcgrath
1996; mcmanus 1996; morgan 1995; mostad 2006; petersen
2002; puhakainen 1995; schectman 1988; sirtori 1997; vessby
1990; westerveld 1993; woodman 2002). most of the articles of
low scores failed to describe the method of blinding. some failed
to mask the odour of the fish oil supplement affecting blinding.
incomplete outcome data
six trials reported drop-outs or withdrawals (axelrod 1994; luo
1998;mostad 2006; petersen 2002; silvis 1990;woodman 2002).
effects of interventions
primary outcomes
no trials were identified that included the primary outcome measures
of fatal myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death, myocardial
infarction or coronary revascularization procedures.
secondary outcomes
as a guide, reference levels of triglycerides are 0.45-1.69 mmol/l
(serum), cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/l (serum),hdl cholesterol
greater than 0.91mmol/l (serum), ldl cholesterol less than
3.36 mmol/l (serum), vldl cholesterol 0.09 to 0.34 mmol/l
(serum), insulin 35 to 145 pmol/l, hba1c 3.8% to 6.4%, fasting
plasma glucose 3.9 to 6.1 mmol/l (kratz 1998).
eighteen of 23 trials reported data on triglycerides (comparison
01.01) including 969 participants.omega-3 supplementationwas
associated with a mean (pooled weighted mean difference) lowering
of plasma triglyceride concentration by 0.45 mmol/l (95%
confidence interval (ci) -0.58 to -0.32) compared to controls (including
a placebo of vegetable oils). this reduction was statistically
significant (p < 0.00001).
sixteen of 23 trials reported data on total cholesterol (comparison
01.02), inwhich 953 participants had a statistically non-significant
pooled weightedmean difference of -0.02 (95%ci -0.15 to 0.11).
omega-3 supplementation was not associated with a change in
plasma cholesterol concentration compared to controls (p = 0.72).
sixteen trials reported data on hdl cholesterol (comparison
01.03) in 882 participants. omega-3 supplementation was associated
with an increase in hdl concentration compared to controls,
with a change of 0.02 mmol/l (95% ci -0.01 to 0.06, p =
0.21).
of 22 trials, 16 reported data on ldl cholesterol (comparison
01.04) including 565 participants.omega-3 supplementationwas
associated with an increase in plasma ldl cholesterol concentration
of 0.11 mmol/l (95% ci 0.00 to 0.22, p = 0.05).
seven of eight trials reported data that could be pooled on
vldl cholesterol including 238 participants (comparison 01.05).
omega-3 supplementation was associated with a decrease in
vldl concentration compared to controls, a weighted mean difference
of -0.07 mmol/l (95% ci -0.13 to 0.00, p = 0.04).
of the 23 trials included in the review, 15 reported measurements
of glycated haemoglobin (comparison 01.06). the pooled
weighted mean difference for hba1c in 848 participants was -
0.01 % (95% ci -0.03 to 0.01). omega-3 supplementation was
not associated with a statistically significant mean change in glycated
haemoglobin compared with controls (p = 0.24).
twenty-one of the 23 trials reported fasting glucose results, of
which only sixteen with 930 participants reported their results in
such a way to enable pooled analysis (comparison 01.07). the
weighted mean difference was 0.16 mmol/l (95% ci -0.13 to
0.46, p = 0.27) showing that omega-3 supplementation did not
significantly change fasting glucose compared to controls.
fasting insulin was reported by eight trials of which only six reported
data that could be pooled with 529 participants (comparison
01.08). the pooled results showed a statistically non-significant
reduction, a weighted mean difference of -4.19 pmol/l (95
% ci -13.09 to 4.71, p = 0.36). compared to controls, omega-3
was not associated with a significant change in fasting insulin.
ten trials reporting data on weight were pooled (comparison
01.09). omega-3 pufa compared with controls was not associated
with a significant weight change, and the weighted mean
difference was 0.4 kg (95% ci -3.2 to 4.1, p = 0.82).
trials did not report the incidence of adverse effects of nausea,
vomiting, belching, diarrhoea, constipation, eczema, acne or arrhythmias.
heterogeneity
the results for the test of heterogeneity for the overall results
(omega-3 versus control in all participants, comparison 01) were
non-significant (p > 0.1) for all outcomes studied, except for the
subgroup analysis on low dose of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (pufa) for vldl cholesterol. these did not change when
different statistical models were applied.
subgroup analyses
subgroup analyses were carried out for outcomes that resulted in
significant results in the overall analysis, that is for triglyceride,
ldl and vldl cholesterol levels. results should be regarded as
hypothesis-generating:
hypertriglyceridemic patients
the pooled weighted mean difference for triglycerides in two trials
that recruited 72 hypertriglyceridemic participants was -2.24
mmol/l (95% ci -5.16 to 0.67, p = 0.13), and -0.44 mmol/l
(95% ci -0.58 to -0.32, p < 0.00001) for 16 trials with 897 nonhypertriglyceridemic
participants (comparison 02.01).
increases in ldl cholesterol levels were statistically non-significant
in two trials with 72 hypertriglyceridemic patients, with a
weightedmean difference of 0.40mmol/l (95%ci -0.26 to 1.06,
p = 0.24) using a fixed-effect model. the weighted mean difference
of 14 trials with 493 non-hypertriglyceridemic participants
was 0.11 mmol/l (95% ci 0.00 to 0.22, p = 0.05) (comparison
02.02).
vldl cholesterolwas significantly reduced by 0.53mmol/l (95%
ci -1.04 to -0.02, p = 0.04) in two trials with 72 hypertriglyceridemic
participants. the pooled weighted mean difference of
vldl cholesterol in five trials with 166 non-hypertriglyceridemic
participants was -0.06 mmol/l (95% ci -0.12 to 0.00, p = 0.06,
comparison 02.03).
dose of omega-3 pufa
comparison 03 shows data fromtrials with high doses of omega-3
pufa (more than 2 g eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic
acid). pooled results for triglycerides levels showed a decrease, a
weighted mean difference of -0.35 mmol/l (95% ci 0.53 to -
0.18, p < 0.0001) in the pooled analysis of 13 high dose trials with
457 participants, and -0.57 mmol/l (95 % ci -0.77 to -0.37, p
< 0.00001) in five low dose trials of 512 participants.
the increase in ldl cholesterol was 0.11 mmol/l (95%ci -0.01
to 0.23 mmol/l, p = 0.08) in 12 trials with 431 participants that
administered the high doses of omega-3 and also statistically nonsignificant
in four trials with 134 participants using lower doses, a
weighted mean difference of 0.14 mmol/l (95% ci -0.14 to 0.42
mmol/l, p = 0.34) (comparison 03.02).
for vldl cholesterol, the weighted mean difference was -0.07
mmol/l (95% ci -0.13 to 0.00, p = 0.04) for six high dose trials
including 222 participants, with only one trial using a low dose of
omega-3.
study duration
comparison 04 shows data for trials with long (more than two
months) and short (two months and less) trial duration. triglyceride
levels were reduced, a weighted mean difference of -0.58
mmol/l (95% ci -0.78 to -0.38, p < 0.00001) in six trials of
longer duration with 525 participants and by -0.36mmol/l (95%
ci -0.53 to -0.19 mmol/l, p < 0.0001) in 12 shorter trials with
444 participants (comparison 04.01).
ldl cholesterol levels increased non-significantly by 0.23 mmol/
l (95% ci -0.07 to 0.52, p = 0.13) in six trials lasting longer
than two months with 192 participants. in 10 trials less than two
months duration with 373 participants, the weightedmean difference
was 0.12 mmol/l (95% ci 0.00 to 0.23 mmol/l, p = 0.05)
after omega-3 supplementation compared to controls (comparison
04.02).
the weighted mean difference after omega-3 supplementation
compared to controls forvldl cholesterol levelswas -0.62mmol/
l (95% ci -1.11 to -0.13, p = 0.01) in three trials of longer duration
with 88 patients and was -0.06 mmol/l (95% ci -0.12 to
0.01, p = 0.07) in four trials shorter than two months including
150 patients (comparison 04.03).
sensitivity analyses
sensitivity analyses are shown in appendix 2. for most outcomes
(total cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, triglycerides, hba1c, fasting
plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin) the conclusions of themain
analysis were unchanged when
• only studies with a quality score of three or more were
included, or
• when only blinded studies were included, or
• when only parallel design studies were included, or
• when the only large study (sirtori 1997) was excluded;
• when the statistical model was adjusted.
however, conclusions regarding ldl and vldl cholesterol levels
were more sensitive to these factors, with increases in ldl becoming
non-significant when only blinded or parallel group trials
were included. pooled results for vldl cholesterol were nonsignificant
when blinded, and parallel designs were included. using
a random-effects model for vldl cholesterol changed the
pooled results to a non-significant weighted mean difference of
-0.13 mmol/l (95% ci -0.28 to 0.02, p = 0.08), but did not
change the conclusions with standardised mean differences, or
using weighted mean difference with a fixed-effect model. trials
measuring vldl cholesterol with low doses of omega-3 pufa
showed heterogeneity (p = 0.09) using both fixed-effect or random-
effects models -0.67 (95%ci -2.09 to 0.75), p = 0.35). the
weighted mean difference for both high and low dose trials were
statistically non-significant, using either a fixed-effect or randomeffects
model, however with standardized mean difference fixedeffect
or random-effects models the pooled reductions were significant
in trials only with high doses -0.36 mmol/l (95% ci -
0.66 to -0.06, p = 0.02). in hypertriglyceridaemic patients, using a
standardised mean difference fixed-effect or random effectsmodel
for vldl-cholesterol changed the results to -0.43 (95% ci -0.90
to 0.40, p = 0.07) and -0.36 (95% ci -0.67 to -0.06, p = 0.02)
in non-hypertriglyceridemic patients. for fasting plasma glucose,
the pooled results for trials of shorter duration were significant
with weighted mean difference and a fixed-effect or random-effects
model (0.55 mmol/l (95% ci 0.02 to 1.08, p = 0.04), but
were non-significant when using standardised mean differences
(0.17 mmol/l (95% ci -0.04 to 0.38, p = 0.10).

summary of main results
this systematic review pools 23 randomized controlled trials of
omega-3 supplementation studying a total of 1075 patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus. none of the trials examined hard clinical
endpoints (such as cardiovascular events or death). in the trials
reviewed, omega-3 supplementation had a statistically significant
triglyceride- and vldl cholesterol lowering effect. a statistically
significant increase in ldl cholesterol was noted after
omega-3 supplementation. ldl was not significantly increased in
subgroup analyses of hypertriglyceridemic patients, high or low
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) doses and in trials
lasting longer than two months. omega-3 supplementation did
not result in any statistically significant increase in fasting glucose,
hba1c, or fasting insulin. no other adverse effects were reported.
overall, the subgroup analyses are difficult to interpret as up to
50% of the trials included in the hypertriglyceridemia, high dose
and long duration subgroups were identical (that is including hypertriglyceridemic
patients on a high dose of fish oil in a long
trial) (connor 1993; morgan 1995), making it therefore difficult
to determine which of these factors really caused the differential
response. non-hypertriglyceridemia, long study duration and low
doses of omega-3 pufa may have contributed to a greater reduction
in triglyceride and levels, whereas hypertriglyceridemia and
trials of longer duration may have had a contribution to the larger
reductions in vldl levels. subgroup analyses did not indicate
variables that increased in ldl cholesterol levels.
overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
our data are relevant to clinicians managing patients with type
2 diabetes. they indicate that, in hypertriglyceridemic and normotriglyceridemic
patients, dietary supplementation with omega-
3 pufa leads to a modest lowering of triglycerides without any
statistically significant effect on glycemic control. the increases
in ldl are not significant in hypertriglyceridemic patients. it is
unlikely that omega-3 pufa will be prescribed in normotriglyceridemic
patients, but our results do not provide evidence to discourage
their use as over-the-counter preparations provided the
formulation has been manufactured to eliminate undesirable contaminants.
omega-3 pufa has been suggested to have beneficial effects in
other diseases including crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis and
breast, colon and prostate malignancies (connor 2000), and our
results show that omega-3 pufa represents a reasonable therapeutic
strategy in hypertriglyceridemic individuals. we are not aware
of any studies that have reported the combination of omega-3
pufa with other lipid lowering drugs, and few trials have compared
omega-3 pufa with fibric acid derivatives (fasching 1996).
the slight increase in ldl cholesterol seen with the use of omega-
3 pufa can occur with other triglyceride lowering agents, in patients
without diabetes (fisher 1998; ouguerram 2006; theobald
2004) and is consistent with physiological studies proposing the
mechanism of the ldl increase with omega-3 pufa (lindsey
1992; schectman 1996; surette 1992). in addition, large buoyant
ldl is known to be less atherogenic than small dense ldl and
this may be the type of ldl produced in response to omega-3
pufa (minihane 2000; mori 2000; suzukawa 1995). the impact
of omega-3 pufa on ldl levels in a larger trial included in
this systematic review of patients with diabetes have not yet been
published (sirtori 1997).
although the gissi-prevenzione trial has published its findings
on the administration of fish oil to 11,324 survivors of myocardial
infarction (gissi 1999), the analysis for the diabetes sub-group
(15% of participants) has not yet been reported. however, the
findings of reduced triglycerides and an overall beneficial effect on
survival on the patients surviving myocardial infarction (relative
risk reduction of 10% for the primary endpoint of death, nonfatal
myocardial infarction and stroke) are encouraging.
quality of the evidence
severalmethodological challenges were encountered in the course
of this review. eleven of 23 trials used a cross-over design and
phase-specific data were not available for any of these. for pooling
results from cross-over and parallel group design studies, ideally,
individual patient data or at least phase-specific data should be
available. in the absence of these data, three approaches are possible.
the first is not to analyse data from cross-over studies. the
second is to pool parallel group design and cross-over trials separately.
the third is to treat first phase data from cross-over studies
as coming from parallel group design studies, pool these with data
from parallel group design studies and look for heterogeneity in
the analysis. we adopted the latter approach and our sensitivity
analysis did not show any association between study design and
direction or magnitude of effect. use of the cross-over design to
study omega-3 pufa supplementation has other potential drawbacks.
omega-3 pufa is incorporated into biologic membranes
and presumably would require washout periods of appropriate duration
to minimize any carryover effect. in our review, only four
of the 11 cross-over studies had a washout period. despite these
limitations, the main findings of the review were similar if crossover
studies were included or excluded from the analysis.
another methodological problem is the use of hba1c as an outcome
measure in trials of short duration. glycated haemoglobin
or hba1c provide an integrated measure of glycemic control over
a period of approximately 12 weeks. the use of such measurements
in studies of short duration will underestimate any effects
on glycemic control. this may have occurred in several trials included
in this review (see tables).
the random-effects model was used where the studies were sufficiently
different to assume some level of heterogeneity that could
have been ignored in a fixed-effect model, but except for vldl
cholesterol, the conclusions did not change when the results were
analyzed with either model.
it is interesting to compare the current systematic review with
that of friedberg et al. (friedberg 1998). despite the differences
in design of that review to farmer et al (farmer 2001) and our
current review, the findings of the two reviews are similar and are
in keeping with the results of the largest trial performed in this
area (sirtori 1997).
potential biases in the review process
the subgroup and sensitivity analyses require elaboration to undertake
a more comprehensive comparison between groups with
different characteristics. this will be addressed in a further publication.
limitations of our systematic review include the limited number
of trials with emerging cardiovascular risk markers as outcomes,
and small trial sizes with a median of 23 participants. another
significant limitation of our study is the shorter duration of the
included trials. some trials did not describe methods of randomisation
or blinding so that the degree of rigor with which they were
conducted was not clear. it was not possible to pool all the identified
outcomes because of non-standardised measurement units,
and non-reporting of changes in outcomes. the findings from the
funnel plot analysis (figure 1) may indicate bias in reporting, selection
or methodology of the trials. however, we included trials
reported in any language to reduce selection and language bias,
and an assessment was made of the quality of the trials.
figure 1.

implications for practice
in hypertriglyceridemic patients, dietary supplementation with
omega-3 pufa leads to amodest lowering of triglycerides without
any clinically significant effect on glycemic control, and omega-
3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) may represent a reasonable
therapeutic strategy in these individuals.
implications for research
arecent reviewincluded patientswith diabetes as part of a high risk
group analysis, but also included non-randomised control trials
(balk 2004). three previous systematic reviews have evaluated
the effect of omega-3 pufa on cardiovascular events, lipid and
glycemicmarkers in type 2 diabetes (farmer 2001; friedberg 1998;
montori 2000). however, we considered lipid cardiovascular risk
factors beyond these markers, and used changes in the mean from
baseline to the end of the trial in the pooled analysis.we have also
identified more recent randomised trials.
the slight increase in ldl cholesterol seen with the use of fish
oil represents a cause for concern and long-term studies assessing
hard cardiovascular endpoints in patients with diabetes are
needed. in conclusion, our systematic review demonstrates the
difficulties of existing trial designs. rigorously designed and conducted
randomised controlled trials are required, using standardised
units measuring both established and emerging cardiovascular
risk markers in type 2 diabetes, to enable more conclusive
pooled analyses and improve the precision of the effect size estimates.
larger trials of longer duration would conclusively establish
the role and mechanisms of omega-3 pufa in cardiovascular
disease risk reduction in type 2 diabetes. one trial sub-group analysis
awaits reporting (gissi 1999), and four such end-point trials
are in progress (aforrd 2004; ascend 2005; galan 2003;
origin 2005).

abstract
background: the charlson comorbidity index is widely used in icd-9 administrative data, however, there is no
translation for read/oxmis coded data despite increasing use of the general practice research database (gprd).
our main objective was to translate the charlson index for use with read/oxmis coded data such as the gprd
and test its association with mortality. we also aimed to provide a version of the comorbidity index for other
researchers using similar datasets.
methods: two clinicians translated the charlson index into read/oxmis codes. we tested the association between
comorbidity score and increased mortality in 146 441 patients from the gprd using proportional hazards models.
results: this read/oxmis translation of the charlson index contains 3156 codes. our validation showed a strong
positive association between charlson score and age. cox proportional models show a positive increasing
association with mortality and charlson score. the discrimination of the logistic regression model for mortality was
good (auc = 0.853).
conclusion: we have translated a commonly used comorbidity index into read/oxmis for use in uk primary care
databases. the translated index showed a good discrimination in our study population. this is the first study to
develop a co-morbidity index for use with the read/oxmis coding system and the gprd. a copy of the comorbidity
index is provided for other researchers using similar databases.
background
studies of patient health should take into consideration
any independent predictors that will affect the outcome
of interest. individual disease status is an important predictor
of mortality and health care usage especially in
studies of older patients, and in many cases, subjects
may have more than one co-existing illness at the same
time. investigators may wish to conduct risk adjustment
for the additional health effects of these co-morbid
diseases.
previous research has led to the development of summary
comorbidity measures which classify patients
according to their disease burden [1-4]. the most widely
used and validated index of comorbidity was developed
by charlson and colleagues in the late 1980s [5,6]. the
charlson index includes 17 categories of comorbid disease
weighted based on their association with 1 year allcause
mortality. because the charlson index is weighted
and allows for additive scoring, it can take into account
both the number and the severity of comorbidity to provide
a summary of disease burden for each individual
patient [6]. the index has been validated in several different
populations, and has been widely used in studies
involving cancer patients and survivors [7-11].
recognizing the potential for its use in large database
studies that require risk adjustment for individual
patients, the charlson index has previously been adapted
for use with administrative data [12-15]. these adaptations
involve searching individual level hospital claims
data for codes corresponding to the charlson index
categories. however, these adaptations generally apply
only to icd-9-cm coded data, an international coding
system for classification of diseases, symptoms and
signs. there is no current translation of the charlson
index for read and oxmis coded data, two systems
which are based on icd-9-cm and are widely used in
british primary care. data using the read and oxmis
coding system has recently been made more readily
available from the general practice research database
(gprd), a uk-based database of clinical primary care
records. the gprd is the world’s largest source of
anonymised longitudinal data from primary care, and
currently contains information on 3.6 million active
patients from 450 general practices in the uk [16].
with increasing use of the gprd for academic and epidemiological
research, there is a need for a gprd-compatible
research tool that will allow categorization and
adjustment for patient comorbidity.
the main aim of this paper is to develop a comorbidity
index based on the charlson index for use with
read/oxmis coded data. we also describe the performance
of the new measure by testing whether comorbidity
is associated with increased mortality in a cohort
of patients from the gprd. it is our hope that the
newly developed and tested translation of the charlson
score can be used by other researchers working with
read/oxmis coded data and the gprd.
methods
development of read/oxmis codes lists
the original charlson index consists of 17 diagnostic
categories which provide the basis for assigning
weighted scores to each comorbid disease. deyo et al
[12] describe a validated translation of each diagnostic
category of the charlson index to icd-9-cm codes. we
used the icd-9-cm codes suggested by deyo et al to
guide development of the read/oxmis code lists used
in this comorbidity index. figure 1 summarizes our process
for translation of the index to read/oxmis codes
using one of the charlson diagnostic categories, myocardial
infarction, as an example.
using definitions provided by deyo et al for each
charlson diagnostic category, we searched the general
practice research database medical dictionary (version
0.3.7, copyright © 2004) for potentially relevant read/
oxmis codes. this dictionary includes the gprd medical
code for the type of event, the read/oxmis code for
the event and a description of the medical term. we
identified potential read/oxmis terms using two search
strategies. firstly, we used specific terms in the icd-9-
cm description of the event to search the gprd dictionary.
read codes have a hierarchical structure, with a
top level code for a disease category branching into
more precise and specific codes. therefore, our second
strategy involved identifying relevant top level read
codes and including all lower level codes. by using the
wild card (*), and hierarchies of read codes, we generated
a list of all potentially related codes. we conducted
these read/oxmis searches for 16 of the diagnostic
categories used in the charlson index. we treated the
cancer codes separately, and included all read codes
starting with ‘b’, but excluding all codes for benign cancer
(b7), cancer in situ (b8) and neoplasms of uncertain
behaviour (b9). we tried to be over-inclusive in the
searching and used broad search terms when possible.
two clinicians experienced in the use of read codes
(pwr and sh) independently reviewed the list of all
read/oxmis codes identified through searches of the
gprd medical dictionary. the clinicians selected relevant
read/oxmis codes and rejected codes not corresponding
to icd-9-cm codes used in the deyo
adaptation of the charlson index. a third clinician
resolved any disagreement on coding. we calculated the
degree of inter-rater agreement between the two clinicians
reviewing read/oxmis code lists using the kappa
score, which provides an estimate of the level of agreement
between the two raters above that occurring due
to chance. the final list of read/oxmis codes in this
adaptation of the charlson index is available in additional
file 1.
13 read/oxmis codes were used in more than one
diagnostic category. these overlaps only occurred
between diabetes and peripheral vascular disease (i.e.
‘gangrene diabetic’ was coded as both ‘diabetes’ and
‘peripheral vascular disease’), and between diabetes and
diabetes with complications. one clinician (pwr) determined
that the codes should be classified as diabetes
codes.
data source
the gprd is the world’s largest anonymised database of
primary care records [16]. practices participating in the
gprd record data on clinical diagnoses, test results, prescriptions
and referral data from primary care. clinical
data is coded using read/oxmis codes, along with the
date of original onset for chronic or recurrent conditions.
gprd recording guidelines direct practices to provide a
record of all significant morbidity events in the patient’s
medical history, including a summary of events that
occurred before the patient joined the practice [17]. the
data from practices undergoes quality control procedures
and several validation studies have shown a high level of
data completeness within the gprd [18].
validation dataset
as part of a study looking at the unmet needs of longterm
survivors of cancer, we received a dataset containing
primary care records between 01/01/1987 and 30/
06/2006 for all patients in the gprd with a diagnosis of
breast, colorectal or prostate cancer and more than five
years survival. we also received data on a control population
of patients with no record of breast, colorectal or
prostate cancer, matched to the cancer survivors by age,
gender and practice on a ratio of 1:4. the dataset
included data on 18707 breast cancer survivors, 5773
colorectal cancer survivors, 4856 prostate cancer survivors,
and 117105 control patients (total n = 146 441
patients). we used individual level clinical data in this
dataset to test the adapted charlson index.
assessing the comorbidity measure
following translation of the charlson index to read/
oxmis codes, we tested whether an increasing comorbidity
score was associated with increased patient mortality.
to achieve this, we applied the adapted weighted
charlson index to the patient cohort obtained from the
gprd. our adapted comorbidity score used the original
charlson score which does not include age, however,
charlson and colleagues have also developed a combined
age-comorbidity index [19].
cox proportional hazards models were fit with mortality
from july 1 2001 to 31 august 2006 as the dependent
variable. charlson score was coded as a continuous
ordinal indicator variable, and was included along with
age as explanatory variables. survival was measured in
days and associations are reported using hazard ratios
with charlson score of 0 as the referent group. all analyses
were conducted using stata mp (version 10, college
station, tx).
discriminatory power of the model
the area under a receiver operating characteristic
(roc) curve, or c-statistic, can be used to quantify how
well a predictor based on a number of variables discriminates
a dichotomous outcome [20]. we used a logistic
model to estimate the relationship between death
(dichotomous outcome coded 0/1) and the charlson
index, after adjusting for age, quintiles of the the index
of multiple deprivation (imd) and gender, before producing
the roc curve. model discrimination was
assessed by the area under the roc curve.
adjusting variables
we included age in 2001, gender and socioeconomic
status in the models for adjustment. age was categorized
in 5 groups of similar sizes (30-49, 50-59, 60-69,
70-79, 80+). the gprd dataset includes an index of
multiple deprivation (imd) score to estimate socioeconomic
status at practice level. the imd covers a range
of indicators including income, employment, health
deprivation and disability, education, skills and training,
housing, and geographical access to services for each
small area in the uk [21]. imd scores were grouped
into quintiles based on the spread of scores within each
country in the uk.
results
coding exercise
the inter-rater agreement between the two clinicians for
including read/oxmis codes in the charlson index was
84.6%, with a kappa of 0.45, indicating a moderate level
of agreement [22]. including the cancer codes, a total of
3156 read/oxmis codes were included in this adaptation
of the charlson index.
characteristics of the cohort
the mean age of the cohort was 73.7 (sd 12.5), and
73.5% of the patients were female. the high percentage
of female patients is due to the high proportion of
breast cancer survivors and gender matched controls in
the cohort. table 1 shows the frequency and percentages
of patients with each of the diagnoses included in
the comorbidity index.
the original charlson index weights each disease category
on the strength of its association with mortality.
using the original charlson weights for each disease
category, the breakdown by index score in our dataset is
shown in figure 2.
most of the patients in the validation dataset had no
comorbid disease (n = 60585). there were a few patients
with a very high charlson score above 5. there was a
strong positive association between increasing charlson
score and increasing age (p < 0.0001).
patient mortality
in total, 11,490 patients died during the five-year period
from july 1 2001 to august 31 2006. figure 3 shows the
survival curves for the population stratified according to
charlson score.
mortality was significantly associated with a charlson
score of 1 or more, with a positive increasing association
as charlson score increases (table 2). there was an
increased risk of death amongst older patients and
amongst males.
discrimination of the model
the discrimination of the logistic regression model was
good, with an area under the curve (auc) of 0.853 (figure
4). this indicates that the adaptation of the charlson
index is a good predictor of mortality in the
validation dataset.
discussion
we have translated a commonly used comorbidity index
into read/oxmis codes for use with uk primary care
databases. in a cohort of cancer survivors and matched
controls, a higher comorbidity score in this adaption of
the charlson index was associated with an increased
risk of mortality after adjusting for age, deprivation
scores and gender. the translated comorbidity index
showed a good discrimination our study population. to
our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a
comorbidity index for use with this disease coding
system.
although this adaptation of the charlson index can be
applied to any read/oxmis coded dataset, we hope
that our adapted version of the charlson index will be
especially useful to the increasing number of researchers
conducting work using the gprd. gprd data provides
an opportunity to conduct large scale epidemiological
research in primary health care use, health outcomes
and pharmacology. the medicines and healthcare products
regulatory agency (mrha), which manages the
gprd, has recently announced plans to link gprd data
with hospital episodes statistics (hes), cancer registrations
and office for national statistics databases. these
linkages will increase the value of conducting research
using the gprd, as researchers will be able to trace
patient pathways through primary and secondary care.
our adaptation of the charlson index is available in
additional file 1, and can be imported into statistical
software for use with other datasets. this index can be
used to quickly categorize patients into different comorbidity
levels, and will add explanatory power when conducting
analyses using read/oxmis coded datasets and
the gprd.
we tested the association between increasing charlson
score and mortality, which was the primary outcome
used in the development of the original score. our
results confirm the hypothesis that patients with a
greater burden of disease will die sooner. one unexpected
result was a large jump in the risk of mortality in
patients with a charlson score of 6 or above. this is
likely due to the number of patients in our cohort with
metastatic cancer, which generally has a very poor prognosis
in the small but high risk group of patients with a
score of 6 or more [23].
limitations
this comorbidity index performed well in our validation
exercise, however, there are several areas where the
model may be inadequate. firstly, it is possible that
some codes were not included when developing the
read/oxmis code lists for assessment. by using broad
search terms, hierarchical searches of read codes, and
two reviewers to independently assess records, fewer
potentially relevant read/oxmis codes were excluded
from the final adaptation of the charlson index. secondly,
we used the original disease weights developed by
the authors of the original charlson index almost twenty
years ago. one recent criticism of the charlson index is
that certain diseases have an improved prognosis since
the original score was developed. for instance, according
to the original charlson weighting, a positive aids disease
status carries an equivalent mortality risk to a diagnosis
of metastatic cancer. only eight patients in our
dataset were diagnosed with aids, therefore, this issue
is unlikely to affect our validation results. in studies
where a larger proportion of individuals are hiv/aids
positive, investigators may wish to use updated weights
for hiv/aids taking into account that the burden of
disease and mortality is lower now than in the 1980s
[24].
thirdly, recording of clinical outcomes in primary care
settings may be incomplete; a recent study demonstrated
that even major outcomes such as cancer may not be
recorded in patient electronic records [25]. although
the gprd data is subject to a number of quality checks,
it is possible that disease recording is incomplete. however,
many of the previous adaptations of the charlson
index have used administrative data, where patient history
and comorbid disease may not be as recorded as
accurately as the clinical data available in datasets such
as the gprd [26,27]. omissions of major comorbid diseases
can result in an incorrect final charlson score in
any study. these omissions are not an intrinsic
limitation in the tool that we have developed, but may
affect its functional ability in datasets such as the
gprd. future work should continue to validate the
accuracy of disease coding in administrative datasets
and the gprd.
our validation population of long-term cancer survivors
is unusual; these patients are older and sicker than
the general population. the cancer survivors have a
charlson score of at least 2 and a high proportion are
female owing to the high number of breast cancer survivors.
other patient cohorts using this adapted comorbidity
index will likely have different trends in mortality
and consultation behaviour. future studies should apply
this charlson adaptation to other study populations to
measure mortality and use of primary care services. we
were also unable to consider race or ethnicity in the
analysis as this information is not routinely collected in
the gprd. these limitations, however, do not affect the
development and translation of the charlson index to
read/oxmis codes, but may affect the results of the
validation exercise.
conclusions
in conclusion, we have developed an adaptation of the
charlson comorbidity index for use in read/oxmis
databases and the gprd which predicts 5-year mortality
in a cohort of patients. our adaptation is provided in a
downloadable format (additional file 1) for other
researchers using similar databases. with increasing use
of large datasets for epidemiological research, researchers
must consider how disease status will affect their
outcomes of interest. tools such as the charlson index
can provide a summary of comorbidity for use in large
studies, and this paper demonstrates the utility of an
adaptation of the charlson score in primary care coded
data.

abstract
importance  intensive follow-up after surgery for colorectal cancer is common practice but is based on limited evidence.

objective  to assess the effect of scheduled blood measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) and computed tomography (ct) as follow-up to detect recurrent colorectal cancer treatable with curative intent.

design, setting, and participants  randomized clinical trial in 39 national health service hospitals in the united kingdom; 1202 eligible participants were recruited between january 2003 and august 2009 who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, including adjuvant treatment if indicated, with no evidence of residual disease on investigation.

interventions  participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: cea only (n = 300), ct only (n = 299), cea+ct (n = 302), or minimum follow-up (n = 301). blood cea was measured every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years; ct scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years; and the minimum follow-up group received follow-up if symptoms occurred.

main outcomes and measures  the primary outcome was surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent; secondary outcomes were mortality (total and colorectal cancer), time to detection of recurrence, and survival after treatment of recurrence with curative intent.

results  after a mean 4.4 (sd, 0.8) years of observation, cancer recurrence was detected in 199 participants (16.6%; 95% ci, 14.5%-18.7%) overall; 71 of 1202 participants (5.9%; 95% ci, 4.6%-7.2%) were treated for recurrence with curative intent, with little difference according to dukes staging (stage a, 5.1% [13/254]; stage b, 6.1% [34/553]; stage c, 6.2% [22/354]). surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent was 2.3% (7/301) in the minimum follow-up group, 6.7% (20/300) in the cea group, 8% (24/299) in the ct group, and 6.6% (20/302) in the cea+ct group. compared with minimum follow-up, the absolute difference in the percentage of patients treated with curative intent in the cea group was 4.4% (95% ci, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted odds ratio [or], 3.00; 95% ci, 1.23-7.33), in the ct group was 5.7% (95% ci, 2.2%-9.5%; adjusted or, 3.63; 95% ci, 1.51-8.69), and in the cea+ct group was 4.3% (95% ci, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted or, 3.10; 95% ci, 1.10-8.71). the number of deaths was not significantly different in the combined intensive monitoring groups (cea, ct, and cea+ct; 18.2% [164/901]) vs the minimum follow-up group (15.9% [48/301]; difference, 2.3%; 95% ci, −2.6% to 7.1%).

conclusions and relevance  among patients who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, intensive imaging or cea screening each provided an increased rate of surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent compared with minimal follow-up; there was no advantage in combining cea and ct. if there is a survival advantage to any strategy, it is likely to be small.

trial registration  isrctn.org identifier: 41458548

colorectal cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. it is the third most common cancer worldwide, with 1.24 million cases reported to the international agency for research on cancer in 2008.1 traditionally, patients who have had curative treatment for colorectal cancer undergo regular hospital follow-up for at least 5 years to detect recurrence. although locoregional relapse is traditionally associated with poor prognosis, specialist centers are reporting improved cure rates for selected patients with combined-mode treatment.2 success in treating metastatic recurrence has also been increasing. approximately 40% of patients survive 5 years after complete resection of liver metastases3 and comparable results have been reported for lung metastases.4 the likelihood of survival is increased if metastatic disease is treated before it becomes symptomatic.5

seven published clinical trials have compared different follow-up regimens.6-12 two systematic reviews suggest an overall survival benefit associated with more intensive follow-up.13,14 however, trial quality was modest, the estimated effect on disease-specific survival was not statistically significant, and the mechanism by which the substantial survival benefits reported were achieved is unclear. two reviews13,14 concluded that the existing evidence base needed to be strengthened by high-quality trials addressing the effectiveness of the individual components of follow-up.

the 2 individual components of follow-up recognized to be widely available and affordable and to have the potential to detect isolated metastatic recurrence at an early and surgically treatable stage are computed tomography (ct) imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and regular blood carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) measurement. the facs (follow-up after colorectal surgery) trial was commissioned by the uk national institute for health research health technology assessment program to assess the effect of these 2 modes with the intention of providing a sound evidence base to inform clinical practice. the original intention was to conduct a trial of sufficient size to assess survival advantage but when this proved infeasible, detection of recurrence that was treatable surgically with curative intent was chosen as the main outcome measure. pretrial modeling suggested that unless follow-up increased the number of such recurrences detected, an important survival advantage of follow-up would not be achieved.

methods
trial design
the facs trial was a factorial 2×2 pragmatic randomized clinical trial conducted in 39 centers in the united kingdom; participants were randomized independently to ct imaging every 6 to 12 months or minimum follow-up and to cea testing every 3 to 6 months or minimum follow-up.

participants
to enroll in the trial, all participants had to have undergone curative treatment for primary colorectal cancer with no residual disease, microscopically clear margins, and dukes stage a to c (tnm stage 1-3). patients were disease-free based on colonic imaging with no evidence of metastatic disease (confirmed by ct or magnetic resonance imaging liver scan and chest ct scan) and with a postoperative blood cea level of 10 µg/l or less following surgery or completion of adjuvant therapy as indicated.

patients were excluded if they had concurrent serious illness or dominantly inherited colon cancer, were unable to provide written informed consent, or were involved in a primary treatment trial with conflicting follow-up requirements. potential participants younger than 50 years or more than 6 months from completion of primary or adjuvant treatment were included only if agreed on by the chief surgical investigator.

all participants gave written informed consent to participate in the trial. ethical approval for the trial was granted by the national health service (nhs) south-west research ethics committee.

study setting
participants were recruited at 39 nhs hospitals in the united kingdom with access to high-volume regional services geared to offer surgical treatment for recurrence.

interventions
follow-up was scheduled to occur for 5 years after trial entry. the factorial design, with independent allocation to the cea and ct interventions, meant that patients received 1 of 4 types of follow-up:

cea follow-up: measurement of blood cea every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, with a single chest, abdomen, and pelvis ct scan at 12 to 18 months if requested at study entry by hospital clinician

ct follow-up: ct of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years

cea and ct follow-up: both blood cea measurement and ct imaging as above

minimum follow-up: no scheduled follow-up except a single ct scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at 12 to 18 months if requested at study entry by the hospital clinician

all patients had undergone colonoscopy at trial entry to ensure there was no residual intraluminal disease and were offered an end-of-trial colonoscopy at 5 years; in the 2 ct groups, an additional colonoscopy was undertaken at 2 years.

blood collection kits were sent directly to patients, who then attended their own general practice for phlebotomy. blood was sent to the biochemistry laboratory at the john radcliffe hospital, oxford; the cea analysis was performed using a siemens centaur xp analyzer. if a patient’s blood cea level was 7 µg/l or more above the level at trial entry, the test was repeated as soon as possible; if the second test result was also greater than this threshold, the patient’s general practice physician was asked to refer the patient urgently to the local hospital.

outcomes
the primary outcome was surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent after a minimum of 3 years of follow-up. secondary outcomes were mortality (total deaths and deaths due to colorectal cancer), time to detection of recurrence, and survival after treatment of recurrence with curative intent.

information on participant deaths was collected at the office for national statistics central registry (all patients were registered to have the trials unit notified in the event of the patient’s death); cause of death was abstracted from death certificates. data on treatment of recurrence and treatment intent were recorded on case report forms by local national cancer research network staff who had access to the full clinical records.

randomization and blinding
randomization to 1 of 4 groups (figure 1) on a 1:1:1:1 ratio was performed centrally at the oxford clinical trials unit using a minimization algorithm to balance patient characteristics within each center based on 3 variables: adjuvant chemotherapy, sex, and age group. study nurses contacted the oxford clinical trials unit by telephone to enter a patient in the trial, reporting the relevant patient characteristics; they were then told the trial group to which the patient had been allocated.

because this was a pragmatic open trial, it was not possible to conceal the allocation group from either participants or clinicians. however, the research staff who abstracted outcome data from clinical notes were employed by the local national cancer research network teams independent of the investigators. the analysis program was undertaken first using dummy variables for the allocation groups and the code was not broken until the precise procedures for analysis were agreed on.

sample size
from the run-in phase of the trial, it was predicted that 2% of patients in the minimal follow-up group would have undergone surgery for recurrence with curative intent by 3 years of follow-up. it was therefore estimated that a sample size of 590 participants would need to be allocated to each factorial group to achieve 80% power with a 2-sided α=.05 to detect a minimum 3% absolute effect of intensive monitoring with ct or cea. modeling suggested that a 3% difference in treatment with curative intent translated into overall survival was the smallest difference that would prove cost effective. to compare the minimum intervention group with each of the cea, ct, and cea+ct groups separately, this sample size would provide 51%, 70%, and 84% power to detect absolute differences of 3%, 4%, and 5%, respectively. we therefore decided to stop recruitment when the sample size reached a minimum of 1180 participants.

statistical analysis
the primary analysis was an intention-to-treat comparison of the proportion of patients experiencing recurrence who were treated surgically with curative intent (1) comparing all patients randomized to the 3 intensive follow-up groups (cea only, ct only, and cea+ct) with the minimum follow-up group and (2) comparing all patients randomized to the 2 factorial groups (cea vs no cea and ct vs no ct). when feasible, crude data are presented with statistical comparison made between randomization groups based on χ2 tests for binary or categorical data, the t test or analysis of variance as appropriate for comparing group means, and the kruskal-wallis test for comparing medians.

time to recurrence was analyzed by the kaplan-meier method to take account of both time censoring and the difference in the number of recurrences detected in each group (ie, a crude comparison of time to recurrence may be misleading because this approach does not take into account recurrences not yet detected in less-effective follow-up groups). the plots of time to recurrence were compared by the log-rank mantel-cox statistic. adjusted odds ratios for the main outcome were calculated by binary logistic regression, entering all the baseline characteristics reported in table 1 into the model. for the comparison of factorial groups (cea vs minimum follow-up and ct vs minimum follow-up), an interaction term (cea factor × ct factor) was also entered. we set a statistical significance threshold of α=.05 based on 2-sided tests. the analyses were conducted using ibm spss version 20.

protocol adherence and amendments
adherence to protocol was ascertained through nhs hospital and laboratory records. a secondary per-protocol analysis was conducted excluding patients who received any unscheduled investigation or had missed more than 1 scheduled examination. there were 2 significant amendments to the original protocol during the trial. the initial protocol did not specify the single ct at 12 to 18 months in the minimum follow-up and cea groups; 66 patients had been randomized to the minimum follow-up group before this change took effect in may 2005. surgical treatment with curative intent rather than overall survival was specified as the main outcome in 2007 when it became clear that we could not recruit the number of participants necessary to estimate an effect on overall survival with adequate statistical power.

results
characteristics of participants
allocation of the 1202 eligible participants recruited between january 2003 and august 2009 to each randomization group is shown in figure 1. the follow-up intervention lasted 5 years or, for patients recruited after august 2007, until august 31, 2012. characteristics at trial entry are shown in table 1. the mean age of participants was 69 years, 736 (61.2%) were male, 350 (29.1%) had significant comorbidity; 487 (40.5%) had received adjuvant chemotherapy and 139 (11.6%) preoperative radiotherapy (for rectal cancer) before randomization. the randomization method was successful in achieving a good balance between randomization groups and factorial comparison groups. cumulative overall survival by stage and randomization group are shown in efigures 1 and 2, respectively, in the supplement.

detection of recurrence
during the period of observation for recurrence (mean, 4.4 [sd, 0.8] years), cancer recurrence was detected in 199 participants (16.6%; 95% ci, 14.5%-18.7%); 41 (3.4%) had locoregional recurrence only and 101 (8.4%) had metastatic disease limited to the lung and/or liver (table 2). the kaplan-meier plots in figure 2 show that the 3 intensive interventions tended to detect recurrence earlier, although these differences in earlier detection were not statistically significant. there were no recurrences treatable with curative intent detected in the minimum follow-up group after year 2. two-thirds of recurrences (n=130 [65.3%; 95% ci, 58.7%-71.9%]) were detected by a scheduled follow-up investigation; the remainder were interval cases, presenting symptomatically or incidentally during investigation of concurrent illness. three luminal recurrences were detected by the 2-year colonoscopy in the groups monitored by ct imaging. additionally, 3 cancers were detected by the 5-year colonoscopy but these were new cancers and not recurrent disease. the way in which the recurrences were treated is detailed in etable 1 in the supplement.

curative treatment and survival
the proportion of participants with recurrence surgically treated with curative intent was 5.9% (71/1202; 95% ci, 4.6%-7.2%) overall, with little difference between participants according to dukes staging (stage a, 5.1% [13/254]; stage b, 6.1% [34/553]; stage c, 6.2% [22/354]). table 3 shows that surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent was higher in each of the 3 more intensive follow-up groups compared with the minimum follow-up group (absolute difference ranged from 4.3% to 5.7%; overall p = .02). the adjusted odds ratios were 3.0 (95% ci, 1.2-7.3) for cea only and 3.6 (95% ci, 1.5-8.7) for ct only. the odds ratio for the combined cea+ct group was similar to that for ct or cea alone, providing no evidence that any additive effect is achieved by using both together. the factorial comparison showed an absolute difference between the intervention and comparison groups of 1.4% (95% ci, −1.2% to 4.1%) for cea and 2.8% (95% ci, 0.2%-5.5%) for ct.

of the 71 participants treated surgically with curative intent, 30 also received chemotherapy (7 with radiotherapy). of these patients, 47 (69%; 95% ci, 56.9%-79.5%) were still alive at the time of follow-up (median, 4.4 years after diagnosis of recurrence). the absolute difference in the proportion of patients treated and surviving compared with the minimum follow-up group was 3.3% (95% ci, 0.5%-6.2%) for cea, 2.0% (95% ci, −0.6% to 4.6%) for ct, and 3.6% (95% ci, 0.7%-6.5%) for cea+ct (overall p = .09). the differences in the factorial comparison were 2.4% (95% ci, 0.3%-4.7%) for cea and 1.2% (95% ci, 1.0%-3.4%) for ct.

the number of deaths was higher but not significantly different in the more intensive follow-up groups compared with the minimum follow-up group (18.2% [164/901] vs 15.9% [48/301]; difference, 2.3%; 95% ci, −2.6% to 7.1%), as was the number of disease-specific colorectal cancer deaths (10.4% [94/901] vs 9.3% [28/301]; difference, 1.1%; 95% ci, −2.7% to 5.0%). the kaplan-meier survival curves by randomization group and dukes stage are shown in efigures 1 and 2 in the supplement.

adherence to protocol
the extent of adherence to the follow-up protocol is shown in etable 2 in the supplement. patient adherence was very good, with only 5.8% (35/602) in the cea group missing more than 1 scheduled cea test and 5.0% (30/601) in the ct group missing more than 1 ct scan. although clinician adherence appears to be lower (10.6% of participants [127/1202] received unscheduled cea blood tests, 10.6% [127/1202] unscheduled ct scans, and 9.7% [117/1202] unscheduled colonoscopies), the protocol required investigation of any patients presenting with symptoms between scheduled follow-up tests. substantially more unscheduled tests were performed in patients not receiving regular ct scans, with 16.5% (99/601) vs4.7% (28/601) receiving 1 or more unscheduled cea tests, 17.6% (106/601) vs 3.5% (21/601) receiving 1 or more unscheduled ct tests, and 15.6% (94/601) vs3.8% (23/601) receiving 1 or more unscheduled colonoscopies.

per-protocol analysis
the results of a per-protocol analysis are shown in table 4, excluding the 308 patients (25.6%) who missed more than 1 scheduled visit or underwent any unscheduled investigation. the results are consistent with the intention-to-treat analysis but effect estimates are higher: the absolute differences in rate of detection of treatable recurrence in the more intensive follow-up groups compared with the minimum follow-up group were 5.8% to 8.0%.

discussion
the 2 follow-up tests assessed in this trial were cea and ct imaging. meta-analyses have suggested that these are the only modes with significant potential to detect curatively treatable metastatic recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer.13,14 clinical and ultrasound examination lack sensitivity whereas magnetic resonance imaging can realistically be applied only to the liver and lacks strong evidence of effectiveness in detecting recurrence.13,14 computed tomography–positron emission tomography was not an available technology when this trial was initiated and, because of cost and logistics, would be preferred to standard ct for routine follow-up only if evidence suggested much superior performance. endoscopic imaging (colonoscopy) was provided to patients in all study groups because it is a standard evidence-based element of follow-up care that can detect metachronous polyps or cancer (and, rarely, intraluminal recurrence).15

our results show that intensive follow-up by either scheduled cea or ct increased the likelihood of detecting a recurrence that can be treated with curative intent. the absolute difference in the proportion of participants treated with curative intent was approximately 5% in the intention-to-treat analysis and 8% in the per-protocol analysis, suggesting that between 12 and 20 patients need to be followed up to identify 1 potentially curable recurrence. more than two-thirds of the patients treated surgically with curative intent were still alive at a median follow-up of just over 4 years postrecurrence, suggesting that 5-year survival may be more than the 40% previously reported.3,4

although the proportion of recurrences treated with curative intent (and the success of such treatment) is higher compared with earlier reports, the absolute number of treatable recurrences detected is lower.14 this is not explicable by differences in stage-specific case-mix (detection of recurrences treatable with curative intent was similar irrespective of stage), nor is there any evidence that participants in the facs trial were at low risk of recurrence within stage (84.5% of stage c participants had received adjuvant chemotherapy). stage-specific overall survival of participants in this study (efigure 2 in the supplement) is comparable with that reported in trials of adjuvant chemotherapy, such as mosaic.16 a more likely explanation for the lower detection of treatable recurrence is the rigor of the investigative procedures undertaken to ensure that no residual cancer was present at trial entry. it suggests that the high rate of early recurrence reported from routine cancer statistics in england and scandinavia17 reflects residual disease that would have been detected with more thorough imaging. it probably also explains the greater benefit of intensive follow-up reported in previous trials—follow-up detected residual disease, not recurrence. a key finding of this study is therefore the need to fully stage colorectal cancer before embarking on follow-up.

the comparison between intervention groups suggests that monitoring with cea combined with a single ct scan at 12 to 18 months is not significantly different from undertaking regular ct scanning. because cea testing can be done in primary care, it is likely to be more cost-effective than regular ct imaging. however, imaging is still necessary to confirm recurrence, and in the combined cea+ct group, two-thirds of recurrences were first detected by ct. the diagnostic performance of cea as a monitoring test depends on the frequency of testing and the algorithm used to interpret the result. the algorithm applied in the facs trial (refer for imaging if blood cea level is 7 µg/l above baseline) achieves good specificity but at the cost of modest sensitivity.18 an ongoing study is investigating whether a higher sensitivity can be achieved at an acceptable level of specificity by applying a diagnostic algorithm that takes account of change over time and has been applied successfully in interpreting cancer antigen 125 levels when screening for ovarian cancer.19

we had planned to report our results after all participants had completed 5 years of follow-up because early analysis increases the risk of lead-time bias. however, there have been no cases of recurrence treatable with curative intent after 2 years of follow-up in the minimum follow-up group, making lead-time bias unlikely in our main comparison. nevertheless, subject to continuing informed consent from those in the minimum follow-up group, we plan to continue follow-up as planned to increase the precision of our results, particularly in relation to disease-specific mortality and posttreatment survival.

the decision on whether the absolute benefit of follow-up is sufficient to justify its opportunity cost will differ between health economies. the benefits of follow-up appear to be independent of diagnostic stage (because although there are fewer recurrences with better-stage tumors, they are more likely to be curable), suggesting that stage-specific follow-up strategies may not be necessary. however, thorough staging investigation at the end of primary treatment to detect residual disease is still important because a large number of “recurrences” reported in routine series are probably residual disease that should be detected and treated before embarking on follow-up. because of the detailed investigation performed before trial entry to exclude residual disease, our results also provide data on the timing of recurrence that can strengthen the evidence base for choosing the optimal frequency of testing. duplication of monitoring tests does not appear to add value; participants in the cea groups had a single ct at 12 to 18 months, when 3 recurrences were detected, but otherwise there was no suggestion of benefit from monitoring with both cea and ct.

the size of the trial provides limited precision in estimating survival. with an observed 15.9% mortality rate in the minimum follow-up group, we had only 31% power (with 2-sided α=.05) to detect a 5% effect on survival. although the observed 2% aggregate survival advantage of the minimum follow-up group vs the more intensive follow-up groups is unlikely to be due to bias (central death registration in the united kingdom means there was no loss to follow-up), it could be due to chance. an observed absolute 6% increase in surgery with curative intent predicts a 2% to 3% survival advantage with intensive follow-up. the confidence intervals around both the total mortality and colorectal cancer–specific mortality rates indicate that our results are still consistent with this outcome.

conclusions
among patients who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, intensive imaging and cea screening each provided an improved rate of recurrence treated with curative intent compared with minimal follow-up; there was no advantage to combining both strategies. if there is a survival advantage to any strategy, it is likely to be small.
