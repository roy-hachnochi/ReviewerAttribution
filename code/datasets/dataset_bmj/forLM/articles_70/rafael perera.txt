background
this is an update of a cochrane review first published in the cochrane library in issue 4, 2006.
otitis media with effusion (ome) or ’glue ear’ is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or
infection. it is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of ’grommets’. potential
treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. autoinflation devices have been proposed as a
simple mechanical means of improving ’glue ear’.
objectives
to assess the effectiveness of autoinflation compared with no treatment in children and adults with otitis media with effusion.
search methods
we searched the cochrane ear, nose and throat disorders group trials register; the cochrane central register of controlled
trials (central); pubmed; embase; cinahl; web of science; biosis previews; cambridge scientific abstracts; ictrp and
additional sources for published and unpublished trials. the date of the most recent search was 12 april 2013.
selection criteria
we selected randomised controlled trials that compared any form of autoinflation to no autoinflation in individuals with ’glue ear’.
data collection and analysis
two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included studies.
main results
eight studies, with a total of 702 participants, met the inclusion criteria. overall, the studies were predominantly assessed as being at
low or unclear risk of bias; unclear risk was mainly due lack of information. there was no evidence of selective reporting.
pooled estimates favoured the intervention, but did not show a significant effect on tympanometry (type c2 and b) at less than
one month, nor at more than one month. similarly, there were no significant changes for discrete pure-tone audiometry and non-
discrete audiometry. pooled estimates favoured, but not significantly, the intervention for the composite measure of tympanogram or
audiometry at less than one month; at more than one month the result became significant (rri 1.74, 95% ci 1.22 to 2.50). subgroup
analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a politzer device under one month (rri 7.07, 95% ci 3.70
to 13.51) and over one month (rri 2.25, 95% ci 1.67 to 3.04).
none of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions.
authors’ conclusions
all of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow-up. however, because of the low cost and absence
of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. primary
care could prove a beneficial place to evaluate such interventions and there is ongoing research in this area. further research should
also consider the duration of treatment, the long-term impact on developmental outcomes in children and additional quality of life
outcome measures for children and families.

autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (glue ear)
otitis media with effusion (ome) or ’glue ear’ is very common in children and the hearing loss and discomfort, especially where
the effusion is bilateral and long-lasting, may lead to problems with language, development and behaviour. there are a number of
treatment options including steroids, antibiotics, decongestants, antihistamines and surgery (the insertion of grommets (ventilation
tubes)). grommet insertion is one of the commonest operations of childhood. the best treatment strategy remains controversial,
however, as glue ear often resolves spontaneously within a few months.
autoinflation is a technique whereby the eustachian tube (the tube that connects the middle ear and the back of the nose) is reopened
by raising pressure in the nose. this can be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose, blowing up a balloon through
each nostril or using an anaesthetic mask. the aim is to introduce air into the middle ear, via the eustachian tube, equalising the
pressures and allowing better drainage of the fluid.
this review included eight randomised controlled trials of autoinflation for glue ear. all of the studies were small, of limited treatment
duration and had short follow-up.
the reviewauthors used a combined outcomemeasurewhich included any outcome signifying improvement (as defined in the individual
studies) and measured outcomes at the time points ’up to one month’ and ’more than one month’. improvement was demonstrated
only in ’more than one month’ analyses. subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a politzer
device at both under one month and over one month. none of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of
side effects between interventions.
the authors conclude that the evidence for the use of autoinflation in the short term appears favourable. given the small number of
studies and the lack of long-term follow-up, the long-term effects associated with the use of these devices cannot be determined.
b a c k g r o u n d
this is an update of a cochrane review first published in the
cochrane library in issue 4, 2006.
otitismedia with effusion (ome) or ’glue ear’ is an accumulation
of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation
or infection. it is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in
childhood (rovers 1999). it is common in children between the
ages of one and three years and in seasons when there is a high incidence
of the common cold, with a prevalence of ome between
10% and 30%. the cumulative incidence to the age of four years
is 80% (zielhuis 1990) and at age seven the prevalence is still 3%
to 8% (fiellau 1977; fiellau 1983; lous 1981; teele 1989). the
aetiology of ’glue ear’ is uncertain, but low-grade infection, poor
eustachian tube function and adenoidal infection or hypertrophy
have all been implicated (bluestone 1988). otitis media with effusion
often resolves spontaneously within a few months (fiellau
1979).
otitismedia with effusion (ome)may be associated with ear ache
(otalgia), infection and/or hearing loss.hearing lossmay be significant
(20 db to 30 db), particularly when the disorder is bilateral
and has lasted for more than a month (fiellau 1983). however,
some children have nearly normal hearing despite the presence of
fluid within the middle ear. the hearing loss and discomfort may
have linguistic, developmental, behavioural and other social consequences,
particularly if the effusion is bilateral and of long duration
(lous 1995). some studies have shown that children with
unilateral or bilateral otitismedia with effusion have balance problems
(golz 1998; grace 1990).
for its diagnosis, tympanometry in combination with otomicroscopy
or pneumatic otoscopy is the recommended technique
(bluestone 1988). tympanometry is performed with a handheld
device inserted in the ear canal andmeasures the eardrumresponses
to the sound and different pressures. diagnostic tympanometry
results in a flat curve (relative gradient less than 0.1, type b) or in
a curve with amiddle ear pressure between -399 to -200 dapa (c2
curve) (jerger 1970; zielhuis 1989) or when mobility of the tympanic
membrane is absent or reduced, or fluid and/or air bubbles
are evident behind the eardrum (browning 2010). type a and c1
tympanograms are considered not to represent otitis media with
effusion. the presence of a significant (10 db) air-bone gap on
pure-tone audiometry correlates well with the presence of fluid in
the middle ear.
management options
ome usually resolves spontaneously (20% will resolve in one
month and 40% at three months (fiellau 1979)) and many childrenwill
require no specific treatment.themost commonmedical
treatment options include the use of decongestants (griffin 2011),
mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines (griffin 2011) and antibiotics
(van zon 2012). of these options, only steroids have been shown
effective and only for short-term resolution (simpson 2011). surgical
treatment is more widely used and better researched, with
options including grommet insertion (browning 2010), myringotomy
tympanocentesis (surgical incision of the eardrum, with or
without aspiration of fluid from the middle ear cavity) and adenoidectomy
(van den aardweg 2010). the optimal treatment
strategy remains controversial, with wide international variability
in clinical practice.
’autoinflation’ refers to the opening of, and forcing of air through,
the eustachian tube by the raising of intranasal pressure. this may
be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose,
blowing up a balloon through each nostril, use of an anaesthetic
mask or a politzer device. the aim of these procedures is to introduce
air into the middle ear, via the eustachian tube, to equilibrate
the pressures. this is most likely to help in ’eustachian tube
dysfunction’ and has been proposed as a treatment for otitis media
with effusion (hunt-williams 1968). this systematic review aims
to assess the effectiveness of autoinflation devices in children and
adults with otitis media with effusion.

m e t h o d s
criteria for considering studies for this review
types of studies
we included randomised controlled trials of an autoinflation device
- designed to force air into the middle ear - in children or
adults with clinically diagnosed serous otitis media.
types of participants
children and adults with unilateral or bilateral otitis media with
effusion and a clinical diagnosis by primary care physicians or
specialists using tympanometry (type b or c2), either alone or in
combination with simple or pneumatic otoscopy or audiometry.
the type of diagnosis used in each trial is presented in the table
characteristics of included studies.
types of interventions
we included trials that studied any form of autoinflation (a technique
to increase intranasal pressure repeatedly either through a
nasal balloon or by other methods) compared to no autoinflation
and which were unconfounded. by unconfounded, we mean
studies where the two groups were treated equally, except for the
provision of the intervention to one group. other treatments (e.g.
analgesia, decongestants or short courses of antibiotics) were permitted
provided these were provided equally. autoinflation interventions
were classified into similar groups by an ent surgeon,
based on the description of the intervention whilst blinded to the
outcomes of the study (see appendix 1 for a brief description of
the interventions).
types of outcome measures
primary outcomes
• improvement in tympanogram (to type c1 or a
tympanogram)
• differences in hearing level on pure-tone audiogram
(average 10 db improvement over the frequencies 250 hz to
2000 hz)
• improvement measured as a composite of change in
tympanogram and/or audiometry (post hoc)
secondary outcomes
• adverse effects of autoinflation
• presence or absence of fluid in middle ear cavity
time points of outcome assessment
• up to and including one month from commencement of
autoinflation
• more than one month from commencement of
autoinflation
we were unable to analyse the following secondary outcomes due
to a lack of trial data:
1. developmental test results
2. behavioural test results
3. language and speech development
4. quality of life
5. family function
search methods for identification of studies
we conducted systematic searches for randomised controlled trials.
there were no language, publication year or publication status
restrictions. the date of the last search was 12 april 2013.
electronic searches
we searched the following databases fromtheir inception for published,
unpublished and ongoing trials: the cochrane ear, nose
andthroatdisordersgrouptrialsregister; thecochranecentral
register of controlled trials (central, the cochrane library
2013, issue 3); pubmed; embase; cinahl; lilacs; koreamed;
indmed; pakmedinet; cab abstracts;web of science; isrctn;
clinicaltrials.gov; ictrp; google scholar and google.
we modelled subject strategies for databases on the search strategy
designed for central. where appropriate, we combined
subject strategies with adaptations of the highly sensitive search
strategy designed by the cochrane collaboration for identifying
randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials (as
described in the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions
version 5.1.0, box 6.4.b. (handbook 2011)). search
strategies for major databases including central are provided
in appendix 2.
searching other resources
we scanned the reference lists of identified publications for additional
trials and contacted trial authors where necessary. in addition,
we searched pubmed, tripdatabase, the cochrane library
and google to retrieve existing systematic reviews relevant to this
systematic review, so that we could scan their reference lists for
additional trials. we searched for conference abstracts using the
cochrane ear, nose and throat disorders group trials register.
data collection and analysis
selection of studies
the trials search co-ordinator of the cochrane ear, nose and
throat disorders group assessed abstracts of all studies identified
by the initial search and excluded clearly irrelevant studies. one
review author assessed abstracts for relevance and we obtained
full texts for these. two review authors independently assessed all
full-text articles. differences in opinion about inclusion of studies
were resolved by discussion with a third review author. the review
authors were not blind to the journal of origin, the authors, the
institutions or the magnitude of results.
data extraction and management
two reviewauthors independently extracted study data using standardised
forms. we entered data into revman 5 (revman 2012)
and a second review author checked the data. data extracted and
presented included: author, publication year, journal, participants
(numbers, duration of illness, demographics, characteristics of the
disease, etc.), intervention (type of intervention and duration) and
results (outcome measures, effect size, statistical significance, adverse
effects).we contacted trial authors formissing or incomplete
data.
assessment of risk of bias in included studies
two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in all
included trials.differenceswere resolved by discussionwith a third
review author. we assessed risk of bias using the cochrane ’risk
of bias’ tool where types of bias are rated as low, high or unclear.
1. randomisation/selection bias: selection generation
2. randomisation/selection bias: allocation concealment
3. detection bias: blinding of outcome assessment
4. attrition bias: incomplete outcome data, losses to follow-up
and whether analysis was intention-to-treat
5. blinding of outcome assessors
6. selective reporting
7. other bias: we also used this section to assess whether the
groups were comparable at the start of the study for prognostic
characteristics
we assessed the quality of the studies separately:
1. that the groups were equally provided of care, except for the
treatment; and
2. adherence to study procedure.
data synthesis
we carried out analysis on the basis of intention-to-treat. where
possible we combined data to give a summary measure of effect.
when outcome data obtained were binary - recovered or improved
glue ear or audiometry improvement - we used relative risks of
improvement to compare interventions. the data reported in the
trials mainly used ’ears’ as their analysis unit despite using individuals
as randomisation units. to correct for this and to give
adequate weight to the studies we adjusted the outcomes using
the ’design effect’, which takes into consideration the association
found in using both ears from the same individual (deeks 2005).
we estimated the ’design effects’ fromthe blanshard data (full data
set provided by author) at one month and three months for participants
with either types b or c2 tympanograms or only type
b tympanograms. minor differences in correlation between intervention
and control groups (smaller at three months) were found,
but an average was used, as differences could be due to sampling
variation. for participants with type b or c2 tympanograms the
design effect at one month was 1.25, while at three months it was
1.51. for participants with only type b tympanograms the design
effect was 1.3 for both one and three months follow-up.
we used the appropriate design effect (for less than one month or
more than one month by tympanogram type at entry) to obtain
adjusted risk ratios (rr) for all studies that provided data for
the outcome. we calculated and then entered the log(rr) and
the se(log(rr)) into revman 5 (revman 2012). as the focus of
the review is on recovery/improvement we emphasise the use of
a positive outcome and refer to the rr obtained as the ’relative
risk of improvement’ or rri; instead of using the term risk ratio
which is normally associated with a negative outcome (e.g. death).
when data were continuous, we used mean differences to compare
interventions. we used the giv (generic inverse variance)
method with a random-effects model to pool studies together and
examined heterogeneity using thechi2 test and i2 statistic. funnel
plots were not used as the number of studies found was too small
for these to provide relevant information. we carried out analyses
using revman 5.
subgroup analyses
subgroup analyses had been planned on the basis of the diagnosis
of otitis media with effusion and the extent of the hearing loss
measured on audiometry. however, insufficient studies were identified
to allow these analyses. we also planned subgroups according
to age (under three years, three to 12 years and over 12 years).
however, we could not identify any papers of sufficient quality
including children aged under three years and only one paper included
children over 12 years (lesinskas 2003).
r e s u l t s
description of studies
results of the search
from the 2013 update searches, we retrieved a total of 401 references.
following first-level screening (i.e. removal of duplicates
and clearly irrelevant references) by the cochrane ent group
trials search co-ordinator we were left with 127 references for
further consideration. following sifting by the authors two more
duplicates were removed and 105 discarded following screening
of titles and abstracts, leaving 20 reports for consideration. two
were studies which we have included in the updated review (de
nobili 2008; ercan 2005). sixteen further studies were excluded
from the review, with reasons (costantino 2010; dalchow 2011;
ducla-soares 2007; el hachem 2012; hidir 2011; jumah 2010;
karahatay 2008; kawase 2008; laina 2006; leach 2008; pau
2009; poe 2011; prabhakar 2007; shim 2010; talmon 2010;
toros 2010). two were identified as ongoing studies (tel-aviv
med center 2006; williamson 2011).
from the original searches (2006 publication of this review), 418
abstracts were obtained from the search, with 62 selected as possibly
relevant.these were screened for relevance and we obtained 24
full-text articles. of these full-text articles two review authors (jh
and rp) filtered out 16 as duplicates or rejected them for not fulfilling
the inclusion criteria. two further reports were awaiting assessment
in the original review and remain so (niebuhr-jorgensen
1996; scadding 2002) (see characteristics of studies awaiting
classification). limited available information has meant that these
studies cannot yet be excluded from meeting the review criteria.
there have been no published data following on from either of
the abstracts for these studies. contact with one of the authors has
indicated that one of the studies may be published in the future
(scadding 2002), whilst the other author has not been contactable
(niebuhr-jorgensen 1996). six studies were included in the original
(2006) version of the review.
it is hoped that the two ongoing studies will be able to contribute
their results to this review in the future. the tel-avivmed center
2006 study commenced in october 2006. the authors confirmed
in 2010 that their results would be released shortly; unfortunately
this has been delayed and a new date has not been announced.
the williamson 2011 study started in september 2011 and it is
hoped that results will be available during winter of 2013-14. (see
characteristics of ongoing studies).
a total of eight papers therefore met the eligibility criteria for
inclusion in the current 2012 update of the review (arick 2005;
blanshard 1993; brooker 1992; de nobili 2008; ercan 2005;
fraser 1977; lesinskas 2003; stangerup 1992).
included studies
see characteristics of included studies table.
participants
two trials included only participants with bilateral ome confirmed
by tympanometry (blanshard 1993; fraser 1977). six trials
(arick 2005; brooker 1992; de nobili 2008; ercan 2005;
lesinskas 2003; stangerup 1992) included participants with both
unilateral and bilateral ome. diagnosis of ome was confirmed
by tympanometry alone in two studies (denobili 2008; stangerup
1992), tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry in one study
(lesinskas 2003), tympanometry and otoscopy in one study
(ercan 2005), tympanometry, otoscopy and audiometry in one
study (brooker 1992) and audiometry and otoscopy in one study
(arick 2005). stangerup and blanshard only included participants
with a diagnosis of bilateral ome of at least three months duration.
the diagnosis of ome by tympanogram varied from study
to study, with some defining types b and c2 as ome (blanshard
1993; stangerup 1992)while others only included typeb(brooker
1992; ercan 2005).
seven of the eight trials studied children aged between three
and 16 years (arick 2005; blanshard 1993; brooker 1992; de
nobili 2008; ercan 2005; fraser 1977; stangerup 1992).one trial
included participants aged between 16 and 75 years (lesinskas
2003).
interventions
the included studies used a range of interventions and outcome
measures. of the eight studies included, three (blanshard
1993; ercan 2005; stangerup 1992) used a classic otovent®, two
(brooker 1992; fraser 1977) used a carnival blower + balloon and
three (arick 2005; de nobili 2008; lesinskas 2003) used politzer
devices. seven out of the eight studies used observation without
treatment as their control; the exception was ercan who maintained
nasal saline irrigation in the control. the duration of the
intervention was variable, with a minimum of 10 days (lesinskas
2003) to amaximum of seven weeks (arick 2005). the number of
times per day the autoinflation procedure was designed to be carried
out was relatively consistent: three times per day (blanshard
1993; brooker 1992; ercan 2005; stangerup 1992) or two times
per day (arick 2005; lesinskas 2003). duration and intensity
of intervention specific to each trial can be obtained from the
characteristics of included studies table. one study (fraser 1977)
used a three-factorial design to compare autoinflation, ephedrine
drops anddimotapp® elixir to treatome. in one study (lesinskas
2003) the intervention was carried out by a physician, not the
patient or a carer.
outcomes and follow-up
tympanometry was the most commonly used outcome and was
reported in four trials, as a dichotomous variable (improvement
yes/no) (blanshard 1993; de nobili 2008; stangerup 1992) and
as a continuous variable (difference in mean middle ear compliance)
(fraser 1977). three trials (brooker 1992; ercan 2005;
lesinskas 2003) reported dichotomous, composite measures obtained
fromtympanometry combinedwith other outcomes. lesinskas
reported a total score that combined pneumotoscopic appearance,
tympanometry, patient complaint and audiometry. brooker
reported improvement in both tympanometry and audiometry as
a single, combined outcome measure. audiometry was reported as
a separate outcome in three trials. one of these (blanshard 1993)
reported a dichotomous change in pure-tone audiometry threshold
at frequencies between 250 hz and 4000 hz, while the other
two trials reported it as a continuous outcome (mean change in
pure-tone audiometry thresholds at frequencies between 500 hz
to 4000 hz (arick 2005) or 500 hz to 2000 hz (fraser 1977)).
other outcomes reported were tympanic membrane mobility on
otoscopy (arick 2005) and clearance of fluid from the middle
ear (blanshard 1993). six studies recorded outcomes at the end
of treatment (blanshard 1993; brooker 1992; de nobili 2008;
fraser 1977; lesinskas 2003; stangerup 1992). one trial (arick
2005) recorded outcomes four weeks after the end of seven weeks
of treatment. three trials (ercan 2005; lesinskas 2003; stangerup
1992) reported longer follow-up times after treatment had finished.
excluded studies
see characteristics of excluded studies table.
a total of 30 studies were excluded for the following reasons:
• 18 were not randomised trials (alper 1999; arick 2000;
blanshard 1995; costantino 2010; gottschalk 1966; gottschalk
1991; havas 1995; kaneko 1997; karahatay 2008; kutácová
2005; laina 2006; leunig 1995; luntz 1991; ogawa 2003; poe
2011; prabhakar 2007; talmon 2010; yu 2003);
• six studies did not have participants with otitis media with
effusion (dalchow 2011; ducla-soares 2007; hidir 2011; jumah
2010; kawase 2008; pau 2009);
• four studies did not assess autoinflation as the intervention
(el hachem 2012; kouwen 2005; leach 2008; shim 2010;
toros 2010);
• one study did not assess hearing loss by either
tympanometry and/or audiometry (chan 1989); and
• one study considered two different autoinflation
techniques, but not against a control (hanner 1997).
risk of bias in included studies
we assessed studies for risk of bias in four areas: random sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment,
incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. we also
assessed the quality of the intervention in terms of equal provision
of care for all groups and treatment adherence. we deemed none
of the included studies to be of high quality (see individual entries
in the characteristics of included studies table, table 1 and figure
1).
figure 1. ’risk of bias’ summary: review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item for each included
study.
randomisation (sequence generation) was reported and deemed
low risk in three of the trials (arick 2005; blanshard 1993;
lesinskas 2003); the remaining trials were unclear risk.
only one study fully commented on allocation concealment and
we classed this as low risk (lesinskas 2003). the remaining studies
made no comment and so we classified them as unclear risk.
four studies presented data showing the different arms of the study
to be comparable on prognostic characteristics (arick 2005; de
nobili 2008; fraser 1977; stangerup 1992). one study described
distribution of age and sex as being similar between arms at baseline
(ercan 2005). one study (blanshard 1993) commented that
groups showed significance only in age distribution and exposure
to smoking, while two studies (brooker 1992; lesinskas 2003)
described as randomised controlled trials did not present data on
the baseline characteristics. confounding was not an issue in any
trial.
only one trial (arick 2005) reported that the participating doctors
and the outcome assessorswere blinded, althoughwith patients not
blinded it is likely the patient’s status could have become known
to the assessors.
follow-up was predominantly low risk: four studies had no attrition
(arick 2005; brooker 1992;denobili 2008; lesinskas 2003)
and three further studies had less than 15% attrition (blanshard
1993; ercan 2005; fraser 1977). we assessed only one study
(stangerup 1992) as high risk, with 42% attrition in the experimental
arm and 67% attrition in the control arm.
no trials showed any evidence of selective reporting.
reported adherence to the use of autoinflation was variable; one
trial reported 98% compliance (arick 2005) while another reported
45% of participants as having high compliance, 43% low
compliance and 12% being unable to use the autoinflation device
(blanshard 1993).
effects of interventions
eight studies met the inclusion criteria for this review and compared
autoinflation with control.
combining data proved difficult due to a lack of consistent reporting
of a common single outcome measure. hence, post hoc,
we also analysed a composite measure of any outcome signifying
improvement (as defined in the individual studies). we analysed
the data in two time frames: up to one month and more than one
month.
improvement in tympanogram (to type c1 or a
tympanogram)
of the five studies that included tympanometry as a discrete outcome
at less than onemonth, three favoured treatment (blanshard
1993; ercan 2005; stangerup 1992) and two favoured control
(brooker 1992; de nobili 2008). within these five studies, at
less than one month, autoinflation showed a non-significant improvement
in tympanometry as defined by type c2 and b tympanograms
(relative risk of improvement (rri) 1.47, 95% confidence
interval (ci) 0.69 to 3.13), with substantial heterogeneity
(i2 = 89%). see analysis 1.1.1. subgroup analyses suggested that
autoinflation is beneficial in children with either initial type b
tympanogram, relative to a type c1 or a tympanogram (rri 2.15,
95% ci 1.41 to 3.28, i2 = 0%), or type c2 tympanograms (rri
3.84, 95%ci 1.94 to 7.59, i2 = 0%) (analysis 1.1). this anomaly
was due to the fact that the brooker 1992 trial did not report the
baseline tympanometry level of the participants in the study, while
de nobili 2008 reported these as percentages at different stages
(not tracked by ear) and therefore neither could be included in
the subgroup analyses. as these are the two trials where the effect
of the intervention is negative, their exclusion from the subgroup
analyses changed the size of the estimated effect.
a sixth study (fraser 1977) used mean change in middle ear pressure
as the tympanometry outcome and was not included in the
pooled estimates. fraser found no significant difference between
control and intervention groups.
four studies followed participants for longer than a month
(blanshard 1993; de nobili 2008; ercan 2005; stangerup 1992).
in these studies autoinflation produced a non-significant change
in tympanometry compared to control (rri 1.22, 95% ci 1.00
to 1.49, i2 = 0%).
differences in hearing level on pure-tone audiogram
(average 10 db improvement over the frequencies
250 hz to 2000 hz)
two studies included an average improvement of 10 db ormore in
the threshold for pure-tone audiometry in a range of frequencies
from250hz to 2000hz as a discrete outcomemeasure (blanshard
1993; brooker 1992). the estimated recovery was worse in the
autoinflation group (rri 0.80, 95% ci 0.22 to 2.88, i2 = 63%)
(analysis 2.1). two studies reported audiometry improvement as
continuous (arick 2005; fraser 1977), with the pooled estimate
showing a non-significant improvement in the autoinflation group
(mean difference (md) 7.02 db, 95% ci -6.92 to 20.96, i2 =
95%) (analysis 2.2). in both cases significant heterogeneity was
found in the combined studies.
improvement measured as a composite of change in
tympanogram and/or audiometry (post hoc)
we combined seven studies using a dichotomous outcome of ’improvement’
in either tympanogram or audiometry (less than one
month: blanshard 1993; brooker 1992; de nobili 2008; ercan
2005; lesinskas 2003; stangerup 1992; and over onemonth:arick
2005; blanshard 1993; de nobili 2008; ercan 2005; lesinskas
2003; stangerup 1992).the relative risk of improvementwas 1.89
(95% ci 0.83 to 4.31, i2 = 93%, analysis 3.1) at less than one
month and 1.74 (95% ci 1.22 to 2.50, i2 = 69%, analysis 3.2) at
more than onemonth.the type of interventionwas categorised by
an independent rater and information on two types was obtained:
a) politzerisation and b) otovent® or carnival blower + balloon.
subgroup analysis: type of intervention
we carried out a subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention
judged by blinded assessment. five studies (blanshard 1993;
brooker 1992; de nobili 2008; ercan 2005; stangerup 1992)
provided information on type a interventions (classic otovent®
or carnival blower with balloon) and two (arick 2005; lesinskas
2003) provided information on type c interventions (politzer and
modified politzer). analyses showed a positive, statistically significant
effect using a politzer device under one month (rri 7.07,
95% ci 3.70 to 13.51) (analysis 3.3) and over one month (rri
2.25, 95%ci 1.67 to 3.04, i2 = 21.1%) (analysis 3.4). a non-significant
effect was found when using otovent®or carnival blower
+ balloon under one month (rri 1.47, 95% ci 0.69 to 3.13 i2
= 89%) (analysis 3.3) and over one month (rri 1.22, 95% ci
1.00 to 1.49, i2 = 0%) (analysis 3.4).
adverse effects of autoinflation and compliance
none of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence
of side effects between the control or intervention groups.
the side effects/complications studied included incidence of middle
ear infection, eardrum perforation, attacks of otitis media, upper
respiratory tract infections, tonsillitis, use of antibiotics, middle
ear effusion, insertion of grommets and enlarged adenoids.
one study (lesinskas 2003) reported that one patient stopped the
treatment due to the pain caused by the procedure.
six of the eight trials reported compliance. four studies assessed
the adherence to the intervention as ’high compliance’ (as defined
by the study authors) ranging from45%to 100%. two studies reported
’good’ or ’satisfactory’ compliance. one study commented
that “some children withome found doing the valsalvamanoeuvre
painful” (blanshard 1993), but other than lesinskas 2003 no
other study made any comment.
data on reported side effects and compliance for each individual
trial can be found in the table of ’side effects and compliance’
(table 1).
presence or absence of fluid in middle ear cavity
one study reported otoscopy findings (blanshard 1993) and
demonstrated significantly higher clearance of free fluid from the
middle ear at one and two, but not at three months, in the intervention
group compared to the control group (p < 0.05).
other outcomes
lesinskas 2003 presented outcomes as a pooled score of pneumotoscopy,
tympanometry, patient complaint and audiometry. at
day 10 and day 60 a significant overall improvement was demonstrated
in the autoinflation group compared to the control group
(p < 0.001). we were unable to obtain data on individual outcomes.
blanshard 1993 analysed low compliance and high compliance
subgroups within the intervention. arick 2005 reported
improvement in tympanometric peak pressure (tpp) and hearing
recovery (used as primary outcome of improvement in the pooled
estimate).
none of the studies reported developmental test results, behavioural
test results, language and speech development, quality
of life or family function.
d i s c u s s i o n
overall autoinflation appears to have a beneficial effect on the
resolution of glue ear, with a low incidence of adverse side effects
(table 1). six of the eight studies showed beneficial effects at least
in the short term(maximumduration of follow-up in the included
studies was three months), while one of the two that reported
a negative effect in the short term reported a positive effect in
the long term (two months). this is in keeping with a previous
systematic review on the use of autoinflation (reidpath 1999).
this reviewconcludes that the evidence for the use of autoinflation
in the treatment of glue ear in children is conflicting but suggests
that it may be of clinical benefit in the short term.
there are several limitations in the collection and interpretation
of the findings. the type of device used may be critical in determining
the benefits of autoinflation. pooled effect estimates suggest
politzerisation to be more effective than the classic otovent®
device or carnival blower with a balloon attached. however, both
papers that used politzerisation as themethod of autoinflation had
slightly different entry criteria to the rest. they were deemed suitable
for inclusion in this review as they both used multiple criteria
to make the diagnosis of otitis media with effusion (ome) (hearing
loss, tympanometry and, in one paper, otoscopy). information
in this area is sparse. a study (hanner 1997, not part of this review)
comparing two differentmethods of autoinflation (valsalva versus
otovent®) did not identify a difference between them, however
a reanalysis of their data showed a significant difference in favour
of otovent® (relative risk of improvement (rri) 1.70, 95% confidence
interval (ci) 1.08 to 2.69).
duration of treatment and follow-up also appear to be factors
in determining the effects of autoinflation. autoinflation seems
more beneficial in the short term (one month or less of treatment)
than in the longer term. paradoxically the meta-analysis of composite
outcomes shows the relative risk of improvement at one
month or less to be non-significant (rri 1.89, 95% ci 0.83 to
4.31) whilst the relative risk of improvement at more than one
month is significant (rri 1.74, 95% ci 1.22 to 2.50). the results
are affected by the two studies that found autoinflation to be
markedly worse than control at least in the short term (brooker
1992; de nobili 2008), leading to significant heterogeneity (i2 =
89%). the study by brooker 1992 did not continue follow-up for
longer than one month, therefore it was not included in the composite
outcomes at longer time frames. the study by de nobili
2008 reported percentage of ears at different tympanogram levels
(b, c2, c1 and a) at baseline, 12 days and two months. for our
calculations we have assumed that all ears in the category b and
c2 are included and ears in categories a and c1 will not revert
to worse tympanograms. de nobili 2008 reports a positive difference
(in favour of autoinflation) for the two-month follow-up.
a final important difference is that for this study most omes are
resolved within the two months of follow-up; five out of 60 ears
remain as c2 or b. several differences were noted in the duration
of the intervention (range 10 days to threemonths) and also in the
duration of follow-up, ranging from cessation of the intervention
to two months after the intervention. only three studies continued
to follow up participants after the intervention had ceased
(arick 2005; lesinskas 2003; stangerup 1992). for these reasons
it is difficult to determine whether the benefits of autoinflation are
sustained after treatment.
the combined effects show a mixed pattern of autoinflation, with
both statistical and clinical heterogeneity. considerable heterogeneity
may be due to the populations, the intervention or the
outcome definitions. one study (brooker 1992) found autoinflation
to be worse than control; another (denobili 2008) showed it
to be worse in the short term (12 days) but better in the long term
(two months). the children in brooker’s study are comparable to
those in other studies in terms of age, but there are few data with
which to compare the prognostic characteristics of the control and
intervention groups in this study with the other studies. for de
nobili 2008 it is difficult to assess if the assumption made about
the change in tympanogram for ears is potentially affecting the
results (no data on improvement at ear or individual level are provided).
brooker’s populations may be different to those of other studies
in that the proportion of controls recovering in this trial was
much higher than in any other studies. a possible reason for this
is the outcome reported, which is a composite of improvement
in pure-tone audiogram and tympanogram. another difference
is that it is suggested in the paper that only children with type
b tympanograms were included, but this was not clearly stated.
hence, heterogeneity could be explained if autoinflation is helpful
to children with type c2 but not type b tympanograms. subgroup
analyses of the blanshard 1993 and stangerup 1992 papers
suggest that this might be the case (although the effect size is not
statistically significant in either subgroup). finally, brooker did
not use a standardised otovent® device, instead using a carnival
blower and balloon. this may be a less effective or even harmful
method of autoinflation, however the independent rater classified
this intervention to be equivalent to otovent®.
the studies mainly gave information on tympanometry and composite
outcomes. autoinflation does not appear to improve puretone
audiometry thresholds. only one study reported otoscopy
findings so it is difficult to comment on this outcome. reduction
of hearing loss is an important outcome for children and parents,
but there was little evidence within the included studies to address
the impact of hearing loss. the development of a quality of
life questionnaire specifically for children with hearing loss means
that the impact of hearing loss could be assessed in future studies
(umansky 2011).
however, it appeared that autoinflation was beneficial at one and
twomonths. a large primary care study is in progress (williamson
2011) which will report on one and three-month outcomes.
adverse events do not appear to differ significantly between intervention
and control groups. data for compliance were variable.
there is some anecdotal evidence that some children, possibly in
selected groups, do get pain when undertaking autoinflation and
that continued enthusiasm for the procedure over time can wane.
blanshard 1993 comments that “significant improvementwas seen
only in those who used the treatment with a high compliance for
the duration of the study”. more details on adverse events and
compliance are needed from trials, along with evidence on how to
achieve good compliance.
limitations
the heterogeneity of trial designs, inclusion criteria, interventions,
outcome reporting and time scalesmakes it difficult to drawrobust
conclusions. another factor that affects validity is the variation in
the level of data analysis. most studies used ears as their data analysis
unit, but some used patients. to overcome this problem we
estimated thewithin-patient correlation. furthermore, some studies
reported their outcomes as continuous variables and some as
dichotomous variables. definitions of improvement varied in the
studies that reported dichotomous outcomes. the quality of the
trials was variable, in particular none of the studies used blinding
of participants or assessors and some studies used inferior methods
of randomisation.
one of the major concerns in children with glue ear is possible
developmental sequelae; none of the included papers looked
at this issue. currently there are no proven treatments that
affect speech and language development, including grommets
(browning 2010). therefore, it is not possible to say whether the
statistically significant improvements in tympanometry translate
into clinically significant benefits. this is an important consideration
when reviewing treatments for a self limiting condition
such as otitis media with effusion; there is a real possibility that
watchful waiting without interventionmay have similar long-term
outcomes to other interventions.
a u t h o r s ’ c o n c l u s i o n s
implications for practice
although this analysis does not enable us to make any firm conclusions,
the evidence appears favourable at least in the short term.
therefore, it may be reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst
awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion (ome).
one particular concern is the level of adherence: are the child and
parent willing to tolerate the inconvenience of the procedure? a
recent cochrane review has concluded that the benefits of grommets
for ome compared to watchful waiting are small and then
diminish over time (browning 2010). currently most autoinflation
interventions are instigated in secondary care.with increased
awareness and the ability to instruct and educate parents and children
in their use, this intervention would be well suited to primary
care and there is ongoing research in this area (williamson
2011). the use of a politzer device appears promising, however
due to the limited amount of information available it is difficult
to make any definitive recommendation. none of these trials provided
data on long-term sequelae such as language development.
however, the trials of ventilation tubes suggest there is little longterm
impact achieved through treatment of otitis media with effusion
(browning 2010).
implications for research
all of the studies we included were small and of limited duration
of treatment and follow-up. further studies with larger numbers
of participants and longer duration of intervention, completed in
primary care, are much needed. studies need to provided further
evidence on adverse events and treatment compliance. further
studies should also consider the impact of autoinflation on both
developmental and hearing loss outcomes in children with otitis
media with effusion. the heterogeneity suggests that the method
of autoinflation, including the device used, may be important and
thismerits further investigation. studies looking at factors predicting
which children may benefit from autoinflation would help in
identifying subgroups of children for whom autoinflation could
be recommended. future work could also include the possibility
of investigating whether autoinflation is effective in preventing
disease relapses in children prone to ome.

background
nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) aims to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

objectives
to determine the effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (nrt), including gum, transdermal patch, intranasal spray and inhaled and oral preparations, for achieving long‐term smoking cessation, compared to placebo or 'no nrt' interventions.

search methods
we searched the cochrane tobacco addiction group trials register for papers mentioning 'nrt' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. date of most recent search is july 2017.

selection criteria
randomized trials in people motivated to quit which compared nrt to placebo or to no treatment. we excluded trials that did not report cessation rates, and those with follow‐up of less than six months. we recorded adverse events from included and excluded studies that compared nrt with placebo. studies comparing different types, durations, and doses of nrt, and studies comparing nrt to other pharmacotherapies, are covered in separate reviews.

data collection and analysis
screening, data extraction and 'risk of bias' assessment followed standard cochrane methods. the main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow‐up. we used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. we calculated the risk ratio (rr) for each study. where appropriate, we performed meta‐analysis using a mantel‐haenszel fixed‐effect model.

main results
we identified 136 studies; 133 with 64,640 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of nrt and a placebo or non‐nrt control group. the majority of studies were conducted in adults and had similar numbers of men and women. people enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day at the start of the studies. we judged the evidence to be of high quality; we judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias but restricting the analysis to only those studies at low risk of bias did not significantly alter the result. the rr of abstinence for any form of nrt relative to control was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (ci) 1.49 to 1.61). the pooled rrs for each type were 1.49 (95% ci 1.40 to 1.60, 56 trials, 22,581 participants) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% ci 1.53 to 1.75, 51 trials, 25,754 participants) for nicotine patch; 1.52 (95% ci 1.32 to 1.74, 8 trials, 4439 participants) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% ci 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials, 976 participants) for nicotine inhalator; and 2.02 (95% ci 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials, 887 participants) for nicotine nasal spray. the effects were largely independent of the definition of abstinence, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the nrt was offered. adverse events from using nrt were related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. attempts to quantitatively synthesize the incidence of various adverse effects were hindered by extensive variation in reporting the nature, timing and duration of symptoms. the odds ratio (or) of chest pains or palpitations for any form of nrt relative to control was 1.88 (95% ci 1.37 to 2.57, 15 included and excluded trials, 11,074 participants). however, chest pains and palpitations were rare in both groups and serious adverse events were extremely rare.

authors' conclusions
there is high‐quality evidence that all of the licensed forms of nrt (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhalator and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. nrts increase the rate of quitting by 50% to 60%, regardless of setting, and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. the relative effectiveness of nrt appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of nrt. nrt often causes minor irritation of the site through which it is administered, and in rare cases can cause non‐ischaemic chest pain and palpitations.

can nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) help people quit smoking?
background

we reviewed the evidence about whether nrt helps people who want to quit smoking to stop smoking at six months or longer. nrt aims to reduce withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping smoking by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes. nrt is available as skin patches that deliver nicotine slowly, and chewing gum, nasal and oral sprays, inhalators, and lozenges/tablets, all of which deliver nicotine to the brain more quickly than skin patches, but less rapidly than from smoking cigarettes.

study characteristics

this review includes 136 trials of nrt, with 64,640 people in the main analysis. all studies were conducted in people who wanted to quit smoking. most studies were conducted in adults and had similar numbers of men and women. people enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day at the start of the studies. the evidence is current to july 2017. trials lasted for at least six months.

key results

we found evidence that all forms of nrt made it more likely that a person's attempt to quit smoking would succeed. the chances of stopping smoking were increased by 50% to 60%. nrt works with or without additional counselling, and does not need to be prescribed by a doctor. side effects from using nrt are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. there is no evidence that nrt increases the risk of heart attacks.

quality of evidence

the overall quality of the evidence is high, meaning that further research is very unlikely to change our conclusions.

authors' conclusions
implications for practice
all of the commercially available forms of nicotine replacement therapy (nrt), i.e. gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhalator, oral spray, lozenge and sublingual tablet, are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. they increase the rate of long‐term quitting by approximately 50% to 60%, regardless of setting. these conclusions apply to smokers who are motivated to quit. there is little evidence about the role of nrt for individuals smoking fewer than 10 to 15 cigarettes a day.

the form of delivery of nrt is unrelated to effectiveness, so other considerations such as preferences, availability, or cost might determine the form of nrt chosen.

the effectiveness of nrt, in terms of the risk ratio, appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided. intensive behavioural support is not essential for nrt to be effective. however, it should be noted that the absolute increase in success rates attributable to the use of nrt will be larger when the baseline chance of success is already raised by the provision of intensive behavioural support.

nrt causes non‐ischaemic chest pain and palpitations in a minority of users but there is no evidence of an excess of serious cardiac problems, even in people with established cardiac disease.

nrt commonly leads to minor adverse reactions which reflect irritation of the site of use of the form of nrt. these reactions are usually not severe enough to prompt discontinuation of treatment

implications for research
there is high‐quality evidence that nicotine replacement therapy increases quit rates at six months or longer in adults motivated to quit. we consider that further research is highly unlikely to change our confidence in the effect of nrt in this population.

1most studies are judged to be at unclear or high risk of bias, but restricting to only studies at low risk of bias did not significantly alter the effect.
2there are likely to be some unpublished trials with less favourable results that we were unable to identify, and a funnel plot showed some evidence of asymmetry. however, given the large number of trials in the review, this does not suggest the results would be altered significantly were smaller studies with lower rrs included.

background
nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) aims to reduce motivation to smoke and the physiological and psychomotor withdrawal symptoms often experienced during an attempt to stop smoking, and therefore increase the likelihood of remaining abstinent (west 2001). nicotine undergoes first‐pass metabolism in the liver, reducing the overall bioavailability of swallowed nicotine pills. a pill that could reliably produce high enough nicotine levels in the central nervous system would risk causing adverse gastrointestinal effects. to avoid this problem, nicotine replacement products are formulated for absorption through the oral or nasal mucosa (chewing gum, lozenges, sublingual tablets, inhalator, spray) or through the skin (transdermal patches).

nicotine patches differ from the other products in that they deliver the nicotine dose slowly and passively. they do not replace any of the behavioural activities of smoking. in contrast the other types of nrt are faster‐acting, but require more effort on the part of the user. transdermal patches are available in several different doses, and deliver between 5 mg and 52.5 mg of nicotine over a 24‐hour period, resulting in plasma levels similar to the trough levels seen in heavy smokers (fiore 1992). some brands of patch are designed to be worn for 24 hours whilst others are to be worn for 16 hours each day. nicotine gum is available in both 2 mg and 4 mg strengths, and nicotine lozenges are available in 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg strengths. nicotine nasal sprays are available in either 0.5 mg or 1 mg per spray strengths, and nicotine inhalators are available in both 10 mg and 15 mg strengths. the amount of nicotine absorbed by the user is less than the original dose. none of the available products deliver such high doses of nicotine as quickly as cigarettes. an average cigarette delivers between 1 and 3 mg of nicotine and a person who smokes 20 cigarettes per day absorbs 20 to 40 mg of nicotine each day (henningfield 2005).

the availability of nrt products on prescription or for over‐the‐counter purchase varies from country to country. table 1 summarises the products currently licensed in the united kingdom.

this review was first published over 20 years ago, in 1996, and has been regularly updated since. in previous versions, this review addressed not only the effect of nrt in comparison to placebo for helping people stop smoking, but also looked at comparisons between different forms and doses of nrt, and between nrt and different pharmacotherapies. the evidence that nrt helps some people to stop smoking is now well accepted, and many clinical guidelines recommend nrt as a first‐line treatment for people seeking pharmacological help to stop smoking (fiore 2008; italy iss 2004; le foll 2005; nice 2008; nz moh 2014; woolacott 2002; zwar 2011). we have therefore split the previous version of the review; this review now only looks at nrt versus placebo or no pharmacotherapy, with the intention that, given the stability of this comparison, this review will no longer require regular updates. studies which compare doses, delivery, forms, and schedules of nrt will now be covered in a companion review, which will continue to be regularly updated, and is in development at the time of writing. comparisons between nrt and other frontline pharmacotherapies are covered in separate cochrane reviews (cahill 2016; hughes 2014). where they meet our other inclusion criteria, studies of nrt in pregnancy are included in the main analysis of this review but are covered comprehensively in a separate cochrane review (coleman 2015), which will continue to be updated. readers specifically interested in nrt in pregnancy should refer to coleman 2015.

objectives
to determine the effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (nrt), including gum, transdermal patch, intranasal spray and inhaled and oral preparations, for achieving long‐term smoking cessation, compared to placebo or 'no nrt' interventions.

randomized controlled trials. we also include trials where allocation to treatment was by a quasi‐randomized method, but use appropriate sensitivity analysis to determine whether their inclusion alters the results.

types of participants
we include men or women who smoked and were motivated to quit, irrespective of the setting from which they were recruited or their initial level of nicotine dependence, or both. we included studies that randomized therapists, rather than smokers, to offer nrt or a control, provided that the specific aim of the study was to examine the effect of nrt on smoking cessation. we have not included trials that randomized physicians or other therapists to receive an educational intervention, which included encouraging their patients to use nrt, but have reviewed them separately (carson 2012).

types of interventions
comparisons of nrt (including chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal and oral spray, inhalators and tablets or lozenges) versus placebo or no nrt control. the terms 'inhaler' and 'inhalator' (an oral device which delivers nicotine to the buccal mucosa by sucking) are used interchangeably in the literature. we have used the term 'inhalator' throughout the rest of this review.

in some analyses we categorized the trials into groups depending on the level of additional support provided (low or high). the definition of the low‐intensity category was intended to identify a level of support that could be offered as part of the provision of routine medical care. if the duration of time spent with the smoker (including assessment for the trial) exceeded 30 minutes at the initial consultation or the number of further assessment and reinforcement visits exceeded two, we categorized the level of additional support as high. the high‐intensity category included trials where there were a large number of visits to the clinic or trial centre, but these were often brief, spread over an extended period during treatment and follow‐up, and did not include a specific counselling component. to provide a more fine‐grained analysis and to distinguish between high‐intensity group‐based support and other trials within the high‐intensity category, we have therefore specified where the support included multi‐session group‐based counselling with frequent sessions around the quit date.

previously, this review had also included studies where all arms received nrt (e.g. testing different doses, types) and studies comparing nrt with bupropion. these comparisons are now covered elsewhere; comparisons between different nrt treatments are covered in a companion review, currently under development, and comparisons between nrt and bupropion are found in hughes 2014.

types of outcome measures
the review evaluates the effects of nrt versus control on smoking cessation, rather than on withdrawal symptoms. we excluded trials that followed up participants for less than six months, except for trials amongst pregnant women, where the interval between enrolment and delivery may have been shorter (if less than six months, these were excluded from the main analysis). for each study we chose the strictest available criteria to define abstinence. for example, in studies where biochemical validation of cessation was available, we regard only those participants who met the criteria for biochemically‐confirmed abstinence as being abstinent. wherever possible we chose a measure of sustained cessation rather than point prevalence. we regard people who were lost to follow‐up as being continuing smokers.

for the 2012 update and for this current update we collected data on adverse events in both the included and excluded studies, where they were reported. we have not attempted to pool these findings, apart from one meta‐analysis of reports of palpitations, tachycardia or chest pains.
we have not included trials that evaluated the effect of nrt for individuals who were attempting to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked rather than to quit in this review. they are covered by a separate review on harm reduction approaches (lindson‐hawley 2016).

search methods for identification of studies
we searched the specialized register of the cochrane tobacco addiction group on 6 july 2017 for any reports of trials making reference to the use of nicotine replacement therapy of any type, by searching for 'nrt', or 'nicotine' near to terms for nicotine replacement products in the title, abstract or keywords. the most recent issues of the databases included in the register as searched for the current update of this review were:

cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), issue 11, 2016;

medline (via ovid) to update 20170526;

embase (via ovid) to week 201724;

psycinfo (via ovid) to update 20170529.

the search strategy for the register is given in appendix 1. for details of the searches used to create the specialized register see the tobacco addiction group module in the cochrane library. the trials register also includes trials identified by handsearching of abstract books from meetings of the society for research on nicotine and tobacco.

for earlier versions of this review we performed searches of additional databases: cancerlit, health planning and administration, social scisearch, smoking & health, and dissertation abstracts. since the searches did not produce any additional trials we did not search these databases after december 1996. during preparation of the first version of this review, we also sent letters to manufacturers of nrt preparations. since this did not result in additional data we have not repeated the exercise for subsequent updates.

data collection and analysis
selection of studies
in previous versions of this review, one review author screened records retrieved by searches, to exclude papers that were not reports of potentially relevant studies. for the last two updates, two review authors independently screened references. reports that linked to potentially relevant studies but did not report the outcomes of interest are listed along with the main study report in the 'references to studies' section. the primary reference to the study is indicated, and for most studies the first author and year used as the study identifier corresponds to the primary reference. where we extracted data for a study from more than one report we have noted this in the characteristics of included studies table.

data extraction and management
two review authors independently extracted data from the published reports and abstracts. we resolved disagreements by discussion or by referral to a third party. we made no attempt to blind these review authors either to the results of the primary studies or to which treatment participants received. we examined reports published only in non‐english language journals with the assistance of translators.

assessment of risk of bias in included studies
we assessed included studies for risks of selection bias (methods of randomized sequence generation, and allocation concealment), performance and detection bias (the presence or absence of blinding), attrition bias (levels and reporting of loss to follow‐up), and any other threats to study validity, using the cochrane 'risk of bias' tool.

measures of treatment effect
we extracted smoking cessation rates in the intervention and control groups from the reports at six or 12 months. since not all studies reported cessation rates at exactly these intervals, we allowed a window period of six weeks at each follow‐up point. for trials which also reported follow‐up for more than a year we used 12‐month outcomes in most cases. (we note length of follow‐up for each study in the characteristics of included studies table). for trials of nrt in pregnant women, we extracted smoking cessation outcomes at the closest follow‐up to end of pregnancy, and also at longest follow‐up post‐partum if reported. we only included studies in pregnant women in the main analysis if they reported results at six months or longer. following the cochrane tobacco addiction group's recommended method of data analysis, we use the risk ratio (rr) for summarizing individual trial outcomes and for estimates of pooled effect. whilst there are circumstances in which odds ratios may be preferable, there is a danger that they will be interpreted as if they are risk ratios, making the treatment effect seem larger (deeks 2005).

dealing with missing data
we treated participants who dropped out or who were lost to follow‐up after randomization as being continuing smokers. we noted in the 'risk of bias' table the proportion of participants for whom the outcome was imputed in this way, and whether there was either high or differential loss to follow‐up. the assumption that 'missing = smoking' will give conservative absolute quit rates, and will make little difference to the risk ratio unless dropout rates differ substantially between groups.

assessment of heterogeneity
to assess heterogeneity we use the i2 statistic, given by the formula [(q ‐ df)/q] x 100%, where q is the chi2 statistic and df is its degrees of freedom (higgins 2003). this describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). a value greater than 50% may be considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity. when there are many trials, as in this review, the chi2 test for heterogeneity will be unduly powerful and may identify statistically significant but clinically unimportant heterogeneity.

data synthesis
we estimated a pooled weighted average of risk ratios using a fixed‐effect mantel‐haenszel method, with 95% confidence intervals.

subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
in comparing nrt to placebo or control, we performed subgroup analysis for each form of nrt. we did additional subgroup analyses within type of nrt (gum, patch, etc.) to investigate whether the relative treatment effect differed according to the way in which smoking cessation was defined, the intensity of behavioural support, and the recruitment/treatment setting.

summary of findings table
following standard cochrane methodology, we created a 'summary of findings' table. also following standard cochrane methodology, we used the five grade considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome, and to draw conclusions about the quality of evidence within the text of the review.

the cochrane tobacco addiction group's glossary of smoking‐related terms is included in this review (appendix 2).

results
description of studies
included studies
the review includes 136 studies, 18 of which are new in this update (anthenelli 2016; berlin 2014; cummins 2016; cunningham 2016; el‐mohandes 2013; fraser 2014; gallagher 2007; graham 2017; hasan 2014; heydari 2012; heydari 2013; johns 2017; lerman 2015; nct00534404; scherphof 2014; stein 2013; tuisku 2016; ward 2013). two studies which gave different doses of nrt based on level of dependency are treated as four separate trials for the purpose of this review (shiffman 2002 (2 mg); shiffman 2002 (4 mg); shiffman 2009 (2 mg); shiffman 2009 (4 mg)). for this update, we also added longer follow‐up data for one previously included study (coleman 2012). the most recent search screened 1059 studies. along with the 18 new included studies, there were three ongoing studies, and 124 studies excluded at full‐text screening. the most common reasons for exclusion were ineligible study design and using an irrelevant comparison (nrt vs nrt rather than control). see figure 1 for study flow information relating to the most recent search presented in a prisma diagram. trials were conducted in north america (62 studies), europe (56 studies), australasia (two studies), japan (two studies), south america (two studies), iran (two studies), in multiple regions (two studies), and in india, syria, taiwan, and thailand (one study each). the median sample size was 257 but ranged from fewer than 50 to over 8000 participants. we treated each of the intervention groups in the two studies by shiffman in 2002 and 2009 separately in the meta‐analysis (shiffman 2002 (2 mg); shiffman 2002 (4 mg); shiffman 2009 (2 mg); shiffman 2009 (4 mg)), and listed brantmark 1973b, cease 1999, bolliger 2000b, wennike 2003b, bullen 2010, schnoll 2010 in the characteristics of included studies tables, despite being excluded studies, because they provided data on adverse events.

participants
participants were typically adult cigarette smokers with an average age of 40 to 50. two trials recruited adolescents (moolchan 2005; scherphof 2014). most trials had approximately similar numbers of men and women. six trials recruited only pregnant women (berlin 2014; coleman 2012; el‐mohandes 2013; oncken 2008; pollak 2007;wisborg 2000); a further four recruited only women (cooper 2005; oncken 2007; pirie 1992; prapavessis 2007). two trials recruited african‐american smokers (ahluwalia 1998; ahluwalia 2006).

trials typically recruited people who smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. although some trials included lighter smokers as well, the average number smoked was over 20 a day in most studies. ahluwalia 2006 recruited only people who smoked 10 or fewer cigarettes a day and two trials recruited only people smoking 30 or more a day (hughes 1990; hughes 2003). one trial recruited people with a history of alcohol dependence (hughes 2003), one recruited methadone‐maintained smokers (stein 2013), and one recruited people with a history of drug abuse including opiates or narcotics (heydari 2013). joseph 1996 recruited people with a history of cardiac disease, hasan 2014 recruited people admitted to hospital with a cardiac or pulmonary illness, gallagher 2007 recruited people diagnosed with psychotic‐spectrum or affective disorders resulting in long‐term mental illness and experiencing significant symptoms and functional impairment, and gourlay 1995 recruited relapsed smokers.

type and dose of nicotine replacement therapy
one hundred and thirty‐three studies contribute to the primary analysis of the efficacy of one or more types of nrt compared to a placebo or other control group not receiving any type of nrt. in this group of studies there were 56 trials of nicotine gum, 51 of transdermal nicotine patch, eight of an oral nicotine tablet or lozenge, seven offering a choice of products, four of intranasal nicotine spray, four of nicotine inhalator, two providing patch and gum (hasan 2014; stein 2013), one of oral spray (tønnesen 2012), one providing patch and inhalator (hand 2002), one providing patch and lozenge (piper 2009), and one providing patch, gum and lozenge (heydari 2013).

three studies did not contribute to the primary analysis; two were conducted in pregnant women and did not follow up participants at six months or longer (berlin 2014; el‐mohandes 2013), and one was conducted in recently relapsed smokers and is hence reported narratively in the text (gourlay 1995).

most trials comparing nicotine gum to control provided the 2 mg dose. a few provided 4 mg gum to more highly addicted smokers, and two used only the 4 mg dose (blondal 1989; puska 1979). in three trials the physician offered nicotine gum but participants did not necessarily accept or use it (ockene 1991; page 1986; russell 1983). in one trial participants self‐selected 2 mg or 4 mg doses; we treat the two groups as separate trials in the meta‐analysis (shiffman 2009 (2 mg); shiffman 2009 (4 mg)). the treatment period was typically two to three months, but ranged from three weeks to 12 months. some trials did not specify how long the gum was available. many of the trials included a variable period of dose tapering, but most encouraged participants to be gum‐free by six to 12 months.

in nicotine patch trials the usual maximum daily dose was 15 mg for a 16‐hour patch, or 21 mg for a 24‐hour patch. thirty‐two studies used a 24‐hour formulation and nine a 16‐hour product; the rest did not specify. one study offered, among other dosage options, a 52.5 mg/24‐hour patch (wittchen 2011). if studies tested more than one dose we combined all active arms in the comparison to placebo. for one study we included an arm with a lower maximum dose of 14 mg but excluded a 7 mg‐dose arm (tnsg 1991). the minimum duration of therapy ranged from three weeks (glavas 2003a, half the participants of glavas 2003b), to three months.

there are eight studies of nicotine sublingual tablets or lozenges. three used 2 mg sublingual tablets (glover 2002; tønnesen 2006; wallstrom 2000). one used a 1 mg nicotine lozenge (dautzenberg 2001). one used 2 mg or 4 mg lozenges according to dependence level based on manufacturers' instructions (piper 2009), and one used 2 mg or 4 mg based on participants' time to first cigarette of the day (ttfc); smokers whose ttfc was more than 30 minutes were randomized to 2 mg lozenges or placebo (shiffman 2002 (2 mg)), whilst smokers with a ttfc less than 30 minutes had higher‐dose 4 mg lozenges or placebo (shiffman 2002 (4 mg)). the two groups are treated in the meta‐analysis as separate trials. one trial did not report the lozenge dose (fraser 2014). there are four trials of intranasal nicotine spray (blondal 1997; hjalmarson 1994; schneider 1995; sutherland 1992), one trial of oral nicotine spray (tønnesen 2012), and four trials of nicotine inhalator (hjalmarson 1997; leischow 1996a; schneider 1996; tønnesen 1993).

as described above, seven studies tested combinations of patch and a short‐acting form of nrt (hand 2002; hasan 2014; heydari 2013; kornitzer 1995; moolchan 2005; stein 2013; tønnesen 2000). six studies offered participants a choice of products (graham 2017; johns 2017; kralikova 2009; molyneux 2003; ortega 2011; pollak 2007).

treatment setting (studies in main comparison)
twenty‐one trials in the main comparison recruited participants from primary care practices. a further two gum trials were undertaken in workplace clinics (fagerström 1984; roto 1987), and one in a university clinic (harackiewicz 1988). one trial recruited through community physicians (niaura 1994). since participants in these trials were recruited in a similar way to primary care, we have aggregated them in the subgroup analysis by setting. we also included one patch trial conducted in veterans affairs medical centers and recruiting people with cardiac diseases in the primary care category (joseph 1996). we kept four trials recruiting pregnant women in antenatal clinics in a separate category (coleman 2012; oncken 2008; piper 2009; wisborg 2000). six of the gum trials, two of the nasal spray trials, an inhalator trial, an oral spray trial, and a patch trial were carried out in specialized smoking cessation clinics to which participants had usually been referred. thirteen trials (five patch, three gum, three giving a combination of products and two giving a choice of products) were undertaken with hospital in‐ or outpatients, some of whom were recruited because they had a co‐existing smoking‐related illness. three patch trials (davidson 1998; hays 1999; sønderskov 1997) and one gum trial (split into shiffman 2009 (2 mg) and shiffman 2009 (4 mg)) were undertaken in settings intended to resemble 'over‐the‐counter' (otc) use of nrt. two trials were undertaken in drug abuse treatment centres (heydari 2013; stein 2013), one in schools (scherphof 2014), and one in a psychiatric treatment setting. the remaining trials were undertaken in participants from the community, most of whom had volunteered in response to media advertisements, but who were treated in clinical settings.

excluded studies
thirty‐four previously included studies were removed from this update, as they did not contain a nrt‐versus‐control comparison. as described in the methods, studies which contribute to comparisons between multiple forms of nrt are now found in a separate cochrane review, in development at the time of publication. previously‐included studies that compare nrt with bupropion can be found in hughes 2014. other studies that were potentially relevant but excluded are listed with reasons in the characteristics of excluded studies table. some studies contribute to the adverse events meta‐analysis but not to the main analysis (e.g. due to short follow‐up or short duration of time where comparison was nrt versus control); these are listed in the characteristics of included studies but we do not count them as included studies. some studies were excluded due to short follow‐up. some of these had as their primary outcome withdrawal symptoms rather than cessation. we exclude studies that provided nrt or placebo to people trying to cut down their smoking but not to make an immediate quit attempt, and we consider them in detail in a separate review of interventions for reduction (lindson‐hawley 2016). we excluded two trials in which nrt was provided to encourage a quit attempt but participants did not need to be planning to quit: velicer 2006 proactively recruited people by telephone, with those in one intervention group being mailed a six‐week course of nicotine patches if they were judged to be in the preparation stage or in contemplation and had more pros than cons for quitting; carpenter 2011 encouraged all participants to make a practice quit attempt, and gave the intervention group trial samples of nicotine lozenges. we excluded one trial in which callers to the nhs quitline were randomized to be offered free nrt or not to receive the offer; the control group had access to and used free nrt and other stop‐smoking medication at high levels (ferguson 2012).

risk of bias in included studies
six trials are included based only on data available from abstracts, conference presentations, or trial registries (dautzenberg 2001; johns 2017; kralikova 2009; mori 1992; nakamura 1990; nct00534404), so had limited methodological details.

overall, we judged 12 studies to be at low risk of bias (low risk of bias across all domains), 36 at high risk of bias (high risk of bias in at least one domain), and the rest at unclear risk of bias. the main findings were not sensitive to the exclusion from the meta‐analysis of trials at unclear risk, or of trials at unclear and at high risk of bias. a summary illustration of the risk of bias profile across trials is shown in figure 2.

thirty‐nine studies (29%) reported allocation procedures in sufficient detail to be rated as being at low risk for their attempts to control selection bias, by using a system of treatment allocation which could not be known or predicted until a participant is enrolled and assigned to a study condition. twenty‐four of these low‐risk trials (62%) also reported adequate sequence generation procedures. most studies either did not report how randomization was performed and allocation concealed, or reported them in insufficient detail to determine whether a satisfactory attempt to control selection bias had been made (rated as being at unclear risk). a small number of nicotine gum trials randomized to treatment according to day or week of clinic attendance (page 1986; richmond 1993; russell 1983), or to birth date (fagerström 1984), and were consequently rated as being at high risk of bias. in one study (gallagher 2007), study staff oversaw allocation and hence we rated this at high risk of bias. one study randomized by physician and there was no information about avoidance of selection bias in enrolment of smokers (nebot 1992), so we also rated this as being at high risk.

we judged 44 of the included studies to be at low risk of performance and detection bias (33%). we judged 23 (17%) to be at high risk of bias in this domain, most commonly because they were not blinded (although we judged some studies which were not double‐blind to be at low risk in this domain due to other study factors). forty‐three trials did not have a matched placebo control (24 gum trials, nine patch trials, six choice of product trials, three combination trials, and one lozenge trial). a further two had both a placebo and a non‐placebo control which we combined for the meta‐analysis control group (buchkremer 1988; russell 1983). approximately one‐third of the trials reported some measure of blinding, but we did not assess whether the integrity of the procedure was tested, in line with the consort guidelines (consort 2001). where they are done, assessments of blinding integrity should always be carried out before the clinical outcome has been determined, and the findings reported (altman 2004). mooney 2004 notes that few published trials report this information. while those that do provide some evidence that participants are likely to assess their treatment assignment correctly, it is insufficient to assess whether this is associated with differences in treatment effects. further, there may be an apparent breaking of the blinding in trials where the treatment effect is marked, for either an intended outcome or an adverse event, but participants who successfully decipher assignment may disguise their unblinding actions (altman 2004). it is also possible that those who believe that they are receiving a placebo may be more likely to stop trying to quit.

definitions of abstinence varied considerably. eighty‐nine trials (66%) reported some measure of sustained abstinence, which included continuous abstinence with not even a slip since quit day, repeated point prevalence abstinence (with or without biochemical validation) at multiple follow‐ups, or self‐reported abstinence for a prolonged period. thirty‐nine (29%) reported only point prevalence abstinence at the longest follow‐up. in six studies it was unclear exactly how abstinence was defined. in four trials, participants who smoked two or three cigarettes a week were still classified as abstinent (abelin 1989; ehrsam 1991; glavas 2003a; glavas 2003b). sensitivity analyses excluding these four trials made no difference to the overall findings. most studies reported follow‐up at least 12 months from start of treatment. fifteen gum trials, 19 patch trials, four combination trials, and one lozenge trial in the primary analysis had only six months follow‐up. we report the findings of a subgroup analysis by type of abstinence and length of follow‐up in the results section.

one hundred and seventeen (87%) of the trials used biochemical validation of self‐reported smoking cessation at longest follow‐up. the most common form of validation was measurement of carbon monoxide (co) in expired air. the 'cut‐off' level of co used to define abstinence varied from less than 4 to 11 parts per million. some of the 21 trials that did not validate all self‐report at longest follow‐up did use biochemical confirmation at earlier points, or validated some self‐reports. the main findings were not sensitive to the exclusion of 17 studies contributing to that analysis that did not attempt to validate all reported abstinence (ahluwalia 1998; buchkremer 1988; clavel‐chapelon 1992; daughton 1991; fraser 2014; graham 2017; huber 1988; nct00534404; otero 2006; page 1986; puska 1979; roto 1987; sønderskov 1997; tuisku 2016; villa 1999; wisborg 2000; wittchen 2011).

effects of interventions
see: summary of findings for the main comparison nicotine replacement therapy

any type of nrt versus placebo or no nrt control, six months or longer follow‐up
analysis 1.1 included 131 trials (133 comparisons), with over 64,000 participants (summary of findings table for the main comparison). a small number of trials contributed to more than one subgroup and two trials were treated as two separate studies in the analyses. each of the six forms of nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) significantly increased the rate of cessation compared to placebo or no nrt, as did a choice of product. the pooled risk ratio (rr) for abstinence for any form of nrt relative to control was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (ci) 1.49 to 1.61; 64,640 participants). the i2 statistic was 39%, indicating that little of the variability was attributable to between‐trial differences. the risk ratio and 95% ci for each type are tabulated below.

although the estimated effect sizes varied across the different products, confidence intervals were wide for the products with higher estimates which had small numbers of trials. one subgroup based on product type had a confidence interval which did not overlap with the pooled estimate; this group consisted of only one study in which only one participant in the control group had successfully quit smoking (heydari 2013). in the tablets/lozenges subgroup, the i2 statistic was 71%, indicating substantial statistical heterogeneity. in all trials in this subgroup, more participants quit in the intervention arm than in control, but in one study new for this update the point estimate was considerably lower (rr 1.08) (fraser 2014); this study drove the observed statistical heterogeneity.

twelve studies had lower quit rates in the treatment than in the control group at the end of follow‐up (all of which had confidence intervals which crossed the line of no effect), and in a further 73% of trials the 95% confidence interval for the rr included 1 (i.e. the trials did not detect a significant treatment effect). many of these trials had small numbers of smokers, and hence insufficient power to detect a modest treatment effect with reasonable certainty. one large trial of nicotine patches for people with cardiovascular disease had lower quit rates in the intervention than in the control group (joseph 1996); at six months the quit rates were 14% for active patch and 11% for placebo, but after 48 weeks there had been greater relapse in the active group and rates were 10% and 12% respectively.

for nicotine gum and patch we assessed whether trials that reported sustained abstinence at 12 months had different treatment effects from those that only reported a point prevalence outcome, or had shorter follow‐up (analysis 2.1; analysis 2.2). subgroup categories were sustained abstinence at 12 months or more, sustained abstinence at six months, point prevalence or unclear definition at 12 months, and point prevalence/unclear at six months. for nicotine gum 32/55 studies (56 comparisons) (58%) reported sustained 12‐month abstinence and the estimate was similar to that for all 55 studies: sustained 12‐month rr 1.43, 95% ci 1.31 to 1.56 (13,737 participants), compared with rr 1.49, 95% ci 1.40 to 1.60. the highest estimate was for the subgroup of eight studies reporting sustained abstinence at six months, where confidence intervals did not overlap: rr 2.77, 95% ci 2.14 to 3.59; 4187 participants. this seems to be attributable to one study (shiffman 2009 (2 mg); shiffman 2009 (4 mg)), and is unlikely to be of methodological or clinical significance. for nicotine patch, 21/49 studies (43%) reported sustained 12‐month abstinence, and the rr was also similar to that for all 49 studies: sustained 12‐month rr 1.52, 95% ci 1.34 to 1.74 (7622 participants), compared with rr 1.64, 95% ci 1.53 to 1.75 (25,754 participants) overall). for patch studies there was no evidence that the rrs differed significantly between subgroups.

sensitivity to intensity of behavioural support
all trials provided the same behavioural support in terms of advice, counselling, and number of follow‐up visits to the active pharmacotherapy and control groups, but different trials provided different amounts of support. we conducted subgroup analyses by intensity of support for gum and patch trials separately (analysis 3.1; analysis 3.2). there was no evidence of a significantly different effect between groups. for nicotine gum the rr was similar across all three subgroups. the control group quit rates varied as expected, averaging 3.5% with low‐intensity support, 9% with high‐intensity individual support and 11.7% with group‐based support. nicotine patch trials showed the same pattern; the rrs were similar for each subgroup and the average control group quit rates were 9.0% with low‐intensity support, 9.5% with high‐intensity individual support and 17.0% with group‐based support.

sensitivity to treatment settings
we conducted further subgroup analyses for each type of setting in which smokers were recruited or treated (with type of nrt as a subgroup beneath setting). the pooled rr for trials in community volunteers where care was provided in a medical setting was 1.62 (95% ci 1.53 to 1.72, 65 trials, 24,597 participants; analysis 4.1) and was similar to that of trials conducted in smoking clinics (rr 1.70, 95% ci 1.48 to 1.96, 12 trials, 3300 participants; analysis 4.2), trials conducted in primary care settings (rr 1.50, 95% ci 1.33 to 1.69, 24 trials, 11,974 participants; analysis 4.3), trials conducted in hospitals (rr 1.39, 95% ci 1.24 to 1.55, 13 trials, 7037 participants; analysis 4.4), and trials conducted in settings similar to 'over the counter' (otc) (rr 1.40, 95% ci 1.26 to 1.55, 9 trials, 13,163 participants; analysis 4.5). pooled results from four trials in antenatal clinics were lower than in other settings (rr 1.22, 95% ci 0.92 to 1.62, 1675 participants; analysis 4.6); this was the only setting in which results did not show a statistically significant effect of the intervention. in a meta‐regression we checked whether there was any evidence of interaction between the treatment setting and type of nrt used. the effect of nicotine gum was highest in the otc setting and this seems to be attributable to the same study that contributed heterogeneity in the abstinence subgroup analysis above (shiffman 2009 (2 mg); shiffman 2009 (4 mg)).

control group quit rates varied by setting; the lowest rates were found in otc (8.4%) and primary care (6.9%) studies, and the highest rate in smoking clinics (14.3%). falling within this range, control group rates were 9.3% in antenatal clinics, 12.5% in community volunteers where treatment was provided in a medical setting, and 12.3% in hospitals.

sensitivity to risk of bias and study methods
excluding those studies at high risk of bias did not significantly alter the point estimate for the main comparison: rr 1.61, 95% ci 1.52 to 1.69, analysis not shown. similarly, restricting the main analysis to only those 12 studies at low risk of bias across all domains led to results consistent with the main analysis: rr 1.53, 95% ci 1.37 to 1.71, analysis not shown. removing those studies without biochemical validation did not substantially influence the effect estimate: rr 1.62, 95% ci 1.55 to 1.70, analysis not shown, nor did restricting the analysis to only placebo‐controlled studies: rr 1.61, 95% ci 1.53 to 1.70, analysis not shown.

relapsed smokers
although many of the trials reported here did not specifically exclude people who had previously tried and failed to quit with nrt, one trial recruited people who had relapsed after patch and behavioural support in an earlier phase of the study but were motivated to make a second attempt (gourlay 1995). this study did not detect an effect on continuous abstinence (rr 1.25, 95% ci 0.34 to 4.60, analysis not shown), although it did detect a significant increase in 28‐day point prevalence abstinence (rr 2.49, 95% ci 1.11 to 5.57). quit rates were low in both groups with either definition of abstinence.

adverse events
we have made no systematic attempt in this review to synthesize quantitatively the incidence of the various adverse events reported with the different nrt preparations. this was because of the extensive variation in reporting of the nature, timing and duration of symptoms. in the included studies, attrition rates in nrt groups were generally similar to or lower than in control groups. appendix 3 summarises the main adverse events reported in the included and excluded studies, where the data were available.

the most common adverse events usually reported with nicotine gum include hiccoughs, gastrointestinal disturbances, jaw pain, and orodental problems (fiore 1992; palmer 1992). the only adverse event that appears to interfere with use of the patch is skin sensitivity and local skin irritation; this may affect up to 54% of patch users, but it is usually mild and rarely leads to withdrawal of patch use (fiore 1992). the major adverse events reported with the nicotine inhalator and nasal and oral sprays are related to local irritation at the site of administration (mouth and nose respectively). for example, symptoms such as throat irritation, coughing, and oral burning were reported significantly more frequently with participants allocated to the nicotine inhalator than to placebo control (schneider 1996); none of the experiences, however, were reported as severe. with the nasal spray, nasal irritation and runny nose are the most commonly reported adverse events. in the study of oral spray, hiccoughs and throat irritation were the most commonly reported adverse events (tønnesen 2012). nicotine sublingual tablets have been reported to cause hiccoughs, burning and smarting sensation in the mouth, sore throat, coughing, dry lips and mouth ulcers (wallstrom 1999). adolescents report similar adverse events to adults (bailey 2012).

a review of adverse events based on 35 trials with over 9000 participants did not find evidence of excess adverse cardiovascular events amongst those assigned to nicotine patch, and the total number of such events was low (greenland 1998). a meta‐analysis of adverse events associated with nrt included 92 rcts and 28 observational studies, and addressed a possible excess of chest pains and heart palpitations among users of nrt compared with placebo groups (mills 2010). the authors report an or of 2.06 (95% ci 1.51 to 2.82) across 12 studies. we replicated this data collection exercise and analysis where data were available (included and excluded) in this review, and detected a similar but slightly lower estimate, or 1.88 (95% ci 1.37 to 2.57; 15 studies; 11,074 participants; or rather than rr calculated for comparison; analysis 6.1). chest pains and heart palpitations were an extremely rare event, occurring at a rate of 2.5% in the nrt groups compared with 1.4% in the control groups in the 15 trials in which they were reported at all. a recent network meta‐analysis of cardiovascular events associated with smoking cessation pharmacotherapies (mills 2014), including 21 rcts comparing nrt with placebo, found statistically significant evidence that the rate of cardiovascular events with nrt was higher (rr 2.29 95% ci 1.39 to 3.82). however, when only serious adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death) were considered, the finding was not statistically significant (rr 1.95 95% ci 0.26 to 4.30). a sensitivity analysis demonstrated that lower‐level events, predominantly tachycardia and arrhythmia, accounted for the observed increased risk of cardiovascular events. chest pains and palpitations are the only clinically significant adverse events to emerge from the trials, and no evidence of significant harm has been identified.

when first licensed there was concern about the safety of nrt in smokers with cardiac disease (tnwg 1994). a trial of nicotine patch that recruited smokers aged over 45 with at least one diagnosis of cardiovascular disease found no evidence that serious adverse events were more common in smokers in the nicotine patch group (joseph 1996). events related to cardiovascular disease, such as an increase in angina severity, occurred in approximately 16% of participants, but did not differ according to whether or not they were receiving nrt. a review of safety in people with cardiovascular disease found no evidence of an increased risk of cardiac events (joseph 2003). this included data from two randomized trials with short‐term follow‐up that we excluded from the present review (tzivoni 1998; working group 1994), and a case‐control study in a population‐based sample. an analysis of 187 smokers admitted to hospital with acute coronary syndromes who received nicotine patches showed no evidence of difference in short‐ or long‐term mortality compared to a propensity‐matched sample of smokers in the same database who did not receive nrt (meine 2005). a subgroup analysis within a network meta‐analysis of cardiovascular events (mills 2014), found no increased risk of cardiovascular events with nrt amongst individuals with predisposing conditions that placed them at an increased risk of having an event (rr 1.24, 95% ci 0.77 to 2.02). another recent network meta‐analysis in people with cardiovascular disease found a slightly higher number of cardiovascular events with nrt but was not able to draw quantitative conclusions due to the low number of trials reporting adverse events and the variation in adverse event definitions used (suissa 2017).

the six trials assessing nrt use in pregnant women did not detect significant increases in serious adverse events amongst the treatment groups (berlin 2014; coleman 2012; el‐mohandes 2013; oncken 2008; pollak 2007; wisborg 2000). the effects of nrt use on neonatal health are discussed further in a separate cochrane review, which found no statistically significant differences in rates of any serious adverse events between treatment and control groups (coleman 2015). as mentioned previously, this separate review covers this topic comprehensively and will be regularly updated, so interested readers should refer to coleman 2015 for more information on the adverse events profile of nrt in pregnancy.

discussion
this review provides high‐quality evidence from trials including over 64,000 participants that offering nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) to dependent smokers who are prepared to try to quit increases their chance of success over that achieved with the same level of support but without nrt. this applies to all forms of nrt and is independent of any variations in methodology or design characteristics of trials included in the meta‐analysis. in particular we did not find evidence that the relative effect of nrt was smaller in trials with longer follow‐up beyond our six‐month minimum for inclusion. we did not compare end‐of‐treatment risk ratios with post‐treatment follow‐up, and relapse rates may be higher in active treatment participants once they stop using nrt products, but later relapse is probably unrelated to nrt use (etter 2006).

the absolute effects of nrt use will depend on the baseline quit rate, which varies in different clinical settings. studies of people attempting to quit on their own suggest that success rates after six to 12 months are 3% to 5% (hughes 2004). use of nrt might be expected to increase the rate by 2% to 3%, giving a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (nntb) of 56. if, however, the quit rate without pharmacotherapy was estimated to be 15%, either because the population had other predictors of successful quitting or received intensive behavioural support, then another 8% might be expected to quit, giving an nntb of 11.

intensity of additional support and treatment setting
we did not detect important differences in relative effect within patch or gum studies by our classification of level of support. a letter prior to the previous update of this review identified inconsistencies in the classification of low‐ and high‐intensity support in this review (walsh 2007). in response, we changed the classification of a small number of trials. this did not alter the conclusion that intensity of support does not appear to be an important moderator of nrt effect.

we also did not detect differences in relative effect according to the setting of recruitment and treatment. this subgroup analysis had considerable overlap with the support subgroup since, for example, people recruited in primary care settings typically had lower‐intensity support.

there has been continuing debate about the amount of evidence for the efficacy of nrt when obtained otc without advice or support from a healthcare professional (hughes 2001; walsh 2000; walsh 2001). the small number of placebo‐controlled trials in settings intended to replicate otc settings support the conclusion that the relative effect of nrt is similar to settings where more advice and behavioural support is provided, although quit rates in both control and intervention groups have been low. one other meta‐analysis supports the conclusion of efficacy, although it differs in its inclusion criteria (hughes 2003). in addition to the same three trials comparing nicotine patch to placebo in an otc setting (davidson 1998; hays 1999; sønderskov 1997), that review includes one study excluded here due to short follow‐up (shiffman 2002a). it also pools four trials comparing nrt provided otc to nrt provided under prescription. we exclude one trial that compared both gum and patch in these settings, but was not randomized (shiffman 2002b), and another that has not been published and for which we have been unable to obtain reliable data for inclusion (korberly 1999). the abstract reported that there were no significant differences in quit rates between users of nicotine patch who purchased it through a non‐healthcare facility, and those receiving it on prescription. it has also been suggested that the 'real world' effectiveness of nrt declines or disappears once it becomes available to purchase without requiring contact with a health professional who can offer behavioural support and guidance on appropriate use (kotz 2014; pierce 2002). a comparison of two cross‐sectional surveys in california found that quit rates for self‐selected nrt users were higher than rates for non‐users prior to otc availability, but after the switch to otc this difference disappeared (pierce 2002). in addition, a prospective cohort study found that the odds of cessation in people who had used otc nrt were lower than in people who had not used any cessation pharmacotherapy or accessed a national stop‐smoking service (or 0.69, 95% ci 0.49 to 0.94) (kotz 2014). however, these observational studies are at risk of residual confounding from unmeasured confounders, such as psychological factors, as participants self‐selected their treatment. these studies are also at risk of bias, as unaided quit attempts are less likely to be recalled than those involving nrt.

a report of a prospective cohort study questioned the effectiveness of nrt outside of the clinical trial setting after finding no difference in relapse rates between smokers trying to quit who used nrt and those who did not use nrt (alpert 2012). however, the design of this study has been criticized for not addressing initial quit rates in the two groups (stapleton 2012). furthermore, two multi‐country prospective cohort studies observed that nrt users had higher quit rates than non‐users (kasza 2012; west 2007), although in the former study this effect was limited to nrt patches, with no effect detected for oral nicotine products. again, these are observational studies and are at risk of confounding and bias.

trials in special populations
trials generally restricted recruitment to adults over the age of 18; in a small number of trials the age range was not specified. two relatively small studies in adolescents did not detect an effect of nrt on quitting at six months or longer (moolchan 2005; scherphof 2014). a separate cochrane review of tobacco cessation interventions for young people did not detect an effect of nrt, although confidence intervals were wide and did not preclude the possibility of a clinically important effect (fanshawe 2017). this is likely to remain an active area of research.

this review previously conducted a separate analysis on a subgroup of studies evaluating nrt in pregnant women. this is covered by a separate cochrane review (coleman 2015) which provides more comprehensive analysis of these studies and will be regularly updated (whereas this review is now marked as stable and will no longer be updated). therefore, readers interested in this topic should refer to (coleman 2015).

evidence for differential treatment effects in different subgroups
we made no attempt to conduct separate analyses for any subgroups of trial participants, because subgroup results are uncommon in trial reports, and where data cannot be obtained from all studies there is a risk of bias from using incomplete data. munafó 2004a has reported the results of a meta‐analysis of nicotine patch by sex. the researchers were able to include data from 11 out of 31 eligible trials (35%) and 36% of study participants. they found no evidence that the nicotine patch was more effective for men than for women, as has been hypothesized; although men showed a somewhat bigger benefit from nrt at 12 months, the difference was not significant. there was also no difference in average placebo quit rates between men and women, which has been reported in some studies. in a commentary some additional data were identified (perkins 2004), but this did not alter the conclusions (munafó 2004b). a second meta‐analysis of any type of nrt reported that in women the odds ratio for cessation declined with increasing length of follow‐up, with a non‐significant difference at 12 months (cepeda‐benito 2004). amongst men the odds ratio declined less over time and remained significant. based on a further subgroup analysis, they also reported that the decline in long‐term efficacy in women was greater in trials with low‐intensity support than with high‐intensity support, suggesting that the more intensive support helped prevent late relapse in women who had initially received nrt. although there was no evidence of bias, the review could only include a subset of published studies, so the finding should be regarded as hypothesis‐generating. all review authors agreed that trials are underpowered to identify any interaction between treatment and any type of individual characteristics, and recommended public archiving of data from studies, as well as new research specifically designed to test group‐by‐treatment interactions. at the moment there does not appear to be sufficient evidence of clinically important differences between men and women to guide treatment matching.

re‐treating relapsed smokers
whilst end‐of‐treatment success rates may be quite high, many people relapse after the end of therapy. there is suggestive evidence that repeated use of nrt in people who have relapsed after an initial course may produce further quitters, although the absolute effect is small (gourlay 1995). a subgroup analysis in another trial indicated that the relative effect of treatment with nicotine patch compared to placebo was at least as high for people who had used nrt before (jorenby 1999, reported in durcan 2002). the authors noted that there was no way to distinguish between people who had completely failed to quit using nrt and those who had been initially successful but relapsed.

limitations of the evidence base
two possible limitations to this evidence base need to be borne in mind: risk of bias in individual studies and publication bias. for the former, although we judged most of our included studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain, restricting the analysis to only those studies at low risk of bias overall did not significantly alter the pooled effect. for the latter, we tried to partly address any shortcomings from having limited our analysis to reported data by approaching investigators, where necessary, to obtain additional unpublished data or to clarify areas of uncertainty. although we took steps to minimize publication bias by writing to the manufacturers of nrt products when this review was first prepared, the response was poor and we have not repeated this exercise, although we have searched clinical trials registries. it is therefore possible that there are some unpublished trials, with less favourable results, that we have not identified despite our efforts to do so. a funnel plot (figure 4) shows some evidence of asymmetry for trials in the main comparison; however, given the large number of trials in the review, the funnel plot does not suggest that results would be altered significantly were smaller studies with lower rrs included. a meta‐analysis has also demonstrated that nicotine gum and patch studies that received pharmaceutical industry funding have on average slightly higher effect sizes than other studies after controlling for some trial characteristics (etter 2007). the practical effect of these considerations is that the magnitude of the effectiveness of nrt may be smaller than our estimates suggest.

funnel plot of comparison: 1 any type of nrt versus placebo/no nrt control, outcome: 1.1 smoking cessation at 6+ months follow up.

a possible further limitation relates to length of follow‐up. this review excludes studies with less than a six‐month follow‐up from the start of treatment; the outcome used reflects the effect of nrt after the end of active treatment. a comparison of abstinence rates during treatment and abstinence at one year suggests that the relative effect of nrt declines once active therapy stops (fagerström 2003), i.e. people who quit with the help of nrt are a little more likely to relapse after they discontinue treatment than those on placebo. the relative effect of nrt could continue to decline even after a year of follow‐up. however, a meta‐analysis comparing one‐year and long‐term outcomes in 12 nrt trials with follow‐up beyond one year suggested that the relative efficacy did not change, with similar relapse rates in the active and placebo groups, but further relapse does reduce the absolute difference in quit rates (etter 2006).

stability of the evidence base
this review was first published in 1996. despite the number of included studies more than doubling over this time, the effect estimate has remained remarkably stable, and our intention is that this publication is the final time the cochrane tobacco addiction group will review the evidence comparing nrt to placebo or to no pharmacotherapy. this is not to say that all questions about nrt have been answered; evidence is still needed comparing different forms, doses, and durations of nrt, comparing nrt to other pharmacotherapies, and testing nrt in special populations where we may reasonably hypothesize that its effectiveness differs from that in the general population (e.g. pregnant women, adolescents). further studies are also needed of electronic cigarettes containing nicotine, which some consider a form of nrt (but which we have never included in this review). however, we will cover these in separate reviews which we will continue to update regularly (cahill 2016; coleman 2015; fanshawe 2017; hartmann‐boyce 2016; hughes 2014). in summary, based on 20 years of research and 136 randomized controlled trials in over 64,000 participants, we believe the question of whether nrt helps people to quit smoking to be definitively answered. we consider that further research is highly unlikely to change our confidence in the effect of nrt, and funders and researchers should give careful thought before pursuing further studies comparing established forms of nrt with control.

background
quit and win contests were developed in the 1980s by the minnesota heart health program, and have been widely used since then
as a population-based smoking cessation intervention at local, national and international level. since 1994 an international contest has
been held every two years in as many as 80 countries (2002).
objectives
to determine whether quit and win contests can deliver higher long-term quit rates than baseline community quit rates.
to assess the impact of such programmes, we considered both the quit rates achieved by participants, and the population impact, which
takes into account the proportion of the target population entering the contest.
search strategy
we searched thecochranetobaccoaddictiongroup specializedregister,with additional searches ofmedline, embase,cinahl,
psycinfo and google scholar. search terms included competition*, quit and win, quit to win, contest*, prize*. most recent search
date was november 2007.
selection criteria
we considered randomized controlled trials, allocating individuals or communities to experimental or control conditions. we also
considered controlled studies with baseline and post-intervention measures.
data collection and analysis
data were extracted by one author and checked by the second. we contacted study authors for additional data where necessary. the
main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking for at least six months from the start of the intervention. we used the most
rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available.we decided against performing ametaanalysis,
because of the heterogeneity of the included studies, and the small number of scientifically valid studies.
main results
five studies met our inclusion criteria. three demonstrated significantly higher quit rates (8% to 20%) for the quit and win group
than for the control group at the 12-month assessment. however, the population impact measure, where available, suggests that the
effect of contests on community prevalence of smoking is small, with fewer than one in 500 smokers quitting because of the contest.
levels of deception, where they could be quantified, were high. although surveys suggest that international quit and win contests may
be effective, especially in developing countries, the lack of controlled studies precludes any firm conclusions from this review.
authors’ conclusions
quit and win contests at local and regional level appear to deliver quit rates above baseline community rates, although the population
impact of the contests seems to be relatively low. contests may be subject to levels of deception which could compromise the validity
of the intervention. international contests may prove to be an effective mechanism, particularly in developing countries, but a lack of
well-designed comparative studies precludes any firm conclusions.
p l a i n l a n g u a g e s u m m a r y
do quit and win contests encourage people to give up smoking
controlled trials suggest that quit and win contests may help some smokers to quit, but they have little effect on community smoking
rates. fewer than one smoker in 500 quits because of the contests. deception levels, where they can be measured, are often high.
international quit and win contests are often well supported, especially in developing countries, but there is no clear evidence from
trials that they are effective.
b a c k g r o u n d
the quit and win contest was first developed by the minnesota
hearthealth program (mhhp), and was run in threeminnesota
communities in the early 1980s, usingmassmedia and posters and
brochures distributed to schools, workplaces and medical facilities
(lando 1994). the prize was a holiday to disneyworld, in a raffle
for those achieving biochemically validated cessation at onemonth
post-programme. a validated quit rate of 32%was achieved at one
month, although 16% of those originally claiming to have quit
did not turn out to be smoke-free, and relapse rates at 12 months
were high. the success of the programme has been influential,
particularly in the usa, where it has been the model for many
recruitment and cessation campaigns.
the rationale for developing the quit and win model was based
on a number of assumptions:
• widespread quit attempts may benefit from a network of
support from family, friends, colleagues, and other smokers
trying to quit, and from non-smoking members of the
community;
• most smokers prefer to try and quit on their own rather
than seeking treatment;
• most quit attempts fail within the first 30 days, with less
than half surviving even for one week;
• the possibility of winning a large prize could offset the
discomforts of quitting, and could attract large numbers of
smokers to make the attempt;
• after 30 days of abstinence, the intrinsic reinforcements for
quitting are more likely to maintain abstinence.
the key features of the seminal mhhp contests, many of which
remained unchanged through their national and international versions,
were:
1. smoking status was validated prior to entry, and quitting was
biochemically validated among potential winners.
2. smokers were adults (18+), and pledged to quit for 30 days on
the target quit date.
3. a large grand prize was offered, e.g. a family holiday, plus several
smaller prizes such as bicycles or health club membership.
4. prizes were donated, or paid for by donation.
5. contests were heavily promoted through the media, through
school children, and through community organizations and worksites.
6. support was sought from health professionals and community
leaders.
7. contests were run and promoted by a local volunteer task force,
led by a single paid staff member.
quit and win competitions have subsequently been developed
and extended to national and international applications. in 1985,
the north karelia project in finland adopted it as part of a community-
based smoking cessation programme, and in the following
year the programme was offered nationally on finnish television,
reaching an estimated 46% of adult smokers, and enrolling
1.6% of the adult smoking population. among smokers who saw
at least one of the eight programmes, 7.5% made a quit attempt,
and 17% of those who made a quit attempt were abstinent at sixmonth
follow up (korhonen 1992).
in 1994, under the auspices of the world health organization,
the first international quit & win contest was conducted, with
13 countries participating. the contest has been run every two
years since then, and has grown exponentially. estimated quit rates
at one year follow up have shown great variation across different
countries, with year 2000 continuous abstinence rates reported to
range from 5% (argentina) to 44% (regional china), and an average
across all participating countries of 21% (sandstrom 2002).
the 2002 contest, the latest for which full details are readily available,
awarded a grand prize of us$10,000, and six regional prizes
of us$2500 drawn from among the national winners. this contest
attracted 700,000 participants from more than 80 countries.
the most recent international quit and win contest was held in
may 2004, and was administered by the national public health
institute in helsinki, finland (klt 2003). preliminary results for
this contest are available on the organizers’ web site (q&w2006)
while competitions and incentives may offer benefits in increased
participation rates, there are attendant risks to such a mechanism.
verification, especially in a community-based intervention,
is often a thorny issue. an australian study which interviewed a
pseudo-random sample of 300 entrants to a national stop-smoking
lottery, with amain prize of a car worth a$30,000, found that
34% of those who had entered were either never-smokers or exsmokers
at the time they signed up, even though a condition of
entry was being a verified current smoker (chapman 1994).
furthermore there are limitations to quit rates of participants as
the indicator of the success of a community-based programme
such as this. the mhhp, for example, has demonstrated that
achieved quit rates cannot be assessed in isolation from community
participation rates (lando 1990). at first sight, the intervention
community’s quit rate of 37% appeared less impressive than
the control group’s 45%. however, the participation rate for the
intervention group was 1.06%of the eligible smoking population,
compared with the control community’s 0.2%, yielding a public
health impact (participation rate x cessation rate) more than four
times greater than for the control group. as thismeasure highlights
the interdependence of participation and cessation rates in any
assessment of the success of a cessation programme, we propose
to use it in this review to evaluate the studies, where the data will
support it.
any enhanced participation rate that incentives may deliver also
has to be weighed against the stability of the long-term quit rates
that are achieved. smokers who elect to take part in a cessation
programme that offers material rewards may be differently motivated
from those who sign up to more conventional cessation
methods, and this may be reflected in differential relapse rates.
cost effectiveness
the use of rewards and incentives increases the costs of running
smoking cessations programmes, and the question must arise of
whether the outlay is justified by the benefits that the component
delivers. in other words, how many more quit attempters will join
a programme that rewards their participation, and how much, if
at all, is the quit rate enhanced by the end of programme follow

there is some evidence that community-based programmes fare
better thanworkplace ones in incentive-based recruitment (nelson
1989).the pawtuckethearthealth program(phhp) proactively
recruited smokers at the annual octoberfest between 1983 and
1987, and also at local worksites from 1985 to 1987. on a cost
effectiveness analysis, those recruited at worksites cost more per
participant than those recruited at the octoberfest. however, because
of the lower quit rates among the octoberfest recruits, the
cost per successful quitter was much lower for the worksite recruits.
any attempt to rate the efficacy of a programme needs to
be clear about the unit by which success is measured.
this review will attempt some assessment of the cost effectiveness
of programmes that incorporate reward mechanisms. the issue
of calculating and comparing programme costs, however, is problematic.
those studies which report a costing component rarely
take full account of all the direct and indirect costs involved, and
sometimes make a series of rather tenuous assumptions to support
their estimate.
o b j e c t i v e s
to assess the effects of community-based contests such as quit
and win on rates of smoking cessation.
we will address the following questions:
(i) cessation:
1.do competitions, contests and incentives affect rates of smoking
cessation or rates of relapse a) among the participants and b) among
the target population?
2.does the amount and type of incentive alter the rates of smoking
cessation?
(ii) recruitment:
1. do prizes improve recruitment to community smoking cessation
programmes?
2. does the amount and type of incentive alter the effect on recruitment
?
(iii) general:
1. what are the costs to the community of incentives and contests
?
2. how great is the risk of disbenefits arising from the use of
competitions and incentives, eg false claims, ineligible applicants
?

search methods for identification of studies
we searched the cochrane tobacco addiction group specialized
register , which includes studies identified by systematic electronic
searches of multiple databases, handsearching of specialist
journals, and ’grey’ literature (conference proceedings and unpublished
reports not normally covered by most electronic indexing
systems). in addition, we have used specifically developed strategies
to search four electronic databases, embase, medline,
cinahl and psycinfo. search terms included competition*,
contest*, prize*, quit and win, quit to win. for the 2008 update,
we also searchedgoogle scholar, using the search string [“quit and
win” smoking]. the most recent search was november 2007.
data collection and analysis
there were four stages in the review process:
stage 1: one author prescreened all search results (abstracts), for
possible inclusion or as useful background
stage 2: two authors independently assessed relevant studies for
inclusion. we resolved discrepancies by consensus. the co-ordinating
editorwas available to resolve any persistent disagreements.
we have noted reasons for the non-inclusion of studies.
stage 3:one author extracted data, and the second author checked
them. this stage included an evaluation of quality. two independent
authors assessed each study according to the presence and
quality of the randomization process, whether or not trialists and
assessors were ’blinded’, whether the analysis was appropriate to
the study design, and the description of withdrawals and dropouts.
stage 4:we decided not to performameta-analysis of the included
studies, because of their paucity, heterogenity of design and variable
quality.we have presented the results in a narrative form, and
have also tabulated themain findings of each study (summary table
1).we have also given details ofmany of the key excluded studies
of local and national quit and win contests (appendix 1), and
the series ofwho-sponsored international quit and win contests
(appendix 2). for the updated version of this review, we include
the cochrane tobacco addiction group’s glossary of tobacco-related
terms (appendix 3).

description of studies
see:characteristics of included studies;characteristics of excluded
studies.
the history of quit andwin contests, from their inception in the
minnesota heart health program (mhhp) in the early 1980s to
their global status (most recently inmay 2006), has been outlined
briefly in the background section of this review. the practicality
and relative success of the mhhp contests, with participation
rates of between 1%and 7%and follow-up abstinence rates (nonverified
self report) at six to eight months of between 21% and
24%, have encouraged other health promotion teams to run and
evaluate similar contests. other landmark local and national quit
andwin contests are summarized intable 2. later studiesmodified
some of the contest parameters; the eligible age was lowered from
18 to 16 in the 1988 swedish contest and to 17 in finland 1986,
and raised to 20 in the hunter valley intervention; contest duration
was varied in the 26 commit contests, and increased to six
weeks in the medicine hat contest. prizes could be cash (phhp,
commit, buffalo, kick it!), holidays (stanford five city 1982,
finland 1986, sweden 1988, buffalo, heartbeatwales 1990, uk
q&w1990,medicine hat, kick it!) or consumer goods (buffalo,
hunter valley 1991 [a car],q&wuk 1990,medicine hat, kick
it!).
international quit andwin, run under the auspices of theworld
health organization (who), and administered through the national
public health institute (ktl) in finland, has been held
every two years since 1994. although each participating country
runs its own national competition, to the agreed rules of the controlling
body, all national prize winners are entered for a super
prize draw (us$10,000) plus six regional prizes of us$2500 each,
with their chances of winning proportionate to the number of participants
registered in each country. the international quit and
win campaign also conducts a one-year follow-up survey. from
the 2000 contest onwards, there have also been prize draws for
supporters of successful quitters, and for health professionals involved
in the administration of the contests (sandstrom 2002).
table 3 summarizes the international contests held to date.
although much has been written about the quit and win experience,
and the concept has been widely applied, evaluations
have generally not been conducted to rigorous trial standards. we
found five studies which compared a quit and win contest with a
no-contest control group.
lando 1991a randomized 200 smokers to receive the national
cancer institute’s quit for good self-help programme, 200 to receive
the minnesota quit and win self-help materials, and 170
to act as a non-intervention control group. participants were contacted
by phone seven months later, to assess smoking status, recall
and use of the brochures, and for a rating of their usefulness.
this trial tested the efficacy and acceptability of different self-help
cessation materials, and did not include the prize element of the
full quit and win contest.
bains 2000 compared quit rates of 231 entrants for aquit andwin
contest in two counties of eastern ontario with a non-participant
control group. the controls were smokers who had not entered the
contest and who lived in the same area or in two adjacent counties.
they had been contacted by a process of random telephone calls.
the quit and win contest offered the chance to win c$1000
to those participants who abstained for the month leading up
to the draw. the winners’ smoke-free status was confirmed by a
nominated ’buddy’. all entrants received a ’quit kit’ of support
materials, including cessation advice, maintenance tips, a list of
local cessation programmes, and a fridge magnet with the number
of a health information unit line. follow up was by telephone
interview at one year.
mcalister 2000 described a quasi-experimental evaluation of a quit
and win contest held in pitkaranta (in russian karelia). following
on the success of the 1996 international quit and win contest held
in the area in may, the study team ran a continuous contest from
september 1996 tomarch 1997,with registering smokers required
to quit for at least four weeks to be eligible to win prizes. the
monthly draw was for a three-day break innorthkarelia.winners
were verified by carbon monoxide (co) monitoring. competing
smokers could also nominate a ’supporter’ (usually a spouse or
friend), who was also eligible for a prize draw. leaflets and the local
press featured role-model stories and encouragement throughout
the duration of the contest. baseline surveys were conducted in
pitkaranta and in a neighbouring comparison district (suojarvi),
and a panel of daily smokers (176 in pitkaranta and 202 in suojarvi)
were re-surveyed one year later.
hahn 2005 used a quasi-randomized study to compare 494 quit
and win contestants (56% of all registrants) in lexington-fayette
county, kentucky, with 512 randomly selected smokers from outside
the contest area. the intervention group received various
forms of quitting assistance, including weekly mailed postcards
giving gender-specific advice throughout the contest period, an
online cessation web site, a toll-free quit line and the chance to
win a grand prize of us$2500 or one of five us$500 prizes. the
contest was widely promoted through mass media, physicians,
community organizations and worksites. intervention and control
subjects were surveyed by phone at baseline and at three, six and
twelve months, with all claims of abstinence verified by urinary
cotinine and the testimony of a nominated ’buddy’. the trialists
also reported separately (hahn 2004) on a sub-group of 248 contest
participants and 290 controls defined as low-income (earning
less than us$25,000 a year).
hawk 2006 reported a campaign in erie and niagara counties
(new york state), in which participants could choose to enter a
one-month quit and win contest with a grand prize of us$1000,
or could receive a free two-week supply of nicotine patches or gum,
or could combine both options. the contest alone attracted 849
smokers, the free nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) alone 690
smokers, and the combination 230 smokers. background smoking
demographics were collected by two telephone surveys which
over-sampled smokers. publicity materials included leaflets and
newsletters targeting african american and latino residents, who
had higher rates of smoking than non-hispanic white residents. as
well as comparing abstinence rates, the study set out to determine
the characteristics of the participants in their self-selected groups,
and to identify predictors of quitting.
risk of bias in included studies
one of the five included studies (lando 1991a) was a randomized
controlled trial, but gave no details about themethods of randomization,
and was therefore rated ’b’ (unclear) for concealment of
allocation. bains 2000, mcalister 2000 and hahn 2005 were all
controlled trials, without random allocation (rated ’c’, not applicable).
hawk 2006 was an observational comparison study (rated
’c’, not applicable).
lando 1991a conducted the study in an area that for three years
had been taking part in the minnesota heart health program
(mhhp), so that there was already a heightened awareness of the
smoking cessation campaign and of quit and win contests in
particular. indeed, the participants had all taken part in baseline
screening for the mhhp, and 15% of all participants across the
three arms of the study had entered previous quit and win contests.
it is likely they would already be familiar with the quit and win
materials that some of them were being asked to test. the authors
commented that smokerswere somewhat under-represented in the
mhhp, with a smoking cohort of less than 28% compared with
the population prevalence rate of over 31%.given that 60%of the
adult population presented for the initial mhhp screening, and
that study participants were drawn only from the screened group,
the under-representation of smokers within that group meant that
less than 54% of the smoking population of the area was eligible
to participate in the trial. it is also likely that those who did would
be unusually receptive to making a quit attempt.
similarly, mcalister 2000 derived his experimental group from a
population survey linked with the 1996 international quit and
win contest held in pitkaranta (russian karelia). this was one
of nine demonstration areas, designated by theworld health organization
’an intensive campaign area’ (korhonen 2000). furthermore,
the study programme in pitkaranta received support
throughout from staff at the north karelia project, and from the
national publichealth institute of finland (organizers of international
quit and win). the comparison community for the study
was neighbouring suojarvi, which had no history of intensive antismoking
activities. although the economy and demography of the
two areas were described as ’very similar’, no direct comparisons
were reported or quantified. the authors point out that the greater
success in following up the experimental group was probably attributable
to the more intense activity and interest in smoking issues
among health workers in pitkaranta.
bains 2000 assembled an experimental cohort of almost all (231/
239) of the smokers who were participating in a 1995 quit and win
contest held in two eastern ontario counties, while the control
group was composed of smokers who had not entered the contest
but had responded positively to a random telephone dialling programme.
the two groups were therefore very differently constituted,
and displayed many baseline disparities (see the included
studies table).
hahn 2005 similarly targeted contestants in a local quit and win
contest (bluegrass 2001), but unlike bains selected the controls
from outside the contest catchment area. there were significant
differences between the groups by age, gender, education, income
and stage of change, but these were controlled for in the analyses.
attrition rates were 37% for the intervention group and 40% for
controls.
hawk 2006 did not randomize participants to the three interventions,
but explored differences between the self-selected groups.
all claims of abstinencewere by unvalidated self-report, and length
of follow up varied between four and seven months. follow up
was achieved for about 60% of sampled participants, in similar
proportions across all three groups. the telephone survey-based
reference group is likely to be subject to similar constraints to those
reported for bains 2000 above.
only one of the included studies (hahn 2005) attempted to validate
every claim of abstinence by testing for urinary cotinine, and
this study also routinely cross-checked with the testimony of a
nominated ’buddy’. two of the studies did not use biochemical
validation, but relied upon self report (lando 1991a) or ’buddy’
confirmation (bains 2000). both studies acknowledged that the
reported quit rates might therefore be somewhat inflated by false
claims. in the mcalister study, only the potential winners of the
prize draw had their claims of abstinence biochemically tested,
using expired co. hawk 2006 did not attempt any form of validation.
lando 1991a,mcalister 2000 andhawk 2006 presented quit rates
as both an intention-to-treat analysis (i.e. including all participants
randomized in the denominator, and assuming those lost to follow
up to be continuing smokers) and on a responders-only basis.
hahn 2005 reported quit rates in an intention-to-treat analysis as
both 7-day point prevalence and continuous abstinence measures,
and distinguished throughout between self-reported and biochemically
validated rates. bains 2000 reported quit rates based only
on those who gave follow-up information at one year, but with a
follow-up rate of 86.5% of the intervention group and 84.4% of
the controls, this is unlikely to have significantly compromise the
final comparisons.
effects of interventions
hahn,mcalister and bains all found significant differences in the
one-year quit rates between the experimental and control participants.
hahn 2005 reported a 7.3% (36/494) biochemically validated
quit rate at 12 months for the quit and win group, compared with
0.6% (3/512) for the controls (p < 0.0001). this contrasts with
12-month self-reported abstinence rates of 24.6% and 8.1% respectively.
only 59% of self-reported quitters who agreed to provide
a urine sample actually did so. logistic regression analysis,
controlling for baseline differences in stage of change, age, education
and marital status, showed that at 12 months follow up
the intervention group had more than five times the odds of confirmed
abstinence than the control group (or 5.3, 95% ci 2.3
to 12.5). those who completed the study were significantly older,
more likely to bemarried, and to have higher educational level and
income than those who dropped out. women, ethnic minorities
and those with an income below us$25,000 were as likely to quit
as men, whites, and those with a higher income.
mcalister 2000 reported a 7% (13/176) quit rate in pitkaranta
comparedwith 0.5%(1/202; p < 0.05) in the comparison community
of suojarvi, for smokerswho had abstained for longer than the
previous month. the corresponding point prevalence quit rates
were 14% (26/176) and 1% (2/202; p < 0.01). this result should
be viewed with some caution, for the reasons given earlier, and because
follow-up rates were relatively low and disparate; the study
team re-contacted 58% of the experimental panel at one year, but
only 42% of the controls.
bains 2000 reported a 1% quit rate among the random survey
control group (4/385 on an intention-to-treat basis, or 4/325 on
a responders-only basis), and a 19.5% quit rate among the experimental
group, based on 200 responders. an intention-to-treat
analysis would yield a quit rate of 16.9%, still substantially higher
than in the control group. the authors urge caution, however, in
interpreting these results, since the two groups were profoundly
different. the experimental group, comprising contestants in a local
quit and win contest, were on average younger, heavier smokers,
better educated and more likely to be employed. the process
of random telephoning to assemble a control group tended
to identify people more likely to be at home (older, not working,
lower socio-economic status), leading to “systematic differences”
between smokers who enter quit smoking contests and smokers
who don’t. the study found no baseline demographic features to
be significantly predictive of cessation at one year.
lando 1991a found no significant differences between the three
arms of the study. the quit and win group achieved a point
prevalence quit rate of 8.9% (17/191), the quit for good group
10.2% (20/197), and the no-materials control group 10.8% (17/
157). the equivalent intention-to-treat quit rates were 8.5%, 10%
and 10% respectively. however, the authors point to several factors
that affect interpretation of these results: follow up that was
intended to evaluate at seven months was in fact conducted only
three or four months after the distribution of the brochures, and
may not have represented the stable long-term quit rates. more
significantly, nearly half of the quitters at follow up (24/53 [sic])
had stopped smoking before thematerialswere sent out.quit rates
for those who only stopped after the receipt of the self-help materials
are reduced to 6.0% (11/184) for quit and win, 5.3% (10/
189) for quit for good, and 5.4% (8/148) for the control group.
the equivalent intention-to-treat rates for these groups would be
5.5%, 5% and 4.7% respectively. the authors speculate that the
baseline phone call may have prompted the spontaneous quit attempts,
but it should also be remembered that the trial was conducted
in a region already very committed and accustomed to the
mhhp, among a group of people who had already signed up to
that programme and been screened for it. this could well have
contributed to the awareness and receptivity of all participants in
the study, and is further reflected in the unusually high quit rate
achieved by the control group, who received no self-help assistance
at all.
hawk 2006 detected no significant differences between the quit
rates of any of the three groups, whether on a per protocol or an
intention-to-treat analysis. responders-only quit rates were 29%
for the quit and win contestants, 26%for thenrt users and 27%
for the combination group. ethnic minority smokers were overrepresented
across the groups, suggesting that targeted recruitment
had been effective. the study demonstrated an unexpected interaction
between intervention and age, with younger people in the
combination group achieving higher abstinence rates than their
counterparts in the single intervention groups(33%, versusq&w
25%and nrt 19%), while older participants in the combination
group achieved lower abstinence rates than those in the contest
and nrt groups (20%, versus q&w 33% and nrt 31%).
population impact
a useful measure of the efficacy of quit and win initiatives within
the community is the population impact of a given intervention.
this is calculated by multiplying the achieved quit rate by the
percentage of smokers who participated in the contest, and affords
a comparator between different events in different communities.
our tabulation of key quit and win studies (table 2) includes this
measure where it was reported or could be calculated.
bains 2000 reports a population impact of 0.17%, based on a
participation rate of 0.83% of adult smokers. in practical terms,
and assuming there is a causal link between entering the contest
and quitting, this would mean that one in every 588 smokers
within the community might be expected to achieve long-term
abstinence because of the quit and win contest.
a similar calculation for the mcalister 2000 study gives a population
impact of 0.21%, based on the reported participation rate
of about 3% of smokers in the pitkaranta contest; in other words,
about one in every 500 smokers in the community might be expected
to achieve abstinence through taking part in the contest.
neitherhahn 2005 nor hawk 2006 reported the smoking prevalence
rates in the target communities, so a population impactmeasure
could not be estimated for these studies.
it is not appropriate to attempt to derive a population impact
figure from the lando study, partly because the experimental design
precludes it, but also because in this trial the quit and win
group were not offered the defining component of a quit and win
contest, namely a tangible incentive for abstinence. the selective
components and the distributive effects of randomization mean
that a population impact cannot be estimated for this trial.
d i s c u s s i o n
it is difficult to draw firmconclusions fromthe few controlled quit
and win studies that have been reported so far. the five included
studies in this review reported on relatively small numbers of participants.
they were all conducted within communities that had
current or prior experience of quit and win contests. for the most
part the control groups or communities were either not attuned
to smoking as a public health priority (mcalister 2000), or were
probably too different to support ameaningful comparison (bains
2000). the single randomized trial (lando 1991a) excluded the
’win’ component, and concentrated on the efficacy of the selfhelpmaterials.
it is therefore not possible to drawmeaningful conclusions
from this trial about the effectiveness of the fully functional
contest. the new york state study (hawk 2006), while
demonstrating benefits for the three intervention groups, lacked a
true control group, and warned against over-interpretation of its
findings. probably the most promising results have emerged from
hahn 2005, in which biochemically validated outcomes and controlling
for baseline differences still demonstrated a benefit of the
quit and win contest. their finding that women and low-income
smokers, both groups less likely to succeed in quitting, were as
likely to achieve abstinence as men and higher-income registrants,
shows particular promise.
bains 1998, in her review of 17 population-based incentives trials,
estimates amean cessation rate of 23%among all participants in at
one year, and a 1% quit rate among all smokers in the target communities.
such a measure, while interesting, makes no allowance
for heterogeneity among populations and trial designs. an alternative
measure of effect is the population impact (cessation rate
x percentage of smokers enrolled), where this is reported or can
be calculated. the results section of our review gives the population
impact at longest follow up for bains 2000 and mcalister
2000, and table 2 gives this measure where it is reported or can be
estimated for the landmark excluded studies. population impact
approximates the number of smokers who quit because of participating
in the intervention (in this case, a quit and win contest),
assuming that there is a causal link between the two. in our review,
population impact ranges from 0.07% at one year in heartbeatwales
(roberts 1993), which is roughly equal to one in every
1400 smokers in the community, to 0.61% in bloomington at 3-
4 months (lando 1991b), or roughly one in 160 smokers.
design and evaluation
population-based interventions are less amenable to a randomized
controlled trial (rct) design than worksite- or clinically-based
ones. the organizers of the swedish 1988 and 1989quit andwin
competitions preferred amodified time-series design for their evaluation
(tillgren 1995), and bains 1998 discusses the prohibitive
logistics of setting up a community-based rct to avoid selection
bias. in the same vein, chapman 1993 has pointed out that in
developed countries such as australia (and the same would hold
true for many regions in the usa and europe) the ubiquity of tobacco
control laws, regulations, taxes, mass-reach campaigns and
a high level of media discussion have made controlled trials virtually
impossible to conduct, since comparable communities can
not be isolated from contaminating influences. the discussion of
the included studies in this review illustrates those difficulties.
participants and non-participants
smokerswho enter a quit andwin contest are usually a self-selected
group, and may share different characteristics from smokers who
choose not to join the contest. from the included and excluded
studies in this review, people who register for a contest tend to
be predominantly female (altman 1987; bains 2000; cummings
1990;hahn 2005;hea 1991; korhonen 1992;o’connor 2006;
roberts 1993;tillgren 1992), younger (altman 1987;bains 2000;
cummings 1990;hahn 2005;hawk 2006;hea1991;korhonen
1999; o’connor 2006), better educated (bains 2000; cummings
1990; hahn 2005; hawk 2006; korhonen 1999; lando 1995a),
smoking more cigarettes per day (bains 2000; cummings 1990;
hawk 2006; korhonen 1999; o’connor 2006), in the contemplation
or preparation stage of change (hahn 2005; lando 1991b;
resnicow 1997; roberts 1993),and to have made more previous
quit attempts than those smokers who do not enter the contest
(korhonen 1999). the picture for socio-economic status is less
consistent, with bains 2000 and hea 1991 finding a preponderance
of professional and semi-professional participants (socioeconomic
class abc1) signing up for the contest, while tillgren
1992 and lando 1991b report a higher proportion of manual or
blue-collar workers.
interestingly, the bluegrass trial found only a weak link between
signing up for the contest and the desire to win the cash prize, with
81% of low-income participants (less than us$25,000 a year) indicating
that they would have entered the contest anyway (hahn
2004).o’connor 2006 reported that fewer than one-third of participants
in the new york contests claimed to be financially motivated
to enter, with the contest that offered more than twice the
value in prize money achieving no greater reach or efficacy than
the other ten contests.
quitters and non-quitters
there also appear to be clear differences among the participants
between those who succeeded in quitting and those who didn’t.
while several studies found no correlation between gender and
quitting success, higher quit rates amongmen than among women
were reported by korhonen 1992 (16% versus 11%) and tillgren
1992 (30% versus 25%). tillgren also found that male quitters
tended to be younger (35 to 54) than female quitters (55 to 85).
successful quitters tended to be older (hea 1991; leinweber
1994; roberts 1993), of higher socio-economic status (lefebvre
1990; tillgren 1992), to smoke more heavily (chapman 1993;
roberts 1993), and to have made no or fewer previous quit attempts
than unsuccessful contestants (chapman 1993; leinweber
1994; roberts 1993; tillgren 1992). two factors emerged across
several studies as consistent predictors of successful quitting: one
was the assistance of supportive others, whether a spouse or cohabiting
partner (hawk 2006; lefebvre 1990; tillgren 1992),
non-smokers living with the contestant (leinweber 1994), family
and friends (lando 1991a; roberts 1993) or workmates (lefebvre
1990).unfortunatelyhahn 2005, themost rigorously designed of
the included studies, did not measure the efficacy of the supportiveness
of the designated ’buddy’, and reported this as a limitation
of its own analysis (hahn 2004). the second mechanism predictive
of success was abrupt or ’cold turkey’ cessation rather than tapering,
reducing smoking or switching brands (hahn 2004; king
1987; lando 1991b; roberts 1993).
publicity and recruitment
one reason for variation in the mix of smokers attracted to a contest
may derive in part from the methods used to promote it. all
the included quit and win contests used some form of mass media
promotion, including newspapers, radio and television, either
with paid or public service advertisements and articles.most of the
campaigns used posters and fliers, distributed through pharmacies,
hospitals, dentists’ and doctors’ offices. schools, churches, worksites,
libraries, sports events and shopping centres were routinely
leafleted. the quit and win/free nrt campaign (hawk 2006)
targeted those ethnic minority groups with higher rates of smoking,
producing an eight-page newsletter featuring african american
and latino testimonies, in english and spanish versions. some
contest organizers recruited proactively at festivals and health fairs
(hahn 2004; hahn 2005).
several studies have suggested that the preponderance of younger,
employed, better educated smokers in quit and win contests may
reflect the channels through which entries are recruited. among
the included studies, bains 2000 has commented that the control
group who did not enter the quit and win contest tended to be
older, of lower socio-economic status, and unemployed or retired.
this group is especially vulnerable to chronic illness andmortality,
and to smoking-related diseases in particular. hahn 2005, like
bains, used quit and win contestants as the experimental group
and assembled the control group by random digit dialling (but
outside the intervention community), and found similar baseline
differences, with the control subjects being significantly older (43
versus 38) and with fewer college graduates (37% versus 65%).
of the studies considered in this review, only one included and
two excluded studies reported that they had reached significant
numbers of blue-collar and lower-paid workers. hahn 2004 reported
separately on a cohort of low-income smokers (earning under
us$25,000 a year), long identified as at higher risk of smoking-
related diseases and largely untouched by most tobacco cessation
approaches (kiefe 2001). despite the intervention group
achieving significantly higher long-term quit rates than the control
group, the authors caution against over-interpretation of the
results. they point out that the quit and win contestants were
younger, more educated, more likely to be in the preparation or
action stage of change and more likely to be unmarried than the
control group.
deception
although biochemical validation of claims of abstinence is the
gold standard for controlled trials (benowitz 2002), in practice
most population-based contests, with limited resources and many
participants, only test the prize winners to verify their smoking
status. most study quit rates are therefore based on self-reported
abstinence claims, and should be treated with some caution. the
only study which attempted biochemical validation of all claims of
abstinencewashahn 2005; this study also contrasted self-reported
quit rates with confirmed ones, demonstrating more than a threefold
difference in twelve month quit rates for the intervention
group between self-reported (24.6%) and confirmed (7.3%) rates
of cessation. the control group disparity was more than thirteenfold
(8.1%versus 0.6%). blanket biochemical verification at entry
would clearly be impractical and prohibitively expensive.whether
some kind of affirmation procedure built into the contest protocol
would reduce levels of deception is questionable. it continues to
be a programme design issue that contest organizers have to live
with, and need to take account of in their analyses.
international quit and win
we have not been able to identify any controlled trials of international
quit and win contests, and it seems unlikely in practice that
any such studies can be implemented. there are, however, several
reports and population-based studies of six international contests
run so far (1994 to 2004), which merit consideration in the discussion
section of this review. we have no detailed information
about the findings of the 2006 contest.
the history of international quit and win contests is discussed
in the background section of this review, and descriptive features
of the contests held to date are summarized in table 3. briefly,
the contests have been run every two years within the who’s
cindi framework (countrywide integrated noncommunicable
diseases intervention) since 1994 by the national public health
institute (ktl) in finland, which supports national organizing
committees within the participating countries. information and
contest entry is increasingly accessible on the world wide web
(www.quitandwin.org). participants must be aged 18 or over, and
have been daily smokers for at least one year.winners’ smoking status
is verified by a urine sample. from1998 the contests have been
supported jointly by the european union and the finnish centre
for health promotion, and have also been sponsored by major
pharmaceutical companies. the 1998 contest, in which 200,000
people from 48 countries participated, recruited 0.1 promille (1
in 10,000) of all smokers worldwide. the first competition in
1994 involved 13 european countries, and the event has grown
steadily until 2002 when it encompassed 80 participating countries
worldwide (700,000 people). the most recent competition,
held inmay 2004, reached 73 countries (688,000 people) through
80 campaigns. it remains to be seen whether or not the reach of
the contest is beginning to plateau out. from 2000, the main cessation
contest has been augmented by a supporters’ contest and
by a health professionals’ contest.
although there are great differences in quit rates between participating
countries, the organizers report that on average about
20% of contest participants are estimated to have remained continuously
abstinent at one-year follow up (sandstrom 2002). because
of the considerable variation in participation and abstinence
rates between participating countries, it was recognized
early on that some global measure was needed to afford comparability.
the population impact (korhonen 2000), or public
health impact (sandstrom 2001), calculated as participation rate
x conservative estimate of successful quitters, was proposed as
the most useful measure. one significant finding of korhonen’s
comparison of eight campaign sites in 1996 is that, despite heterogeneous
one-year quit rates ranging from 11.9% (finland) to
34.6% (pitkaranta), the population impact measures suggested
that higher participation rates were not correlated with lower abstinence
rates. in other words, more smokers did not mean less
highly motivated smokers. given that across a number of contests
the average cessation rate stayed relatively stable at between 10 and
30% (sandstrom 2002), and given that the rates do not appear
to be diluted by increased participation, the potential of quit and
win contests would seem to depend primarily upon enhancing
participation rates (lavack 2007).
the increasing heterogeneity of the participant countries makes
comparisons and meaningful conclusions very problematic. a report
of the 1996 contests in regional china and in finland, for
example, attributes the spectacularly higher chinese one-year quit
rate (41.7%versus 18.2%) to a number of cultural differences, including
a higher prevalence of less addicted or ’easy’ quitters, radically
different prevalence rates by gender, different sorts of prizes
(money versus a trip to the olympics), and even pharmacologically
different nicotine patches in the two countries (sun 2000).
similarly, a report of the 1998 iranian contest (pourshams 2000)
speculated that the unusually high quit rate of 39.8% had been
contaminated by a mixture of false claims of abstinence (30% of
the biological samples indicating current smoking) and a high proportion
of nonsmokers entering the contest.the cautious estimate
(assuming non-responders to be smokers) of validated cessation
was adjusted to 27.8%, with the high level of success attributed to
the relative lack of other quitting facilities, iran’s lower economic
status compared with european countries, and the possibly higher
participation rate of nonsmokers eager to win a prize. a recent
conference summary of the subsequent quit andwin campaigns
in iran has reported one-year quit rates of 65.5% (2000), 58%
(2002) and 68% (2004) (sarrafzadegan 2006).
the official report for the 2000 contest drew attention to the generally
higher quit and win cessation rates in developing countries,
compared with the developed world (sandstrom 2002). not only
are these contests considered to be cost-effective, with two-thirds
of them costing less than us$10,000 to run, but they have also
raised awareness of tobacco control issues, often by linking with
other smoking control programmes such as world no tobacco
day (kenya), and by influencing anti-tobacco legislation (nigeria,
brazil).this comes at a time of aggressivemarketing by the tobacco
industry in the developing regions, and indeed british american
tobacco (bat) ran a counter-campaign to coincide with quit
and win in kenya, as did bat and philip morris in romanian
schools.
as with regional and national contests, the quitting aid that has
consistently been cited in international quit andwin evaluations
as the most important and effective is support from friends and
family. the addition in 2000 of the supporters’ contest to the
basic structure of the quit and win campaign is a response to that
finding, and an attempt to consolidate its effectiveness.
cost effectiveness
only one of the five included studies in this review reported any
information about the cost effectiveness of their intervention.
hawk 2006 estimated that the cost per quitter for the quit and
win contestantswasus$130, and for the freenrtusersus$179,
but pointed out that such comparisons may be misleading, since
the two groups were self-selected and demographically different
from each other.

implications for practice
the conclusions and implications for practice and research are
based only upon the included studies in this review.
1. no randomized controlled trials have shown that quit and win
contests increase the number of people giving up smoking. however,
controlled studies suggest that there is an increase in quit
rates among participants compared to control populations. possible
biases in these results include differences between control and
intervention populations and accuracy of outcome ascertainment
because of deception rates.
2. using estimates from controlled trials, calculations of population
impact suggest that fewer than one in 500 smokers in com-
munities targeted by quit and win contests quit as a result of the
contest.
3. enhancing participation rates may be important for delivering
improved absolute numbers of quitters through quit and win contests.
4. the two elements which appear to lead to success in a quit
andwin contest are supportive others (family, friends,workmates),
and abrupt quitting (’cold turkey’) rather than reducing or brand
switching.
5. there are insufficient data to draw conclusions about cost effectiveness
of quit and win contests
implications for research
there are considerable difficulties in designing controlled studies
of quit and win contests.

abstract
objective
to evaluate the effect of different types of adjunctive support to stop smoking for individuals contacting telephone “quitlines,” including call‐back counselling, different counselling techniques and provision of self help materials.

data sources
this review includes quitline studies identified as part of cochrane reviews of telephone counselling and self help materials for smoking cessation. we updated the searches for this review.

study selection
we included studies that were randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of any quitline or related service with follow‐up of at least six months.

data extraction
data were extracted by one author and checked by a second. the cessation outcome was numbers quit at longest follow‐up taking the strictest definition of abstinence available, and assuming participants lost to follow‐up continued to smoke.

data synthesis
we identified 14 relevant studies. eight studies (18 500 participants) comparing multiple call‐backs to a single contact increased quitting in the intervention group (mantel‐haenszel fixed effect odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 1.57). two unpublished studies without sufficient data to include in the meta‐analysis also reported positive effects. three call‐back trials compared two schedules of multiple calls. two found a significant dose‐response effect and one did not detect a difference. we did not find consistent differences in comparisons between counselling approaches (two trials) or between different types of self help materials supplied following quitline contact (three trials).

conclusions
multiple call‐back counselling improves long term cessation for smokers who contact quitline services. offering more calls may improve success rates. we failed to detect an effect of the type of counselling or the type of self help materials supplied as adjuncts to quitline counselling.

telephone quitlines are an established means of providing support for smoking cessation.1 we aim here to evaluate the effect of different interventions for smokers who call quitlines seeking help to quit smoking. the support offered by quitlines may include mailed materials, recorded messages, counselling at the time of the call, call‐back from a counsellor, access to pharmacotherapy and combinations of these elements. in this review we principally consider the effect of providing call‐back counselling after an initial call. we also consider the evidence that there is a difference by method of counselling and examine the effect of adjunctive self help materials (excluding evaluations of the effect of personally tailored materials).

methods
data sources
this paper draws on the results of a recently updated cochrane review analysing 48 trials of telephone counselling used in a variety of settings including quitlines.2 in january 2006 we searched the cochrane tobacco addiction group specialised register using the free text terms “telephone*”, “quitline*” or “helpline*” or the keywords “telephone counselling” or “hotlines” or “telephone”. the register incorporates the results of systematic searches for trials on tobacco addiction in medline, embase, psycinfo and science citation index electronic databases and includes trials reported in conference abstracts including society for research on nicotine and tobacco meetings. we updated the search in november 2006 and identified one new study that recruited quitline callers.3 we excluded this because it only compared different types of individually tailored materials. we contacted the principal investigators of previously identified unpublished trials to see if further data were available. some studies identified by this search strategy compare the effect of different types of self help materials for callers to quitlines. these are covered by the cochrane review of self help materials so the data are drawn from this source.4

study selection
we included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials that enrolled smokers or recent quitters who called a telephone service that offered quitting support. the intervention was one or more sessions of call‐back cessation counselling (also called proactive or counsellor initiated counselling); or comparison of a different counselling protocol or of different forms of self help materials at the initial call. control conditions included mailed self help materials; advice, counselling or recorded messages during the initial call. we excluded trials or arms of trials that only evaluated the use of individually tailored self help materials. the outcome was smoking status at least six months after the initial contact.

data extraction
for both the cochrane reviews one author (ls) identified potentially relevant studies and extracted data. a second author checked inclusion criteria and data.

data synthesis
the primary outcome was the proportion of quitters at the longest follow up, using the strictest measure of abstinence reported. we preferred sustained and biochemically validated abstinence to point prevalence and/or self reported quitting. we used as the denominator the number randomised, assuming participants lost to follow up continued to smoke.

we grouped studies to address three central questions:

call‐back counselling: does multiple contact intervention increase the proportion of quitters compared to a single telephone contact control?

counselling method: is there a difference in proportion of quitters between different counselling protocols at a single contact?

self help materials: is there a difference in proportion of quitters with different types including population targeted materials.

we summarise the main characteristics and results of the studies in each of these three groups. for the first group, we assessed heterogeneity using the i2 statistic5 and estimated a pooled effect size for quitting at the longest follow‐up, using a mantel‐haenszel fixed effect method to derive an odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals.6 the other two groups included a smaller number of trials and we therefore did not calculate a pooled estimate.

results
the review includes 14 trials that recruited callers to quitlines. ten trials evaluated call‐back counselling.7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 two trials evaluated the counselling method at the initial call.17,18 three trials compared adjunctive self help materials at the initial call,13,19,20 one of which13 also contributed to the first group. two of the included studies in the call‐back group12,16 were identified for the cochrane review2 from conference reports but not formally included because results were not available in enough detail to extract data for meta‐analysis. for the same reason they do not contribute to the meta‐analysis in this paper but we describe their results separately. full results of the first of these are published in this supplement.21

call‐back counselling
ten studies evaluated counsellor initiated calls in the following days or weeks after the initial contact. two studies by borland and colleagues used the quitline services in victoria.7,8 three were conducted by zhu and colleagues in the setting of the california smokers' helpline,14,15,16 and two were conducted by the american cancer society (acs).11,12 the remaining studies involved quitlines in the united kingdom ,9 canada13 and oregon, united states.10

the number of calls constituting the intervention varied, and four trials had multiple intervention arms comparing different schedules of calls.10,12,13,14 in one california study15 the control group could call back for counselling—which 32% received, while only 73% of the intervention group received their intended intervention. the main characteristics of the intervention and control conditions of all call‐back trials are shown in table 1​1.

*in relevant arms.

†not included in meta‐analysis.

the control group quit rates varied across trials, reflecting differences that are likely to include the motivation and other characteristics of the callers, the amount of support provided at the initial call, the length of follow‐up, loss to follow‐up and definition of abstinence. as an indication of this range the quit rates in the control arms ranged from 1% sustained at 12 months (2% if losses to follow‐up excluded) for a pamphlet alone in canada13 to 12% for 30 day abstinence at 12 months, or 17% when combined with an offer of free nicotine patch, in oregon.10 this trial also reported the highest quit rates in an intervention arm; 21% for intensive counselling and the offer of nrt.

the pooled data from 18 500 participants in the eight trials with sufficient data to pool7,8,9,10,11,13,14,15 show a benefit from the call‐back counselling compared to the control condition (or 1.41, 95% ci 1.27 to 1.57) (fig 1​1).). the odds ratios for individual trials ranged from 1.09 to 3.4.13 there was some evidence of heterogeneity (i2 58.4%5) but using a random effects analysis did not materially change the size or significance of the estimate. five of the individual trials reported significant positive effects. limiting the intervention condition to the less intensive arm in the three studies testing multiple interventions10,13,14 marginally reduced the estimate (or 1.39, 95% ci 1.24 to 1.56). of the two trials with small and non‐significant odds ratios, the poor outcome in one was suggested to be because of concomitant use of tailored materials that could give conflicting advice.8 in the other trial, within the uk quitline,9 all participants received counselling during their initial call as well as the offer of a quitting pack. six‐month sustained abstinence rates at 12 months were around 9% in both groups. the lack of additional effect was attributed to the absence of an extended pre‐quit session, and the unstructured nature of the follow‐up sessions. the authors commented that “non‐structured counselling, led by the client, can result in being overly empathetic regarding the difficulty of changing, with insufficient emphasis on reducing ambivalence and preparation for change.”

effect of number of intended calls
three of the call‐back trials in the meta‐analysis10,13,14 also compared different schedules and numbers of call‐backs allowing a test of a dose‐response effect. in the canadian study no difference was reported between two and six additional calls following an initial 50 minute session.13 in one california study14 six calls increased rates by a further 2 percentage points over a single pre‐quit call‐back, a marginally significant effect, (or 1.36, 95% ci 1.01 to 1.83). in the oregon study,10 an initial extended counselling call with the offer of four further calls increased quit rates by about 1 percentage point over an extended counselling call and a brief reminder call, which again was just significant (or 1.22, 95% ci 1.01 to 1.49). the average number of contacts increased from under two to fewer than three but this was reported to increase satisfaction with the service and the number of calls.

call‐back counselling trials not in the meta‐analysis
two studies were not included in the meta‐analysis. one was unpublished and had insufficient data.16 the other was only published in full in this special issue.21 it evaluated different numbers and durations of counselling sessions. there was a significant overall effect comparing all counselled groups to mailed self help materials only (11% vs 8% “intent to treat” quit; p<0.005). differences in quit rates between counselling formats were relatively small but the number of sessions seemed more important than the total time. quit rates ranged from 8.5% for three standard length sessions without booster to 14.1% for five brief sessions plus two boosters.

in the other unpublished call‐back study not in the meta‐analysis,16 a seven call protocol significantly increased quit rates over self help materials alone for pregnant smokers calling the california smokers' helpline. at the third trimester evaluation, 21.4% of the counselling group versus 12.4% of the self help group quit for 30 days (p = <0.001). this contrasts with a recently published study of proactive multisession counselling compared to brief counselling for pregnant smokers referred for telephone counselling by providers.22 that study failed to detect an overall benefit, although there was some evidence of efficacy among subgroups. differences between help‐seeking pregnant smokers and those recruited through the healthcare system may contribute to the different findings.

comparison of counselling methods
two studies compared different counselling interventions provided during the initial call (see table 2​2).). neither of these detected a difference between the approaches, with overall quit rates of about 19%18 and 10%17 at 6 months. in the second trial17 an opportunistic 12 month follow‐up of a subgroup of participants found a higher quit rate in the population targeted condition.

comparison of different forms of adjunctive self help materials
for quitlines that do not routinely offer call‐back counselling, support might be enhanced by providing self help materials. standard self help materials have some effect in a range of settings although the effect size is small.4 three trials have compared self help materials in quitline settings (see table 3​3).

cummings and colleagues19 compared four self help booklets using either a day by day plan for quitting or a less structured menu format, and a “cold turkey” sudden quit versus gradual reduction approach. all booklets covered preparation for quitting, making a commitment, coping with urges and maintenance. a shorter control booklet only covered the hazards of smoking and did not give instructions for quitting. no significant differences in quit rates were detected between any of the experimental booklets or the control. about 6% reported at least 5 months' abstinence at the 6 month follow‐up and 16%–19% had been quit for at least a week. although reported use of the books was high, undertaking specific recommended activities was not a predictor of success. the best predictor was participants' initial assessment of their likelihood of success. another trial20 compared three sets of materials for women smokers with young children who called the us cancer information service hotline. again there was no significant difference between the guides, with 12.5% of those followed up reporting at least a week of abstinence at 6‐month follow‐up. one trial evaluating call‐back counselling included a factorial test of different written materials.13 it detected no difference between a 44 page booklet, tailored for either men or women, compared to a single page pamphlet among a population receiving at least three counselling calls. overall, this evidence suggests that in the population of smokers seeking help from quitlines the choice between different standard self help materials is not of critical importance.

discussion
in controlled trials in quitline settings call‐back counselling improved quit rates over mailed materials or brief counselling at the first contact. these were pragmatic trials with potential sources of bias. only one study attempted biochemical validation in a convenience sample and found a high refusal rate.14 it is claimed that the rate of misreport is low in population based studies, and unlikely to differentially affect intervention and control groups.23 while using self reported outcomes may overestimate quit rates, treating all non‐responders as failures probably leads to an underestimate,24 as does inclusion of people who did not receive the intervention. we conducted a sensitivity analysis for the meta‐analysis: excluding participants lost to follow‐up from the denominators did not greatly affect the relative effect because most studies had similar dropout rates across intervention and control groups. the choice of cessation outcome might also affect the meta‐analysis results. we used a sustained measure of quitting in all studies, but point prevalence rates where reported were substantially higher. in most cases the relative treatment effect was similar if a more lenient measure of quitting was chosen but in one case delayed quitting activity among controls reversed the relative difference.13

intervention implementation was often incomplete. in some trials participants refused call back counselling; some participants could not be contacted and people often did not receive all intended calls. trial reports typically noted a dose response with higher quit rates as the number of completed calls increased. higher quit rates in those receiving more support are not necessarily evidence of efficacy since these people may be more motivated and thus more successful, but if they are seeking more help they may be having more difficulty quitting: where number of calls was not restricted; receiving a very high number of calls tended to predict failure.7 borland noted that in two trials7,8 quit rates in those not receiving any calls were similar to the control group, suggesting that they did not differ in their capacity to quit, and that therefore the real effect of counselling was underestimated by including participants who did not receive any intervention.

identifying the optimum number of calls and the number of attempts to complete calls for a cost effective service remains a challenge. responding to client need is likely to be important, but proactive calls may help people who would not initiate further contact. zhu and colleagues elegantly demonstrated that it was possible to enhance quit rates through proactive calls to smokers who had been invited to make further contact but had not done so.15 the counselling protocols showing clearest effects include at least one pre‐counselling session, and further calls scheduled close to the quit date, but with flexible schedules. although the california protocol showed a single call to have a measurable benefit, additional calls further increased rates. the meta‐analysis in the cochrane review suggested that a minimum of three calls was needed for an effect but this included studies in a range of settings where some counselling calls were to unmotivated smokers, or to smokers who had already been supported by face to face intervention and pharmacotherapy. there is almost no evidence about the best type of counselling when contact time and frequency are controlled. the california single call protocol focuses on promoting motivation to change, and preparing for combating urges to smoke.14 the number of calls may be more important than their length.12

some studies tried to assess whether the intervention affected the number of quit attempts or their likelihood of success. we did not formally evaluate these intermediate outcomes. even in these populations of help‐seeking smokers, on average only a half to two thirds recorded quit attempts, and the effect of the intervention on this intermediate outcome may not be large. zhu and colleagues noted an increase in quit attempts from 59% with self help to 67% with a single call, but no additional effect from multiple contacts.14 there was a clearer dose‐response effect on maintenance; among those who quit, sustained abstinence increased from 15% to 20% with a single session and 27% with multiple sessions. in one study, where no effect on abstinence was detected, the number of quit attempts was lower in the intervention group.9 another outcome reported in a few studies was the median length of abstinence. while sustained cessation has to be the ultimate goal, an extended quit attempt gives some indication of an intervention effect and may increase the likelihood of future success. zhu14 reported an increase in the median length of abstinence in those quitting for any period from 5 days with self help to 11 days with a single counselling session and 63 days with multiple sessions. longer duration of previous abstinence increases the probability of future success in quitting.25 based on these findings a reasonable hypothesis would be that counselling helps maintain cessation in the early stages of a quit attempt.

quitlines have become integral parts of national and statewide anti‐tobacco media campaigns.15 a survey of 62 north american state and province quitlines in 2005 found that all but one could provide proactive multisession counselling.26 quitlines also have a potential impact on public health beyond that of the services they provide to individuals. their promotion reinforces the importance of quitting and the availability of help should smokers choose to use them. this review does not directly address how much quitline services increase quitting compared to an “unassisted” attempt. it is no longer regarded as appropriate to deny support to smokers seeking this form of help and therefore no recent trials have had a no treatment control group. the multicounty trial by ossip‐klein and colleagues provides the best evidence for the overall effect of quitline type services. in the trial a hotline which included taped messages and access to counselling increased quit rates over a manual alone.27 the quit rates among control group participants in trials considered in this review, who received the basic quitline service, compare favourably with the success rates that might be expected for motivated but unassisted quitters. callers to a quitline are likely to be relatively highly motivated to quit and are actively seeking help, but may also have lower self efficacy.7

increasingly, telephone based services provide access to free or low cost pharmacotherapy where this is not available through national health services. the north american quitline survey26 found that more than half the services provided free or low cost pharmacotherapy to callers meeting eligibility criteria. in the oregon trial, randomisation to the offer of free nicotine patches increased success rates in all three counselling intensity conditions.10 evaluations of such initiatives have been reported from new york state,28,29 maine,30 minnesota31 and south dakota.32 these also report higher quit rates for smokers provided with nrt, although the non‐randomised nature of these comparisons means that they should be interpreted cautiously. the campaigns supporting these initiatives typically combine encouragement for cessation and publicity for quitline services and the incentive of free or subsidised medication. the increase in the number of calls to services during these campaigns indicates that they increase the level of quitting activity in the populations served.

the “4as” model of counselling advocated by the agency for health care policy and research (ahcopr) practice guidelines recommends that healthcare providers ask their patients about smoking, advise them to quit, assist them in quitting and arrange follow‐up.33 studies suggest that the assist and arrange components are poorly delivered.34,35 referring motivated smokers to quitline proactive counselling may increase delivery of these components, and it is important that the quitline intervention be as effective as possible. this review shows that call‐back counselling increases efficacy, but based on a limited number of trials failed to show that any particular method of counselling or adjunctive self help materials leads to higher success rates.

what this paper adds
systematic reviews of randomised trials have shown that telephone counselling is an effective intervention for assisting smokers to quit, while self help materials also offer a small benefit.

this review singles out the evidence supporting the benefit of call‐back counselling to help smokers who are seeking support via quitlines, showing that such counselling improves quit rates.

the paper also considers the effect of different types of counselling method and adjunctive self help materials, but failed to detect a difference between the different interventions studied.

abstract
background: the charlson comorbidity index is widely used in icd-9 administrative data, however, there is no
translation for read/oxmis coded data despite increasing use of the general practice research database (gprd).
our main objective was to translate the charlson index for use with read/oxmis coded data such as the gprd
and test its association with mortality. we also aimed to provide a version of the comorbidity index for other
researchers using similar datasets.
methods: two clinicians translated the charlson index into read/oxmis codes. we tested the association between
comorbidity score and increased mortality in 146 441 patients from the gprd using proportional hazards models.
results: this read/oxmis translation of the charlson index contains 3156 codes. our validation showed a strong
positive association between charlson score and age. cox proportional models show a positive increasing
association with mortality and charlson score. the discrimination of the logistic regression model for mortality was
good (auc = 0.853).
conclusion: we have translated a commonly used comorbidity index into read/oxmis for use in uk primary care
databases. the translated index showed a good discrimination in our study population. this is the first study to
develop a co-morbidity index for use with the read/oxmis coding system and the gprd. a copy of the comorbidity
index is provided for other researchers using similar databases.
background
studies of patient health should take into consideration
any independent predictors that will affect the outcome
of interest. individual disease status is an important predictor
of mortality and health care usage especially in
studies of older patients, and in many cases, subjects
may have more than one co-existing illness at the same
time. investigators may wish to conduct risk adjustment
for the additional health effects of these co-morbid
diseases.
previous research has led to the development of summary
comorbidity measures which classify patients
according to their disease burden [1-4]. the most widely
used and validated index of comorbidity was developed
by charlson and colleagues in the late 1980s [5,6]. the
charlson index includes 17 categories of comorbid disease
weighted based on their association with 1 year allcause
mortality. because the charlson index is weighted
and allows for additive scoring, it can take into account
both the number and the severity of comorbidity to provide
a summary of disease burden for each individual
patient [6]. the index has been validated in several different
populations, and has been widely used in studies
involving cancer patients and survivors [7-11].
recognizing the potential for its use in large database
studies that require risk adjustment for individual
patients, the charlson index has previously been adapted
for use with administrative data [12-15]. these adaptations
involve searching individual level hospital claims
data for codes corresponding to the charlson index
categories. however, these adaptations generally apply
only to icd-9-cm coded data, an international coding
system for classification of diseases, symptoms and
signs. there is no current translation of the charlson
index for read and oxmis coded data, two systems
which are based on icd-9-cm and are widely used in
british primary care. data using the read and oxmis
coding system has recently been made more readily
available from the general practice research database
(gprd), a uk-based database of clinical primary care
records. the gprd is the world’s largest source of
anonymised longitudinal data from primary care, and
currently contains information on 3.6 million active
patients from 450 general practices in the uk [16].
with increasing use of the gprd for academic and epidemiological
research, there is a need for a gprd-compatible
research tool that will allow categorization and
adjustment for patient comorbidity.
the main aim of this paper is to develop a comorbidity
index based on the charlson index for use with
read/oxmis coded data. we also describe the performance
of the new measure by testing whether comorbidity
is associated with increased mortality in a cohort
of patients from the gprd. it is our hope that the
newly developed and tested translation of the charlson
score can be used by other researchers working with
read/oxmis coded data and the gprd.
methods
development of read/oxmis codes lists
the original charlson index consists of 17 diagnostic
categories which provide the basis for assigning
weighted scores to each comorbid disease. deyo et al
[12] describe a validated translation of each diagnostic
category of the charlson index to icd-9-cm codes. we
used the icd-9-cm codes suggested by deyo et al to
guide development of the read/oxmis code lists used
in this comorbidity index. figure 1 summarizes our process
for translation of the index to read/oxmis codes
using one of the charlson diagnostic categories, myocardial
infarction, as an example.
using definitions provided by deyo et al for each
charlson diagnostic category, we searched the general
practice research database medical dictionary (version
0.3.7, copyright © 2004) for potentially relevant read/
oxmis codes. this dictionary includes the gprd medical
code for the type of event, the read/oxmis code for
the event and a description of the medical term. we
identified potential read/oxmis terms using two search
strategies. firstly, we used specific terms in the icd-9-
cm description of the event to search the gprd dictionary.
read codes have a hierarchical structure, with a
top level code for a disease category branching into
more precise and specific codes. therefore, our second
strategy involved identifying relevant top level read
codes and including all lower level codes. by using the
wild card (*), and hierarchies of read codes, we generated
a list of all potentially related codes. we conducted
these read/oxmis searches for 16 of the diagnostic
categories used in the charlson index. we treated the
cancer codes separately, and included all read codes
starting with ‘b’, but excluding all codes for benign cancer
(b7), cancer in situ (b8) and neoplasms of uncertain
behaviour (b9). we tried to be over-inclusive in the
searching and used broad search terms when possible.
two clinicians experienced in the use of read codes
(pwr and sh) independently reviewed the list of all
read/oxmis codes identified through searches of the
gprd medical dictionary. the clinicians selected relevant
read/oxmis codes and rejected codes not corresponding
to icd-9-cm codes used in the deyo
adaptation of the charlson index. a third clinician
resolved any disagreement on coding. we calculated the
degree of inter-rater agreement between the two clinicians
reviewing read/oxmis code lists using the kappa
score, which provides an estimate of the level of agreement
between the two raters above that occurring due
to chance. the final list of read/oxmis codes in this
adaptation of the charlson index is available in additional
file 1.
13 read/oxmis codes were used in more than one
diagnostic category. these overlaps only occurred
between diabetes and peripheral vascular disease (i.e.
‘gangrene diabetic’ was coded as both ‘diabetes’ and
‘peripheral vascular disease’), and between diabetes and
diabetes with complications. one clinician (pwr) determined
that the codes should be classified as diabetes
codes.
data source
the gprd is the world’s largest anonymised database of
primary care records [16]. practices participating in the
gprd record data on clinical diagnoses, test results, prescriptions
and referral data from primary care. clinical
data is coded using read/oxmis codes, along with the
date of original onset for chronic or recurrent conditions.
gprd recording guidelines direct practices to provide a
record of all significant morbidity events in the patient’s
medical history, including a summary of events that
occurred before the patient joined the practice [17]. the
data from practices undergoes quality control procedures
and several validation studies have shown a high level of
data completeness within the gprd [18].
validation dataset
as part of a study looking at the unmet needs of longterm
survivors of cancer, we received a dataset containing
primary care records between 01/01/1987 and 30/
06/2006 for all patients in the gprd with a diagnosis of
breast, colorectal or prostate cancer and more than five
years survival. we also received data on a control population
of patients with no record of breast, colorectal or
prostate cancer, matched to the cancer survivors by age,
gender and practice on a ratio of 1:4. the dataset
included data on 18707 breast cancer survivors, 5773
colorectal cancer survivors, 4856 prostate cancer survivors,
and 117105 control patients (total n = 146 441
patients). we used individual level clinical data in this
dataset to test the adapted charlson index.
assessing the comorbidity measure
following translation of the charlson index to read/
oxmis codes, we tested whether an increasing comorbidity
score was associated with increased patient mortality.
to achieve this, we applied the adapted weighted
charlson index to the patient cohort obtained from the
gprd. our adapted comorbidity score used the original
charlson score which does not include age, however,
charlson and colleagues have also developed a combined
age-comorbidity index [19].
cox proportional hazards models were fit with mortality
from july 1 2001 to 31 august 2006 as the dependent
variable. charlson score was coded as a continuous
ordinal indicator variable, and was included along with
age as explanatory variables. survival was measured in
days and associations are reported using hazard ratios
with charlson score of 0 as the referent group. all analyses
were conducted using stata mp (version 10, college
station, tx).
discriminatory power of the model
the area under a receiver operating characteristic
(roc) curve, or c-statistic, can be used to quantify how
well a predictor based on a number of variables discriminates
a dichotomous outcome [20]. we used a logistic
model to estimate the relationship between death
(dichotomous outcome coded 0/1) and the charlson
index, after adjusting for age, quintiles of the the index
of multiple deprivation (imd) and gender, before producing
the roc curve. model discrimination was
assessed by the area under the roc curve.
adjusting variables
we included age in 2001, gender and socioeconomic
status in the models for adjustment. age was categorized
in 5 groups of similar sizes (30-49, 50-59, 60-69,
70-79, 80+). the gprd dataset includes an index of
multiple deprivation (imd) score to estimate socioeconomic
status at practice level. the imd covers a range
of indicators including income, employment, health
deprivation and disability, education, skills and training,
housing, and geographical access to services for each
small area in the uk [21]. imd scores were grouped
into quintiles based on the spread of scores within each
country in the uk.
results
coding exercise
the inter-rater agreement between the two clinicians for
including read/oxmis codes in the charlson index was
84.6%, with a kappa of 0.45, indicating a moderate level
of agreement [22]. including the cancer codes, a total of
3156 read/oxmis codes were included in this adaptation
of the charlson index.
characteristics of the cohort
the mean age of the cohort was 73.7 (sd 12.5), and
73.5% of the patients were female. the high percentage
of female patients is due to the high proportion of
breast cancer survivors and gender matched controls in
the cohort. table 1 shows the frequency and percentages
of patients with each of the diagnoses included in
the comorbidity index.
the original charlson index weights each disease category
on the strength of its association with mortality.
using the original charlson weights for each disease
category, the breakdown by index score in our dataset is
shown in figure 2.
most of the patients in the validation dataset had no
comorbid disease (n = 60585). there were a few patients
with a very high charlson score above 5. there was a
strong positive association between increasing charlson
score and increasing age (p < 0.0001).
patient mortality
in total, 11,490 patients died during the five-year period
from july 1 2001 to august 31 2006. figure 3 shows the
survival curves for the population stratified according to
charlson score.
mortality was significantly associated with a charlson
score of 1 or more, with a positive increasing association
as charlson score increases (table 2). there was an
increased risk of death amongst older patients and
amongst males.
discrimination of the model
the discrimination of the logistic regression model was
good, with an area under the curve (auc) of 0.853 (figure
4). this indicates that the adaptation of the charlson
index is a good predictor of mortality in the
validation dataset.
discussion
we have translated a commonly used comorbidity index
into read/oxmis codes for use with uk primary care
databases. in a cohort of cancer survivors and matched
controls, a higher comorbidity score in this adaption of
the charlson index was associated with an increased
risk of mortality after adjusting for age, deprivation
scores and gender. the translated comorbidity index
showed a good discrimination our study population. to
our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a
comorbidity index for use with this disease coding
system.
although this adaptation of the charlson index can be
applied to any read/oxmis coded dataset, we hope
that our adapted version of the charlson index will be
especially useful to the increasing number of researchers
conducting work using the gprd. gprd data provides
an opportunity to conduct large scale epidemiological
research in primary health care use, health outcomes
and pharmacology. the medicines and healthcare products
regulatory agency (mrha), which manages the
gprd, has recently announced plans to link gprd data
with hospital episodes statistics (hes), cancer registrations
and office for national statistics databases. these
linkages will increase the value of conducting research
using the gprd, as researchers will be able to trace
patient pathways through primary and secondary care.
our adaptation of the charlson index is available in
additional file 1, and can be imported into statistical
software for use with other datasets. this index can be
used to quickly categorize patients into different comorbidity
levels, and will add explanatory power when conducting
analyses using read/oxmis coded datasets and
the gprd.
we tested the association between increasing charlson
score and mortality, which was the primary outcome
used in the development of the original score. our
results confirm the hypothesis that patients with a
greater burden of disease will die sooner. one unexpected
result was a large jump in the risk of mortality in
patients with a charlson score of 6 or above. this is
likely due to the number of patients in our cohort with
metastatic cancer, which generally has a very poor prognosis
in the small but high risk group of patients with a
score of 6 or more [23].
limitations
this comorbidity index performed well in our validation
exercise, however, there are several areas where the
model may be inadequate. firstly, it is possible that
some codes were not included when developing the
read/oxmis code lists for assessment. by using broad
search terms, hierarchical searches of read codes, and
two reviewers to independently assess records, fewer
potentially relevant read/oxmis codes were excluded
from the final adaptation of the charlson index. secondly,
we used the original disease weights developed by
the authors of the original charlson index almost twenty
years ago. one recent criticism of the charlson index is
that certain diseases have an improved prognosis since
the original score was developed. for instance, according
to the original charlson weighting, a positive aids disease
status carries an equivalent mortality risk to a diagnosis
of metastatic cancer. only eight patients in our
dataset were diagnosed with aids, therefore, this issue
is unlikely to affect our validation results. in studies
where a larger proportion of individuals are hiv/aids
positive, investigators may wish to use updated weights
for hiv/aids taking into account that the burden of
disease and mortality is lower now than in the 1980s
[24].
thirdly, recording of clinical outcomes in primary care
settings may be incomplete; a recent study demonstrated
that even major outcomes such as cancer may not be
recorded in patient electronic records [25]. although
the gprd data is subject to a number of quality checks,
it is possible that disease recording is incomplete. however,
many of the previous adaptations of the charlson
index have used administrative data, where patient history
and comorbid disease may not be as recorded as
accurately as the clinical data available in datasets such
as the gprd [26,27]. omissions of major comorbid diseases
can result in an incorrect final charlson score in
any study. these omissions are not an intrinsic
limitation in the tool that we have developed, but may
affect its functional ability in datasets such as the
gprd. future work should continue to validate the
accuracy of disease coding in administrative datasets
and the gprd.
our validation population of long-term cancer survivors
is unusual; these patients are older and sicker than
the general population. the cancer survivors have a
charlson score of at least 2 and a high proportion are
female owing to the high number of breast cancer survivors.
other patient cohorts using this adapted comorbidity
index will likely have different trends in mortality
and consultation behaviour. future studies should apply
this charlson adaptation to other study populations to
measure mortality and use of primary care services. we
were also unable to consider race or ethnicity in the
analysis as this information is not routinely collected in
the gprd. these limitations, however, do not affect the
development and translation of the charlson index to
read/oxmis codes, but may affect the results of the
validation exercise.
conclusions
in conclusion, we have developed an adaptation of the
charlson comorbidity index for use in read/oxmis
databases and the gprd which predicts 5-year mortality
in a cohort of patients. our adaptation is provided in a
downloadable format (additional file 1) for other
researchers using similar databases. with increasing use
of large datasets for epidemiological research, researchers
must consider how disease status will affect their
outcomes of interest. tools such as the charlson index
can provide a summary of comorbidity for use in large
studies, and this paper demonstrates the utility of an
adaptation of the charlson score in primary care coded
data.

medical statisticians seldom directly make life and death decisions. though i wouldn't like to have direct responsibility for making the decision to give a penicillin injection to a child with a purpuric rash in the community, i am conscious of the effect that my work may have on clinical decisions for such children. i felt a heavy responsibility when i conducted the statistical analysis of this paper.

in most datasets that i analyse, the main issue is to quantify if the effect observed is due to chance. the question is rarely about the direction of the main effect; instead it is more about the size of the effect and the precision with which it has been estimated. but on this occasion one key statistical decision determined whether the best estimate of the effect of parenteral penicillin given before admission to hospital was a modest benefit or substantial harm (table), and the statistician involved in the previous paper from the united kingdom (on which current clinical policy is based) had taken the opposite view.

table 1
estimated increased odds of death in children with suspected meningococcal disease given penicillin before admission to hospital according to analysis chosen

children included	children excluded	crude odds ratio
analysis a	448	0	0.85
analysis b	152*	290†	5.96
*excluded six children because we could not determine whether or not penicillin had been administered before admission.
†none of excluded children received penicillin before admission so an odds ratio cannot be obtained for this group.

as the table shows, analysis a included all children with meningococcal disease for whom data were available and estimated a small protective effect of penicillin. analysis b, which included only children in whom the general practitioner had suspected a diagnosis of meningococcal disease, estimated a substantial (six-fold) reduction in survival.

simpson's paradox
this rather frightening statistical effect—actually changing the direction of the estimated effect from benefit to harm—is related to simpson's paradox (or the yule-simpson effect), first described in 1952.3 simpson reported the seemingly impossible situation where the success of several subgroups seems to be reversed when the groups are combined.4

the reason for the paradox is the combination of two factors: an imbalance in the proportion of each subgroup receiving each intervention and a different event rate in each subgroup. this was the case with the penicillin data. to have a chance of being given penicillin, children had to be seen by a general practitioner who suspected meningococcal disease, and children who were seen by a general practitioner had a lower mortality (18%) than those that were not (37%).

analysis a was based on all the children with meningococcal disease in our study. it replicated previous work and was therefore reassuring. but on reflection and discussion with the clinicians, i realised it transgressed one basic statistical principle—it included in the analysis children who had no chance of receiving penicillin before admission. i therefore excluded the children who had not been seen by a general practitioner or in whom he or she had not diagnosed meningococcal disease (analysis b in the table). this analysis produced the evidence of substantially increased mortality.

defining the population highlighted two important sources of confounding: the fast progression of the disease and the lack of specific signs and symptoms early in the illness.5 the analysis reported is based on a population composed only of children with a more slowly progressive disease (who had time to see their doctor) and in whom the signs and symptoms were specific enough for a diagnosis. the 158 children in whom the general practitioner diagnosed meningococcal disease were at a later stage of their illness than the 166 who also saw their general practitioner but were not so diagnosed (median time from onset of illness to consultation 14 v 8 hours). furthermore, if the critical decision to administer penicillin in the 158 children is associated with severity of disease at the time (for example, more ill, higher chance that penicillin will be given) then the effect would be biased in the direction of penicillin causing harm. i thought it essential to adjust for severity of disease at the point at which the decision to give penicillin had been made.

unfortunately, the limited data available made this difficult. the only validated measure of severity collected, gmsps score, was assessed at admission to hospital—by which time penicillin is likely to have had an effect. though severity scores at the time of diagnosis from the general practitioner's notes were obtained, recording was incomplete. nevertheless i used this partial assessment of severity at diagnosis, together with other recorded variables that are believed to be associated with mortality (such as type of disease), to obtain an adjusted effect of penicillin on mortality. having adjusted with these variables i would have expected the association between penicillin and mortality to get weaker or disappear. the estimate adjusted for severity, however, showed a further increase in the association between penicillin and mortality (adjusted odds ratio 7.45, 95% confidence interval 1.47 to 37.67). the question still in my mind is whether the variables used did truly adjust for severity of disease.

i decided to write this commentary to highlight the major impact that simple statistical decisions can have on the results of clinical research; to increase awareness of the possibility of simpson's paradox, particularly in observational data of this nature; and to emphasise the importance of not assuming that strong associations are necessarily causal.

abstract
objective to assess the effectiveness of self monitoring blood glucose levels in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes compared with clinical management without self monitoring, and to explore the effects in specific patient groups.

design meta-analysis based on individual participant data.

data sources medline, embase, and a recent systematic review of trials on self monitoring of blood glucose. chief investigators of trials published since 2000 were approached for additional information and individual patient data.

inclusion criteria randomised controlled trials in patients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes comparing an intervention using self monitoring of blood glucose with clinical management not using self monitoring. trials published from 2000 with at least 80 participants were included.

data collection individual patient data were collected from electronic files and checked for integrity.

analysis all randomised participants were analysed using the intention to treat principle. a random effects model of complete cases was used to assess efficacy, a sensitivity analysis comprised imputed data, and prespecified subgroup analyses were carried out for age, sex, previous use of self monitoring, duration of diabetes, and levels of glycated haemoglobin (hba1c) at baseline.

results 2552 patients were randomised in the six included trials. a mean reduction in hba1c level of −2.7 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval −3.9 to −1.6; 0.25%) was observed for those using self monitoring of blood glucose levels compared with no self monitoring at six months. the mean reduction in hba1c level between groups was 2.0 mmol/mol (3.2 to 0.8; 0.25%) at three months (five trials) and 2.5 mmol/mol (4.1 to 0.9; 0.35%) at 12 months (three trials). these estimates were unchanged after imputing missing data, and estimates of effect in trials with higher loss to follow-up or a possibility of co-intervention compared with those with lower loss to follow-up and no co-intervention did not differ significantly (p=0.21). the difference in hba1c levels between groups was consistent across age, baseline hba1c level, sex, and duration of diabetes, although the numbers of older and younger people and those with hba1c levels >86 mmol/mol (10%) were insufficient for interpretation. no changes occurred in systolic blood pressure (−0.2 mm hg, 95% confidence interval −1.4 to 1.0), diastolic blood pressure (−0.1 mm hg, −0.9 to 0.6), or total cholesterol level (−0.1 mol/l, 95% confidence interval −0.2 to 0.1).

conclusions evidence from this meta-analysis of individual patient data was not convincing for a clinically meaningful effect of clinical management of non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes by self monitoring of blood glucose levels compared with management without self monitoring, although the difference in hba1c level between groups was statistically significant. the difference in levels was consistent across subgroups defined by personal and clinical characteristics.

introduction
self monitoring of blood glucose is generally accepted as integral to the management of diabetes, particularly for people who require insulin.1 typically, a meter device measures blood glucose levels in a fingertip sample of capillary blood and the data are used by patients and clinicians to determine the presence of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia and to inform decisions about adjustment of insulin dosage, use of other drugs, or aspects of lifestyle that may need to be changed, such as meals and physical activity. evidence on the effectiveness of self monitoring blood glucose in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes is less clear cut however.2 in a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, estimates for the effect of self monitoring blood glucose varied.3 4 5 6 whether these findings were accounted for by differences in trial designs, recruited populations, or the methods used to pool the data are uncertain. it is also unclear whether particular groups of people may benefit more than others from a period of self monitoring.

we pooled the data from a series of randomised controlled trials of self monitoring of blood glucose in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes, excluding trials with a small sample size and limited follow-up.7 we also evaluated more recent trials examining the use of blood glucose measuring devices that incorporated electrochemical sensors and technology to minimise inaccurate measurements.

methods
we searched the bibliography of a recent high quality systematic review to identify trials that evaluated self monitoring of blood glucose levels in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes reported between january 2000 and april 2009.3 we searched medline and embase from april 2009 to june 2010 with the same search terms as used in the review (see web extra on bmj.com). to identify further trials we also hand searched other systematic reviews of glucose self monitoring, conference proceedings and abstracts, and the current controlled trials register. no language restrictions were applied.

selection criteria and validity assessment
we selected randomised controlled clinical trials comparing an intervention of self monitoring of blood glucose in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes with clinical management not using self monitoring and that assessed glycaemic control by using hba1c as a primary outcome. secondary outcomes included blood pressure and serum cholesterol level. trials were required to include an active intervention arm intended to improve disease outcomes through incorporating self monitoring into self management, and a comparator arm not using self monitoring and with no additional modification of risk factors or behaviour intended.

we determined the methodological quality of selected trials by assessing randomisation, allocation concealment, blinded outcome assessment, losses to follow-up, funding source, and follow-up rates.8 two additional quality criteria were also included: a minimum sample size of 80 patients and a minimum study duration of six months.

specification of intervention and comparator groups
from published reports we obtained the details of the trial designs, interventions, comparator groups, and conduct, which we then verified with the trialists. the details included use of concealed allocation, dropout rates, the intended frequency of self monitoring, training in the self management intervention, frequency and timing of self monitoring measurements, and delivery of co-interventions. to identify the extent to which educational interventions were matched with the intervention we examined the comparator groups. we also collected details of any factors used to stratify the sample.

extraction of individual patient data
we contacted the principal investigators for the original individual patient data. the following baseline data, where available, were provided: date of randomisation, age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, duration of diabetes, glucose lowering treatment, previous use of blood glucose testing, weight, height, blood pressure, and levels of total cholesterol, plasma glucose, and hba1c. in addition the allocated treatment, methods of hba1c analysis, and trial outcomes were provided, including hba1c level, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol level. all randomised patients with a database record were entered in the pooled database. we retrieved patients lost to follow-up or excluded in published per protocol analyses and included them in the database of individual patient data.

quantitative data synthesis
the protocol for the study has been published9 and a statistical plan was agreed before starting data analysis. codes for treatment allocation were not provided until the end of the analysis process. the main analysis, including primary, secondary, and other exploratory analyses, was based on intention to treat, in which we considered all randomised participants. where a trial included two intervention arms, we pooled these to obtain a single intervention group for the analysis.8 we report analyses for hba1c at 3, 6, and 12 months after the intervention. if hba1c outcome data were available at two and four months, we averaged the figures to provide an estimate of the outcome at three months.

analyses were undertaken to estimate treatment effects by fitting a two level regression model, with patients corresponding to level one units and trials as level two.10 we treated trial specific differences as random effects and assumed the treatment effect to be common across trials. all analyses were adjusted for baseline measures and where missing were imputed using the missing indicator method.11 to assess potential confounding we further adjusted analyses for age, sex, and duration of diabetes. we present the results for all analyses with appropriate measures of effect, 95% confidence intervals, and p values where applicable.

for those trials where relevant data were not available we investigated the potential for bias—in particular, in trials with high levels of attrition. we handled missing primary outcomes in the regression models by adopting a bayesian approach,12 which imputes the outcome variable directly from the model, and we used these estimates as part of extended sensitivity analyses. additional sensitivity analyses were carried out for trials with higher rates of loss to follow-up or with potential for an additional impact from a co-intervention with the use of self monitoring. analyses were carried out using r version 2.13 (r foundation for statistical computing, vienna) and stata version 11.1.

results
of the 272 studies retrieved from the database search, and the additional studies from the bibliography of the high quality systematic review,3 15 trials were identified. of these, three included self monitoring in both trial arms,13 14 15 one included multiple co-interventions alongside self monitoring that were not available to the comparator group,16 three included patients treated with insulin,17 18 19 one was a trial of financial incentives to use self monitoring,20 and one included patients with type 1 diabetes.21 no trials identified to june 2010 were excluded solely because of inclusion of fewer than 80 patients.

the remaining six trials with 2552 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the analysis, and data were available for each of them. included trials were carried out in the united states,22 france,23 germany,24 and the united kingdom,25 26 and a sixth trial was a multicentre european trial.27

table 1⇓ shows the characteristics of each trial (see web extra table for full details). with the exception of one trial25 that recruited newly diagnosed patients, trials recruited participants with established type 2 diabetes not treated with insulin. interventions varied but focused around management of lifestyle24 25 or adjustment of drugs.22 27 one trial included a continuing dietary intervention for the duration of the trial alongside self monitoring.24 one trial included two intervention arms.26 trials varied in size from 8922 to 689 participants,23 in duration from six to 12 months, and in losses to follow-up from 2%25 to 31%.23 table 2⇓ reports the methods used in each of the trials.

figure 1⇓ and table 4⇓ show glycaemic outcomes for the main complete case comparison of self monitoring with no self monitoring of blood glucose levels. adjusted hba1c levels at six months were 2.7 mmol/mol (0.25%) significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (p<0.001). secondary adjusted glycaemic outcomes at three and 12 months were also significantly lower, at 2.0 mmol/mol (0.18%; p=0.001) and 2.5 mmol/mol (0.23%; p=0.002). for two trials the hba1c outcomes at three months included the average of the measurements at two and four months.22 24

figure 3⇓ shows the results of the preplanned subgroup analysis. for participants aged 45 to 75 years a consistent effect of self monitoring was evident. only a few participants were aged less than 45 years and more than 75 years, and the confidence intervals of the estimates for these subgroups were wide. the difference in effect between men and women and between individuals with varied durations of diabetes did not differ. evidence was also lacking of a differing effect for individuals with varied baseline levels of hba1c, although few data were available for those with an hba1c level above 10% (86 mmol/mol).

a sensitivity analysis based on imputing data gave similar results to the primary analysis, with a reduction in hba1c level of 2.7 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval 3.8 to 1.6, 0.25%) at six months. evidence of heterogeneity in outcomes was lacking between the trials. outcomes did not differ significantly (p=0.21) in an additional sensitivity analysis comparing trials with a greater loss to follow-up and additional dietary intervention with the remainder of the trials.

discussion
our analysis suggests that clinical management of non-insulin treated diabetes using self monitoring of blood glucose levels compared with no self monitoring results in a reduction in hba1c level of around 2.7 mmol/mol (0.25%). in trials measuring outcomes the reduction in levels at six months was apparent at three months and 12 months. the mean pooled reduction in hba1c levels across the trials was 9.6 mmol/mol (0.88%) in the intervention group and 7.5 mmol/mol (0.69%) in the comparator group. no change in hba1c level was observed for older and younger people and those with a level above 86 mmol/mol (10%), although confidence intervals were wide, but otherwise a consistent effect of a small reduction in hba1c level was observed in other prespecified subgroups. the numbers of patients included in the analysis were too small to confidently exclude a difference in response between those who had previously used self monitoring compared with those who had not. the differences in the effect size observed between individual trials did not suggest that differences in the way self monitoring has been used to date or the characteristics of trial participants might contribute to important differences in the observed effect.

strengths and limitations of the review
this analysis reports, for the first time, the results of pooling individual data from recent trials comparing self monitoring of blood glucose with no self monitoring. the results of the individual trials can be compared by using a common analysis plan, and the impact of self monitoring can now be observed in prespecified subgroups. a statistical analysis plan, written before the data were examined, contributes to the rigour of this analysis. the participants included in this analysis were drawn from a wide range of settings but are representative of people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes and therefore the findings can be applied widely. no heterogeneity was observed in outcomes between trials and therefore we have not included further analysis of differences between populations, interventions, and trial design variables. in any case the limited number of trials would not have justified such an exploratory analysis. this collaboration forms the basis of a group that can facilitate continued meta-analysis of self monitoring trials, explore co-interventions designed to enhance the effective use of self monitoring, and investigate the potential for improved outcomes from occasional or intermittent use of self monitoring in addition to regular use.

despite the insights that can be obtained from an individual patient data analysis, there are several limitations to the interpretation of data. in particular, the interventions used in each trial were intended to reflect best practice as seen at the time of the trial’s design, which may not reflect subsequent developments in the use of self monitoring in clinical practice. the design of the trials reflects their “real world” settings and the difficulty of identifying the additional impact of self monitoring beyond good clinical care. for simplicity in reporting we used a linear imputation to extrapolate the measurement of hba1c at three months from these two measures and calculated the difference in levels between the intervention and comparator group. as this is a direct comparison between randomised groups, any difference between this linear approximation and alternative methods of extrapolation is likely to be negligible. the data that could be obtained and pooled across the trials did not extend to markers of safety—for example, incidence of hypoglycaemia, although individual trials did provide data reporting low rates of recorded hypoglycaemia.25 26 in addition, data about socioeconomic groupings and changes to treatment were insufficient to explore their impact on the changes in hba1c levels, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. other limitations noted for individual trials included inclusion of people with a blood glucose level potentially too low to benefit from the intervention26; interventions in people with newly diagnosed diabetes, with poor control likely to improve without self monitoring25 27; high rates of loss to follow-up23; and the presence of concerns about the contribution of a dietary co-intervention with self monitoring of glucose to outcomes.24

all the trials excluded patients actively using self monitoring blood glucose levels; a recent survey indicated the type of benefits that many have gained from personalised use of the technology,28 and that they may be less willing to take part in randomised trials. our data provide an indication, although not statistically significant, that those who have used self monitoring in the past may benefit less than a group newly exposed to the technology. self monitoring of blood glucose is not simply a diagnostic tool but one component of a complex intervention aimed at improving overall glycaemic control and wellbeing. the future use of self monitoring depends on integrating the technology in clinical and behavioural management pathways. poor use of monitoring may mean wasted resources, an important consideration as the market for glucose self monitoring for all types of diabetes approached $8.8bn (£5.6bn; €6.8bn) worldwide in 2008,29 with estimated annual uk costs of £38m in type 2 diabetes,30 of which up to £34m may be attributable to use in non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes.3

the pooled estimate of the benefit from using self monitoring from our analysis is in line with most3 5 6 31 32 but not all of the analyses carried out that previously used aggregated data.4 our findings do not, however, support previous assertions that the overall reduction in hba1c level may be greater when treating those with higher compared with lower hba1c levels.6 33 34 although intuitively it might seem that greater reductions in hba1c levels are possible with a higher initial level, similar reductions were also observed in the control groups.

clinical implications
it is widely agreed that for further evaluation of self monitoring of blood glucose, the therapeutic interventions and efforts to promote behavioural change should be more tightly aligned to the results obtained from monitoring, and targeted at those likely to benefit.2 early studies linking test results to specific drug and behavioural strategies have had promising results,35 36 although not achieving the 0.5% reduction in hba1c that is generally accepted to be of clinical relevance.3 smaller reductions of hba1c level might be of importance from a public health perspective if achieved on a wide scale and at lower cost; however, costs of self monitoring remain high, even in low and middle income countries, with the costs of unsubsidised test strips varying from $0.35 in australia to $3.11 in india.37 until further studies can establish potential target groups and promising interventions to improve glycaemic control with self monitoring, our meta-analysis using individual patient data does not provide convincing evidence to support its routine use for people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes using the range of interventions employed within the included trials.

what is already known on this topic
self monitoring of blood glucose level is essential for the management of type 1 diabetes and insulin treated type 2 diabetes
the use of self monitoring for non-insulin treated people has been controversial because estimates of benefit in reducing levels of hba1c vary between systematic reviews
no single trial has been large enough to identify the characteristics of those who might benefit most from monitoring blood glucose
what this study adds
meta-analysis using individual patient data lacked convincing evidence to support the routine use of self monitoring of blood glucose in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes
evidence was also lacking of a greater effect from self monitoring in patients with a baseline hba1c level above 8%
better evidence that self monitoring can provide feedback on treatment and behaviour are needed before further large scale trials are carried out
