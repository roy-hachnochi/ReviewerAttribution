abstract
background: james tanner emphasised the “tempo” of growth, i.e. the adolescent spurt as summarised by its timing (age at peak velocity or apv) and intensity (peak velocity, pv).

aim: the paper applies the sitar growth curve model to pubertal growth data with the aim of clarifying the growth pattern across multiple measurements and the spectrum of apv and pv.

subjects and methods: data for 7–20 years on ten anthropometric measurements in 619 children from the harpenden growth study, and on height in 10410 children from the alspac study, were analysed using sitar (superimposition by translation and rotation). sitar models pubertal growth as a mean curve with apv and pv fitted as subject-specific random effects, and a random measurement intercept.

results: mean apv for harpenden girls and boys averaged 12.0 and 13.9 years across the ten measurements. pv expressed as percent per year lay in the narrow range 4–8%. splitting the alspac subjects into 9 by 5 apv and pv groups and fitting separate sitar models to each group confirmed sitar’s good fit while highlighting the spectrum of growth patterns.

conclusion: sitar works well to summarise pubertal growth. the disappointment is that tanner did not live to see it in action.
introduction
the human adolescent growth spurt is a remarkable phenomenon seen in few other primate species. occurring towards the end of the growth period, after height velocity has been falling steadily since early infancy, the velocity suddenly increases to a peak of around 10 cm/year in boys and 8 cm/year in girls, a growth rate not seen since late infancy. then, just as suddenly, the rate falls to zero and growth ceases (tanner 1962).

the pubertal growth spurt is unusual not only for its intensity but also for its timing. peak height velocity in individuals can occur as early as 10 years of age in girls or as late as 17 years in boys. on average boys peak two years later than girls, and this, coupled with their greater peak velocity (pv), explains the sex difference in adult height – the two sexes are very similar in height at 10 years (tanner 1962). the combination of the sharp change in velocity and the peak’s variable timing leads to an apparently chaotic pattern of height growth across individuals during puberty.

james ‘jim’ m tanner (1920–2010) was an eminent british auxologist (a term that he invented), whose contribution to the study of human growth throughout the second half of the 20th century was remarkably wide-ranging. he was perhaps most famous for his work on growth at adolescence, which was the title of his first of many books on growth (tanner 1962). in it he explored pubertal growth in depth, comparing the changes in the different organ systems in the two sexes, and discussing how to measure the progress of puberty in individuals. he emphasised the concept of the tempo of growth, a measure of passing time in individuals relating to their pubertal status as quantified by their developmental age.

developmental age is a measure of maturation and can be based on the appearance of the individual child’s bones, teeth or secondary sexual characteristics, including menarche in girls. they are all markers that over time progress through a series of consistent and well-documented developmental stages. the tanner stages of pubic hair, breast development and genitalia have proved popular for assessing developmental age, as they can be assessed on a single occasion and require no specialised equipment (unlike the radiographic images required for bones or teeth) (marshall and tanner 1969, 1970).

alternatively, developmental age can be based on the timing of growth landmarks such as peak height velocity. this however cannot be measured on a single occasion; it requires longitudinal data, with individuals measured repeatedly over time. the data then need to be analysed to generate the individual velocity curves and extract the ages at pv. thus, as tanner (1962) pointed out, there are two requirements to study growth: a cohort study of individuals followed over time and a trained anthropometrist to make the measurements.

in 1948 tanner’s developing interest in growth led him to set up the harpenden growth study, recruiting as his experimental officer reginald ‘reg’ h whitehouse, straight out of the royal army medical corps (tanner 1988). whitehouse quickly established himself as an anthropometrist of the highest calibre, making hundreds of thousands of growth measurements (by tanner’s own estimate), using equipment he himself designed, until his retirement in 1976.

whitehouse also proved himself indispensable in analysing the growth data, meticulously plotting the points and drawing smooth curves through them. this work led to the seminal two-part 1966 tanner, whitehouse and takaishi paper on height and weight growth reference charts, which has set the example for many subsequent studies on growth references (tanner et al. 1966).

later tanner and whitehouse (with statisticians marubini and resele) analysed the adolescent growth spurt in 55 boys and 35 girls from the harpenden growth study, fitting logistic curves to height, sitting height, leg length, shoulder width and hip width for each individual (tanner et al. 1976). the curves fitted well overall, and the ages at pv were highly correlated across measurements, but the corresponding velocities less so.

analytical methods for growth data have advanced since these papers were written. however the underlying aim remains the same: to summarise mean growth as a smooth curve and to express individual growth patterns relative to the mean. a recently described growth curve model, superimposition by translation and rotation (sitar) (cole et al. 2010) is well suited to growth in puberty. based on a group of individuals it estimates a mean growth curve and defines the individual curves relative to it in terms of their size, timing and intensity of growth. in particular, timing corresponds directly with the individual’s age at pv (apv), while intensity equates to pv, which means that applying sitar is a simple way to categorise individuals in terms of their “tempo of growth”.

tanner’s simple but elegant vision of pubertal growth was that individual growth patterns could be summarised largely by the timing and intensity of pv. conveniently, the sitar model makes this same assumption, and at the same time it assumes – as tanner did – that conditional on timing and intensity, the underlying velocity curve is essentially constant in shape.

the aim of this paper is to celebrate the legacy of tanner – and whitehouse – by using sitar to explore the adolescent growth spurt from two distinct perspectives: how it varies across ten distinct linear measurements from the harpenden growth study, and how in detail the shape of the height velocity curve depends on timing and intensity, using data from the much larger avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac). the first perspective builds on tanner’s paradigm whereas the second tests it, by seeing just how invariant the height velocity curve is to differences in timing and intensity.

subjects and methods
harpenden growth study
the harpenden growth study consisted of 701 white british children, 282 girls and 419 boys, born between 1929 and 1965 (median 1949) and recruited from the highfield children’s home, harpenden, uk between 1949 and 1969 at ages between 0.9 and 20 years. they were predominantly children of manual workers or the lower middle class (tanner 1981).

they were measured 6-monthly outside puberty and 3-monthly during puberty, up to 35 years of age, on a total of 8097 distinct measurement occasions, 95% of them at ages between 4 and 19 years. figure 1 is a lexis diagram for the study, with a slanting line for each child showing the date and their age at the time of their first and last measurements.

whitehouse made all the measurements, including weight, height, other linear measurements and skinfold thicknesses. here ten linear measurements are selected for analysis, ranked by median size: height*, sitting height*, leg length* (by difference), thigh circumference, shoulder width*, foot length, hip width*, arm circumference, knee width and elbow width (the asterisked measurements were also analysed by tanner et al. (1976)). note that the technical names for shoulder, hip, knee and elbow width used by tanner were respectively bi-acromial, bi-iliac, bi-epifemur and bi-epihumerus width. all measurements were recorded to the last complete 0.1 cm. to focus on puberty the age range here is restricted to >7 to <20 years, during which period 619 children (248 girls and 371 boys) were measured on 6670 distinct occasions.

avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac)
the avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac) consisted of over 15,000 children from bristol uk recruited antenatally in 1990–1992 and followed up to age 20 (boyd et al. 2013). height was measured, to the nearest 0.1 cm, annually up to age 13, then at ages 15 and 17, by trained researchers. the present analysis involves 5183 girls and 5227 boys with 33122 and 31776 measurements aged from >7 to <20 years.

data cleaning
the two datasets had already been cleaned. for further cleaning sitar models (see below) were fitted, and outliers were identified with standardised residuals exceeding 4 in absolute value (only 0.006% of data are this extreme based on a normal distribution). there were very few outliers in the harpenden study, and they were inspected individually and either corrected (based on the context) or excluded. for the numerically larger alspac models the outliers were excluded. individuals with at least one measurement were included.

statistical methods
sitar is a mixed effects growth curve model featuring a cubic spline mean curve and three subject-specific random effects that adjust the mean curve to best match the subjects’ own curves (cole et al. 2010; cole et al. 2014). the random effects are called size, timing and intensity, and each represents a simple transformation of the mean curve. size indicates an up/down shift of the mean curve (in measurement units), reflecting how tall/short the individual is relative to the mean; timing reflects the individual apv (in age units e.g. years), seen as a right/left shift in the curve, positive for a later peak than average and negative for earlier; and intensity reflects the rate of passage through puberty as measured by pv (in fractional units), positive for faster than average and negative for slower. the degree of intensity shows itself by shrinking/stretching the age scale, which can be visualised as follows: imagine the image of a growth curve projected onto a half-open door. the effect of further opening the door is to make the curve appear narrower and steeper, corresponding to higher intensity, while closing the door makes the curve wider, shallower and lower intensity.

algebraically the sitar model is given by
yij=αi+h[(tij−βi)eγi]+εij
(1)
where i=1…n subjects, j=1…n measurements, y and t are length (or other outcome) and age respectively, h[.] is a cubic spline function, α,β,γ are the normally distributed random effects size, timing and intensity, and ε is the residual assumed distributed as n(0,σr2).

the smoothness of the natural cubic spline mean curve is controlled by the number of degrees of freedom (d.f.), each corresponding to a spline fixed effect, with the number chosen to minimise the bayesian information criterion (bic). in addition, there are fixed effects for size, timing and intensity, which ensure the corresponding random effects have mean zero. in nearly all the models here age was fitted after natural log transformation, to improve the fit, which effectively measures age differences in percentage units rather than years (cole and altman 2017). all the results were back-transformed to age for presentation purposes.

the output from each sitar model consists of the mean curve as defined by the fixed effect coefficients, plus fixed effects for α,β,γ, subject random effects for α,β,γ summarised by their standard deviations and correlations, the residual standard deviation ε and the percentage of variance explained by the model, calculated as 100(1−(σr2/σf2)) where σf2 is the residual variance of the model fitted without random effects, i.e. with just the cubic spline mean curve. for models fitted with log age, the timing random effect sd was multiplied by median age to give units of age. the intensity random effect sd is age-invariant and essentially unaffected by age transformation.

the mean velocity curve was derived (in units of cm per year) as the first derivative of the mean curve plotted against age. in addition, four outputs were estimated from each mean velocity curve: the mean ages of pv and takeoff velocity (the minimum velocity prior to the peak), and the corresponding mean velocities. note the mean curves are all plotted as length versus age, whether the sitar model used age or log age. standard errors for the outputs were obtained using the bootstrap.

for presentation purposes the curves were also compared in terms of percent velocity (i.e. in units of % per year), to adjust for the size differences between the measures. this was achieved by plotting length versus age with length on a 100 × natural log scale, and the first derivative of the curve is velocity measured in percent units (cole and altman 2017).

the aim of the alspac analysis was to test the sitar assumption that the underlying mean height curve is essentially the same shape for all individuals after adjusting for the timing and intensity of their growth spurt. to this end separate (global) sitar models were first fitted for boys and girls, with log transformed age and 6 d.f. for the spline curves. then individuals were split by sex into nine equal size groups based on the value of their timing random effects, i.e. apv, and separate “local” sitar models were fitted to each group. as a second stage each apv group was split into five equal size groups based on individuals’ intensity random effects (pv) from the local apv model, giving 45 groups by sex, where in each group individuals were closely matched by timing and intensity. again, separate local sitar models were fitted to each group.

the group mean curves (either nine groups by apv or 45 groups by apv and pv) were then compared with the corresponding mean curves predicted from the global models, based on the mean timing and intensity random effects for each group. the numbers of nine apv and five pv groups were chosen to provide similar numbers per group of around 100, give more emphasis to timing than intensity, provide a median group by using odd numbers, and compromise between group number and group size. the models grouped by timing were fitted with 5 d.f. and the timing random effect was omitted as it was already adjusted for. the models grouped by timing and intensity also had 5 d.f., with both the timing and intensity random effects omitted as they were adjusted for.

all the analyses were carried out in r version 3.5.3 (r core team 2019), with sitar fitted using the sitar package version 1.1.1 (cole 2019).

results
harpenden growth study
figure 2 illustrates the anthropometry for one of the most intensely followed-up subjects, female 2113, born in 1947, with ten measurements on 36 occasions from age 3 to 20 years. the measurements vary in size from height (median 140 cm) to elbow width (median 5.9 cm), but all of them demonstrate a growth spurt at around 12 years. the regularity of the individual curves is striking, testimony to whitehouse’s skill. note that the curves for arm circumference and thigh circumference are noisier than the length curves, reflecting their soft mass component. note also that leg length increases faster than sitting height prior to puberty but has a smaller pubertal growth spurt.

mean growth curves
separate sitar models were fitted to the ten measurements by sex, a total of twenty models as summarised in table 1. the number of measurement occasions per child ranged from 1 to 32 with median 8. the sitar mean spline curves had between 3 and 7 d.f., with generally fewer for the smaller measurements. figure 3 shows the fitted spline curves for the models grouped by sex, emphasising the broad similarity in shape, though the growth spurts for the smallest measurements are hard to see.

figure 3. mean curves for the harpenden growth study sitar length models by sex.

the models used a log age transformation for all except the four smallest female measurements, and the variance explained by the models ranged from 91% to 99.5%, again less for the smaller measurements and the circumferences. the residual standard deviations (sd) were largest for the large measurements, e.g. 0.5 cm for height, but divided by the median to give residual percent coefficients of variation (cv) they were the smallest (0.3% for height).

table 2 summarises the random effect structure of the models. the sds reflect the population variability in size, timing and intensity. the size sd is given in both absolute (cm) and proportional (%) units, using size at age 19 as denominator. on the percent sd scale the two sexes are very similar, with that for leg length (5.4%) unexpectedly larger than for sitting height (3.2%), while that for height (3.8%) is intermediate. the timing sd (variability in apv) is close to one year for all measurements. the intensity sd is generally around 0.1 to 0.2 (corresponding to 10% to 20% variation in pv), but somewhat larger for the smaller measurements and appreciably larger for the circumferences. the correlations in table 2 are nearly all positive, with median values of around 0.4 for size-timing and timing-intensity, and 0.5 for intensity-size, indicating that larger individuals tend to have a later and more intense pubertal spurt. however the correlations are misleading as most are based on log age not age, which affects the correlations. for example, if boys height is refitted using age, the timing-intensity correlation of 0.28 changes to −0.28, indicating that timing and intensity are inversely correlated. thus the true correlation between timing (as based on age) and intensity is negative not positive, and this applies quite generally in table 2.

the model mean curves in figure 3 are replotted in figure 4 on a log 2 scale, i.e. constant rate of doubling, which scales the curves to be similar in shape, and in particular allows them to be compared across measurements by sex. for example, the height and shoulder width curves are seen to be very similar.

mean velocity curves
however, the best way to compare the growth spurts is via the corresponding velocity curves, as seen in figure 5 by sex. each measurement facet has its own scale, which enlarges the smaller measurement spurts. the corresponding apvs are highlighted as vertical lines, and the girls’ peaks are consistently about two years earlier than the boys’ (mean apvs across measurements 12.0 se 0.18 and 13.9 se 0.12 years for girls and boys). pv is generally slightly greater for boys than girls, with the striking exceptions of thigh circumference and to a lesser extent hip width.

figure 5 is useful for comparing velocity curves in the two sexes, but less so for comparing across measurements, as the scales differ. the slopes of the curves in figure 4 are directly comparable across measurements, being on a log scale, and as explained in the methods, the slopes of these curves correspond to growth velocity measured in percent units. the corresponding percent velocity curves are shown in figure 6, which make clear that peak percent velocity is not related to size; it is largest for boys arm circumference and girls thigh circumference, with both exceeding 8% per year, while the smallest velocity is for girls knee width (3.7% per year), a factor of just over two difference compared to the thirty-fold difference for linear velocity (boys height 9.3 cm/year versus girls elbow width 0.27 cm/year, table 3). for the other measurements pv is consistently around 5% per year and slightly greater for boys than girls.

figure 6. mean percent velocity curves for the harpenden growth study sitar length models by sex (girls left, boys right), with the ages at peak velocity indicated by vertical lines.

as well as pv, a second landmark on the velocity curve is takeoff, the point where velocity is at a minimum immediately prior to the peak. table 3 summarises the means for pv and takeoff velocity and their corresponding ages, both on the linear (cm per year) and proportional (% per year) scales as seen in figures 5 and 6. the ages at takeoff/peak are very similar whether calculated on the cm or % scale, so those on the % scale are omitted. bootstrap standard errors for apv range from 0.07 years for height and leg length up to 0.3+ years for the smaller measurements and the circumferences. for pv the standard errors are 0.12 cm per year for height and sitting height, 0.06 for leg length, and in between for the other measurements. mean age at takeoff is two years earlier than mean age at peak, and earlier still for the circumferences. the takeoff velocities are about half the peak velocities on average, varying from a third or less for the circumferences to near equality for foot length in girls. the correlation across measurements between linear velocity at takeoff and at peak is high at 0.94, but for percent velocity the corresponding correlation is small and negative at −0.2. so the two are effectively unrelated when the scale differences are accounted for, showing that each measurement has its own distinct profile from takeoff to peak.

random effects
an obvious question is whether individuals tend to be consistently large/small, early/late or fast/slow across all their measurements, and this can be tested for by looking at the correlations between the random effects. across the ten measurements there are 45 correlations for each of size, timing and intensity in the two sexes, the median correlations being 0.49 (size), 0.46 (timing) and 0.37 (intensity) for boys and 0.45, 0.50 and 0.23 for girls. so within individuals, timing is conserved across measurements just as strongly as size is, while intensity is less so.

the order of measurements in each correlation matrix can be rearranged so the largest correlations migrate towards the diagonal – a process known as seriation – and this ranks the measurements in terms of their strength of association with their neighbours (see supplementary table 1). it effectively ranks them by their median correlation with the other measurements. across the three random effects in the two sexes, height and leg length are consistently the most closely associated, followed by foot length and sitting height, while thigh and arm circumference are consistently the least associated, with the other four measurements in between. for example, the boys’ size random effects for height and leg length correlate at 0.87, whereas those for height and arm circumference correlate only at 0.16. similar contrasts in correlation apply for boys’ timing and intensity random effects, and also for girls. so in terms of individual growth patterns, foot length is surprisingly similar to height and its two components, while the circumferences are very different.

alspac
figure 7 shows the height data for 5183 girls and 5227 boys in alspac, where the nine data sweeps are clearly seen. the final sweep provides data from 17 to 20 years where the coverage is relatively sparse. figure 8 illustrates the sitar mean height curves and height velocity curves fitted to the data. on average girls are taller than boys between 10.8 and 13.5 years, while mean height velocity at age 19 is <0.1 and 0.4 cm per year in girls and boys, respectively. table 4 summarises the two sitar models, showing residual sds twice those in harpenden and correspondingly less variance explained. mean apv is earlier than in harpenden by 0.4 and 0.7 years (girls/boys), while pv is 0.0/1.3 cm per year greater and predicted height at age 19 is 2.1/4.9 cm greater. the bootstrap standard errors for mean apv and pv are around 0.02 years and 0.05 cm per year, respectively.

figure 8. sitar mean height and height velocity curves for alspac by sex, with the ages at peak velocity indicated by vertical lines (girls left, boys right).

tables 5 and 6 explore how age at peak height velocity affects the mean growth pattern. for this, individuals were split into nine equal size groups according to their timing random effect, and sitar models were fitted to each group by sex. thus the groups represent the spectrum from early to late puberty. table 5 shows that the groups all have the same number of ∼580 individuals, but the early and late groups have consistently more data points and are also consistently more variable (with less variance explained, larger residual sds, and larger size and intensity random effect sds) than the central groups.

table 6 confirms that the groups are clearly ranked by mean apv, with 2.5 to 3 years between the earliest and latest groups. age at takeoff shows a weaker trend, particularly in boys, but velocity at takeoff is strongly and inversely related to apv in both sexes. pv also falls with increasing apv. those maturing late are consistently taller at age 19, by 4 cm in girls and 5 cm in boys compared to the earliest maturers.

figures 9 (girls) and 10 (boys) visualise the mean height and height velocity curves for the groups in tables 5 and 6. they are derived in two distinct ways – a) as predicted by the global sitar models based on the group mean random effects for size, timing and intensity, and b) as fitted by the local group-specific sitar models.

figure 9. sitar mean height and height velocity curves for alspac girls, split into nine groups by age at peak height velocity. the left panels are predictions from the global model, while on the right are the group-specific mean curves.

the global and local height curves in figures 9 and 10 are very similar in shape, indicating that sitar has done a good job of predicting mean height by age across the spectrum of apv. however the height velocity curves are less so; the global curves are very consistent in shape and show a clear trend downwards with increasing apv (this trend arises from the use of a log age transformation, and had age been used instead predicted pv would be essentially the same across groups). the local curves, in contrast, vary considerably in terms of velocity and curve shape near the peak, but also in the shape of the curve prior to takeoff.

figure 10. sitar mean height and height velocity curves for alspac boys, split into nine groups by age at peak height velocity. the left panels are predictions from the global model, while on the right are the group-specific mean curves.

the global velocity curves show velocity falling slowly until takeoff, whereas with the local curves velocity prior to takeoff falls dramatically in girls and rises then falls in boys. this subsidiary peak in boys around age 9 years can also be seen in the height curves, where there is an upward “bulge” for the later groups. the reason why these patterns are not reflected in the global curves is because they feature in only some of the groups, and averaged across groups they disappear.

it is possible that the differences in velocity, particularly prior to takeoff, arise from sampling error and are not biologically meaningful. to test this the nine apv groups are each split into five further groups by individual intensity random effects i.e. pv, so splitting them into independent groups of faster and slower growers with the same apv. figures 11 (girls) and 12 (boys) show the local velocity curves for these 9 × 5 = 45 groups by sex, where to aid navigation, each facet shows the global mean velocity curve in grey. the figures confirm two things; that mean pv is greater in those whose intensity random effect is greater, and that velocity prior to takeoff does indeed vary systematically in shape according to apv. this is particularly marked for boys, where the facets for the first two apv groups show no sign of a pre-takeoff peak, whereas the later facets show an increasingly obvious peak at around age 9 years, largely independent of apv. for girls there is just the hint of a pre-takeoff peak in the latest maturing facet. each of the 45 models in these figures is based on ∼115 individuals, providing strong independent evidence for the existence of a “midgrowth” spurt at age 9 in later-maturing boys.

discussion
study findings
the study has confirmed the complexity of linear growth in puberty, driven as it is by individual variation in – tanner’s term - the “tempo of growth”. this shows itself as variability in the intensity and timing of growth, i.e. pv and the age when pv occurs. the results show that the sitar growth curve model works well with growth in puberty, because it explicitly estimates these two parameters in individuals, along with a third parameter representing their mean size. simpkin et al. compared several alternative growth curve models for height in puberty, and they also concluded that sitar was useful in providing unbiased estimates of age at peak height velocity (simpkin et al. 2017).

but that said, the more detailed alspac analysis has brought to light the existence of a midgrowth spurt at around 9 years in the later-maturing boys. by its nature it is hard to see unless the data are sufficiently numerous to disaggregate.

harpenden growth study
the harpenden growth study is an important resource, not only for the biological insights arising from the data, but also for the way they demonstrate reg whitehouse’s auxological skill. the lexis diagram (figure 1) shows how tanner and whitehouse set about obtaining the study children they needed, with many recruited at the outset in 1949 and followed up for 10 or more years, while other older early recruits dropped out soon afterwards. tanner and whitehouse continued to recruit children steadily over the next twenty years, typically at ages between 4 and 13 years, and tanner went on to use the study data in several seminal papers (tanner et al. 1966; marshall and tanner 1969, 1970; tanner et al. 1976).

mean growth curves
the good fit of sitar is demonstrated by the proportion of variance it explains. taking as a baseline the data treated cross-sectionally, i.e. ignoring the repeated measures component, and then adding the three sitar random effects, explains over 90% and up to 99.5% of the variance (table 1), leaving a small component corresponding to the residual sd. in harpenden the residual sd ranges from 0.5 cm for height down to 0.08 cm for knee and elbow width, while proportionally height is the least noisy of the measurements, its residual cv being only 0.3% versus 1.3% for knee and elbow. this reflects the fact that variability consists of two components: biological variation which scales with the measurement (i.e. the sd is proportional to size), and measurement error which is scale-invariant (in cm units) and hence relatively larger for small measurements. for height in alspac the residual sd was 1.0 cm, twice that in harpenden, reflecting the trade-off in measurement quality between a small study with a single (excellent) auxologist and the necessarily larger-scale and hence noisier measuring regime in a cohort the size of alspac.

an obvious strength of the harpenden study is the opportunity it provides to compare the growth patterns of ten distinct linear measurements, ranging in size from height (median 148 cm) to elbow width (6 cm), a thirty-fold range (see tables 1–3 and figure 3). tanner also analysed five of the measurements in 55 boys and 35 girls (tanner et al. 1976), tabulating mean (sd) age at takeoff, apv, pv and final size by sex. despite the smaller sample size his results were very similar to those in table 3; final size agreed to within 0.3 cm except for boys’ height (0.5 cm), and similarly for apv to within 0.3 years. however, his correlations between the apvs of the five variables were implausibly larger – median 0.92 and maximum 0.97 - than the equivalent correlations for the timing random effects in supplementary table 1.

mean velocity as a percentage
it has already been noted how variability scales across the measurements, but comparing the growth curves is complicated as the peak velocities are so different (table 3). plotting the data on a log scale (figure 4), which converts velocity to percentage units, is a simple way to adjust for the differences in scale and allows the growth curves to be compared directly. the spacings between the measurement curves are similar in boys and girls, the one obvious exception being thigh circumference which is relatively larger for girls after puberty.

figure 6 compares velocity in percentage units in the two sexes. expressing velocity this way is novel, the more usual units being cm per year, but it is particularly useful here for comparing measurements on the different scales.

figure 6 and table 3 show that peak percent velocity is strongly conserved, with all except arm and thigh circumference in the narrow range of 4–6% per year, on average about 0.5% greater for boys than girls. however figure 6 and table 3 also show that the shapes of the velocity curves differ in detail between measurements, with sex differences in pv, apv and age at takeoff making each measurement profile unique.

sitting height and leg length provide an interesting contrast in growth pattern. prior to puberty, leg length grows fastest and sitting height slowest in both sexes. so during this period leg length increases progressively as a proportion of height. the two are similar in pv at around 4/5 cm per year in girls/boys, but at takeoff sitting height velocity is 1 cm per year lower than for leg length (figure 5). figures 3 and 5 show that sitting height continues growing well after leg length growth has ceased, and in boys it continues to age 19 and beyond. also the size random effect sd is appreciably larger for leg length than sitting height (5.4% vs 3.2%, table 2), so there is greater variability in leg length. thus the two components of height grow in rather different ways during childhood.

the two circumferences, thigh and arm, behave differently from the eight lengths and widths. they have the largest percent peak velocities (for arm in boys and thigh in girls) and amongst the smallest velocities at takeoff. so the intensity of the circumference growth spurt (i.e. the increase in velocity from takeoff to peak) is particularly high, presumably due to the fact that it measures not just bone but also soft mass, which accumulates faster than bone. this fits with the residual cvs and the intensity random effect sds for the circumferences being more than twice those for the other measurements (tables 1 and 2).

comparing random effects
thus far the discussion has focussed on the shapes of the sitar mean curves and velocity curves. the other component of the sitar model is the set of subject random effects that indicate how the growth curves of individuals differ from the mean curve. table 2 shows that the sd for the size random effect is more uniform when presented as the percent cv rather than the sd in cm units. this represents the variability of each measurement once timing and intensity have been adjusted for, so it reflects the variability when growth has ceased i.e. in adulthood.

this population cv is equivalent to that estimated for growth references using the lms method (cole and green 1992), where the cv is the “s” in “lms”. thus for height in the british 1990 reference (cole et al. 1998) the s value at age 19 is 3.9% for boys and 3.7% for girls, closely similar to the 3.7%/3.8% in table 2. the corresponding alspac values are 3.7% and 3.6% (table 4). dangour’s leg length and sitting height growth references (dangour et al. 2002) give s values at age 19 of 5.4% for leg length and 4.6% for sitting height (averaged by sex), agreeing well with the cv for leg length but not for sitting height in table 2 (5.4% and 3.2%). tanner’s analysis of a subset of the harpenden data gave cvs for adult size broadly similar to the size cvs in table 2 (tanner et al. 1976). in harpenden sitting height is by far the least variable of all the measurements, whereas leg length is amongst the most variable (excepting the circumferences).

the timing random effect sds in table 2 are all (again with the exception of the circumferences) close to one year, the median being 1.0 years. for height they are 0.86/0.87 years in the two sexes, matching closely tanner’s experience – “the sd of age at phv is a little less than 1 year in nearly all published series; we have taken the value 0.9 years” (tanner and davies 1985). in alspac the two sds are slightly more varied at 0.81 and 0.89 years (table 4).

the intensity random effect reflects the individual’s proportional difference in pv relative to the mean. so the intensity sd is effectively the cv for pv, or multiplied by 100 the percent cv for pv. the values for the intensity sd in table 2 show it to be related to size, with the smallest values for height and leg length (0.12–0.13) and the largest (excepting the circumferences) for knee width and elbow width (0.2–0.3).

with multiple measurements available, it is obvious to ask if individuals tend to be similar in their random effects across measurements, i.e. do they tend to be consistently large/small, or early/late, or fast/slow in their growth pattern. this is addressed by looking at the correlations between measurements for each random effect by sex, as seen in supplementary table 1. the variables in the correlation matrices are sorted to put highly correlated measurements next to each other, which has the effect of migrating large coefficients towards the diagonal and small correlations away from it. the most strongly associated measurements are height and leg length (unsurprisingly, as leg length is a component of height) but more surprisingly the next most associated measurement is not sitting height but foot length (it ranks third three times and fourth twice in supplementary table 1). why such a distal measurement should be closely correlated with height is something of a mystery – perhaps it represents a link between leg length and foot length. as expected from what has gone before, the two circumferences are consistently last in the rankings, being similar to each other but different from all the other variables.

alspac
the alspac study design involved nine data sweeps spaced one to two years apart (figure 7). this has been shown to be close to the optimal design for studying pubertal growth, as annual or biennial measurements minimise the data collection while retaining relevant information on the mean curve and subject random effects (cole 2018). on these grounds one could argue that the 3-monthly measurement regime used in harpenden was unnecessarily intensive.

the sitar models for alspac by sex appear in figure 8 and table 4. they can be compared directly to the sitar models described by frysz et al. (2018) which were fitted to a selected subset of alspac data from age 5 to 20 years. thus they had 45,065 measurements on 2688 boys and 3019 girls, as against 64,898 points, 5227 boys and 5183 girls here (table 4). despite the disparities in sample size their mean (sd) apvs were very similar to those here: girls 11.7 (0.8) and boys 13.6 (0.9) years, as against 11.7 (0.9) and 13.5 (0.8) years (table 4). and similarly for pv: 7.7 (0.8)/10.0 (1.1) there and 7.7 (0.8)/10.6 (1.2) here (table 4). the percentage of variance explained was close to 98% in all four models, and the two sets of random effect sds were also very similar. frysz et al. restricted their sample to individuals with at least one measurement in each of the age groups 5-<10, 10-<15 and 15 < 20 years. the fact that the results are effectively the same without applying this filter indicates that the filtering is unnecessary, and that results based on the whole sample are unbiased. in addition, the increased numbers allow for a mean curve with 6 d.f. rather than the 5 used by frysz, which may explain the greater boys pv here of 10.6 cm versus 10.0 cm per year.

comparing mean predicted adult height in alspac and harpenden demonstrates the secular trend in height from 1949 to 1991, a period of 42 years between their median dates of birth. height at age 19 increased by 5 cm in boys and 2 cm in girls over that time, corresponding to trends of 1.1 and 0.5 cm per decade respectively. however the harpenden children were of lower social class than in alspac, and this may have exaggerated the trend. for comparison trends from the flemish 2009 growth reference were 1.2 and 0.8 cm per decade (roelants et al. 2009), and for the finnish 2011 reference 0.6 cm per decade in both sexes (saari et al. 2011).

a strength of sitar is its ability to sort individuals by apv (simpkin et al. 2017). thus it is easy to use the global model to split the ten thousand alspac children into nine groups by sex, based on their timing random effects, and then analyse these local groups separately. the results in tables 5 and 6 and figures 9 and 10 confirm that the local group curves (top right in each figure) are not only correctly ranked by mean apv, but are also very similar in shape to the curves predicted from the global models (top left).

table 5 shows that despite having equal numbers of subjects, the central groups have fewer measurements and are generally less noisy than the more extreme groups. this is due to the group membership being based on individual timing random effects, and individuals with relatively few points have their random effect shrunk towards the mean of zero (in the extreme case of an individual with just one measurement, their timing random effect is zero). thus the central groups have fewer measurements per subject on average, and also less opportunity to generate residual variation.

it is noticeable with the predicted velocity curves (figures 9 and 10, bottom left) that pv falls steadily as apv rises; this is due to the sitar model using log age rather than age, which provides a better fit as apv is negatively correlated with pv as previously discussed (cole et al. 2014). tanner also documented a negative correlation between apv and pv in his harpenden analysis (tanner et al. 1976). this same trend can be seen with the locally estimated velocity curves (bottom right), particularly in boys, though the curves are more ragged. note that in girls the agreement between the global and local velocity curves is generally close.

however for boys two features of the local velocity curves are absent from the global curves – the later apv groups show a peak in velocity at around 8.5 years that the earlier apv groups lack, and several of the curves dip below zero velocity approaching age 20, indicating predicted mean adult height falling over time. the early velocity peak is also seen in the height curves (top right, figure 10) as an upward bulge at age 9, restricted to the older apv groups. the two features occur at the extremes of age and show that sitar is less effective at modelling these extremes.

the negative velocity curves may arise from the timing of the final data sweep at age 17. it is clear from figure 7 that the data are sparse after age 18.5, and it would require only slight downward bias to tip the mean curve slopes negative.

figures 11 (girls) and figures 12 (boys) show each apv group split into five pv groups. the individual girls curves are generally similar in shape, although a few dip below zero velocity at age 19. however the boys curves show a remarkable spectrum of curve shapes, ranging from the earliest and fastest growing (top curve, top left facet) to the latest and slowest growing (bottom curve, bottom right facet).

the peak in velocity at age 9, seen consistently in the later apv groups of figure 12, looks like a midgrowth spurt, but this term has already been applied to a spurt documented as occurring nearer age 7 than 9 (tanner and cameron 1980; gasser et al. 1985; remer and manz 2001). the data analysed here start at age 7 and so are not able to detect a spurt that early. whether this age 9 peak is just a delayed version of the age 7 peak, or whether it is novel, would need further analysis to unpick.

figure 12. sitar mean height velocity curves for alspac boys, split into nine groups by age at peak height velocity (apv) and in turn five groups by peak height velocity (pv).

to demonstrate the spectrum of height growth in boys, figure 13 shows the individual growth curves in the two extreme timing-intensity groups of figure 12, each representing 2.2% of the cohort total. their mean curves are also shown superimposed (with solid lines for the local mean and dotted lines for the predicted global mean). because they are filtered by apv and pv the individual curves are essentially parallel to each other. mean apv in the two groups is 11.5 and 15.0 years respectively, i.e. 3.5 years apart, while mean pv is 10.4 and 5.4 cm per year, a factor of two different (figure 12). yet despite these differences sitar does a reasonable job of predicting the two growth patterns from the global model (dotted lines), although it infers a growth spurt in the late curve where none exists.

figure 13. height growth curves for alspac boys with two contrasting patterns of development; left) early and fast - apv group 1 and pv group 5 (n = 116), and right) late and slow – apv group 9 and pv group 1 (n = 117). the corresponding sitar mean curves are shown as solid black lines, and the dotted lines are predicted mean curves (based on mean apv and mean pv) from the global sitar model.

this ability of sitar to identify groups of individuals with early or late apv could be exploited in cohort studies to construct specialist growth references for early and late developers. it could be done for example using all the data for the first and last groups, respectively, of figures 9 and 10 (n > 4000, table 5), and fitting growth reference centiles to them using the lms method (cole and green 1992). this would be most useful for the clinical management of constitutional growth delay, where the chart would document the growth pattern of the 11% most delayed normal children. it might also be reassuring to parents to see just how late the growth spurt can be.

however figure 13 makes clear that the late developing boys are still growing at age 19, so there would be insufficient data to extend the centiles to final height. and it should be acknowledged that tanner staging could be used instead of apv to identify the early and late groups. however apv is likely to be more accurate, being based on a growth curve rather than a single clinical assessment, and measured on a continuous rather than a five-point scale.

strengths and limitations
the study has some obvious strengths. the harpenden growth study is an important resource of very high quality growth data containing information on ten separate measurements in a cohort of children born seventy years ago, while alspac provides high quality height data on a very large number of individuals born thirty years ago. given this richness of material it is hard to identify limitations in the study design, and the analysis was thorough, though it could obviously have been extended in a number of ways.

conclusions
the analysis of growth data during puberty is greatly simplified using sitar, as the subject random effects of timing and intensity accurately characterise the tempo of growth of individuals. the analyses of data from the harpenden growth study and alspac have shed light on the growth patterns of a range of linear measurements and on the spectrum of height growth as seen in early, average and late developers.

fifty years of child height and weight in japan and south korea:
contrasting secular trend patterns analyzed by sitar

abstract
objectives japanese and south koreans have traditionally been shorter than europeans, but have recently become appreciably taller. the aim was to quantify the
secular trend patterns in height and weight growth in the two countries over 50 years
using the sitar growth curve model.
methods data on mean height and weight by sex in 1-year age groups from 1 to 20
years were obtained by decade in south korea (1965–2005) and japan (1950–2010).
the data were analyzed using sitar (superimposition by translation and rotation), which estimates a mean curve and three adjustments–size, timing and
intensity–reflecting how the individual surveys differ from the mean. a sensitivity
analysis compared results for the japanese data based on cohort as well as period.
results growth patterns in the two countries changed dramatically over the study
period, affecting not only height and weight but also developmental age, in that the
growth period advanced in timing and shrank in duration. sitar fitted the data well.
the trends were larger in south korea than japan, and puberty timing in japan stabilized by 1970. most of the height increment seen in adults had already accrued by
age 1.5 years, whereas the adult weight increment accrued throughout childhood.
conclusions the secular height trend in these countries represents increased growth
in the long bones during infancy, so it can be viewed as the inverse of stunting. there
are striking country differences in growth pattern, but they are not easily explained
by differences in national income, diet or lifestyle.
1 | introduction
the japanese have traditionally been much shorter in height
than their european counterparts, particularly scandinavians,
though they have experienced a dramatic secular increase
in height since world war ii (matsumoto, 1982). tanner,
hayashi, preece, and cameron (1982) showed this to be due
primarily to an increase in leg length, possibly arising from
the shift from rice to a dairy-based diet during the 1970s.
south korea is another east asian country whose inhabitants are materially shorter than in the west—indeed in 1978
south korean children were shorter even than the japanese (y.
s. kim, 1982). however they, like the japanese, have
experienced a steep increase in height in recent decades, and
they are now taller than the japanese (j. y. kim et al., 2008;
mori, 2017). furthermore, south koreans are among the tallest
peoples in the asian continent (schwekendiek & jun, 2010),
and south korean women are 20 cm taller now than they were
a century ago, a larger increase over the period than any other
group (ncd risk factor collaboration, 2016).
it is of interest that these two neighboring countries have,
over a similar period of time, experienced remarkable secular
increases in height, and yet in detail the patterns of change
have been very different, with the south koreans “leapfrogging” over the japanese, by starting out shorter and ending up taller.

the secular trend in height as seen in children combines
two distinct processes: not only does height itself increase,
but the age at peak height velocity in puberty gets earlier,
due to accelerated maturation. thus, over a period of time,
the curve of mean height plotted against age shifts upwards,
and at the same time it shifts to the left.
the recently developed sitar growth curve model provides a way to examine these components of the secular trend
in more detail (cole, donaldson, & ben-shlomo, 2010). it
does this by explicitly modeling the two separate components
of the growth curve: increasing size and accelerating maturation. it can also be applied to “growth curves” based on mean
height by age in representative cross-sectional samples, where
“individuals” correspond to particular surveys.
the way sitar works is to summarize the pattern of
growth in individuals as a mean growth curve plus a set of
adjustments for individuals that transform the mean curve to
match their individual curve. the three transforming adjustments reflect differences between individuals in size (mean
height), timing (or tempo, similar to age at peak height
velocity), and intensity (similar to peak height velocity).
when modeling the secular trend, the adjustment of size
represents the change in adult height, while the adjustments
of timing and intensity reflect the change in rate of maturation. thus, the secular trend can be decomposed into three
separate components. the technique represents an extension
of the approach by ali, lestrel, and ohtsuka (2000) who
analyzed growth curves of japanese height over eight decades using kernel regression, and identified turning points on
the curves reflecting age at take-off and age at peak velocity.
this article aims to decompose the secular trends in height
and weight among japanese and south korean children and
young people over long periods of time (40 years in south
korea, 1965–2005, and 60 years in japan, 1950–2010), and to
show how the trends can be explained in terms of countryspecific changes in sitar size, timing, and intensity.
2 | methods
2.1 | data
mean values of height (cm) and weight (kg) for boys and
girls, tabulated in 1-year age groups from 1 to 20 completed
years, were obtained from national samples of child anthropometry. half a year was added to each year group age to
reflect mean age. the data represent periods, i.e., children
measured in particular years, not cohorts of children born in
the same year. south korean data were available only for the
years 1965, 1975, 1984, 1997, and 2005 (j. y. kim et al.,
2008), while the japanese data came from annual national
nutrition surveys carried out between 1949 and 2011 by the
japanese ministry of health and welfare (latterly ministry of
health, labor and welfare)—see funatogawa, funatogawa,
nakao, karita, and yano (2009) for details. the south
korean surveys were very large, with each age group mean
based on 15,000 to 60,000 children, while the japanese samples were much smaller, ranging in size from 500 to 3500
for all ages 1–20 years. to make the two datasets more similar, the japanese data were merged in 3-year groups at 10–
year intervals as follows: 1949–1951, 1959–1961, 1969–
1971, 1979–1981, 1989–1991, 1999–2001 and 2009–2011.
supporting information tables s1–s4 give the mean values by age group, sex, country and year of measurement,
and figure 1 shows the corresponding period growth curves
for height and weight (discussed in more detail later).
2.2 | sitar growth curve model
sitar (superimposition by translation and rotation) is a
shape-invariant mixed effects growth model (cole et al.,
2010). it fits a mean curve to the data as a natural cubic bspline, on the assumption that the growth curves of individuals (i.e., individual surveys here) differ from this mean curve
shape in just three ways, corresponding to three subjectspecific transformations. the three transformations are size,
i.e., how tall individuals are relative to the mean; timing, i.e.,
their relative timing of the pubertal growth spurt based on
the age at peak velocity, and intensity, the relative rate at
which they pass through childhood and puberty. intensity is
effectively a measure of accelerated developmental age, in
that biological time passes faster when development is
advanced and slower when it is delayed.
the geometric impact of the three sitar transformations on individual growth curves, reflecting how they differ
from the mean curve, is as follows: they are shifted up/down
(size, reflecting the curve being above or below average size)
or left/right (timing, corresponding to early or late timing),
and the age scale is stretched/shrunk (intensity, this transformation having the effect of making the curve respectively
shallower or steeper, a positive value indicating advanced
growth). the transformations are in units of cm or kg (for
size), years (timing) and percentage (intensity). so for example a height curve with size 15 cm, timing 20.5 years and
intensity 14% indicates that the individual is 5 cm taller as
an adult, peaks in velocity 6 months earlier and completes
growth 4% faster than the mean curve. using their fitted
transformations, individual curves can be back-transformed
to match the mean curve; if the model fits well the adjusted
curves will all be superimposed (hence the name sitar).
the sitar model was fitted in the statistical language r
version 3.3.2 (r core team, 2015) using the sitar package
version 1.0.9 (cole, 2016). four separate models were fitted,
for height and weight in boys and girls, with the seven surveys by decade for japan and five for south korea treated as
12 individual growth curves. the sexes were analyzed separately due to their differing mean curve shapes.
the transformations size, timing and intensity were estimated as random effects, with zero mean, included in the
model along with corresponding fixed effects. for presentation intensity was multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage. the goodness of fit was measured as the percentage
of variance explained by adding the random effects to a simpler model fitting just the mean curve (cole, pan, & butler,
2014).
2.3 | optimizing the sitar model
the sitar models were optimized by choosing the degrees
of freedom for the cubic b-spline curve to minimize the
bayesian information criterion or bic (schwarz, 1978). the
fitted curves had either 6, 7, or 8 degrees of freedom, with
knots placed at the corresponding age quantiles.
other models were explored, optimized by transforming
the age and/or size scales. the main model summarizes the
differences between surveys on the age and size scales in
absolute terms, e.g., shifting the height growth curve
upwards by say 5 cm, or shifting it left by say 0.5 years;
these adjustments are the same at all ages. if instead age and/
or size are logarithmically transformed, then the predicted
effects at each age are proportional rather than absolute, e.g.,
shifting the curve up or shifting it left by say 4%; in absolute
terms these adjustments are smaller at younger ages. the
square root transformation is intermediate between linear and
log, and hence is midway between absolute and proportional
effects. all three transformations were explored in sensitivity
analyses, with the fitted curves back-transformed for presentation purposes.
2.4 | velocity curves
the first derivative of the (back-transformed if necessary)
growth curve shows the difference in size by year of age, a
measure of growth, which for convenience is here termed the
“velocity” curve (although based on cross-sectional rather
figure 1 growth curves for height (left) and weight (right) by country and year of measurement, boys (above) and girls (below)
than longitudinal data). the area under the velocity curve
corresponds to the total increment in size, and so the curve is
useful to illustrate how the sitar effects of timing and
intensity impact on size at each age. sensitivity analyses
explored which transformations of the measurement and age
scales best captured the secular changes in the velocity
curve.
2.5 | cohort versus period
height and weight in the two countries were tabulated by
age and year of measurement. analysing the data in this
form assumes that the growth pattern depends only on the
period, the time when the measurement was made. however,
the time when the children were born—their birth cohort—
could also be relevant, so that both year of birth and year of
measurement may affect the growth curve’s shape.
the japanese data being available annually allowed
growth curves to be constructed both by cohort (i.e., successive years of age for a given year of birth cohort correspond
to successive years of measurement)—see funatogawa,
funatogawa, nakao, karita, and yano (2009)—as well as by
period. (note though that this was not possible for the
korean data, which were available only by decade of measurement, so the primary country comparison here is necessarily based on period.)
if one assumes that the secular trend in growth is monotonic (i.e., that it does not change direction at any point),
then the cohort and period approaches will lead to broadly
similar results—children of later-born cohorts and later measurement years will be taller and heavier than for earlier
cohorts and measurement years. however, it is not clear how
the trends in the corresponding sitar parameters might differ when viewed the two ways.
as a sensitivity analysis the japanese growth curves
were analyzed both by period and by cohort, to see how the
sitar growth parameters were affected; to do this the
“period” curve for a given measurement date was compared
with the “cohort” curve for the birth cohort born 11 years
earlier (e.g., those born in 1939 were compared with those
measured in 1950; this ensured that in mid-1950 the mean
age of the cohort was 11.0, matching that for the period dataset). the cohort data were inevitably incomplete for the early
and late years.
3 | results
3.1 | height and weight in japan
and south korea
figure 1 shows the growth curves for height (left) and
weight (right) in boys (above) and girls (below). each
quadrant contains 12 curves, i.e., the seven surveys in japan
(solid lines) and five in south korea (dashed lines). there
was a clear secular trend to increasing height and weight
over time, with japan shortest and lightest in 1950, and
south korea tallest and heaviest in 2005.
there was also an obvious secular trend to earlier maturation, with the curves shifting to the left over time. to
express these differences in terms of size, timing and intensity, separate sitar models were fitted to each quadrant of
figure 1.
figure 2a illustrates the model fit for height in boys and
girls, where the 12 boys’ curves are shown in black and the
12 girls’ curves in red, and the two countries are indexed by
line type. the individual curves by sex are all superimposed,
with 97% of the variance in figure 1a,c explained, indicating
that the models fit well. the mean curve shapes for the two
sexes, with the girls (red) spurting earlier but ending up
shorter than the boys (black), are clearly visible.
the other three quadrants in figure 2 illustrate the random effect estimates of sitar size, timing and intensity for
each of the 12 surveys, indicated by the year label and country color (japan black, south korea red), and joined by lines
to indicate the temporal trend. the values for boys and girls
are plotted against each other, and the diagonal line of equality demonstrates that the values for the two sexes are very
similar.
mean height size (figure 2b) increased by about 8 cm in
japan and 5 cm in south korea (for both sexes) over the
period of study. note that this is after adjusting for concurrent trends in timing and intensity, so it reflects the increase
in adult height. however, the bulk of the increase occurred
before 1980 in japan and after 1984 in south korea (in
1980/1984 the two countries were similar in height). in addition japan showed no change from 1990 to 2010, an indication that the secular trend had stopped, whereas in south
korea mean height increased slightly from 1997 to 2005.
figure 2c compares the timing of puberty in the different
surveys, where again the two sexes were in close agreement.
however, there was a dramatic difference between the two
countries in that japan showed virtually no change in timing
after 1970, whereas in south korea puberty occurred 6
months earlier in 2005 than in 1997. ali et al. (2000) also
found that in japan, age at peak height velocity plateaued
after 1970.
finally figure 2d compares growth intensity in the two
countries, where the sexes are again almost identical. intensity increased by 15% over the period, this indicating by how
much the duration of growth had shrunk. however, the
increase was more rapid in south korea, occurring over a 40
year period as against 60 years in japan.
the results for weight are shown in figure 3. again the
sitar models fitted well (figure 3a), with 97% of variance
explained. there was more sexual dimorphism than for
height, with the size, timing and intensity effects in figures
3b-d less close to the line of equality. boys increased in size
over the period by twice as much as girls (6 vs. 1.5 kg in
japan, 7 vs. 4 kg in south korea). for timing (figure 3c) the
results again showed a greater effect in south korea than
japan, an advance of 2.5 years, and within japan the effect
was greater in girls than boys. weight intensity (figure 3d)
showed a similar pattern to size, increasing more in south
korea than in japan, and in boys more than girls.
3.2 | height and weight increment by age
figure 4 explores the increments in height and weight by age
and sex in the two countries over the period of study, i.e., 60
years for japan and 40 years for south korea. the increments are strongly age-dependent, depending as they do on
the underlying changes in size, timing and intensity; thus,
the maximum increments occurred in puberty, at around 14
years in boys and 12 years in girls. figure 4 shows both the
observed increments and those predicted by the sitar models, and the two agree well. the increments at age 20 indicate the adult secular trends, and the adult height increments
were appreciably greater for japan than south korea, reflecting how short the japanese were in 1950. conversely the
weight increments were greater in south korea.
there is a particular interest in the size of the height increment in early life, as it has been suggested that the size increment as seen in adults is accrued as early as age 2 (cole,
2000a). the youngest infants (mean age 1.5 years) were 5 cm
taller at the end of the period than at the start (figure 4a,c).
this is the same as the adult increments in south korea, but
slightly less than in japan (10 cm in boys and 7 cm in girls).
so in south korea the 5 cm increment in adult height
had already been accrued by 1.5 years, whereas in japan an
extra 2–5 cm in height was gained during childhood after
infancy.
figure 2 sitar summary of height growth by sex, country and year of measurement: (a) sitar-adjusted height curves (boys black, girls red);
(b) changes in size (cm) for boys plotted against girls (japan black, korea red); (c) changes in timing (years) similarly; and (d) changes in intensity (%)
similarly. see text for details
with weight, the adult increments were much smaller for
girls than boys in both countries. the early life increments
were all considerably smaller for weight than for height. for
japanese girls the adult weight increment matched that in
early life, while for south korean girls, and boys in both
countries, it was greater.
3.3 | secular trends in height velocity
figures 2–4 confirm the good fit of the model to changes in
size over time. a more subtle aspect of model fit is the shape
of the predicted velocity curve and how it changes over time.
this is explored in figure 5 for height velocity in south
korea, and in figure 6 for weight velocity in japan.
figure 5 contrasts two alternative sitar height models
(left and right) for boys (above) and girls (below). the models on the left are those for height versus age as already discussed, while on the right are better fitting models with age
on the square root scale, where the bic is 30–50 units
smaller (and hence better fitting). the figures contrast the
predicted height velocity curves in 1965 and 2005, showing
how puberty advanced over time.
the simpler models (left) imply that before age 10 velocity
was greater in 2005, whereas the optimal models (right) show
it was unchanged from 1965. this reinforces the impression
from figure 4 that height velocity after infancy did not change
over the period. the corresponding figure for japan (not
shown) indicated that height velocity up to age 10 was slightly
greater in 2010 than in 1950, which accords with the observed
secular increase in height in japan beyond 1.5 years.
figure 6 looks at weight velocity in japan similarly. it is
clear in all four quadrants that weight velocity before age 10
was considerably greater in 2005 than in 1965, thus explaining the observed secular trend in weight. however, the better
fitting models (log weight and square root age, bic 80
units less, on the right) show that this applied much less to

peak weight velocity in puberty, which did not change
materially.
3.4 | cohort versus period
as a sensitivity analysis, figure 7 compares the japanese boys
height growth curves as defined by cohort and by period.
figure 7a contrasts the two mean curves, where the
cohort curve (solid red line) is lower than the period curve
(solid black line) at younger ages but higher at older ages.
this is because within each cohort, the younger and older
ages correspond to earlier and later measurement dates,
whereas the corresponding period data are all measured at
the same time. the net effect is to make the mean cohort
curve steeper, so the peak height velocity for cohort in
figure 7a (dashed red line) is greater than for period (dashed
black line). this is equivalent to increased intensity for the
cohort curve, i.e., the age scale is foreshortened.
figures 7b-d compare the corresponding trends over time
in the sitar effects for size, timing and intensity by cohort
and period. although there are differences, the size and timing effects are broadly similar the two ways, lying close to
the dotted line of equality. however, the intensity trend is
much steeper for period, the range of values being twice that
for cohort (15% vs. 7%). a similar though less extreme pattern was seen for girls height and boys and girls weight (data
not shown). this confirms that the main difference between
cohort and period curves lies in the sitar intensity parameter, the secular trend in intensity for the cohort curves being
as little as half that for the period curves.
4 | discussion
the results demonstrate the dramatic secular trends in child
height and weight that have taken place in japan and south
figure 4 increments by age for height (left) and weight (right) in japan (1950 to 2010, black) and south korea (1965 to 2005, red), boys (above)
and girls (below). the increments are shown observed (solid lines) and predicted by sitar (dashed lines)
korea during the past 40–60 years. the trend has been
appreciably greater in south korea, where the children were
shorter and lighter than in japan in 1965, but taller and heavier in 2005.
the results also show how well sitar summarizes the
secular changes in growth pattern, with over 97% of the variance between surveys being explained by differences in
mean size, growth timing and intensity. this emphasizes that
the secular changes over time that occurred in height and
weight, which one might think were simply a reflection of
increasing body size, were also driven by similar changes on
the developmental age scale—earlier puberty and faster
passage.
the results demonstrate in three distinct ways how well
sitar represents the changing growth patterns in the two
countries. in figures 2a and 3a, the individual survey growth
curves are all superimposed after sitar adjustment, with
the curves for the two sexes clearly distinct. in figure 4 the
increments over 40 or 60 years are well characterized by the
sitar models, and in figures 5 and 6 the changes in velocity curve shape over time are convincingly captured.
the sitar analysis adjusts mean height and weight for
differences in the timing and intensity of growth. for this
reason the mean size results in figures 2b and 3b directly
reflect the corresponding secular trends in adult size, i.e.,
after growth has stopped. for height, they show that in japan
the growth pattern did not change after 1997, whereas in
south korea it continued changing up until 2005.
a similar picture emerges for weight, with much larger
secular changes in growth pattern among south koreans
than japanese. however weight, unlike height, is still
increasing in japan. there is also sexual dimorphism in the
weight growth patterns, with girls changing less than boys
in terms both of size and intensity. this confirms the
figure 5 changes in height velocity curve shape for korean boys (above) and girls (below), from 1965 (red dashed lines) to 2005 (black solid
lines). the curves are predictions from sitar models of height on age (left) and height on age (right), where the latter models have lower bic and fit
better
observation by maruyama and nakamura (2015) that the
japanese gender difference in bmi secular trend was due to
a difference in the weight trend not the height trend.
tanner et al. (1982) pointed out that the japanese secular
height trend from 1957 to 1977 was driven almost entirely
by an increase in leg length. ali et al. (2000) studied secular
changes in japanese leg length for birth cohorts from 1943 to
1978, showing a steep rise in leg length as a percentage of
height from 1943 to 1968 but a plateau thereafter. in addition
they showed that this percentage increased with age until
puberty, i.e., 13 years in boys and 11 years in girls, and then
either stabilized (girls) or fell slightly (boys). thus, in terms
of length (cm) the trend in leg length was greater than the
trend in height (and even greater than the trend in sitting
height) up to puberty (though not thereafter). so the height
trend was until puberty primarily a leg length trend.
the secular increment in adult height (i.e., at age 20)
amounted to 8–10 cm in japan and 5 cm in south korea
(figure 2b). figure 4 shows how this increment developed
through childhood, and the pattern is striking; 5 cm of it, i.e.,
the majority, was already apparent at age 1.5 years, the mean
age for the youngest age group. the increment appeared to
be greater at later ages, but this reflected only more advanced
maturation. in south korea the peak increment was at age
12–14 and exceeded 15 cm, but by adulthood it had shrunk
to 5 cm, the same as at age 1.5. so there was no net increase
in height after infancy. by contrast in japan the adult increment of 8–10 cm was greater than the 5 cm increment at age
1.5, showing some growth in childhood after infancy, so the
two countries differed in this respect. the secular increment
in length at birth is known to be very small; in shanghai for
example mean birth length increased from 1985 to 2005 by
just 0.2 cm (zhang & li, 2015). so, it is reasonable to state
that in south korea the secular increase in adult height
occurred during the first 18 months of postnatal life, driven
primarily by extra growth in the long bones of the leg, which
confirms and refines the previously suggested 2 years (cole,
2000a).
figure 6 changes in weight velocity curve shape for japanese boys (above) and girls (below), from 1950 (red dashed lines) to 2010 (black solid
lines). the curves are predictions from sitar models of weight on age (left) and log weight on age (right), where the latter models have lower bic and
fit better
this, it should be noted, is the exact opposite of the malnutrition state of stunting, where infants in the first 1000
days of prenatal and postnatal life fall behind in terms of linear growth (dewey, 2016). it is tantalizing to think that the
beneficial changes over time that have driven the secular
trend to increased stature may well be the inverse of the factors that are driving linear growth retardation in millions of
poor infants.
the secular increase in adult weight was also substantial,
but rather greater in boys than girls and in south korea more
than japan (figures 3b and 4). in addition the increase
accrued throughout childhood and puberty rather than being
restricted to infancy (figure 6b,d). it is for this reason that
the best data transformation for size (as seen in figures 5
and 6) was linear for height and log for weight; the absolute
increment in height was the same in early and adult life
(figure 4), whereas for weight the proportional increment
was closer to constant—this corresponds to the log transformation (cole, 2000b).
the best data transformation for age was the square root
(figures 5 and 6). in principle one would expect differences
in developmental age to be multiplicative, corresponding to
the age scale being stretched or shrunk, and this in turn corresponds to the log age scale, as seen in the original sitar
publication (cole et al., 2010). conversely the linear age
scale would imply the whole growth curve being shifted left
or right, which could fit poorly in infancy with age becoming
negative. the square root scale is a compromise between
figure 7 sitar summary of japanese boys height by year of measurement, with growth curves constructed by period and by cohort: (a) mean
curves (period black, cohort red; height solid, velocity dashed); (b) changes in size (cm) for period plotted against cohort; (c) changes in timing (years)
similarly; and (d) changes in intensity (%) similarly. see text for details
linear and log, implying that differences on the developmental age scale are somewhere between multiplicative and
additive.
the sensitivity analysis showed that secular trends in the
sitar size and timing parameters were broadly the same
whether based on cohort or period curves. however, the
cohort-based intensity parameter changed over time only half
as fast as the period-based intensity. this can be explained
by reference to figure 7a, where the mean cohort curve
(solid red line) is slightly steeper than the mean period curve
(black). this is because within each cohort, the younger and
older ages correspond to earlier and later measurement dates,
whereas the corresponding period data are all measured at
the same time. expressed the other way round, the period
curves include some cohort information as their data are
spread across 20 birth years, with the younger children born
later and the older earlier. the net effect is that the secular
trend in intensity based on the period data is up to twice that
for the cohort data, and hence provides a biased estimate of
the cohort-based trend.
however, it is important to emphasize that the sitar
analysis, in summarizing the secular trend, does not claim to
provide any extra insight as to whether the trend is driven by
cohort or period differences. probably both apply, in that
children’s individual growth patterns are inherited in early
life (i.e., a cohort effect) but are subsequently influenced by
the changing environment (a period effect). the two effects
can be distinguished in figure 4, which shows the agespecific increments in height and weight over the period of
study. thus, it contrasts growth in children born 40–60 years
apart. in south korea, the height increment for boys and girls
was 5 cm both in infancy and in adulthood, which means
that the growth pattern did not change during childhood.
this corresponds to a cohort effect, not a period effect. however, the weight increment for south korean boys was much
greater in adulthood than in infancy (13 vs. 2 kg), indicating
a strong period effect in addition to the cohort effect. note
that these inferences could have been based either on the
observed increments in figure 4 (solid lines) or the sitar
modeled increments (dashed lines), so the sitar analysis is
useful here but not essential.
as noted at the outset, europeans have historically been
much taller than asians. the dutch are recognized as the
tallest nation, and their secular increase in height has recently
stopped (sch€onbeck et al., 2013). figure 3 of sch€onbeck
et al. (2013) shows how height in the netherlands has
increased since 1955, equivalent to figure 4 of the current
article. the adult increment amounted to 7 cm in both sexes,
but the pattern by age was quite different from figure 4. the
increment increased linearly from birth to 15 years in boys
and 11 years in girls, when the increments were respectively
10 and 8 cm, after which they fell back to 7 cm at age 20; so
there was no infant increment at all. however, the dutch in
1955 were already taller (175 and 164 cm by sex) than the
south koreans were in 2005 (sch€onbeck et al., 2013), so
both the nature of the secular trend and the factors driving it
were clearly different in the two countries.
what factors might have caused japanese and south
korean children to grow so differently from each other?
there are several possibilities: genetics (e.g., different height
potential), economic status (e.g., per capita gross domestic
product or gdp) and diet (e.g., per capita national food supply). grasgruber, sebera, hrazdira, cacek, and kalina
(2016) explored many factors that might explain the differences in male height in 105 countries. they found that gdp
was a strong predictor but national health expenditure was
stronger, as was the mortality rate for children under 5 years.
this obviously relates directly to living conditions in
infancy, when long bone growth is important. among the
strongest predictors was the human developmental index
(hdi), which had a correlation of 0.80 with adult height
based on 100 countries.
several dietary factors were predictive, notably animal
protein in the form of dairy, eggs, meat and fish, while a rice
diet was generally associated with shorter stature (grasgruber
et al., 2016). the strongest single positive influence was
dairy protein (r 5 0.79 for 93 countries), while rice had a
strongly negative effect (r 5 20.74).
so how do japan and south korea compare in terms of
these predictive factors? gdp was considerably higher in
japan than south korea, as was the hdi, while child mortality was slightly lower in japan. (however, the reviewer
points out the very different development paths taken by the
two countries—japan achieved a miracle of economic development but then stagnated after 1995, whereas korea was
initially poorer but developed and maintained strong growth,
its gdp now matching that for japan. this may well be
relevant.)
in terms of diet, south koreans ate appreciably less animal protein than japanese (17 versus 23 g/person/day protein
from dairy, eggs, pork and beef). so in all these respects
japan looks healthier than south korea, and the japanese
ought to be the taller, as predicted by grasgruber et al.
(2016) (their figure 12). schwekendiek and jun (2010)
emphasized the impact of primary school feeding programs
set up by the south korean government after the korean
war, which have continued until now. however, mori compares in detail the national income and dietary intake in the
two countries over time, and shows that as recently as 1995,
both per capita gross national income and milk intake were
three times higher in japan than in south korea (mori,
2017). mori (2017) also highlights the recent striking
increase in south korean intake of fruit and vegetables, at a
time when japanese intake has fallen, particularly among the
young, and this may explain the recent increase in south
korean height.
in conclusion, child height and weight have increased
dramatically over the past 40–60 years in japan and south
korea. the changes have affected both size (i.e., cm and kg)
and developmental age, in that the growth period has
advanced in timing and shrunk in duration. most of the
height increment seen in adults has already accrued by age
1.5 years, indicating that the secular height trend in these
countries (though not in the netherlands) represents
increased growth in the long bones during infancy. the
trends have been larger in south korea than japan, but there
are no convincing differences in national income, diet or lifestyle to explain them.

what predicts intergenerational change in anthropometry?

it is a truth universally acknowledged, that children
now are taller, heavier and fatter than their parents
and grandparents were. trends in adult height over
the past 100 years have recently been documented in
detail by the ncd risk factor collaboration, comparing
mean adult height by sex in 200 countries between 1896
and 1996 [1]. some countries have seen height increase by
up to 20 cm. in addition, the pace of growth in childhood
has accelerated, so that adult height is now reached at an
earlier age. this has the effect of inflating the apparent
increase in height during childhood, as children of a
particular age are both taller and more advanced in
developmental age [2]. weight has also been increasing in
line with height; but over the past half-century, it has
outstripped height, and this has led to the secular trend of
rising body mass index (bmi) and the public health
concerns of increasing obesity.
documenting these secular trends in child growth
usually involves comparing anthropometry in crosssectional studies at different times; for example national
surveys carried out every 10 or 15 years [3,4]. it is unusual
to be able to make a direct comparison of the growth of
children with their parents.
the article by sinha, et al. [5] in this issue of indian
pediatrics uses an interesting and unusual
intergenerational study design to do just that – the growth
patterns of children born around 1970 and recruited to the
new delhi birth cohort were compared with those of their
own children as measured more recently. the comparisons
focussed on the age groups 0-5 and 5-10 years, where the
outcomes were the intergenerational z-score changes in
height, weight and bmi, adjusted for age and sex. the
findings were striking – over the follow-up period, the
children increased in height by a whole standard deviation,
corresponding to 3.9 cm in the younger children and 6.4
cm in the older. weight increased similarly, by 1.3 and 5.4
kg in the two age groups; while bmi changed only in the
older children, by 1.9 kg/m2, and in the 0-5 year group it
remained the same. the authors concluded that children
tend to “grow up” before they “grow out.”
this is one surprise, that the younger children were not
fatter than their parents were at the same age, despite the
steep rise in obesity prevalence that has occurred over the
period. but the intergenerational study design also
provided other interesting insights, some of them counterintuitive: the increases were greater for smaller and older
parents, with poorer sanitation and higher education, and
for older children. it is instructive to consider each of these
associations in turn, and to explore their relevance to
health policy. by far the strongest association was with
parental size – the secular increase was appreciably greater
for shorter parents. the authors provide three potential
explanations for this: “statistical regression to the mean,
narrowing of socio-economic inequalities and greater
biological response among deprived strata”, and they are
optimistic that it represents a reduction in height inequity.
however, they are perhaps over-optimistic, in that the
most likely explanation is the first of the three, regression
to the mean, which is a statistical not a social or biological
construct. it states simply that extreme measurements (e.g.
height) are on average less extreme on remeasurement; so
shorter parents tend to produce somewhat less short
children, and vice versa for taller parents and children. it
was first described by francis galton, working in the same
context as here, with the heights of parents and children
[6]. as a statistical phenomenon, regression to the mean is
substantial and ever-present; so it tends to dwarf any other
factors that may be operating.
the next strongest association the authors found was
with parental age; the children of older parents tended to
be relatively taller. the authors speculate that the parents
being older meant they were exposed longer to improved
living conditions, and passed this on to their children.
however, there is another more likely explanation; the
parents were all born around 1970, so if they were older
when their children were born, the children must have been
born later and hence experienced more of the underlying
secular trend. in this sense, parental age is simply a
measure of passing time, and the child’s year of birth
would have been similarly predictive.
the child’s age was another important predictor of
secular change, which was appreciably greater in the older
age group. the authors view this as a proxy for exposure
duration, but again it is more likely to be structural,
reflecting the advanced developmental age of the children
compared to their parents; so they reach milestones
relatively earlier than their parents and hence appear taller.
this effect increases with age until puberty and then
disappears once adult height is reached [7]; so one would
expect it to be greater for age 5-10 y than age 0-5 y.
the secular change in developmental age may also
explain why bmi did not increase in the 0-5 year group.
the bmi curve typically rises steeply in infancy, peaks just
before 1 year, then falls until adiposity rebound at age 4-5 y
when it rises again [8]. the advance in developmental age
shifts this pattern to the left, with both the age at bmi peak
and the age at adiposity rebound getting earlier [9,10],
independently of any secular increase in bmi. because of
its shape, the age-shifted curve is slightly lower than the
original curve at some ages (fig. 1), and this generates an
apparent fall in bmi that partially compensates for the
secular bmi rise. so, in this sense the authors are right that
children tend to “grow up” before they “grow out.”
the wash (water, sanitation and hygiene) score, was
the one socio-economic factor to have a measurable effect
on the secular change in height, weight and bmi. it
presumably means that the children brought up in better
conditions than their parents grew better as a result. weight
and bmi were also relatively greater in children whose
parents were more educated; this though looks more like
greater obesity than improved growth, as there was no
associated height effect.
in summary, the study confirms intergenerational
increases in height, weight and bmi, and identifies several
factors that predict them. however, most of the factors
reflect either statistical or biological associations that may
not be very relevant to policy. in terms of policy relevance,
only sanitation in the parent cohort impacted significantly
on the secular height trend, suggesting that improved
sanitation is a worthwhile policy goal. sanitation in the
child cohort did not show an effect, but this may be because
it has improved materially in 30 years, making its impact
harder to detect.

using super-imposition by translation and
rotation (sitar) to relate pubertal growth to
bone health in later life: the medical research
council (mrc) national survey of health and
development
abstract
background: to explore associations between pubertal growth and later bone health in a
cohort with infrequent measurements, using another cohort with more frequent measurements to support the modelling, data from the medical research council (mrc)
national survey of health and development (2–26 years, 4901/30 004 subjects/measurements) and the avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac) (5–20 years)
(10 896/74 120) were related to national survey of health and development (nshd) bone
health outcomes at 60–64 years.
methods: nshd data were analysed using super-imposition by translation and
rotation (sitar) growth curve analysis, either alone or jointly with alspac data.
improved estimation of pubertal growth parameters of size, tempo and velocity was assessed by changes in model fit and correlations with contemporary measures of pubertal
timing. bone outcomes of radius [trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vbmd)
and diaphysis cross-sectional area (csa)] were regressed on the sitar parameters, adjusted for current body size.
results: the nshd sitar parameters were better estimated in conjunction with
alspac, i.e. more strongly correlated with pubertal timing. trabecular vbmd was associated with early height tempo, whereas diaphysis csa was related to weight size, early

tempo and slow velocity, the bone outcomes being around 15% higher for the better vs
worse growth pattern.
conclusions: by pooling nshd and alspac data, sitar more accurately summarized
pubertal growth and weight gain in nshd, and in turn demonstrated notable associations between pubertal timing and later bone outcomes. these associations give insight
into the importance of the pubertal period for future skeletal health and osteoporosis
risk.
puberty is a time of dramatic change in body size and composition, driven by a complex hormonal cascade that results in rapid weight gain and height gain, the timing of
which varies widely between individuals.1 studies using
questionnaire-derived data on recalled age at menarche, a
discrete event during late puberty in girls, indicate that the
timing of puberty is influenced by both genetic2 and nongenetic factors, and that it has important relevance to later
health outcomes.3 however, the regulation of pubertal
changes in weight and height, and in particular the relevance of these growth traits to later outcomes, is difficult
to study, for two reasons: the need for serial growth measurements over much of the second decade of life, and the
need for a suitable methodology to model and summarize
the pattern of pubertal growth to relate it to later outcome.
an example of this arises in our recent report on the associations between childhood growth and bone outcomes
at 60–64 years4 in the medical research council (mrc)
national survey of health and development (nshd), a
birth cohort born in one week in march 1946 and followed
up over the subsequent 70 years.5,6 we found that greater
height and weight growth during ‘pre-puberty’ and ‘postpuberty’ were positively associated with bone size, a
predictor of fracture risk, at 60–64 years. yet, given that
30–40% of skeletal mineral is accrued within two years of
peak height velocity, it was surprising not to find stronger
associations with growth during ‘puberty’. whereas
nshd has more frequent growth measurements than
many subsequent studies, the analysis was limited by the
infrequent time-points around puberty (with just three
sweeps at the ages of 11, 15 and 20 years) which were too
sparse to easily test for associations with pubertal growth.
furthermore, the shape of the pubertal growth curve is
complex, and summarizing it in a way that is suitable to relate to potential determinants or later outcomes is not
straightforward.
in a life-course context, most studies have treated adolescent height and weight as exposures, either as single measurements (i.e. size) or as change over time (i.e. velocity), and
few have considered the maturational clock (i.e. tempo, the
timing of puberty) as an exposure, which may be confounded with size and velocity. recently, the superimposition by translation and rotation (sitar) growth
curve model has been shown to efficiently summarize pubertal growth based on these three parameters: size, velocity
and tempo.7–9 like most growth curve models, sitar
works best with frequent serial data, and this limits its use
in cohort studies that have only sparse anthropometry. the
purpose of this paper is to apply sitar to nshd growth
data, and to explore whether the sparse nature of the data
can be compensated for by augmenting them with data
from another cohort of comparable size but with more frequent measurements—the avon longitudinal study of
parents and children (alspac) cohort.10 to test whether
the sitar parameters, particularly tempo, were biologically
meaningful, we related them to contemporaneously
collected measures of pubertal timing in nshd.

stage for boys) to later bone outcomes in nshd and, in
the same sample, compares these associations with the association with height tempo derived from our sitar
model.11 the current paper documents the process for augmenting nshd with alspac data in the sitar analysis,
and then tests the hypotheses that (i) this augmented model
improves the correlations with reported pubertal status in
nshd and (ii) that the sitar effects of size, velocity and
tempo in nshd in the full sample are associated with key
bone health outcomes measured some 50 years later.11
methods
nshd
the nshd is a socially stratified birth cohort of 2547 men
and 2815 women of white european descent born during
one week in march 1946 and followed with repeated data
collections since then.5 heights and weights were measured
using standard protocols at ages 2, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 15 years,
and self-reported at ages 20 and 26 years.
pubertal timing was recorded at age 14–15 years.
mothers were asked their daughter’s age at menarche (in
months) and, where it had not yet occurred, it was imputed
(n ¼ 94) from reports of the subjects themselves who at 48
years were asked to recall their age at menarche.12 the
school doctor assessed boys for genital development, voice
breaking, pubic hair and axillary hair, leading to the fourpoint maturity scale prepubertal (1), early (2), advanced
(3) and mature (4). for this analysis, the scale was reversed, so that a lower score corresponds to earlier puberty
in both sexes.
at age 60–64 years, 1355 study members (658 men and
697 women) had a peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pqct) scan of the radius.4 among others, the
following two bone outcome measures were derived: trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vbmd, mg/cm3
)
at the distal 4% site, and diaphysis cross-sectional area
(csa, mm2
) at the 50% site.
the study received multi-centre research ethics
committee approval, and informed consent was given by
cohort participants.
alspac
the alspac is a study of children born to 15 247 pregnant women living in bristol with an expected delivery
date between april 1991 and december 1992.10 detailed
information has been collected using self-administered
questionnaires, data extraction from medical notes, and
linkage to routine information systems and at research
clinics.
childhood weight and height were measured annually
up to age 13 years, then at ages 15 and 17 years at dedicated alspac focus clinics by a trained research team.
parent-reported heights and weights were also included.
height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm and weight to
the nearest 0.1 kg. for the present analysis, data were restricted to the age range 5–20 years.
ethical approval for the study was obtained from the
alspac law and ethics committee and local research
ethics committees.
data management
the data were examined for obvious outliers, and were
further cleaned after preliminary fitting of the sitar models by excluding points with standardized residuals exceeding 3 in absolute value.
data analysis
the analysis was performed in two stages. first, the height
and weight data were analysed using sitar growth curve
analysis.7 this is a shape-invariant growth model such that
all individuals are assumed to have the same underlying
shape of growth curve, subject to three simple transformations. this mean curve is estimated along with three
subject-specific parameters termed size, tempo and velocity
that transform the mean curve to fit individual growth
curves. the size parameter for each child shifts the fitted
curve up/down, reflecting differences in size; the tempo
parameter shifts it left/right, reflecting differences in puberty timing; and the velocity parameter stretches/shrinks
the underlying age scale to make the curve shallower/
steeper, reflecting differences in growth rate. the model
fits the mean growth curve as a fixed effect natural cubic
regression b-spline with specified degrees of freedom, and
the parameters size, tempo and velocity are estimated as
fixed effects and subject-specific random effects. the
model was fitted with the nlme package13 and the first author’s sitar package in the statistical language r.14 the
sitar formula is
yit ¼ a0 þ ai þ h t  b0  bi
ec0ci
  þ eit; (1)
where yit is the measurement for subject i at age t; ai, bi
and ci are, respectively, size, tempo and velocity random
effects (along with corresponding fixed effects a0, b0 and
c0); h(.) is a cubic regression spline curve; and eit are independent normally distributed errors.
each model was fitted to the sexes separately. initially,
the models were fitted to the nshd data alone (age 2–26
years), and then again with the alspac data added (age
5–20 years). for the combined analyses, fixed effects were
included in the model to distinguish between the two cohorts, allowing the cohort differences in mean size, tempo
and velocity to be formally tested, leading to the extended
formula
yit ¼ a0 þ aalspac þ ai þ h t  b0  balspac  bi
ec0calspacci

þ eitnshd þ eitalspac; (2)
where the cohort fixed effects have subscript alspac.
this assumes that the mean curves for nshd and
alspac are the same after adjusting for the cohort fixed
effects.
in addition, different residual variances were estimated
for nshd and alspac, so that the reported residual variance refers to nshd explicitly, whether or not alspac
data were in the model. the models were found to fit better after log-transforming age, and the resulting coefficients can be multiplied by 100 and viewed as percentage
differences.15 similarly, the standard deviations (sds) of
the tempo random effects are effectively coefficients of
variation; the tempo random effects and sds are here converted to units of years by multiplying by the geometric
mean age.
the output from each sitar analysis consisted of a set
of subject-specific random effects for size, tempo and velocity, plus the corresponding fixed effects and (for the joint
models) the cohort differences, along with fixed effects for
the mean curve coefficients.
the second stage of the analysis involved just the
nshd subjects, with sitar random effects from the joint
models. their two bone outcomes were each regressed in
turn on the six sitar random effects (three for height and
three for weight), including sex as a main effect (this is
termed model 1). the outcomes were in addition adjusted
for body size: height and weight at 60–64 years (model 2).
models involving subsets of the six sitar parameters
were also fitted where the full results justified it, and sex
interactions and quadratic terms were explored, though no
clinically important effects were found. for all analyses,
the bone outcomes and weight and height at age 60–64
years were log-transformed prior to analysis for allometric
scaling purposes.
it is important to assess the potential impact of pubertal
growth on outcome, analogous to attributable risk. in the
simplest case, a model with a single sitar parameter, this
impact can be obtained directly by multiplying the regression coefficient by four times the parameter sd. this corresponds to the difference in outcome predicted for
individuals with extreme growth patterns 62 sds from the
mean for that parameter (i.e. comparing the third and
ninety-seventh centiles). as the outcomes are logged, this
difference can be multiplied by 100 and viewed as the percentage difference in outcome attributable to the contrast
between the two growth patterns.15
however, it is less obvious how to measure impact
when the model contains more than one sitar parameter,
as the parameters will be correlated, some of them highly,
and the individual coefficients cannot be interpreted in isolation. to assess the impact of multiple sitar parameters,
the following method was used: the linear predictor corresponding to the sitar parameters was derived as the sum
of the parameters after multiplying each by its regression
coefficient. this linear predictor shows how the predicted
outcome varies across the spectrum of growth as represented by the combined sitar parameters, adjusted for
other covariates in the model, and the corresponding impact is summarized as four times the sd of the linear predictor. this is a multivariate extension of the simple case,
and is the appropriate way to express the impact of the
sitar parameters as a single summary statistic.
results
sitar pubertal growth parameters in nshd
cleaning the nshd height and weight data for outliers
excluded 331 (1.1%) of 30 335 measurement occasions
from age 2 to 26 years. the remaining 30 004 measurements, for 2574 boys (15 652 measurements) and 2327
girls (14 352 measurements), were fitted to sitar models
with 5 degrees of freedom. the analyses were then repeated with the nshd data augmented with alspac data
for 5499 boys and 5397 girls, with respectively 36 560 and
37 560 measurements. the inclusion of alspac allowed
6 degrees of freedom for the mean curves in the two height
models. figures 1 and 2 show the fitted growth curves.
figure 1 compares the nshd mean curves for height
and weight by sex, estimated alone (sole—dashed lines)
and with alspac (joint—solid lines). the joint curves are
generally smoother than the sole curves, with fewer bumps,
and the sole and joint height curves are very similar in
shape, though the joint curve for boys dips slightly after
age 20 years. however, the weight curves differ materially
after age 10 years, with the sole curves steeper before age
15 years and shallower after. this implies a real difference
in the growth pattern between the two cohorts during and
after puberty, even after the sitar adjustment, with
greater weight gain in alspac.
figure 2 shows the height and weight data by sex for
alspac (grey) and nshd (black), illustrating the sparsity
of the nshd data during puberty. note that, in two of the
nshd sweeps, the measurement ages were not recorded,
and ages 2 and 20.5 years were imputed. figure 2 also
shows the mean curves for each cohort separately, as estimated with the joint model, where alspac is above and
to the left in each case (and stops at age 20 years). these
differences make clear that, in the 45 years between 1946
(nshd) and 1991 (alspac), there was a clear secular
trend to greater height, greater weight and earlier puberty.
in particular, weight in both sexes was greater for
alspac at age 19 years than for nshd at age 26 years.
cohort comparisons of sitar parameters
the differences in mean curve shape between alspac and
nshd shown in figure 2 arise from differences in the
underlying sitar size, tempo and velocity parameters,
estimated as fixed effects comparing the two cohorts.
table 1 summarizes these fixed effects, confirming that, in
general, alspac children were on average taller, heavier,
earlier into puberty and faster-growing than nshd children. the apparent exception is for girls’ weight, where the
tempo effect (corresponding to age at peak weight velocity)
was slightly later for alspac.
the velocity effect was dramatic, with growth in
alspac 7% faster for height and no less than 30% faster
for weight. it reflects sitar’s attempt to reconcile materially different curve shapes in the two cohorts. the weight
increase in alspac compared with nshd was relatively
greater during and after puberty than before, and to model
this sitar had to shrink the age scale (i.e. increase velocity) but also postpone puberty in alspac. thus, the
tempo effects probably underestimate the true differences
in puberty timing.
table 2 shows the fit of the nshd models, in terms of
the residual standard deviations (rsds) and the sds of the
sitar parameter random effects, without and with the
figure 1. mean nshd growth curves as estimated by sitar: height (above) and weight (below) in boys (left) and girls (right), estimated alone
(dashed lines) or jointly with alspac (solid lines).
alspac data, sexes pooled (n ¼ 4901). in the joint models, the rsd for height was 1.6 times larger in nshd than
in alspac for both sexes, whereas for weight it was 1.1
times larger. compared with height, the tempo sd for
weight was larger and the velocity sd three to four times
larger in nshd. the results for the sole and joint
models in table 2 are broadly similar, showing that
adding alspac did not have a dramatic effect on fit. it
slightly reduced the rsd for height, but increased it for
weight.
correlating the sitar random effects in the sole models with those in the joint models, all but one of the six correlations exceeded 0.94, so the addition of alspac had
little effect. however, for weight tempo, the correlation
was much lower at 0.68, showing that adding alspac affected weight tempo quite substantially. adding alspac
also increased the correlations between height tempo and
weight tempo, from 0.45 to 0.60 in boys and from 0.24 to
0.56 in girls, implying improved estimates, since the two
are known to be strongly correlated.16

velocity (%) 6.8 (6.0 to 7.5) 6.5 (5.8 to 7.3) 28 (26 to 30) 36 (34 to 38)
the random effects for size and velocity in each model
were very strongly correlated with each other (sole models:
0.85 for height, 0.99 for weight; joint models: 0.76 height
and 0.97 weight). these are much larger than found in a
previous sitar analysis, and probably reflect the instability of modelling nshd with sparse data.7 in contrast, the
correlations of tempo with size and velocity were all <0.2
for height, and for weight in the joint model, but for
weight in the sole model they were both much higher at
0.7. so adding alspac enabled the weight-tempo effects
to be separated from weight size and velocity. this latter
contrast probably best explains the differences between the
sole and joint models.
comparison of sitar tempo with puberty timing
table 3 shows the correlations in the nshd boys and girls
between the measures of puberty timing and the sitar parameters from the sole nshd and joint nshd–alspac
models. as expected, puberty timing correlated positively
with sitar tempo, with correlations of around 0.5
(p < 0.0001). the addition of alspac consistently
increased each correlation, only weakly for height but dramatically so for weight, where the correlation doubled,
though it was still less than for height. thus, despite the apparently small impact on the random effects of including
alspac, it appreciably improved the estimate of puberty
timing, particularly for weight. by contrast, the correlations
of puberty timing with sitar size and velocity were weak,
particularly with the joint models, as would be expected.
relation between sitar growth parameters and
bone outcomes
the influence of pubertal growth on later bone outcomes
is explored in table 4, where the outcomes are regressed
on the sitar height and weight parameters, adjusted for
sex, and in addition for height and weight at the time of
the scan. the analysis is restricted to 1321 subjects (642
men, 679 women) with complete data on sitar parameters, bone outcomes and anthropometry at age 60–64
years.
in summary, the pattern of pubertal growth has a material impact on later bone health, with or without later
body size adjustment. however, in detail, the relationships
between pubertal growth and bone health vary by
outcome.
for trabecular vbmd, height tempo is very strongly
associated (p < 0.001), its negative sign indicating that earlier puberty is associated with greater vbmd. model 1 explains 16% of the variance, and the difference in predicted
outcome for the extremes of growth represented by the
model (i.e. þ2 vs –2 sds of the linear predictor—see the
‘methods’ section) is a substantial 17.5% (table 4).

omitting the other sitar parameters from the model reduces the impact attributable to growth to 15% (not
shown), so that vbmd is 15% less in those with late as
opposed to early puberty, adjusted for sex. [this 15% figure corresponds to 4 sds of height tempo (table 2) times
its regression coefficient of –0.65 se 11.] adjusting for current body size (model 2) increases the variance explained
to 17% but hardly alters the growth impact, whereas the
growth impact attributable to height tempo alone (refitting
the model omitting the other sitar variables) is a still impressive at 13%. the sd of vbmd is 26%, so this corresponds to a half sd effect size.
conversely, for diaphysis csa, the important sitar
parameters are weight size (p ¼ 0.0002), weight velocity
(p ¼ 0.008), height size (p ¼ 0.01) and weight tempo
(p ¼ 0.05), together indicating a strong effect of pubertal
body size (table 4, model 1). the outcome is sexually dimorphic, as shown by the high t value for sex which accounts for 56% of the variance on its own, and 64%
including current body size (not shown). the impact of
growth on the outcome is 26%, falling to 15% adjusted
for current body size (model 2). the negative coefficients
for weight tempo and weight velocity mean that greater
weight, and to a lesser extent earlier puberty and slower
growth velocity, are positively associated with csa. thus,
pubertal weight growth and current body size have separate and independent effects, the former amounting to
three-quarters of an sd of csa (which is 21%).
discussion
statement of findings
the study shows that pubertal growth in nshd can be
summarized compactly in terms of subject-specific sitar
parameters, and that the addition of alspac data to the
model provides smoother mean curves and more robust estimates of the weight-tempo random effects in nshd. the
resulting sitar parameters are strongly associated with
bone health outcomes measured 50 years later; vbmd is
13% less in late maturers compared with early, and 15%
of the variance in diaphysis csa is explained by the pattern
of pubertal weight gain. the growth pattern corresponding
to later bone health is summarized by greater weight size,
earlier weight tempo and lower weight velocity (table 4).
as a subsidiary finding, the mean differences in the
sitar parameters between nshd and alspac (see
table 1) reflect marked upward secular trends in height
and weight, in terms of both size and velocity, and earlier
puberty for boys but less so for girls. indeed mean weight
tempo for girls was seven weeks later in alspac.
however, the mean curves in figure 2 show that puberty
was consistently earlier in alspac in both sexes, indicating that the large velocity effect swamped the tempo effect.
the greater robustness of the joint weight-tempo estimates is demonstrated in two ways: they are more highly
correlated with height tempo (r  0.6) and they correlate
more highly with contemporaneous questionnaire responses to puberty timing. some example r code is provided as a supplementary file.
in detail, the modelling is imperfect. the height rsds
of 2.5 cm are appreciably larger than for two other
sitar published models,7 where both rsds were
<0.8 cm. however, these other studies started at age 9
years whereas nshd started at age 2 years, and this will
have inflated the error. looking at the sds of the random
effects, those for height are all smaller than in previously
published studies (6 cm for size, 1 year for tempo and
20% for velocity7,8
). in addition, the nshd mean
curves, though improved when estimated jointly with
alspac, are still lumpy (see figure 1), and the weight
curves are forced to be steeper after puberty when
alspac is added. this is because pubertal weight gain is
greater in alspac than in nshd, and it violates the
sitar assumption that the curves can be made the same
shape by suitable choice of sitar parameters. however,
this does not apply to the height curves, where the assumption holds and the curves for the two cohorts are essentially
the same after sitar adjustment.
an important design question when piggy-backing data,
as done here with alspac, is getting the right mix of original and supporting data—if the added data are too few,
they make no difference (as was found by initial experimentation with a much smaller growth study than
alspac8
), whereas, if they are too many, they may
swamp the original data. it was important here to allow
the rsds to differ for the two datasets, showing that height
was more noisy in nshd than in alspac. this may be
due partly to the missing age of measurement at age 2
years.
the results of the regression models relating bone outcome at age 60–64 years to pubertal growth as summarized by sitar demonstrate the complexity both of
pubertal growth and its relationship with bone status 50
years later. trabecular vbmd relates to age at peak height
velocity,11 whereas diaphysis csa is affected by all three
facets of pubertal weight growth. these findings illustrate
the extra information derived from the sitar model, with
its tempo, size and velocity parameters, over and above reported pubertal timing, even in studies like nshd where
the reports are prospectively obtained and clinically assessed.11 each parameter represents a different aspect of
growth. for a bone to be ‘fit-for-purpose’, it must appropriately adapt to longitudinal growth11 and to the loading
it undergoes, which will change with the timing, speed and
mean weight gain, and it is consistent with the findings for
csa. for vbmd and csa, the risk attributable to pubertal
growth, i.e. the difference in predicted outcome for those 2
sds below as opposed to 2 sds above the mean of the linear predictor based on the sitar parameters, is substantial and clinically important, at around 15% adjusted for
current body size, which would translate to a clinically
relevant increased risk of fracture.11,17,18 given that a 1-
sd reduction in bmd17 results in a doubling of fracture
risk, the differences in the current study represent a 1.5- to
2-fold increased risk of fracture between the two extremes.
strengths and limitations
strengths of the study are the large sample size, the long
period of follow-up and well-characterized bone outcomes in
nshd,11 plus the large number of height and weight measurements from alspac through puberty. the use of pqct
enables the investigation of multiple aspects of bone strength,
which no other bone densitometry technique can provide.
thus, it has been possible to understand how the different aspects of growth may influence skeletal health in later life.
a limitation is that sitar assumes the same underlying
growth curve for all individuals, after adjusting for size,
tempo and velocity differences, yet the mean curves for
weight in nshd and alspac are systematically different,
with weight rising faster through puberty in alspac than
in nshd. this affects the shape of the mean curve, and
probably the velocity random effects as well, but the size
and tempo random effects are likely to be relatively robust.
conclusions
in conclusion, individual patterns of pubertal growth in
nshd, summarized by subject-specific sitar parameters,
are better estimated when the relatively sparse nshd data
are augmented with more frequent alspac data. relating
the sitar parameters to bone outcomes in later life shows
that pubertal growth, particularly earlier puberty, greater
weight and slower weight gain, has a long-lasting effect on
bone health, which is to a large extent independent of contemporary body size.
