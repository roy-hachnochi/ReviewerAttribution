abstract
background  although obesity is an established risk factor for coronary heart disease, its role as a risk factor for stroke remains controversial.

methods  prospective cohort study among 21 414 us male physicians participating in the physicians' health study. incidence of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke was measured by self-report and confirmed by medical record review. we used cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association of body mass index (bmi), calculated as self-reported weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters, with risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke.

results  during 12.5 years of follow-up, 747 strokes (631 ischemic, 104 hemorrhagic, and 12 undefined) occurred. compared with participants with bmis less than 23, those with bmis of 30 or greater had an adjusted relative risk of 2.00 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.48-2.71) for total stroke, 1.95 (95% ci, 1.39-2.72) for ischemic stroke, and 2.25 (95% ci, 1.01-5.01) for hemorrhagic stroke. when bmi was evaluated as a continuous variable, each unit increase of bmi was associated with a significant 6% increase in the adjusted relative risks of total (95% ci, 4%-8%), ischemic (95% ci, 3%-8%), and hemorrhagic stroke (95% ci, 1%-12%). additional adjustment for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia slightly attenuated the risks for total and ischemic (relative risk, 4%; 95% ci, 2%-7%), but not hemorrhagic, stroke.

conclusions  these prospective data indicate a significant increase in the relative risk of total stroke and its 2 major subtypes with each unit increase of bmi that is independent of the effects of hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol. because bmi is a modifiable risk factor, the prevention of stroke may be another benefit associated with preventing obesity in adults.

excess weight is a well-documented risk factor for coronary heart disease.1-4 in addition, it is associated with increased risk of several factors that may lead to stroke, including hypertension5 and diabetes mellitus.6 however, data on the overall association of obesity and stroke as well as stroke subtypes are limited and inconclusive.7 several studies have suggested that a high body mass index (bmi) may increase the risk of total stroke,4,8,9 particularly ischemic stroke.10-13 others have found an association with waist-hip ratio14 and abdominal obesity15-17 (but not with bmi)17 or no association.18 moreover, it is not clear if excess weight itself is independently associated with increased risk of stroke over and above its relationship with stroke risk factors. finally, the relationship of bmi with stroke severity has, to our knowledge, never been prospectively evaluated.

as a result, excess weight is not included in the framingham stroke risk prediction score,19,20 nor is it listed as a primary risk factor for stroke by the national institutes of health21 or the american stroke association.22 obesity, however, is listed as a potential modifiable risk factor for stroke in the recent guidelines of the american heart association,23 but its effect is stated to be mainly mediated through hypertension, diabetes, and increased blood lipid levels.

because stroke, the leading cause of long-term disability and morbidity and the third leading cause of death in the united states,24 has few effective therapies, identifying and managing potential risk factors such as elevated bmi remain of great importance. the physicians' health study (phs) provided the opportunity to assess prospectively the association between bmi and the incidence of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke, as well as stroke severity, among more than 22 000 us male physicians.

methods
participants were part of the phs, a completed randomized trial of low-dose aspirin and beta carotene in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. the participants, methods, and results have been described in detail previously.25-27 the study population consisted of 22 071 us male physicians aged 40 to 84 years in 1982, with no history of myocardial infarction, stroke, transient cerebral ischemia, or cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), who were followed for 12.5 years. morbidity and mortality data were available for more than 99%.

baseline information was self-reported and collected by a mailed questionnaire that asked about many demographic, medical history, and lifestyle variables. every 6 months for the first year and annually thereafter, participants received follow-up questionnaires asking about compliance with randomized treatment assignments and newly diagnosed conditions, including stroke. at baseline, 22 065 participants (99.9%) reported weight and height. of these, 651 were excluded because of missing information on potential confounders, resulting in a study population of 21 414 men. body mass index was calculated as self-reported weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.

evaluation of stroke
participants who self-reported stroke on a follow-up questionnaire were asked for permission to obtain their medical records. an end points committee confirmed a diagnosis of stroke after review of medical records and reports of brain imaging. stroke was defined as a focal neurological deficit of vascular mechanism lasting more than 24 hours and was classified according to criteria established by the national survey of stroke28 into ischemic, hemorrhagic (including intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage), and unknown subtypes. fatal stroke was documented by evidence of a cerebrovascular mechanism obtained from all available sources, including death certificates and hospital records. stroke severity was measured using the modified rankin scale (mrs)29 based on information from the hospital discharge summary. the mrs classifies stroke cases from 1 (no residual symptoms) to 6 (fatal stroke). we categorized stroke severity as mild (mrs score of 1-3), severe (mrs score of 4-5), or fatal (mrs score of 6).30

an independent review by 2 neurologists of the diagnostic coding of stroke from the start of randomization of the phs until 1988 yielded excellent interobserver agreement.31 a similar analysis of data from 1988 until the trial's end also yielded strong interrater reliability, with agreement for ischemic stroke of 96.4% (κ = 0.84) and for hemorrhagic stroke of 97.1% (κ = 0.87). the overall agreement for stroke severity, calculated with quadratic weighted κ statistics,32 was excellent, with concordance of 94.3% (κ = 0.71) for the period until 198831 and 97.2% (κ = 0.86) for the remainder of the study.

statistical analyses
we used cox proportional hazards models33 to analyze the association between bmi and stroke. person-time was calculated from return of the baseline questionnaire until the date of stroke, death, or the study's end, whichever occurred first. body mass index was evaluated in the following 3 ways: (1) in 5 categories (<23, 23-24.9, 25-26.9, 27-29.9, and ≥30), (2) as the 3 world health organization (who) weight categories (normal weight, <25; overweight, 25-29.9; and obese, ≥30), and (3) as continuous term. we tested both the proportional hazards and linearity assumptions of the association between bmi and total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke and found no violations.

we calculated age-adjusted and multiple-adjusted hazard ratios as a measure of the relative risk for total (including ischemic, hemorrhagic, and undefined stroke cases), ischemic, and hemorrhagic (including intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage) stroke. we used an ordinal variable to test for trend in risk across bmi categories. the multiple regression models controlled for age (continuous); smoking (never, past, or current); alcohol consumption (≥1 drinks per day, 2-6 drinks per week, ≤1 drink per week); exercise (≥1 week or <1 week); history of angina (yes or no); parental history of myocardial infarction prior to 60 years (yes or no); and randomized treatment assignment. the use of finer categories of both alcohol consumption and exercise did not appreciably change the estimates of the association between bmi and stroke. we considered hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels as possible biological mediators of the effect of bmi on stroke and therefore did not control for these factors in the primary analysis. however, hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm hg or taking antihypertensive medication regardless of blood pressure), history of self-reported diabetes, and history of self-reported high cholesterol levels were added sequentially to multiple regression models in a secondary analysis. the use of different categorization of blood pressure did not appreciably change the estimates of the association between bmi and stroke. we evaluated effect modification of bmi by smoking, hypertension, alcohol consumption, and age.

we calculated the proportion of total stroke and stroke types directly standardized for age to evaluate the association of bmi and stroke severity. we used the mantel-haenzsel extension test to test for trend in risk across bmi categories. to compare bmi measurements over the study period, we calculated a spearman correlation coefficient comparing baseline bmi to bmis from the 8-year follow-up and study-end questionnaires after excluding subjects with severe illnesses.

results
during 12.5 years (268 269 person-years) of follow-up, 747 incident strokes occurred, including 631 ischemic, 104 hemorrhagic (83 intraparenchymal and 21 subarachnoid hemorrhages), and 12 undefined strokes. the mean bmi was 24.9, ranging from 14.4 to 56.0. based on who criteria, 12 125 (56.6%) of the 21 414 men were in the normal weight category, 8105 (37.9%) were overweight, and 1184 (5.5%) were obese.

table 1 gives the age-adjusted baseline characteristics of the participants according to bmi categories. mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as prevalence of hypertension increased with increasing bmi. the percentage of men who had never smoked decreased with increasing bmi, whereas the percentage of men who reported current smoking was highest in the obese category. the proportion of men who reported exercising regularly decreased with increasing bmi. the leanest men were more likely to have reported alcohol consumption of 1 drink or more per day and less likely to have reported consumption of less than 2 drinks per week compared with obese men.

the age- and multiple-adjusted relative risks of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke according to bmi categories are summarized in table 2. the age-adjusted relative risks of total stroke as well as stroke types increased steadily across bmi categories compared with the referent (bmi <23). multiple adjustments for various risk factors attenuated the relative risks only slightly.

using the who categories, overweight men had multiple-adjusted relative risks for total stroke of 1.32 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.14-1.54), for ischemic stroke of 1.35 (95% ci, 1.15-1.59), and for hemorrhagic stroke of 1.25 (95% ci, 0.84-1.88) compared with men with bmis less than 25. obese men had multiple-adjusted relative risks of 1.91 (95% ci, 1.45-2.52) for total stroke, 1.87 (95% ci, 1.38-2.54) for ischemic stroke, and 1.92 (95% ci, 0.94-3.93) for hemorrhagic stroke compared with men with bmis less than 25.

when bmi was examined as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in bmi was associated with a multiple-adjusted increase of 6% (95% ci, 4%-8%) in the risk of total and ischemic stroke and 6% (95% ci, 1%-12%) for hemorrhagic stroke.

the influence of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia on the association between bmi and stroke risk was evaluated in a stepwise fashion using the continuous measurement of bmi. for both total and ischemic stroke, the increased risk was reduced to 4% (95% ci, 2%-7%) per unit increase in bmi when hypertension was included in the model. additional adjustment for diabetes did not further reduce the relative risks. hemorrhagic stroke was only marginally mediated by hypertension and diabetes, and the effect estimate of 6% was unchanged. after controlling for hypertension and diabetes, the inclusion of cholesterol levels of 240 mg/dl or greater (≥6.22 mmol/l) did not further attenuate the association between bmi and any stroke types.

smoking, alcohol consumption, and age did not substantially modify the effect for total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. the risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke was highest among individuals with hypertension, but no substantial effect modification was observed between hypertension status and bmi (figure 1 and figure 2).

although the overall stroke 30-day fatality was 6.3%, large differences were seen between the fatality among stroke types. among the hemorrhagic stroke cases, 27.9% were fatal (25.3% of intraparenchymal hemorrhages and 38.1% of subarachnoid hemorrhages) compared with only 2.4% of ischemic strokes. table 3 summarizes the age-adjusted proportion of stroke severity in each bmi category. stroke severity for total and ischemic stroke was not associated with bmi. for hemorrhagic stroke, mild strokes occurred more often in men with bmis of 30 or greater, while fatal strokes occurred more often in men with bmis lower than 23. further analysis of hemorrhagic stroke subtypes showed that the age-adjusted inverse association between fatal hemorrhagic stroke and bmi was primarily owing to an increased incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. of the 29 fatal hemorrhagic stroke cases, 8 had subarachnoid hemorrhages, of which 3 (age-adjusted percentage, 45.2%) occurred in men with bmis lower than 23 and 4 (age-adjusted percentage, 39.3%) with bmis between 23 and 24.9, while only 1 (age-adjusted percentage, 14.3%) occurred in those with bmis between 25 and 26.9, with no cases in the heavier categories. however, the age-adjusted percentage of fatal intraparenchymal hemorrhages among obese men (8.4%) was also lower than that among men in bmi categories of less than 23 or 23 to 24.9 (30.1% each). these findings were not changed with additional adjusted-for-hypertension.

the correlation between baseline bmi, bmi at 8 years of follow-up (r = 0.86), and bmi at the study's end (r = 0.80) was high. body mass index was relatively stable throughout the study, with 42% of participants with baseline bmis less than 25 remaining in that category and 27% remaining in the 25 to 29.9 bmi category. of the participants, 20% increased from normal weight to overweight or from overweight to obese and less than 1% shifted from normal weight to obese.

comment
in this prospective cohort, increasing bmi was associated with a steady increase in the risks of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. although concomitant hypertension and diabetes accounted for much of the increase in total and ischemic stroke, a significant increase remained after adjustment for these potential biological mediators. although the risk of ischemic stroke was highest among smokers and individuals with hypertension, these factors did not substantially modify the relationship between bmi and stroke. body mass index was not associated with the severity of total and ischemic stroke, but the data suggest that it might be inversely associated with severity of fatal hemorrhagic stroke, particularly subarachnoid hemorrhage.

the association between excess weight and stroke risk has been controversial. among men, few prospective studies have investigated this relationship. some of these had small sample sizes9,10 and others did not classify stroke subtypes.11,12,16,17 to our knowledge, the association between bmi and stroke severity has not been examined prospectively before.

in the honolulu heart program, nonsmoking men in the highest tertile of bmi at age 25 years had a 2-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke over 22 years of follow-up.10 in the whitehall study, a 2-fold increase in risk of stroke mortality was observed among men with bmis of 24 or greater compared with those with bmis less than 24.12 obesity was also a risk factor for nonfatal stroke in a long-term follow-up study of male college alumni.34 the modest to small associations observed in some studies, such as among 2773 elderly men and women in chicago, ill,9 may be a result of controlling for hypertension and diabetes, which may directly mediate the association between excess weight and stroke. other studies, however, failed to find a strong association between obesity and stroke in men.16,17,35-37 among women, the data are also inconsistent, with some studies showing a positive association4,13,15,38 and others showing no association.8,9,14

in the nurses' health study, a nonsignificant inverse association was observed between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke.13 in contrast, we found a 6% increase in risk of hemorrhagic stroke per unit increase of bmi. on examination by subtype, a direct association was observed between bmi and intraparenchymal hemorrhage, while an inverse association was observed for subarachnoid hemorrhage. a similar inverse association was observed in a community-based finnish cohort of 187 subjects with subarachnoid hemorrhage. low bmi (≤23.5) was associated with a markedly increased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage among current smokers and those with hypertension.39 if the same divergent associations between bmi and subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhage observed in our cohort of men are also present in women, this could explain the nonsignificant inverse association between bmi and total hemorrhagic stroke observed among women,13 since subarachnoid hemorrhage is more frequent in women than men.40

the severity of ischemic and total stroke did not appear to be influenced by bmi in our study, while fatal hemorrhagic stroke occurred more often in lean men than in overweight or obese men. these findings were mainly owing to subarachnoid hemorrhage, which has a higher 28-day case fatality rate than intraparenchymal hemorrhage.41,42 however, because few fatal hemorrhagic strokes occurred in our study, we were unable to estimate more precisely the association between hemorrhagic subtypes and categories of bmi.

the mechanism by which bmi affects stroke risk independent of established risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes is not fully understood. some investigators have proposed that an increase in prothrombic factors observed among overweight and obese individuals may contribute to their increased risk for ischemic events.43-45 higher levels of prothrombic factors, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) antigen and activity, fibrinogen, von willebrand factor, and factor vii, have been found in obese women compared with normal-weight women.43 adipose tissue seems to play a role in determining elevated plasma levels of pai-1,44 which are also linked to the development of atherothrombosis.45 increased levels of c-reactive protein in overweight and obese individuals46,47 may also play a role in their increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events48 since an association between increased levels of inflammatory markers and risk of cardiovascular disease,49-51 including ischemic stroke,52,53 has been documented.

our study has several strengths, including its large size, prospective design, and the relatively homogeneous nature of the cohort, which reduces confounding by several variables, including access to medical care, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status. misclassification of stroke was reduced by detailed review of medical records, and interobserver agreement in classifying stroke, stroke subtypes, and stroke severity was high. the study also has several potential limitations. body mass index was calculated using self-reported data, which can lead to misclassification. in several validation studies of other cohorts of health professionals, however, self-reports of height, weight, and other cardiovascular risk factors were reliable.54-57 in the health professionals follow-up study, the correlation coefficient for self-reported and measured weight in men was r = 0.97.56 body mass index is not a perfect measurement of adiposity,58 and abnormal regional adiposity may further increase risk for stroke.15,37 to the extent that our single measure of bmi imperfectly reflects adiposity, our results would tend to underestimate the deleterious effects of obesity. moreover, because our study population contains solely physicians who were mostly white and somewhat leaner than the average us population,59,60 the results may not be generalizable to a less-selective population. however, since the pathomechanism that leads to stroke is likely to be similar across populations, our results may underrepresent the contribution of obesity to stroke risk.

in conclusion, this study demonstrates that overweight and obese men are at increased risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. these risks appeared to be independent of the potential biological mediators of hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol level. these results suggest that individuals and their physicians should consider increased risk of stroke another hazard of obesity. prevention of obesity should help prevent risk of stroke in men.

abstract
background— obesity is an escalating pandemic in the united states, and its association with coronary heart disease is well understood. several studies have found positive associations between body mass index (bmi) and stroke in men, but the association with stroke and its subtypes is less clear in women.

methods and results— this was a prospective cohort study among 39 053 women participating in the women’s health study. bmi was measured as self-reported weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared. incident stroke was self-reported and confirmed by medical record review. we used the cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the association between bmi and stroke. after a mean follow-up of 10 years, a total of 432 strokes (347 ischemic, 81 hemorrhagic, and 4 undefined) occurred. we found a statistically significant trend for increased risk of total and ischemic stroke across 7 bmi categories. with world health organization criteria, women who were obese (bmi ≥30 kg/m2) had hazard ratios of 1.50 (95% ci 1.16 to 1.94) for total stroke, 1.72 (95% ci 1.30 to 2.28) for ischemic stroke, and 0.82 (95% ci 0.43 to 1.58) for hemorrhagic stroke compared with women with bmi <25 kg/m2. additional control for history of hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol substantially attenuated the hazard ratios for total and ischemic stroke. there was no effect modification for age, exercise, or smoking.

conclusions— in this large prospective cohort study among women, bmi was a strong risk factor for total and ischemic stroke but not for hemorrhagic stroke. the association was highly mediated by hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol.


overweight and obesity represent an emerging threat to public health,1–3 affecting nearly 59 million adults in the united states alone.4 in addition, and perhaps more worrisome, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than doubled over the last 20 years.4,5 approximately 300 000 deaths each year in the united states are estimated to be attributable to obesity,6 and the economic burden is enormous.4 overweight and obesity are well-documented risk factors for a variety of diseases,2 including coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, and certain cancers.7,8

there is increasing evidence that obesity is a risk factor for ischemic stroke.9–14 despite this, excess weight has not been recognized as an established risk factor for stroke15 and generally has not been included in the overall estimation of stroke risk.16–18 in addition, the association between body mass index (bmi) and hemorrhagic stroke is less clear.9,10,12,14,19–21 stroke remains a leading cause of severe disability and premature death in the united states and other western countries. effective therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke only are used in a small number of patients22 and do not help to completely reverse the impaired function of affected brain areas. thus, the identification of modifiable lifestyle factors remains critical for stroke prevention. we aimed to evaluate the association between bmi and total stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke in more than 39 000 apparently healthy female health professionals participating in the women’s health study (whs).

methods
participants
study individuals were all participants in the whs, a recently completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that tested the benefits and risks of low-dose aspirin and vitamin e in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among apparently healthy women. the design and methods of the whs have been described in detail previously.23,24 briefly, a total of 39 876 us female health professionals aged 45 years or older at baseline in beginning of 1993 and without a history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other major illnesses were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: active aspirin (100 mg on alternate days), active vitamin e (600 iu on alternate days), both active agents, or both placebos. baseline information was self-reported and was collected by a mailed questionnaire that asked about a large number of cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle variables. twice in the first year and annually thereafter, participants were sent follow-up questionnaires that asked about study compliance, study outcomes (including stroke), personal characteristics, medical history, and health habits during the study period. for the present analysis, we included follow-up information from the time of randomization through march 31, 2004. as of this date, follow-up was 96% complete. the institutional review board of the brigham and women’s hospital approved the study.

assessment of bmi
participants reported their height and weight on the baseline questionnaire. on the 24-, 36-, 60-, 72-, and 108-month questionnaires, participants were asked again to report their weight, and on the 72- and 108-month questionnaires, they were asked to report their height again. bmi was calculated as self-reported weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). we used the baseline height information to calculate bmi for all but the 72- and 108-month time points. we categorized bmi into a priori categories of <20.0, 20.0 to 22.9, 23.0 to 24.9, 25.0 to 26.9, 27.0 to 29.9, 30.0 to 34.9, and ≥35.0 kg/m2. we further evaluated bmi on the basis of the world health organization (who) categories of <25 (normal weight), 25 to 29.9 (overweight), and ≥30 kg/m2 (obese), as well as a continuous term.

ascertainment of stroke
participants who reported a stroke on a follow-up questionnaire were asked for permission to review their medical records. a diagnosis of stroke was confirmed only after review of the medical records by an end points committee of physicians that included a neurologist. a nonfatal stroke was defined as a focal neurological deficit of sudden onset and vascular mechanism that lasted >24 hours. cases of fatal stroke were documented by evidence of a cerebrovascular mechanism obtained from all available sources, including death certificates and hospital records. stroke was classified according to the criteria established by the national survey of stroke25 as ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and unknown subtype. the interobserver agreement of the classification of stroke and its major subtypes in the whs was excellent.26

statistical analysis
of the 39 876 randomized participants, we excluded 820 women with missing information on weight or height on the baseline questionnaire. we additionally excluded 3 participants who reported a stroke before the receipt of the baseline questionnaire, which left a total of 39 053 women for the present study.

we compared the characteristics of participants with respect to baseline bmi categories using direct standardization to adjust categorical variables for age in 5-year increments. we used the cox proportional hazards model27 to analyze the association between bmi and the incidence of stroke. we calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) and their 95% cis for total (including ischemic, hemorrhagic, and undefined stroke cases), ischemic, and hemorrhagic (including subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage) strokes. we made a distinction in the multivariable models between variables that were considered potential confounders and those considered potential biological intermediate variables in the association between bmi and stroke risk. in the first multivariable model (model 1), we controlled for age (quadratic term), alcohol consumption (<1 drink per week, 1 to 6 drinks per week, ≥1 drink per day), smoking (never, past, current <15 cigarettes per day, current ≥15 cigarettes per day), physical activity (≤1 time per week, 2 to 3 times per week, ≥4 times per week), and postmenopausal hormone use. we considered other potential confounding variables including ethnicity, oral contraceptive use, and education, which did not lead to substantially different results. we then considered 3 potential biological mediators: history of hypertension (defined as self-reported systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mm hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm hg, or report of diagnosis of hypertension by a physician), history of diabetes, and history of elevated cholesterol (≥240 mg/dl). in the second multivariable model (model 2), we controlled for all variables in model 1 plus hypertension at baseline. in the third model, we then additionally controlled for history of diabetes and elevated cholesterol at baseline. we decided a priori not to control for randomized treatment assignment. because randomization in this large trial was successful,24 randomized treatment assignment is not associated with bmi. consequently, by definition, randomized treatment assignment cannot be a confounder of the association between bmi and stroke.

our primary analysis was to evaluate the association between baseline bmi and risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. as a secondary approach, we updated the information on bmi by incorporating weight change over time. we evaluated effect modification by age (<60 versus ≥60 years), exercise frequency (<1 times per week versus ≥1 times per week), and smoking status (current versus never/past). we used the likelihood ratio test to test for statistical significance. all probability values were 2 tailed, and we considered p<0.05 as statistically significant.

results
after a mean of 10 years of follow-up (384 345 person-years), a total of 432 strokes occurred among the 39 053 participants, including 347 ischemic, 81 hemorrhagic, and 4 undefined strokes. the mean bmi was 26.0 kg/m2 (±5.1 sd), with 19 841 women (50.8%) reporting bmi values of <25.0 kg/m2, 12 081 (30.9%) reporting values between 25.0 and 29.9 kg/m2, and 7131 (18.3%) reporting bmi ≥30 kg/m2. the association between bmi who categories and baseline characteristics is summarized in table 1. women who reported bmi values of 30 kg/m2 or higher more frequently reported a history of hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and diabetes. in addition, they smoked fewer cigarettes, drank less alcohol, exercised less, and reported less postmenopausal hormone use.

table 2 presents the association between bmi in 7 categories and risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. after adjustment for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, and postmenopausal hormone use, there was a significant trend of an increased risk for total and ischemic stroke across bmi categories (both p for trend <0.01). the risk was noticeably increased for women with bmi values ≥27 kg/m2. compared with participants with bmi <20 kg/m2, women with bmi ≥35 kg/m2 had an hr of 2.05 (95% ci 1.18 to 3.55) for total stroke and 2.81 (95% ci 1.45 to 5.43) for ischemic stroke. the risk of total and ischemic stroke was attenuated substantially when models were also controlled for history of hypertension. additional control for history of diabetes and elevated cholesterol further attenuated the hrs to 1.19 (95% ci 0.68 to 2.10) for total stroke and 1.54 (95% ci 0.79 to 3.02) for ischemic stroke. in contrast to the positive association between bmi and total and ischemic stroke, there was no consistent association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke. there was, however, a suggestion that women in the leanest bmi category (<20 kg/m2) in fact had an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke compared with women with bmi 20.0 to 22.9 kg/m2 (figure 1), although this was not statistically significant (hr 2.09, 95% ci 0.89 to 4.89). this pattern was different from that seen for ischemic stroke.

figure 1. multivariable-adjusted (model 1) hrs for hemorrhagic stroke according to bmi categories. bmi of 20.0 to 22.9 kg/m2 serves as referent group.

when we used who categories for bmi, women in the obese category (≥30 kg/m2) had multivariable-adjusted (model 1) hrs of 1.50 (95% ci 1.16 to 1.94) for total stroke, 1.72 (95% ci 1.30 to 2.28) for ischemic stroke, and 0.82 (95% ci 0.43 to 1.58) for hemorrhagic stroke compared with women with bmi <25 kg/m2. after we additionally controlled for history of hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol, the risks of total and ischemic stroke were attenuated to 1.04 (95% ci 0.80 to 1.37) for total stroke and 1.15 (95% ci 0.85 to 1.55) for ischemic stroke.

when we evaluated bmi as a continuous variable, a 1-unit increase in bmi was associated with a 4% increase in total stroke (multivariable [model 1]-adjusted hr 1.04, 95% ci 1.02 to 1.06) and a 5% increase for ischemic stroke (hr 1.05, 95% ci 1.03 to 1.07) but had no association with hemorrhagic stroke (hr 0.99, 95% ci 0.94 to 1.04). these relative risks for total and ischemic stroke were also attenuated after we controlled for history of hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol: 1.01 (95% ci 0.99 to 1.03) for total stroke and 1.02 (95% ci 0.99 to 1.04) for ischemic stroke.

when we updated the information on bmi over the course of follow-up, the results were similar in direction compared with the association between baseline bmi and risk of stroke and stroke subtypes. after adjustment for potential confounders (model 1), women with bmi values ≥35 kg/m2 had hrs of 1.66 (95% ci 1.01 to 2.71) for total stroke, 1.89 (95% ci 1.09 to 3.26) for ischemic stroke, and 0.79 (95% ci 0.23 to 2.65) for hemorrhagic stroke. as before, the hrs for total and ischemic stroke were attenuated when we additionally controlled for history of hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol, with hrs of 1.02 (95% ci 0.62 to 1.69) for total stroke and 1.10 (95% ci 0.63 to 1.94) for ischemic stroke.

the association between bmi and total, ischemic, or hemorrhagic stroke was not statistically significantly modified by age (<60 versus ≥60 years; p for all stroke types ≥0.09). the association between bmi categories according to smoking status is summarized in figure 2. there was a progressive increase in risk with higher bmi among never-smokers and past smokers. women who were current cigarette smokers had increased risk irrespective of bmi. overall, there was no statistically significant effect modification of the association between bmi and ischemic stroke by smoking status (p=0.62). there was also no significant effect modification by smoking status with regard to hemorrhagic stroke.

the association between bmi who categories according to exercise categories is presented in table 3. compared with women with bmi <25 kg/m2, there was an excess risk of total and ischemic stroke for bmi 30 kg/m2 or higher whether or not the women exercised. the hrs were somewhat stronger in those who exercised less, but there was no statistically significant effect modification (p≥0.39 for all stroke types).

discussion
in this large prospective cohort study of >39 000 apparently healthy women, bmi was strongly associated with total and ischemic stroke but not with hemorrhagic stroke. we found a statistically significant trend across bmi categories for total and ischemic stroke and found significant increased risks for ischemic stroke beginning with bmi values ≥27.0 kg/m2 that steadily increased with higher bmi. women with bmi ≥35 kg/m2 had a 2-fold increase in the risk of total stroke and an almost 3-fold increase in the risk of ischemic stroke compared with women with bmi <20 kg/m2. when who criteria were used, women who were obese (bmi ≥30 kg/m2) had a 1.5-fold increase in the risk of total stroke and a 1.7-fold increase in the risk of ischemic stroke compared with women with bmi <25 kg/m2. the association between bmi and total and ischemic stroke was strongly mediated by history of hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol. the association between bmi and stroke was not modified by age, smoking status, or exercise.

over the last 2 decades, the association between obesity and stroke among women has been inconsistent, with some studies showing a positive association,11,12,28–30 and others showing no association.31–33 data from the nurses’ health study showed similar associations as in the present study and found a >2-fold increase in the risk of ischemic stroke and 1.6-fold increase in the risk for total stroke among women with bmi ≥32 kg/m2 compared with women with bmi <21 kg/m2.12 as in the present study, inclusion of hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol led to substantial attenuation of the risk estimates. there was also a suggestion of an inverse association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke that also did not reach statistical significance. similar to the present findings, the highest risk for hemorrhagic stroke was seen among women in the leanest bmi category. the study further evaluated weight change and found increased risk for total and ischemic stroke but not for hemorrhagic stroke among women who gained >11 kg.12 studies that found no association between obesity and stroke may have been limited by small size32 or may have controlled for the potential biological mediator of hypertension.31,33

in men, a number of studies support an association between bmi and increased risk of stroke.9,10,21,34 a recent population-based study from göteborg, sweden, found a 2-fold increase in the risk for total, ischemic, and undetermined stroke for men with bmi >30 kg/m2 compared with men with bmi of 20.0 to 22.5 kg/m2.9 no association was observed between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke. because that study showed a strong association between bmi and undetermined stroke, it is possible that some of these cases were in fact hemorrhagic strokes and that the association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke was thus underestimated. data from the physicians’ health study showed a significant increase in the risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke with increasing bmi.10 men with bmi ≥30 kg/m2 had a >2-fold risk increase for all stroke types. in both studies, the increased risk for total and ischemic stroke, although attenuated, remained statistically significant when additionally controlled for hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol.

the association between obesity and hemorrhagic stroke remains unclear. the present study is consistent with findings of others that showed an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke among the lean.12,14,19 other studies, however, found no association9,20,21 or an increased risk with increasing bmi.10 the fact that the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke is higher in asian populations has led to the hypothesis that low cholesterol, in addition to lean body weight, may be associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic strokes.20,35 the low numbers of hemorrhagic strokes in most of the studies may explain in part the uncertainty with regard to the association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke. future studies are needed to determine whether lean bmi and/or low cholesterol or other factors are important contributors to hemorrhagic stroke.

there is an ongoing discussion about the best measure of obesity for stroke prediction.11,30,32,36 a report from the northern manhattan stroke study suggested that abdominal obesity, as measured by the waist-to-hip ratio, was a stronger predictor than bmi and had a greater effect among younger individuals.11 in that study, however, obesity was evaluated at the time of the stroke, which may indicate that abdominal obesity may be a better short-term predictor than bmi. nevertheless, obesity is a strong risk factor for total and ischemic stroke regardless of the measure used. whether more detailed information on body fat distribution will lead to better prediction of stroke currently remains unclear.

obesity is a strong risk factor for the development of hypertension,37 diabetes,38 and elevated cholesterol.39 in virtually all studies that have evaluated the association between obesity and ischemic stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol were biological mediators.9,10,12,14,36 this, however, should not downplay the importance of obesity as a primary risk factor for stroke. to the contrary, because obesity has such a strong influence on hypertension and diabetes, obesity may be the biggest overall contributor to stroke occurrence. in some studies, a statistically significant excess risk for stroke remained even after controlling for hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol.9–11 in a recent large, population-based study from malmö, sweden among normotensive men and women, bmi was a statistically significant and independent predictor for stroke.40 furthermore, the risks of excessive body fat for stroke can be obscured by a history of cigarette smoking and thinness associated with deteriorating health.41

in addition to the established mechanisms by which bmi affects stroke risk such as hypertension and diabetes, other mechanisms may be associated with the increased risk. some investigators have proposed that an increase in prothrombotic factors observed among overweight and obese individuals may contribute to their increased risk for ischemic events.42–44 increased levels of c-reactive protein in overweight and obese individuals45 may also play a role in their increased risk of stroke,46 because an association between increased levels of inflammatory markers and risk of ischemic stroke has been documented47,48; however, the biological interrelationship between obesity, inflammatory markers, and ischemic stroke risk has yet to be determined.

the present study has several strengths, including the prospective method of data collection, the large size of the study population, the large number of incident strokes, the high rate and length of follow-up, and the homogeneous nature of whs participants, which reduces potential confounding by access to medical care and other socioeconomic factors. on each of the follow-up questionnaires, whs participants were asked specifically about stroke and transient ischemic attacks. because stroke was a major end point of the whs trial, all efforts were made to obtain the relevant medical records, and an experienced end points committee confirmed stroke cases only after review of these records. in addition, the interobserver agreement in the classification of stroke was excellent.26 we further ran several different models, including time-varying models, to update the most recent exposure information, used different cutpoints of bmi, and evaluated potential biological mediators and effect modifiers.

several limitations should be considered when evaluating the present results. first, information on body weight and height, as well as on all potential confounders, was self-reported, and thus nondifferential misclassification is possible. participants of the whs, however, were all health professionals, who are known to accurately report information regarding lifestyle factors and health status. specifically, self-reported and directed measured weight were highly correlated (r=0.96) in another comparable cohort of female health professionals.49 in addition, nondifferential misclassification in a prospective study most likely would lead to an underestimation of the association between bmi and stroke. we have no reason to believe that a significant number of participants did not report a stroke event and particularly no reasoning that such potential underreporting would be differential with regard to bmi status. second, because participants in the whs were all health professionals who participated in a randomized trial, and the vast majority (94.9%) of them were white, the present results may not necessarily be extrapolated to other populations; however, we have no a priori basis for believing that the biological mechanisms by which bmi may lead to stroke differ in the whs cohort compared with other populations. in addition, the relative measures of effect for a wide variety of cardiovascular risk factors have been similar to those seen in other studies. because women participating in the whs were somewhat leaner than the general population, we may have underestimated the risk of heavier populations. finally, as with all observational studies, residual and unmeasured confounding remains an alternative explanation for our findings, despite adjustment for many potential confounders.

in conclusion, our study indicates that obesity is associated with increased risk of total and ischemic stroke. this was not modified by age, smoking, or exercise and was strongly mediated by hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol, which may be biological intermediates of the obesity–stroke association. the association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke remains less clear. preventing obesity may lead to a substantial reduction of total and ischemic stroke occurrence.

abstract
background  healthy lifestyle has been associated with decreased risk of coronary heart disease. in contrast, little is known about its association with stroke risk.

methods  this is a prospective cohort study among 37 636 women 45 years or older participating in the women's health study. stroke was self-reported and confirmed by means of medical record review. we considered the following self-reported lifestyle factors: smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, body mass index, and diet. the health index was calculated from these variables by assigning scores from 0 to 4 to the respective variable categories, with a higher score indicating healthier behavior. healthy behavior was defined as never smoking, alcohol consumption between 4 and 10.5 drinks per week, exercise 4 or more times per week, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) less than 22, and a diet high in cereal fiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids, with a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat, and low in trans fat and glycemic load.

results  during 10 years of follow-up, 450 strokes (356 ischemic, 90 hemorrhagic, and 4 undefined) were confirmed. compared with participants with 0 to 4 health index points (4.3%), women with 17 to 20 health index points (4.7%) had multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of 0.45 (0.24-0.83; p<.001 for trend) for total stroke, 0.29 (0.14-0.63; p<.001 for trend) for ischemic stroke, and 1.27 (0.37-4.29; p = .62 for trend) for hemorrhagic stroke.

conclusions  in this large prospective cohort of apparently healthy women, a healthy lifestyle consisting of abstinence from smoking, low body mass index, moderate alcohol consumption, regular exercise, and healthy diet was associated with a significantly reduced risk of total and ischemic stroke but not of hemorrhagic stroke. our findings underscore the importance of healthy behaviors in the prevention of stroke.

stroke remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. in the united states alone, approximately 700 000 strokes occur each year, of which approximately 23% are fatal; an equal number of people are left permanently disabled and in need of assistance with activities of daily living.1 effective therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke are used uncommonly2 and often do not completely reverse the impaired brain functions. thus, identification of modifiable lifestyle factors remains critical for stroke prevention, particularly for women who, in the united states, have relatively more strokes than myocardial infarctions when compared with men.1

the association between many individual behavioral risk factors (including smoking,3,4 alcohol consumption,5 exercise,6,7 body mass index [bmi],8,9 and some dietary factors)10,11 and stroke incidence has been studied. in contrast to findings for coronary heart disease12 and diabetes mellitus,13 however, the combined effects of health-related behaviors on the risk of stroke and stroke subtypes have not been studied. we thus aimed to evaluate whether a composite of healthy lifestyle factors reduces the risk of stroke and stroke subtypes in more than 37 000 apparently healthy women.

methods
participants
study subjects were all participants in the women's health study (whs), a completed randomized trial of low-dose aspirin and vitamin e in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. the methods and results of the whs have been described in detail previously.14-16 briefly, 39 876 female health professionals in the united states who were 45 years or older at the beginning of 1993 and who did not have a history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other major illnesses were randomly assigned to receive aspirin (100 mg on alternate days), vitamin e (600 iu on alternate days), both active agents, or both placebos. baseline information on many lifestyle variables was collected by means of a mailed questionnaire. twice in the first year and yearly thereafter, participants were sent follow-up questionnaires asking about study outcomes and other information during the study period. for this analysis, we included follow-up information from the time of randomization through march 31, 2004. as of this date, follow-up was 97.2% complete for morbidity and 99.4% for mortality.

health index
to create a health index with components that have been previously proposed,12,13 we considered self-reported lifestyle information from the baseline questionnaires, incorporating information about smoking, exercise, bmi, alcohol consumption, and dietary factors.

smoking is a strong risk factor for ischemic3 and hemorrhagic4 stroke in women, and the risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked. we categorized participants as never smokers, past smokers who smoked less than 20 pack-years, past smokers who smoked 20 or more pack-years, current smokers who smoke fewer than 15 cigarettes per day, and current smokers who smoke 15 or more cigarettes per day.

physical activity has been associated inconsistently with risk of stroke. findings from a recent meta-analysis7 of observational studies showed that moderately intense physical activity compared with inactivity was protective for total stroke as well as for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. we categorized exercise on the basis of self-reported frequency of weekly strenuous exercise as rarely or never, less than once per week, once per week, 2 to 3 times per week, or 4 or more times per week.

body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters, has been associated consistently with a steady increase in risk of total and ischemic stroke.8,9,17 although the association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke is less clear,8,9,17 we decided to use the lowest category as the healthiest group, which is similar to previous approaches.8,12,13,17 we categorized bmi as lower than 22.0, 22.0 to 24.9, 25.0 to 29.9, 30.0 to 34.9, and 35.0 or more.

the association between alcohol consumption and risk of stroke has been described as j-shaped, with the most benefit for light to moderate consumption of alcohol.5,18 study participants reported alcohol consumption as drinks per week or day. we categorized alcohol intake as never, less than 1, 1 to 3, 4 to less than 10.5, and 10.5 or more drinks per week. we assigned the health index points for alcohol consumption favoring moderate drinking habits and assigned a low health index score for women who rarely or never drank alcohol. reassigning the low health index score to the highest alcohol consumption category did not substantially change the association between the health index and risk of stroke.

women reported dietary intake on a 161-item standardized food frequency questionnaire.19 nutrient intake was calculated by multiplying the reported frequency by the nutritional content of the indicated portion sizes. we calculated glycemic load in a manner similar to previous approaches.20 we adjusted each nutrient for total energy intake by using the residual method.21 to incorporate diet into the health index, we considered 6 dietary factors as proposed by others12,13 and the association of each with vascular disease22-25: cereal fiber, folate (including from supplement intake), the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat, omega-3 fatty acids, trans fats, and glycemic load. consumption of these dietary components was grouped into deciles and scored from 0 to 9 (inverse for trans fat and glycemic load), with 0 being least healthy consumption. the individual scores were then summed to a total diet score, which we categorized into quintiles.

the overall health index was calculated by assigning scores of 0 to 4 to each individual variable category, for which a higher point value indicates a healthier behavior. the health index ranged from 0 to 20. healthiest behavior was defined as never smoking, consumption of between 4 and less than 10.5 alcoholic drinks per week, exercise 4 or more times weekly, a bmi lower than 22, and a healthy diet (ie, high in cereal fiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids, with a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat, and low in trans fat and glycemic load). the assigned point scheme per individual health behavior is summarized in table 1. we a priori divided the health index into categories of 0 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12, 13 to 16, and 17 to 20 points, reflecting the 4-point scheme that was used to create the index. we also evaluated the association between the health index as a continuous term and stroke risk.

ascertainment of stroke
participants who reported a stroke on a follow-up questionnaire were asked for permission to review their medical records. a diagnosis of stroke was confirmed only after review of the medical records by an end-points committee of physicians. a nonfatal stroke was defined as a focal-neurological deficit of sudden onset and vascular mechanism that lasted more than 24 hours. cases of fatal stroke were documented if they had evidence of cerebrovascular mechanism using information obtained from all available sources, including death certificates and hospital records. clinical information and results from brain imaging were used to distinguish among ischemic, hemorrhagic, and unknown subtype. the interobserver agreement of the classification of stroke and its major subtypes in the whs was excellent.26

statistical analyses
of the 39 876 participants, we excluded 2237 women with information missing on lifestyle factors and 3 women who reported a stroke before the baseline questionnaire, leaving 37 636 for this analysis. we used cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between the health index and the risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. we calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (cis), using the category conventionally believed to be least healthy as the reference group. we distinguished 2 multivariable models. model 1 controlled for age (quadratic term), postmenopausal hormone use (never, past, or current), past and present use of oral contraceptives, family history of myocardial infarction before age 60 years, annual household income (<$50 000, $50 000 to <$100 000, or ≥$100 000), highest level of education (less than a bachelor's degree, bachelor's degree, or master's degree or doctorate), location of residence (northeast, southeast, midwest, or west), marital status (single, married, or other), ethnicity (white, black, or other), and randomized treatment assignments. model 2 additionally controlled for the potential consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle—history of hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm hg, diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm hg, or self-reported physician-diagnosed hypertension), antihypertensive treatment, history of diabetes mellitus, and history of cholesterol of 240 mg/dl (6.21 mmol/l) or higher.

we evaluated whether the association between the health index and stroke was modified by age (<55, 55-64, or ≥65 years) and history of hypertension (defined as before). we tested age-adjusted effect modification by using the likelihood ratio test. we calculated p for trend across the mean values of health index categories. all analyses were performed with sas version 9.1 (sas institute inc, cary, nc); p values are 2-tailed, and we considered p<.05 statistically significant.

results
after a mean of 10 years of follow-up (374 658 person-years), 450 strokes (356 ischemic, 90 hemorrhagic, and 4 unknown) were confirmed among the 37 636 participating women. table 1 summarizes the association between health index categories and the individual components of the index. in addition, we provide the association between individual components and risk of total stroke. as expected, women with 17 or more health index points (4.7% of the study population) were less likely to be current smokers, exercised more regularly, drank alcohol in moderation, had a lean bmi, and had a high diet score. we found strong associations between smoking, as well as bmi, and risk of stroke, whereas there was no apparent association between alcohol consumption and exercise with stroke risk. the diet score was inversely associated with stroke risk.

in table 2, we summarize the association between various baseline characteristics and health index categories. as expected, the proportion of participants who reported history of hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes mellitus, or history of elevated cholesterol was higher in the lower health index categories. current use of postmenopausal hormones was higher in the high health index categories, whereas the proportion of women with a family history of premature myocardial infarction was lower. black women were more likely to be in the low health index category. women in the low health index category reported lower annual household income, had lower levels of education, were less likely to be married, and were more likely to live in the southeast or midwest.

the overall health index showed strong associations between total and ischemic stroke but not hemorrhagic stroke (table 3). compared with women with 0 to 4 health index points, women with 17 to 20 points had multivariable-adjusted (model 1) hrs of 0.45 (95% ci, 0.24-0.83) for total, 0.29 (95% ci, 0.14-0.63) for ischemic, and 1.27 (95% ci, 0.37-4.29) for hemorrhagic stroke. there was a significant trend across the mean values of health index categories for total and ischemic stroke (p<.001 for both) but not for hemorrhagic stroke (p = .62). additional adjustment for the potential consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle—indicators of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and elevated cholesterol—attenuated these associations; however, there remained a statistically significant reduction of risk for total and ischemic stroke.

when we evaluated the association between health index as a continuous term and stroke, a 1-unit increase was associated with a 5% reduction (95% ci, −2% to −7%) for total stroke, a 6% reduction (95% ci, −3% to −9%) for ischemic stroke, and 0% (95% ci, −6% to 6%) for hemorrhagic stroke. we found no statistically significant deviation from linearity (p>.27 for total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke).

the beneficial effect of healthy lifestyle was apparent in all age groups, although the trend was not statistically significant among women 65 years or older. overall, however, the association between healthy lifestyle and risk of total stroke was not statistically significantly modified by age (p = .67). healthy lifestyle consistently reduced the risk of total stroke among women with hypertension (p = .007 for trend) and among women with no history of hypertension (p = .03 for trend); hypertensive state was not a statistically significant effect modifier (p = .59 for interaction). furthermore, there was no effect modification according to randomized aspirin (p = .95 for interaction) or vitamin e (p = .23 for interaction) assignment.

because some may consider an increased relative body weight (ie, bmi) to be a consequence rather than a component of an unhealthy lifestyle, we also created another health index incorporating all lifestyle variables except bmi. this score ranged from 0 to 16 points. the association between this health index and stroke showed similar but weaker associations compared with the health index including bmi. compared with women with 0 to 4 points, women with 13 to 16 points (healthiest category) had multivariable-adjusted hrs of 0.58 (95% ci, 0.37-0.92; p = .03 for trend) for total, 0.54 (95% ci, 0.31-0.92; p = .04 for trend) for ischemic, and 0.36 (95% ci, 0.27-1.60; p = .35 for trend) for hemorrhagic stroke. additional adjustments for bmi categories reduced the effect estimates and led to nonsignificant trends across health index categories for all outcomes. the association between the health index that excluded bmi and total stroke was not statistically significantly modified by bmi categories.

comment
in this large prospective cohort of women, a composite healthy lifestyle involving abstinence from smoking, low bmi, moderate alcohol consumption, regular exercise, and a healthy diet was associated with a substantial reduction in risk of total and ischemic stroke. these associations were apparent even after controlling for the potential biological mediators hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and elevated cholesterol. the association was not significantly modified by age or history of hypertension. the association between healthy lifestyle and hemorrhagic stroke was less clear, and the results suggested a u-shaped association. however, the number of hemorrhagic stroke cases was small, so the effect estimates were imprecise.

with regard to the individual components of the health index, we found substantial reduction of stroke risk for women who never smoked or were past smokers and for women who had lower bmi. alcohol consumption and physical activity were only weakly associated with risk of total stroke. surprisingly, the diet index was inversely related to stroke risk. the increased risk of stroke among those with the healthier diet was apparent for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (data not shown). excluding diet from the health index did not change the association between the remaining health index with total and ischemic stroke (p<.001 for trend) and showed no significant beneficial association with hemorrhagic stroke (p = .30 for trend).

our finding for smoking is in agreement with results from previous studies that established smoking as an independent risk factor for ischemic3,27 and hemorrhagic4,28,29 stroke. the risk of stroke from smoking is dose related, and there is good evidence that smoking cessation can reduce the risk of stroke,3 which is supported by our results.

overweight and obesity have been associated consistently with increased risk of total and ischemic stroke.8,9 however, the association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke is less clear, with a generally positive association in men17 but inconsistent associations in women,8,9 which may explain in part the lack of association between our health index and risk of hemorrhagic stroke. when we evaluated a healthy lifestyle excluding bmi, we found similar but weaker associations with stroke risk compared with the health index incorporating bmi.

with regard to physical activity and alcohol consumption, meta-analyses of observational studies indicate a protective effect of moderately intense physical activity on total stroke,7 a j-shaped association between alcohol consumption and the risks of total and ischemic stroke,18 and a linear association between alcohol consumption and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. heavy alcohol consumption was associated with an increased relative risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke.18 in our data, moderate alcohol consumption and vigorous physical activity were not strongly associated with stroke risk.

compared with the association between diet and coronary heart disease, the association between dietary factors and stroke risk is less well studied. in this study, we considered the main components of a previously proposed diet index that mostly related to coronary heart disease.12,13,22-25 although results from previous studies did not indicate strong associations with components of the diet index and risk of stroke, such as consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids,30 glycemic load among obese women,31 or even inverse associations with hemorrhagic stroke,32 our diet results were still unexpected. future study should address the association between dietary factors and risk of stroke and stroke subtypes. a western dietary pattern may increase stroke risk, but a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish may protect against stroke.11

despite the numerous studies on individual lifestyle factors and risk of stroke, evaluations of combined effects of these factors are sparse. for coronary heart disease, analyses from the nurses' health study showed a substantial reduction in risk of coronary heart disease for women who lived healthy lifestyles.12 women who never smoked, had low bmi, exercised regularly, consumed alcohol moderately, and ate a healthy diet had an adjusted relative risk of coronary heart disease of 0.17 (95% ci, 0.07-0.41) compared with the other women in the study. in secondary analyses, the authors also included total stroke in the outcome, yielding a relative risk of 0.25 (95% ci, 0.14-0.44) for the healthy lifestyle group compared with the other women. the number of stroke cases was too small, however, to provide separate estimates for stroke.

strengths of our study include the large number of outcome events and participants, long follow-up and high participation rate, detailed standardized information on many lifestyle factors, confirmed stroke cases with high interobserver agreement,26 and the homogeneity of the cohort, which reduces confounding by access to medical care.

several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. first, information on all lifestyle factors was self-reported, so misclassification is possible. however, in a prospective study, misclassification is typically considered nondifferential and therefore is expected to lead to an underestimation of risk. in addition, health professionals are known to report their health status and lifestyle factors with reasonable accuracy.33 second, women who participated in the whs were health professionals and mostly white. thus, generalizability to other populations may be limited; blacks and hispanics have a higher incidence of stroke,34 and lifestyle factors may be part of the reason for this observation. our data support the contention that blacks and those with lower socioeconomic status have less healthy lifestyles. third, despite adjustments for potential confounding factors, residual confounding remains plausible because our study design is observational. fourth, we did not update information on lifestyle factors during follow-up because such updated information was not ascertained for all factors that were included in the health index. fifth, the relationship between the health index and stroke is influenced by the weight given to each component of the index. because we did not aim to maximize the likelihood of observing a significant effect, we chose to give equal weight to each health-behavior component. however, because the use of equal weight is an imperfect approximation of the underlying biological relationships between the different health behaviors and stroke, future analyses should examine the issue of weighting.

in conclusion, in this large prospective cohort of apparently healthy women, a healthy lifestyle was associated with a substantial and statistically significant reduction in the risk of total and ischemic stroke with no apparent benefit in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. our findings show the importance of healthy behaviors in the prevention of total and ischemic stroke.

introduction
migraine is a common primary headache disorder characterised by severe, pulsating, mostly unilateral headaches accompanied by vomiting, nausea, and autonomic dysfunctions. in the united states alone, about 18% of the female population and 6% of the male population have migraine headaches.1 some people experience transient neurological symptoms before or during the headache that are most often visual, such as seeing zigzag lines or flash spots, but might also include sensory or motor symptoms. these symptoms are known as migraine aura. the pathophysiology of migraine involves the neuronal system as well as the cranial vascular system.2 peripheral arteries can also be affected in patients with migraine.3 4

migraine with aura is associated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke,5 6 7 8 angina,9 10 and other ischaemic vascular events, including myocardial infarction.11 12 it remains unclear which mechanisms link migraine with vascular events and whether the biological mechanisms leading to ischaemic stroke differ from the mechanisms leading to myocardial infarction.

migraine with aura has also been associated with an unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile and increased 10 year predicted risk of coronary heart disease based on the framingham risk score.13 this has led to speculation about whether the increased risk of ischaemic vascular events among patients with migraine with aura is partly caused by this increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. several observations question this hypothesis. firstly, the association between migraine and ischaemic vascular events is independent of many cardiovascular risk factors.11 12 secondly, the increased risk of ischaemic stroke is more apparent among individuals without cardiovascular risk factors,5 7 8 with the exception of smoking14 15 or use of oral contraceptives,6 14 15 or both.8 a potential association between migraine and cardiovascular disease that depends on the underlying vascular risk status is important for clinicians as it might help to identify individuals at increased risk of future cardiovascular disease events. we evaluated whether the association between migraine with aura and overall and specific cardiovascular disease events differed according to vascular risk status, as measured by the framingham risk score.16

methods
study population
we carried out a prospective cohort study among participants in the women’s health study, a completed trial designed to test the benefits and risks of low dose aspirin and vitamin e in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among apparently healthy women. the design and results have been described in detail previously.17 18 briefly, 39 876 us female health professionals aged ≥45 at study entry (1992-5) and without a history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other major illnesses, were randomly assigned to aspirin (100 mg on alternate days), vitamin e (600 iu on alternate days), both active agents, or both placebos. baseline information was self reported and was collected by a mailed questionnaire that asked about many cerebrovascular risk factors and lifestyle variables. twice in the first year and yearly thereafter, participants were sent follow-up questionnaires asking about study outcomes, personal characteristics, medical history, and health habits. for this analysis, we included follow-up information from study entry to 31 march 2007. as of this date, follow-up was 97% complete.

before randomisation, blood samples were collected in tubes containing edta from 28 345 participating women and stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen (−170°c). samples were analysed for lipids and inflammatory biomarkers. total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and directly obtained low density lipoprotein cholesterol were assayed with reagents from roche diagnostics (basel, switzerland) and genzyme (cambridge, ma). cholesterol analyses could be performed on 27 939 of the blood samples.

assessment of migraine
on the baseline questionnaire participants were asked: “have you ever had migraine headaches?” and “in the past year, have you had migraine headaches?” from this information, we categorised women into “no history of migraine” and “any history of migraine.” we also distinguished between “active migraine,” which included women with self reported migraine in the year before they completed the baseline questionnaire, and “prior migraine,” which included women who reported ever having had a migraine but none in the year before they completed the questionnaire. those participants who reported active migraine were asked about migraine specific features. in the women’s health study,11 19 we have previously shown good agreement with 1988 international headache society (ihs) criteria for migraine.20 specifically, we showed that among those who provided a blood sample and reported active migraine, over 83% fulfilled all but one ihs criterion (code 1.7, migrainous disorder) and over 46% fulfilled all ihs criteria for migraine (code 1.1 migraine without aura).11

participants who reported active migraine were further asked whether they had an “aura or any indication a migraine is coming.” responses were used to classify women who reported active migraine into active migraine with aura and active migraine without aura.

framingham risk score
we used the framingham risk score, which predicts the 10 year risk of coronary heart disease, as defined by the national cholesterol education program,16 to classify participating women into vascular risk classes. this score assigns points for age, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, and systolic blood pressure stratified by treatment for hypertension. the points for each individual component are summed and categorised into groups of 10 year risk of coronary heart disease of ≤1% (≤12 points), 2-4% (13-16 points), 5-9% (17-19 points), and ≥10% (≥20 points), as in a previous report of the women’s health study.21

outcome ascertainment
all participants were followed up for the occurrence of a major ischaemic vascular event, a combined end point defined as the first of any of non-fatal ischaemic stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or ischaemic cardiovascular death. in addition, we evaluated any first myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, coronary revascularisation procedure, and angina. there were too few cases of cardiovascular death to perform meaningful stratified analyses. medical records were obtained for all reported cardiovascular end points except angina and reviewed by an end points committee of physicians. stroke was confirmed if the participant had a new focal neurological deficit of sudden onset that persisted for more than 24 hours and was then classified as ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or undefined, with excellent agreement between observers.22 for this report, we included only cases of ischaemic stroke and censored participants with other subtypes of stroke at the time of event. the occurrence of myocardial infarction was confirmed if symptoms met world health organization criteria and if the event was associated with abnormal levels of cardiac enzymes or abnormal results on electrocardiography. cardiovascular deaths were confirmed by autopsy reports, death certificates, medical records, and information obtained from next of kin or family members.

statistical analyses
of the 27 939 women with completed blood assays, we excluded 79 with missing information on migraine status, 321 with missing information on framingham risk score, and 20 who reported angina before they received the baseline questionnaire, leaving 27 519 women free from cardiovascular disease or angina at study entry for this analysis. we compared the baseline characteristics of participants, with respect to their migraine status, using analysis of covariance for continuous measurements adjusted for age. we used direct standardisation to adjust categorical variables for age in 5 year increments.

we used multinominal logistic regression models to calculate prevalence odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the association between migraine and migraine aura status with framingham risk score categories, adjusting for age. we used age adjusted cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between migraine and migraine aura status with risks of incident cardiovascular disease or angina. we ran stratified analyses on categories of predicted 10 year risk of coronary heart disease based on framingham risk score (≤1%, 2-4%, 5-9%, and ≥10%). in addition, we ran stratified analyses of the association between migraine and the various outcomes for individual components of the framingham risk score (age, systolic blood pressure, smoking, total cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol). all analyses were performed with sas version 9.1 (sas, cary, nc); p values were two tailed and p<0.05 was considered significant.

results
of the 27 519 participants, 5074 (18.4%) women reported any history of migraine, and 3577 (13.0%) reported active migraine (migraine in the year before the baseline questionnaire), of whom 1418 (39.6%) reported migraine aura.

table 1⇓ summarises the association between baseline characteristics according to migraine status. compared with women without a history of migraine, women with active migraine with aura were younger, less likely to consume alcohol, less likely to exercise regularly, and more likely to currently use hormone therapy after the menopause. women with prior migraine tended to have raised total cholesterol concentration and were more likely to currently smoke cigarettes, have higher systolic blood pressure, and to have a history of hypertension compared with the other migraine groups. mean concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol was higher among women without a history of migraine. family history of myocardial infarction was equally distributed among the migraine groups.

with regard to categories of the framingham risk score, women who reported any history of migraine were more likely to have a higher predicted 10 year risk of coronary heart disease. compared with women without a history of migraine and low estimated risk for coronary heart disease (≤1%), the age adjusted odds ratio of a predicted 10 year risk of coronary heart disease of ≥10% was 1.26 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.49) for women who reported any history of migraine. after further stratification, this increased risk was apparent only in the group of migraineurs who indicated prior migraine (history of migraine but not active migraine) (1.83, 1.43 to 2.35) (table 2)⇓.

during a mean of 11.9 years of follow-up (326 547 person years), 697 participants had a first major ischaemic cardiovascular disease event, which, taking into account the potential for multiple events in a single individual, included 306 first ischaemic strokes, 301 first myocardial infarctions, and 148 deaths from cardiovascular disease. in addition, 647 underwent coronary revascularisation, and 412 reported angina during follow-up. the risk of major cardiovascular disease increased with increasing framingham risk score. compared with women with a predicted 10 year risk of coronary heart disease of ≤1%, the age adjusted hazard ratios for major cardiovascular disease were 3.11 (2.46 to 3.93), 6.04 (4.67 to 7.81), and 10.40 (7.76 to 13.94) for women with predicted risks of 2-4%, 5-9%, and ≥10%, respectively.

active migraine with aura was associated with about a twofold increased risk of major cardiovascular disease, ischaemic stroke, and myocardial infarction (table 3)⇓. after stratification by framingham risk score groups, the pattern of association between active migraine with aura and major cardiovascular disease was u shaped, with the highest estimate in the lowest risk score group. we observed a strikingly different pattern of association for the outcomes of ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction (table 3, figure)⇓ ⇓. compared with women without a history of migraine, the age adjusted hazard ratios for ischaemic stroke were 3.88 (1.87 to 8.08) in the lowest risk score group and 1.00 (0.24 to 4.14) for the highest. for myocardial infarction, these estimates were 1.29 (0.40 to 4.21) and 3.34 (1.50 to 7.46), respectively.

with regard to the association between active migraine with aura and coronary revascularisation, the hazard ratios were 1.58 (0.80 to 3.14), 1.70 (1.03 to 2.79), 0.93 (0.46 to 1.90), and 2.21 (1.11 to 4.40) for risk score groups ≤1%, 2-4%, 5-9%, and ≥10%, respectively. for angina, these estimates were 2.12 (1.01 to 4.45), 1.40 (0.68 to 2.88), 1.09 (0.48 to 2.50), and 2.06 (0.82 to 5.17).

when we evaluated the individual components of the framingham risk score, the association between active migraine with aura and ischaemic stroke was particularly apparent for the younger age groups (45-54 and 55-64) and was not apparent among women aged ≥65 (table 4)⇓. the risk was further increased for women aged 45-49 (5.35, 2.08 to 13.79; p<0.001). with regard to systolic blood pressure, we found a greater risk of ischaemic stroke for women with low blood pressure. this trend was further magnified among women with systolic blood pressure <110 mm hg (5.18, 1.70 to 15.80; p<0.004). furthermore, the associated risk of ischaemic stroke for women with active migraine with aura increased with decreasing total cholesterol concentrations. when we evaluated lower cholesterol concentrations, women with migraine with aura and cholesterol <4.40 mmol/l had further increased risk (4.01, 1.15 to 13.96, p=0.03). this pattern was not driven by high density lipoprotein cholesterol (table 4).⇓ there was a u shaped pattern with regard to smoking, showing increased risk for current smokers and those who had never smoked, which reached significance for those who had never smoked.

discussion
summary of findings
in this large prospective cohort of women, the association between active migraine with aura and specific ischaemic vascular events differed with vascular risk status according to framingham risk score groups. the association between active migraine with aura and ischaemic stroke was apparent only among women in the lowest framingham risk score group, while the association with myocardial infarction was apparent only among women in the highest group. with regard to the individual components of the framingham risk score, this diametric pattern of association was driven by particularly increased risk of ischaemic stroke among women with active migraine with aura who were young (aged 45-49) and who had low total cholesterol concentrations. in contrast, women with active migraine with aura who had high total cholesterol concentrations had an increased risk of myocardial infarction. the association between migraine with aura and coronary revascularisation procedures was similar to the myocardial infarction finding, while our data suggest a u shaped association between migraine with aura and angina according to the framingham risk score.

we have previously shown that the association between migraine with aura and cardiovascular disease in the women’s health study remains significant even after adjustment for major cardiovascular risk factors.11 the data presented here suggest that among women with migraine with aura, information on the underlying vascular risk status can help to identify women who are at particular increased risk for specific cardiovascular disease events.

our data add to the growing evidence that migraine is associated with increased risk of vascular events6 8 11 12 and that the risk of specific cardiovascular disease outcomes might depend on the presence or absence of vascular risk factors.5 8 our results are of interest for general practitioners as a history of migraine in combination with information on vascular risk status, as measured by the framingham risk score, could indicate future cardiovascular disease events. this is analogous to recent work indicating that a history of pre-eclampsia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in later life.23 our data imply that among patients with migraine, cardiovascular risk factors should be more carefully sought and controlled.

results of the genetic epidemiology of migraine study suggest that migraine, particularly migraine with aura, is associated with increased likelihood of an unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile and a high framingham risk score.13 compared with participants without migraine and predicted risk (according to the framingham risk score) for coronary heart disease of <1%, migraineurs with aura had age and sex adjusted odds ratios of 1.84 (0.8 to 4.5) for predicted risk of 10-20%, and 4.01 (1.1 to 15.0) for predicted risk of ≥21%. while in our study any history of migraine was also associated with increased predicted 10 year risk of coronary heart disease (according to the framingham risk score), this association did not differ with regard to migraine aura status. we had too few participants with very high framingham risk scores, however, to allow us to evaluate the association between migraine and 10 year risk prediction for coronary heart disease of ≥21%.

potential biological mechanisms
recent studies on the pathophysiology of migraine suggest that migraine can also be viewed in part as a systemic disorder that is affecting the vasculature, and migraineurs might have reduced number and function of endothelial progenitor cells, a surrogate for marker for impaired vascular function.24 even in the absence of vascular risk factors, people with migraine have decreased cerebral25 and peripheral vascular resistance3 and increased likelihood of retinal microvascular signs,4 hypercoagulability,26 and inflammation.27 moreover, the altered vascular reactivity is already present among young patients with a recent onset of migraine (mean age 24.6).3

findings from previous studies have suggested that the association between migraine with aura and ischaemic stroke is more apparent for individuals without vascular risk factors5 7 8 with the exception of smoking and use of oral contraceptives in women.8 14 in particular, people with migraine and no history of hypertension or diabetes had increased risk of ischaemic stroke.5 8 people with migraine also have a higher likelihood of retinal microvascular signs.4 furthermore, the proportion of ischaemic strokes among patients with migraine is less likely to be of atherosclerotic origin,7 8 and, specifically, ischaemic strokes in the posterior circulation of migraineurs are probably caused by microembolism and hypoperfusion.28 the increased risk of ischaemic stroke for migraineurs with aura in the lowest framingham risk score group seen in our study supports these findings. because the score is composed of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, it can be interpreted as a proxy for vascular health. thus, it is plausible that the biological mechanisms by which migraine with aura results in ischaemic vascular events in the brain require a vasculature not altered by atherosclerosis but might involve microvascular changes.

several studies have found an association between migraine with aura and angina but not myocardial infarction.9 10 in addition, patients with active migraine with chest symptoms or suspected coronary ischaemia had lower angiographic coronary severity scores than patients with similar symptoms but no migraine.29 in our data, the association between migraine with aura and angina was increased for patients in the low and high risk score groups. furthermore, our data indicate that the association between migraine with aura and myocardial infarction is apparent only among patients with a high framingham risk score. thus, the effect of migraine with aura on the coronary arteries might involve two mechanisms, one involving a vasculature not altered by atherosclerosis leading to angina and one involving a vasculature impaired by atherosclerosis leading to angina and myocardial infarction. moreover, as women who reported a history of migraine but not active migraine at baseline (that is, the migraine had stopped or the frequency of migraine attacks was less than one attack a year) had a stronger association with high framingham risk score and are also more likely to have increased levels of biomarkers of cardiovascular disease,30 we suggest that an impaired vasculature is involved in the declining one year prevalence of migraine in older age groups.1 as our data do not allow us to directly test this hypothesis, however, future research is warranted to further evaluate potential biological mechanisms of the association between migraine with aura and ischaemic vascular events. of particular interest is whether continuing attacks of migraine with aura lead to changes in the peripheral vasculature, which increase the susceptibility to atherosclerotic changes.

strengths and weaknesses of study
our study has several strengths, including the prospective design, large number of participants and outcome events, long follow-up and participation rate, standardised evaluation of migraine and cardiovascular disease risk factors, confirmed cardiovascular disease events by an end points committee of physicians, and the homogeneous nature of the cohort, which could reduce confounding.

several limitations should be also considered when interpreting our results. firstly, migraine and migraine aura status were self reported leading to potential misclassification. because of the prospective design, however, any misclassification would probably result in underestimation of relative risks and would be unlikely to explain the observed association pattern. furthermore, we have previously reported that our migraine classification had good agreement with 1988 ihs criteria11 and our prevalence of migraine and migraine aura is close to that reported in other population based studies.1 31 32 secondly, we had no detailed information on use of specific drugs for migraine that might be associated with ischaemic events. such drugs, however, tend to be used by all migraineurs, not just those with migraine aura. furthermore, the different pattern of association between migraine with aura and ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction according to vascular risk status can hardly be explained by drug use. thirdly, despite the overall high number of outcome events, this number was small when we stratified by migraine and framingham risk score categories. fourthly, our stratified analyses are adjusted only for age and not other major cardiovascular disease risk factors. we have previously shown, however, that the association between migraine with aura and cardiovascular disease in this cohort is independent of major risk factors for cardiovascular disease.11 in addition, inclusion of major risk factors for cardiovascular disease as well as randomised treatment assignments in the stratified models showed similar associations (data not shown). residual confounding remains a potential alternative explanation as our data are observational. finally, participants in the women’s health study were all health professionals aged ≥45 and mostly white, thus generalisability might be limited. we have no reason to believe that that the biological mechanisms by which migraine with aura might be associated with vascular events would be different in other populations of women.

conclusions
results from this large prospective study of women indicate that information on vascular risk status might help to identify women with migraine with aura who are at a particularly increased risk for specific future cardiovascular disease events with a diametric pattern of association for ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction. physicians should consider evaluating vascular risk factors in patients with migraine with aura.

what is already known on this topic
migraine with aura is associated with increased risk of ischaemic stroke and other ischaemic vascular events
migraine with aura is also associated with an unfavourable vascular risk profile as measured by the framingham risk score for coronary heart disease
what this study adds
migraine with aura is associated with increased risk of ischaemic stroke only among women with low vascular risk scores, while migraine with aura is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction only among women with high vascular risk scores
information on history of migraine and vascular risk status might help to identify women at increased risk for specific future cardiovascular disease events

abstract
background— there is clear evidence from numerous randomized trials and their meta-analyses that aspirin reduces risks of first myocardial infarction (mi). recent data also suggest that other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) may interfere with this benefit of aspirin.

methods and results— we performed subgroup analysis from a 5-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 325 mg aspirin on alternate days among 22 071 apparently healthy us male physicians with prospective observational data on use of nsaids. a total of 378 mis were confirmed, 139 in the aspirin group and 239 in the placebo group. aspirin conferred a statistical extreme (p<0.00001) 44% reduction in risk of first mi. among participants randomized to aspirin, use of nsaids on 1 to 59 d/y was not associated with mi (multivariable adjusted relative risk [rr], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.78 to 1.87), whereas the use of nsaids on ≥60 d/y was associated with mi (rr, 2.86; 95% ci, 1.25 to 6.56) compared with no use of nsaids. in the placebo group, the rrs for mi across the same categories of nsaid use were 1.14 (95% ci, 0.81 to 1.60) and 0.21 (95% ci, 0.03 to 1.48).

conclusions— these data suggest that regular but not intermittent use of nsaids inhibits the clinical benefits of aspirin. chance, bias, and confounding remain plausible alternative explanations, despite the prospective design and adjustment for covariates. nonetheless, we believe the most plausible interpretation of the data to be that regular but not intermittent use of nsaids inhibits the clinical benefit of aspirin on first mi.


the clinical benefits of aspirin in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and primary prevention of myocardial infarction (mi) have been shown in numerous studies.1–4 the most plausible mechanism by which aspirin prevents ischemic events is by irreversible inhibition of the isoenzyme cyclooxygenase-1 (cox-1).5 in the united states, nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are commonly used6 for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects. these effects result primarily from inhibition of cox-27 and reduced prostaglandin production. nonselective nsaids also inhibit cox-1.8 unlike aspirin, nsaids bind reversibly at the active site of the isoenzyme, leading to impaired platelet function for only a portion of the dosing interval.9 aspirin and nsaids share a common docking site on cox-1,10,11 raising the potential for a competitive interaction between the two. a recent crossover study in healthy subjects12 and an observational study of concomitant administration of aspirin and ibuprofen on cardiovascular mortality13 in secondary prevention support this hypothesis.

in this article, we investigate whether nsaids inhibit the clinical benefit of aspirin on first mi among 22 071 apparently healthy male us physicians.

methods
study subjects were participants in the physicians’ health study (phs), a completed randomized trial of aspirin and β-carotene in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. the methods and results of the phs have been described in detail previously.1,14 in brief, 22 071 apparently healthy male physicians, 40 to 84 years old at entry, without a previous history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other major illnesses were randomized to either aspirin (325 mg every other day as bufferin, supplied by bristol-myers products), β-carotene (50 mg every other day as lurotin, supplied by basf ag), both active agents, or both placebos.

baseline information was collected by mailed questionnaires that asked about many demographic, medical history, and lifestyle variables. follow-up questionnaires were sent to participants at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after randomization asking about newly diagnosed medical conditions, including mi, study compliance, medication use, and health behaviors during the study period.

this study includes randomized data on aspirin from the beginning of the trial in 1982 to january 25, 1988, the date the blinded aspirin component was terminated early, primarily because of the emergence of a statistically extreme (p<0.00001) 44% reduction in risk of first mi.1 at that time, participants had been followed for an average of 60.2 months; 99.7% were still providing information on morbidity, and mortality follow-up was 100% complete.

information on aspirin and nsaid use
we classified participants into aspirin (325 mg every other day) and placebo users according to the original randomized aspirin treatment assignment. compliance with randomized treatment was identical for the aspirin and placebo groups.15 observational data on nsaids were collected on baseline and follow-up questionnaires. participants were asked, “on how many of the past 30 days did you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents other than aspirin?” from this information, we calculated the number of days per year on which nonaspirin nsaids were ingested. we categorized participants who reported use of nsaids into 3 groups: no use, intermittent use (1 to 59 d/y), and regular use (≥60 d/y) for each follow-up questionnaire. to reduce confounding by indication, information about nsaid use was obtained before mi occurrence. in a sensitivity analysis, we also evaluated nsaid intake categories of none, 1 to 29, and ≥30 d/y. if information on nsaid use on a follow-up questionnaire was missing, we used the most recent information.

documentation of mi
we included only first nonfatal or fatal mi, defined according to the criteria of the world health organization.16 when a participant or next of kin reported an mi, written consent for the review of his medical record was obtained. self-reported mi was confirmed only after review of the appropriate medical record by an end-points committee blinded to aspirin treatment assignment and unaware of the nsaid hypothesis.

statistical analysis
we used the general linear models procedure (sas version 8.2, sas institute) to compare continuous measurements adjusted for age. we compared categorical variables adjusted for age using direct standardization. we used time-varying cox proportional hazards models17 to analyze the association between aspirin, placebo, and nsaid use and mi. person-time was calculated from the return of the baseline questionnaire until the date of the mi, date of death, or the study’s end, whichever occurred first. we ran separate models in the aspirin and placebo groups. in addition, we evaluated the effect of aspirin, placebo, and nsaids in the entire phs cohort using indicator variables for use of aspirin or placebo according to nsaid categories. we calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios as a measure for the relative risk (rr) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (cis).

we built 2 multivariable regression models. the first controlled for variables considered to be potential confounders of the association between nsaid use and mi. this model controlled for age (in 5-year increments), history of arthritis at baseline, exercise (<1 time/mo, 1 time/mo to 4 times/wk, ≥5 times/wk), body mass index (continuous), history of smoking (never, past, current), and randomized β-carotene assignment. the second multivariable model also controlled for other major risk factors for mi, including baseline information on history of hypertension (defined as self-reported systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm hg, or antihypertensive medication regardless of blood pressure), history of diabetes, and parental history of mi before age 60 years.

to evaluate whether nsaid use inhibited the clinical benefit of aspirin on first mi, we compared the likelihood of the regression model containing only the main effects of aspirin and nsaids with the likelihood of the regression model that also included the interaction of aspirin and nsaids using the likelihood-ratio test.

results
during a mean follow-up of 5 years, a total of 378 mis were confirmed: 139 in the aspirin group and 239 in the placebo group (rr, 0.56; 95% ci, 0.45 to 0.70).1 the age-adjusted baseline characteristics with respect to nsaid use categories are summarized in table 1. participants who used nsaids on ≥60 d/y in any of the follow-up years had greater body mass index; reported more history of arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension; and were more likely to be current smokers. participants in the intermittent-use group tended to be younger.

table 2 presents the number of participants according to aspirin and nsaid use and the number of mis in each exposure group and follow-up period. relatively few mis were confirmed in the intermittent and regular nsaid-use categories. among participants randomized to placebo who took nsaids on ≥60 d/y, only 1 mi occurred. for 13 mis, information on nsaid use was not available in the follow-up year before the events occurred. using the most recent nsaid information for the preceding year, 7 of these mis occurred in the placebo-only group, 1 occurred in the placebo and intermittent nsaid use group, and 4 occurred in the aspirin-only group. for 1 mi event, no nsaid information was available. in the last interval set, a total of 8 mis occurred before the aspirin arm of the phs was stopped.

the results of the age- and multivariable-adjusted models that adjusted for potential confounders of the association between aspirin and nsaid intake and mi as well as other risk factors for mi are summarized in table 3. intermittent use of nsaids (1 to 59 d/y) was not associated with an increased risk of mi in either the aspirin or placebo group. the combined use of aspirin and other nsaids on ≥60 d/y was significantly associated with mi, whereas the use of placebo and other nsaids on ≥60 d/y was not. among participants randomized to aspirin, the multivariable-adjusted rrs of mi were 1.21 (95% ci, 0.78 to 1.87) for nsaid use on 1 to 59 d/y and 2.86 (95% ci, 1.25 to 6.56) for nsaid use on ≥60 d/y compared with no nsaid use. among participants randomized to placebo, the rrs of mi were 1.14 (95% ci, 0.81 to 1.60) for nsaid use on 1 to 59 d/y and 0.21 (0.03 to 1.48) for nsaid use on ≥60 d/y compared with never use. additional adjustment for risk factors for mi did not attenuate the rr associated with aspirin and regular nsaid use (model 2).

when we used a different cutoff for nsaid use (none, 1 to 29, and ≥30 d/y), similar trends were observed. among participants randomized to aspirin and placebo, use of nsaids on 1 to 29 d/y was not associated with increased risk of mi. compared with never use of nsaids, the multivariable-adjusted rrs were 1.20 (95% ci, 0.76 to 1.89) in the aspirin group and 1.15 (95% ci, 0.81 to 1.63) for the placebo group. different risks associated with use of nsaids for 30 days or more, however, were observed in the aspirin group (rr, 2.20; 95% ci, 1.06 to 4.54) and the placebo groups (rr, 0.52; 95% ci, 0.19 to 1.41) compared with never use.

we created indicator variables for each of the possible aspirin, placebo, and nsaid category combinations and calculated the rrs of mi (table 4). compared with the use of placebo alone, the use of aspirin alone and the use of aspirin plus an intermittent concomitant level of nsaid use (between 1 and 59 d/y) were associated with a reduced risk of mi. in contrast, no protective effect of aspirin was apparent among participants who used nsaids ≥60 d/y.

the likelihood ratio test contrasting the age-adjusted main effects of aspirin and nsaids with a model that included also the interaction between aspirin and nsaid use yielded a χ2 value of 8.39 (2 degrees of freedom [df], p=0.015). the same contrast in multivariable model 1 yielded a χ2 value of 8.68 (2 df, p=0.013), and for multivariable model 2, a χ2 value of 8.84 (3 df, p=0.012).

in a sensitivity analysis, we included 7 additional confirmed mi cases that occurred before the randomized aspirin arm was terminated but that were not confirmed by the end-points committee before the data set was closed for the final report of the aspirin arm.1 six of these cases occurred in the aspirin arm and 1 in the placebo arm. the results were quite similar to the primary analysis. among participants randomized to aspirin, the multivariable-adjusted rrs of mi were 1.12 (95% ci, 0.73 to 1.74) for nsaid use on 1 to 59 d/y and 2.61 (95% ci, 1.14 to 5.98) for nsaid use on ≥60 d/y compared with no nsaid use. for the placebo group, the rrs of mi were 1.09 (95% ci, 0.78 to 1.54) for nsaid use on 1 to 59 d/y and 0.21 (0.03 to 1.49) for nsaid use on ≥60 d/y compared with never use. additional adjustment for risk factors for mi did not attenuate the rr associated with aspirin and regular nsaid use.

discussion
in subgroup analyses of data from a large randomized trial, we found a >2-fold increased risk of mi among participants randomized to aspirin who also took other nsaids on ≥60 d/y. participants randomized to placebo who used nsaids regularly had a nonsignificantly reduced risk of mi. these results are compatible with the possibility that nsaids inhibit the clinical benefits of aspirin on first mi. we found no association between intermittent use of nsaids (between 1 and 59 d/y) and subsequent development of mi among aspirin or placebo users.

aspirin reduces the incidence of first and recurrent mi1,4 by its ability to irreversibly block cox-1. this inhibits production of thromboxane a2 and thus increases platelet inhibition.18 this effect lasts for the lifetime of the platelet. nonselective nsaids also inhibit platelet activity of cox-1,8 but this effect does not persist throughout the dosing interval.9 aspirin and nsaids share a common docking site on cox-1, providing the possibility of competitive interaction. basic research findings,19,20 a crossover study in healthy subjects,12 and 1 observational study13 support this hypothesis. in the crossover study by catella-lawson et al,12 concomitant administration of 400 mg ibuprofen every morning antagonized the irreversible platelet inhibition of cox-1 induced by 81 mg aspirin. this inhibition could be bypassed, such as when aspirin was given before a single dose of ibuprofen. intake of enteric-coated ibuprofen 3 times/d inhibited the effect of aspirin on platelets, even when the aspirin was taken before the ibuprofen. no interaction was found between concomitant intake of aspirin and rofecoxib, acetaminophen, or diclofenac.

a recent observational study of secondary prevention by macdonald and wei13 identified 7107 patients from scotland who were discharged after first admission for cardiovascular diseases and followed them up for 8 years. four discharge groups were compared: low-dose (<325 mg) aspirin alone, aspirin plus ibuprofen, aspirin plus diclofenac, and aspirin plus another nsaid. compared with users of aspirin alone, those also using ibuprofen had a relative risk of 1.73 (95% ci, 1.05 to 2.84) for cardiovascular mortality. combined use of aspirin and diclofenac or other nsaids did not increase the risk. although the authors could control for several potential confounding factors, the nature of their data did not allow them to control for lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise.

the strengths of our study include the large number of endpoints and participants, randomized data on aspirin use, prospectively collected data on nsaid use, and confirmation of mi by medical record review. we incorporated change of nsaid use over time in our analyses, and we could differentiate between the effects of intermittent and regular nsaid use. we performed sensitivity analyses on a different nsaid use cutoff and included mi events that occurred before the end of the study but could not be included in the final report of the aspirin arm of the phs.1 both sensitivity analyses led to similar results. furthermore, the phs study population was relatively homogeneous, which reduces confounding by several variables, including access to medical care, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status.

our study has several limitations. in contrast to the randomized data on aspirin, the data on nsaid use were observational. thus, bias and confounding are plausible alternative explanations for the findings, although this is limited by the prospective method of data collection and adjustment for a large number of covariates. in addition, all post hoc subgroup findings raise the possibility of chance as a plausible alternative explanation, a concern mitigated by the mechanistic plausibility of the hypothesis of competitive interaction between aspirin and nsaids. we had no information on the brand and dosage of the nsaids used and thus can give only average effects over all nsaids. during the study period, however, ibuprofen was a widely used nonaspirin nsaid in the us market.21 because the study participants were apparently healthy at baseline, relatively few used nsaids regularly. in addition, few mis occurred in the exposed groups. this is reflected by the wide range of the cis around the relative risks. thus, these relative risks should be interpreted with caution. biological plausibility must also be taken into account. this is particularly true for the relative risks in the placebo and high nsaid-intake group, in which only 1 mi occurred. although some controversy exists regarding a possible cardioprotective effect of the nonselective nsaid naproxen,22–25 an overall cardioprotective effect of nsaids is not expected.9

another limitation to the generalizability of our findings involves the nature of the cohort, which included only male us physicians, 92% of whom were caucasian. we have no reason to believe, however, that the study population and the general population differ with respect to the mechanism by which aspirin and nsaids may interact. the data on all covariates were collected by self-administered questionnaires. although physicians are likely to provide health-related information accurately,26 random misclassification is plausible.

in summary, these randomized data on aspirin use and prospective observational subgroup data on nsaid use over a mean follow-up period of 5 years are compatible with the possibility that regular but not intermittent use of nsaids inhibits the clinical benefits of aspirin on first mi.

abstract
observational studies often provide the only available information about treatment effects. control of confounding, however, remains challenging. the authors compared five methods for evaluating the effect of tissue plasminogen activator on death among 6,269 ischemic stroke patients registered in a german stroke registry: multivariable logistic regression, propensity score–matched analysis, regression adjustment with the propensity score, and two propensity score–based weighted methods—one estimating the treatment effect in the entire study population (inverse-probability-of-treatment weights), another in the treated population (standardized-mortality-ratio weights). between 2000 and 2001, 212 patients received tissue plasminogen activator. the crude odds ratio between tissue plasminogen activator and death was 3.35 (95% confidence interval: 2.28, 4.91). the adjusted odds ratio depended strongly on the adjustment method, ranging from 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 0.67, 1.84) for the standardized-mortality-ratio weighted to 10.77 (95% confidence interval: 2.47, 47.04) for the inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted analysis. for treated patients with a low propensity score, risks of dying were high. exclusion of patients with a propensity score of <5% yielded comparable odds ratios of approximately 1 for all methods. high levels of nonuniform treatment effect render summary estimates very sensitive to the weighting system explicit or implicit in an adjustment technique. researchers need to be clear about the population for which an overall treatment estimate is most suitable.

issue section: original contributions
nonexperimental observational studies are never considered the “gold standard” for causal inference. however, when randomized trial data are unavailable, observational studies provide the only information about treatment effects. even when randomized trial data are available, rigorous patient inclusion and exclusion criteria may limit the generalizability of their results. a major methodological problem in observational studies is that investigators have no control over the treatments used by participants. to account for differences in observed covariates in the treatment groups, investigators must frequently carry out analytic adjustments to control confounding when estimating treatment effects (1, 2). data on scores of potential confounders are often available for analysis, but the richness of this information does not always translate into a reliable analysis (3–6). in studies with a dichotomous outcome, the most common adjustment method is logistic regression of the outcome on treatment and a subset of the pretreatment covariates.

in 1983, alternative methods for control of confounding in observational studies based on the propensity score were proposed (7). the propensity score is the probability that an individual would have been treated based on that individual's observed pretreatment variables. adjustments using the estimated propensity score tend to balance observed covariates that were used to construct the score. several adjustment methods incorporating the estimated propensity score have been proposed, including matching (8, 9), regression adjustment (1, 10), and weighting (11–15).

one difficulty faced with all methods of confounder control (i.e., logistic regression or propensity score–based methods) is that if key predictors or important interactions are not included in the outcome regression model or in the propensity score model, then residual confounding due to the excluded covariates and interactions may be substantial. on the other hand, by including all available covariates and their lower-order interactions, the estimate of the treatment effect can be very imprecise and, in nonlinear models such as the logistic, may even be biased (3–5, 16). thus, it is unclear which adjustment method is preferable in which situation.

to assess the utility of different techniques to adjust for confounding, we used data from a regional german stroke registry to compare estimates of the effect of treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) on the in-hospital mortality of ischemic stroke patients. we chose this scenario because some observational studies have shown an increased risk of death associated with t-pa treatment (17–21), while randomized controlled trials demonstrated no causal association between t-pa treatment and death (22–25).

description of the data set
the westphalian stroke registry is a regional data bank in northwestern germany and has been described in detail previously (26, 27). the registry included all patients treated for stroke symptoms who were admitted to the participating 42 hospitals. patient documentation was performed anonymously and included sociodemographic characteristics, cerebrovascular risk factors, comorbidities, stroke type and severity, and details regarding the treating institution, the mode of admission, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, complications, and discharge conditions.

between 2000 and 2001, data for 12,410 patients with stroke symptoms were entered in the registry. of those patients, 8,208 were diagnosed with ischemic stroke, 2,794 with transient ischemic attacks, 793 with primary intracerebral hemorrhage, and 615 with stroke of unknown mechanism. for our analyses, all but the ischemic stroke cases were excluded. in addition, we excluded 1,880 patients from 19 centers that did not perform t-pa therapy during the time interval of investigation, 27 ischemic stroke cases with intraarterial lysis, and 32 ischemic stroke cases for whom no admission data were available, leaving 6,269 patients for this analysis.

propensity score
the propensity score is the probability that an individual would have been treated based on that individual's observed pretreatment variables. to describe the propensity score, let the dichotomous (0,1) variable z indicate treatment, and let x be the vector of available pretreatment covariates. the propensity score e(x) for an individual is defined as the conditional probability of being treated given his or her covariates x: e(x) = pr(z = 1|x).

the propensity score is a one-dimensional variable that summarizes the multidimensional pretreatment covariates x. among persons with a given propensity score, the distribution of the covariates x is on average the same among the treated and untreated.

propensity score model
the estimated propensity score, (ê(x)), for t-pa treatment was obtained from the fit of a logistic regression model for which we considered the following pretreatment variables: age (5-year increments), gender, rankin scale (28) at the time of admission (1–3, 4–5, 6), time from event to hospital admission (<1 hour, 1–3 hours, >3 hours), paresis (monoplegia, hemiplegia, tetraplegia), state of consciousness (awake, somnolent, comatose), type of admitting ward (normal, stroke unit, intensive care unit), transportation to the hospital (emergency medical service, other qualified transport, private, other), aphasia, hypertension (defined as measured systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmhg or diastolic pressure ≥90 mmhg, or current treatment of hypertension regardless of admission blood pressure), diabetes mellitus (defined as pathologic glucose tolerance test, or two times serum glucose values of ≥140 mg/dl), atrial fibrillation, history of other cardiac illnesses, previous stroke, and the admitting clinical center. during the study period, the associations of age (<70 years vs. ≥70 years), time from symptoms to admission to the hospital (<1 hour, 1–3 hours, >3 hours), and rankin scale (1–5, 6) with t-pa treatment changed in the last three 6-month periods compared with the first (29). we therefore added time-covariate interaction terms for these variables into the propensity score model.

analytical approach
all analyses were performed by using sas (version 8.2) software (sas institute, inc., cary, north carolina). we compared patient pretreatment characteristics with respect to t-pa treatment by using student's t test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. all p values are two sided.

our goal was to estimate the effect of treatment with t-pa among ischemic stroke patients on in-hospital mortality by using different methods to control for confounding. specifically, we compared five methods: multivariable logistic regression adjustment and four propensity score methods (matching, regression adjustment, and two weighted regression adjustments). in the absence of unmeasured confounding, the first of the weighting methods estimates the treatment effect in a population whose distribution of risk factors is equal to that found in all study subjects. this method is also known as inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted (iptw) estimator (11, 12). the second weighting method estimates the treatment effect in a population whose distribution of risk factors is equal to that found in the treated study subjects only. this method is known as the standardized mortality ratio (smr)–weighted estimator (15). both weighting methods can be interpreted as multivariable standardization methods that use different standard populations. iptw uses as weights the inverse (estimated) propensity score, 1/ê(x), for treated patients and the inverse of 1 minus the propensity score, 1/(1 − ê(x)), for untreated patients. thus, iptw estimates a standardized effect measure with the total study group as the standard population (12, 30). smr-weighted analyses use as weights the value 1 for the treated and the propensity odds for the untreated, (ê(x)/(1 − ê(x)), and estimates a standardized effect measure that considers the exposed group as the standard population (15).

we compared the following five methods for control of confounding:

multivariable-adjusted logistic regression model

logistic regression analyses after matching on the propensity score in a range of ±0.05

logistic regression model adjusted for the propensity score (as a linear term and as decile categories)

iptw logistic regression model (11, 12) of response on treatment with the weights 1/ê(x) for treated individuals and 1/(1 − ê(x)) for untreated individuals

smr-weighted logistic regression model (15) of the response on treatment with weights of 1 for treated and ê(x)/(1 − ê(x)) for untreated individuals

matching procedure
we matched participants who did not receive t-pa treatment to those treated with t-pa based on a range of ±0.05 of the propensity score. we chose the matching range of ±0.05 because it is commonly used, provides reasonable balance of the included covariates, and does not lose many treated individuals as unmatchable. we examined a closer matching range (±0.01) and did not find results that were meaningfully different from those reported below. to match participants, we used an automated matching procedure in the sas software that randomly selected a treated individual and randomly selected an untreated individual (comparator) from the pool of potential comparators to determine whether he or she fulfilled the matching criterion. if the selected comparator was eligible, he or she was matched to the treated individual, and the pair was removed. this procedure was repeated until all treated patients were matched to one comparator or until no further comparators fulfilled the matching criteria.

weighted models
for both weighting methods, we used sas's genmod procedure with a logit link to weight participants and empirical (i.e., robust or sandwich) standard error estimation to calculate the 95 percent confidence intervals. since our logistic model is saturated, estimates and standard errors based on our weights will be identical to those based on stabilized weights (11). here, we additionally report the nonparametric 95 percent confidence interval for the iptw analysis based on 10,000 bootstrap samples drawn with replacement from the study population.

for the unweighted multivariable-adjusted outcome models, we considered the same set of covariates as those considered in the logistic regression model to calculate the propensity score, including the interaction terms mentioned previously.

we evaluated whether the odds ratio between t-pa and death was modified by the propensity score. to do so, we compared a logistic model containing indicator variables for t-pa treatment and propensity score quintiles with a model that also included indicator variables for the product of t-pa and propensity score quintiles with a 4-df likelihood ratio test.

results
the 23 centers included in this analysis submitted usable data on 6,269 ischemic stroke patients, of whom 212 (3.4 percent) had been treated with t-pa. of the patients treated with t-pa, 34 (16.0 percent) died during hospitalization. of those not treated with t-pa, 327 (5.4 percent) died during hospitalization. the distribution of patients' pretreatment characteristics with respect to t-pa treatment is summarized in table 1. patients who received t-pa treatment were younger, more often had hemiplegia and aphasia, had more severe stroke symptoms as measured by the rankin scale, were more likely to report a history of atrial fibrillation, were less likely to have had previous strokes, and were more likely to have been living with their family. they were also more likely to have arrived earlier at the hospital and to have been initially admitted to an intensive care unit.

propensity score model
the logistic model used to estimate the propensity score yielded a c-statistic of 0.94. the mean propensity to receive t-pa treatment for patients actually treated was 0.252 (standard deviation, 0.193) compared with 0.026 (standard deviation, 0.070) for patients not receiving t-pa treatment. the probability density functions of the propensity score for treated and untreated patients are summarized in figure 1. as expected, the distribution of the propensity score for treated patients shifted somewhat toward 1 and for the untreated group toward 0. the figure also illustrates that the overlap of the propensity score for the treated and untreated is limited to a narrow range.

propensity-stratum-specific effects
for mortality, gradients across levels of the propensity score for the treated and untreated groups were strong and unexpectedly different. table 2 summarizes information about the proportions of patients who died during the hospital stay in the treated and untreated groups according to percentiles of the propensity score. several things are notable. first, below the 10th percentile of the overall propensity score, no individuals were in the group treated with t-pa. second, among those not treated with t-pa, mortality increased with increasing propensity score, while, among those treated with t-pa, mortality decreased with increasing propensity score. as a consequence, the associated empirical odds ratio for in-hospital mortality increased from 0.25 for the 99th percentile of the propensity score to 25.11 for the 10–25th percentile (table 2). this difference was statistically significant. specifically, for a 4-df test for homogeneity of the treatment odds ratio across quintiles of the propensity score, the p value was 0.008.

almost all (96 percent) of the 212 patients who received t-pa treatment could be matched to comparator patients who did not receive t-pa by using a matching criterion of ±0.05 of the propensity score. in the groups matched on propensity score, the pretreatment characteristics did not differ meaningfully between treated and untreated patients (table 3). the means of the propensity scores in the matched population were 0.233 (standard deviation, 0.174) for treated and 0.220 (standard deviation, 0.177) for untreated patients.

comparison of different methods to control for confounding
the crude odds ratio between t-pa treatment and death after ischemic stroke was 3.35 (95 percent confidence interval (ci): 2.28, 4.91). the effect estimates resulting from the five different methods to control for confounding were extremely different and are summarized in table 4. the smr-weighted analysis yielded the smallest estimated odds ratio of 1.11 (95 percent ci: 0.67, 1.84), followed by the propensity-matched odds ratio of 1.17 (95 percent ci: 0.68, 2.00). adjusting for the propensity score in a logistic regression model yielded estimated odds ratios ranging from a low of 1.53 (95 percent ci: 0.95, 2.48) when only a linear propensity term was included to a high of 1.96 (95 percent ci: 1.20, 3.20) when both dummy variables for deciles of the propensity score and the other pretreatment covariates were included in a multivariate logistic regression model. the logistic regression model including the individual covariates without the propensity score produced an estimated odds ratio of 1.93 (95 percent ci: 1.22, 3.06). the iptw model yielded the extreme odds ratio estimate of 10.77, with 95 percent confidence intervals of 2.47, 47.04 as estimated from the robust or sandwich estimator and 1.21, 96.03 when estimated by bootstrapping.

because of the extreme difference in the empirical t-pa–mortality odds ratio among low-propensity versus high-propensity strata shown in table 2, we report in table 5 analyses restricted to patients whose propensity scores were greater than or equal to 0.05. the crude odds ratio in this restricted population was 1.36 (95 percent ci: 0.84, 2.19). the ranges of estimated odds ratios resulting from the five different methods were no longer significantly different from each other or from the crude odds ratio. the smr-weighted analysis again yielded the smallest estimated odds ratio of 0.82 (95 percent ci: 0.47, 1.44).

discussion
using data on t-pa treatment and mortality from a regional stroke registry, we found that five different methods to control for confounding yielded extremely different treatment effect estimates, ranging from estimated odds ratios of 1.11 (95 percent ci: 0.67, 1.84) for the smr-weighted estimator to 10.77 (95 percent ci: 2.47, 47.04) for the iptw estimator. randomized clinical trials showed no significant effect of t-pa treatment on death among patients with ischemic stroke (22–25). in a cumulative meta-analysis of several randomized trials, the pooled relative risk estimate for death due to t-pa treatment was 1.16 (95 percent ci: 0.95, 1.43) (31). the smr-weighted estimate and the propensity-matched estimate did not differ significantly from the null value and were very close to the risk estimates obtained from the randomized trials. the effect estimates from outcome models that included the propensity score depended on incorporation of the score. when the score was included as a linear term, no statistically significant association was found. in contrast, all other methods suggested increased risk of in-hospital mortality.

we now argue that the variation we observed in effect estimates cannot be ascribed to the small numbers of subjects in the low-propensity strata and the variability of the associated estimated odds ratios. furthermore, we argue that this variation does not prove or even suggest that any one of the five methods is superior for controlling confounding. the analyses reported in table 4 instead answer different questions implicit or explicit in the adjustment method.

in the absence of unmeasured confounding, the smr-weighted method estimates the average treatment effect in a population whose distribution of risk factors is equal to that for the t-pa-treated patients only (15). as shown in table 2, most of the treated patients were in the propensity strata with a low associated risk of death and had an empirical odds ratio of less than 2.2, so it is not surprising that the smr-weighted odds ratio was 1.11. in contrast, iptw estimates the average effect of treatment in the entire study population, that is, for patients who were and were not treated with t-pa. given that 65 percent of the entire study population was in the three propensity strata associated with high empirical odds ratios (table 2), it is not surprising that the iptw estimate is 10.77. similarly, it is no surprise that the iptw estimate decreases to 1.09 when the patients in these three strata were excluded by restricting the analysis to the subpopulation of treated and untreated patients whose propensity scores were greater than or equal to 0.05. indeed, in the subpopulations dominated by patients whose propensity scores were high, the estimated treatment effect is approximately 1. thus, limiting our study population to patients whose propensity scores were greater than or equal to 0.05 produced roughly comparable estimates for all methods, none of which differed significantly from 1 and from the results of the randomized trials.

when, as in the present example, the number of untreated subjects is many times larger than the number of treated subjects, propensity score matching will typically result in all or nearly all treated patients being successfully matched, while many untreated patients will remain unmatched and be excluded from the analysis (which may lead to slightly reduced efficiency). as a result, the distribution of covariates in the (successfully) matched subpopulation will be close to that in the treated study population. thus, it is no surprise that the propensity-matched estimate is very close to the smr-weighted estimate. although the smr-weighted and matched propensity analyses gave similar results in this particular data set, the smr-weighted analysis has the theoretical advantages that 1) data from all patients are used, and 2) it is not affected by further uncontrolled confounding attributable to the inability to find an exact match for each treated subject (32).

in the present study, as in most studies of adverse drug effects, the death rate was low, and the ratio of untreated to treated subjects was large. here, there was also strong and statistically significant effect modification. under such circumstances, the estimated treatment effect from a logistic model that includes only the treatment indicator and the estimated propensity score (as decile indicators or continuous) is largely driven by the magnitude of the treatment effect in propensity strata with the greatest number of treated patients who died. the propensity stratum with the most treated deaths (n = 13) had an empirical odds ratio of 1.21 (table 2). furthermore, among patients treated with t-pa, the fraction (7/34 = 21 percent) of all deaths that occurred in the three propensity strata with large empirical odds ratios exceeded the fraction (17/212 = 8 percent) of all nondeaths that occurred in these strata. thus, it is no surprise that the estimate from the logistic model adjusted for the propensity score would somewhat exceed the smr-weighted estimate, as confirmed by our results. adjustment for covariates in addition to the propensity score made little difference.

data sets in which a much larger untreated population has a strikingly different risk factor distribution than a small treated population are common in observational studies of drug effects. in such studies, the low-propensity strata are composed of those members of the population for whom most physicians regard treatment as inappropriate, and such patients would not meet the inclusion criteria of randomized clinical trials. the smr-weighted and the propensity-matched estimates most closely approached results observed in the clinical trials that evaluated the association of t-pa treatment in ischemic stroke patients (22–25). presumably, this finding reflects a focus in these analyses on individuals who would have been eligible to participate in clinical trials on the basis of their characteristics. restriction to persons whose propensity scores are greater than or equal to 0.05 focuses even more sharply on this target population.

however, the similarity of the result obtained with the smr-weighted and propensity score–matched analyses to the results of the randomized trials should not be taken as evidence that, compared with other multivariable outcome models, these two methods are a better tool to adjust for covariates in observational research. indeed, once we restricted the analysis to subjects whose propensity score exceeded 0.05, all adjustment methods gave fairly similar results. in addition, in most studies in the literature, the effect estimates from multivariable regression models were quite close to the effect estimates derived from various implementations of the propensity score, as long as the number of outcome events was much larger than the number of potential confounders (16, 33–35). an apparent advantage in using the propensity score, however, may be that the strong effect modification in this clinical example is very obvious across propensity score strata, as shown in table 2. this effect modification may be difficult to unveil when evaluating individual risk factors.

a caution with regard to the use of weighted methods is that they can perform poorly when the weights for a few subjects are very large. although some partial approximate fixes have been described (36, 37), there is no perfect solution for this problem. these few large weights imply that the population parameter estimated by the weighted method (e.g., the average effect of treatment in the entire population for the iptw method) cannot be accurately derived from the data in the absence of additional a priori assumptions. in this setting, the estimated standard-error-of-treatment effect, whether based on a robust variance estimator or the bootstrap, may underestimate the true difference between the weighted estimator and the population parameter it estimates.

with respect to this particular clinical example, two possible explanations should be considered for the high odds ratios found for the three low-propensity strata. first, the time period covered in our study began when t-pa treatment for patients with ischemic stroke was officially approved in germany (august 2000) and thus reflects first experiences with t-pa treatment. initiation of t-pa treatment for patients who had low propensities for this therapy may represent a last-ditch effort to salvage patients characterized by unrecorded situation-specific and individual risk factors. with this explanation, the high odds ratios in the low-propensity strata were due to unmeasured confounders (e.g., presence of extreme severity, physician or family attitudes) not recorded for data analysis. a second possibility is that patients who had a low propensity for treatment may have had contraindications to t-pa based on their recorded values for some covariates in the database. in that case, the high odds ratio for these patients would be solely attributable to effect modification by these covariates and not to confounding.

seen in this light, the iptw analysis gives at best (i.e., when the effect-modification rather than the confounding explanation is the case) the “right” answer to the possibly “wrong” question: what would be the effect of giving t-pa to every patient with an acute ischemic stroke? that question would be wrong if prior knowledge had already ruled out administering t-pa to subjects with certain contraindications. on the other hand, to develop new indications for treatment or to conduct surveillance of the appropriateness of the current indications and protocol, the effect of t-pa treatment in patients whose propensity scores are low may be of importance. it remains to be specified which factors are associated with increased risk of death for patients with a low propensity for t-pa treatment. little clinical experience with t-pa may be one of these factors, as suggested by some studies (19–21, 29).

in summary, in the setting of a nonuniform treatment effect across covariate or propensity-score levels, much of the difference between the adjustment strategies resulted from explicitly or implicitly incorporating low-propensity patients, who were uncommon in the treated group, common in the untreated group, and radically different from other patients with respect to treatment-associated risk of death. high levels of nonuniform treatment effect render summary estimates very sensitive to the weighting system explicit or implicit in an adjustment technique. the divergent results conceivably may all be correct but are answers to different questions. the researcher needs to be clear as to the population for which an overall treatment estimate is most suitable.

abstract
context migraine with aura has been associated with an adverse cardiovascular risk profile and prothrombotic factors that, along with migraine-specific physiology, may increase the risk of vascular events. although migraine with aura has been associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, an association with cardiovascular disease (cvd) and, specifically, coronary events remains unclear.

objective to evaluate the association between migraine with and without aura and subsequent risk of overall and specific cvd.

design, setting, and participants prospective cohort study of 27 840 us women aged 45 years or older who were participating in the women's health study, were free of cvd and angina at study entry (1992-1995), and who had information on self-reported migraine and aura status, and lipid measurements. this report is based on follow-up data through march 31, 2004.

main outcome measures the primary outcome measure was the combined end point of major cvd (first instance of nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or death due to ischemic cvd); other measures were first ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, angina, and death due to ischemic cvd.

results at baseline, 5125 women (18.4%) reported any history of migraine; of the 3610 with active migraine (migraine in the prior year), 1434 (39.7%) indicated aura symptoms. during a mean of 10 years of follow-up, 580 major cvd events occurred. compared with women with no migraine history, women who reported active migraine with aura had multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of 2.15 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.58-2.92; p<.001) for major cvd, 1.91 (95% ci, 1.17-3.10; p = .01) for ischemic stroke, 2.08 (95% ci, 1.30-3.31; p = .002) for myocardial infarction, 1.74 (95% ci, 1.23-2.46; p = .002) for coronary revascularization, 1.71 (95% ci, 1.16-2.53; p = .007) for angina, and 2.33 (95% ci, 1.21-4.51; p = .01) for ischemic cvd death. after adjusting for age, there were 18 additional major cvd events attributable to migraine with aura per 10 000 women per year. women who reported active migraine without aura did not have increased risk of any vascular events or angina.

conclusions in this large, prospective cohort of women, active migraine with aura was associated with increased risk of major cvd, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and death due to ischemic cvd, as well as with coronary revascularization and angina. active migraine without aura was not associated with increased risk of any cvd event.

migraine is a common, primary, chronic-intermittent neurovascular headache disorder characterized by episodic severe headache accompanied by autonomic nervous system dysfunction and, in some patients, transient neurologic symptoms known as migraine aura.1,2 in the united states, the 1-year prevalence of migraine is approximately 18% in women and 6% in men; an estimated 28 million americans have severe and disabling migraines.3

migraine-specific neurovascular dysfunctions4,5 and the elevated frequency of ischemic stroke among young women with migraine6 have led to speculation that migraine may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke. indeed, several studies have found associations between migraine, especially migraine with aura, and increased risk of ischemic stroke.7-10 since some studies have suggested that migraine, particularly migraine with aura, is associated with an unfavorable cardiovascular risk profile11 and prothrombotic or vasoactive factors,12-16 and since the vascular dysfunction of migraine may also extend to coronary arteries,17,18 it is plausible that migraine, and especially migraine with aura, may be associated with other vascular events, not just ischemic stroke. although an association between migraine and chest pain has been described,19,20 an association between migraine and coronary events has not been firmly established.21 in a previous report from the women's health study (whs), migraine was not associated with coronary heart disease after a mean of 6 years of follow-up.22 however, the number of outcome events was too small to conclusively assess the association between migraine with aura and coronary heart disease.

we thus evaluated the association between migraine with or without aura and subsequent risk of overall and specific ischemic vascular events in the whs, a large, prospective cohort of apparently healthy women, during a mean of 10 years of follow-up.

methods
study population
the whs was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to test the benefits and risks of low-dose aspirin and vitamin e in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (cvd) and cancer among apparently healthy women. the design, methods, and results have been described in detail previously.23-25 briefly, a total of 39 876 us female health care professionals aged 45 years or older at study entry (1992-1995) without a history of cvd, cancer, or other major illnesses were randomly assigned to receive active aspirin (100 mg on alternate days), active vitamin e (600 iu on alternate days), both active agents, or both placebos. all participants provided written informed consent, and the institutional review board of brigham and women's hospital, boston, mass, approved the whs. baseline information was self-reported and collected by a mailed questionnaire that asked about many cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle variables. twice in the first year and yearly thereafter, participants were sent follow-up questionnaires asking about study outcomes and other information during the study period. for this analysis, we included follow-up information from the time of randomization through march 31, 2004. as of this date, morbidity follow-up was 97.2% complete and mortality follow-up was 99.4% complete.

blood samples were collected in tubes containing edta from 28 345 participating women prior to randomization. a total of 27 939 samples could be assayed for total, high-density lipoprotein, and directly obtained low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with the use of reagents from roche diagnostics (basel, switzerland) and genzyme (cambridge, mass). of these, we excluded 79 women with missing migraine information and 20 who reported angina prior to study entry, leaving 27 840 women free of cvd or angina at baseline for this study.

assessment of migraine
the baseline questionnaire elicited detailed information about migraine. participants were asked, “have you ever had a migraine headache?” and “in the past year, have you had a migraine headache?” we defined 3 main categories: (1) no migraine history; (2) active migraine, which includes women with self-reported migraine in the year prior to completing the baseline questionnaire; and (3) prior migraine, which includes women who reported ever having had a migraine but none in the year prior to completing the questionnaire. participants who reported active migraine were asked details about their migraine attacks, including attack duration of 4 to 72 hours, unilateral location of pain, pulsating quality, inhibition of daily activities, aggravation by routine physical activity, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, and nausea or vomiting. this information allowed us to classify women based on modified 1988 international headache society (ihs) criteria for migraine.26 of the women who reported active migraine, 46.6% fulfilled all modified ihs criteria for migraine (code 1.1) and 83.5% fulfilled all but 1 modified ihs criteria (code 1.7, migrainous disorder). participants who reported active migraine were further asked whether they had an “aura or any indication a migraine is coming.” responses were used to classify women who reported active migraine into active migraine with aura and active migraine without aura, similar to previous studies.8,22 however, we did not have further details to classify migraine aura based on ihs definitions. to more directly compare our results with those of other studies, we also created a fourth category, “any history of migraine,” that included women who reported active migraine and prior migraine.

outcome ascertainment
during follow-up, participants self-reported cardiovascular events, coronary revascularization, and angina. medical records were obtained for all cardiovascular events and coronary revascularizations, but not angina, and reviewed by an end points committee of physicians. nonfatal stroke was confirmed if the participant had a new focal-neurologic deficit of sudden onset that persisted for more than 24 hours and classified into its major subtypes based on available clinical and diagnostic information with excellent interrater agreement.27 the occurrence of myocardial infarction was confirmed if symptoms met world health organization criteria and if the event was associated with abnormal levels of cardiac enzymes or diagnostic electrocardiogram results. cardiovascular deaths were confirmed by review of autopsy reports, death certificates, medical records, or information obtained from next of kin or family members.

the primary outcome was major cvd, a combined end point defined as the first of any of these events: nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or death due to ischemic cvd. we also evaluated the association between migraine and any first ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, angina, and death due to ischemic cvd.

statistical analyses
we compared the baseline characteristics of participants with respect to their migraine status using the general linear models procedure (sas statistical software, version 9.1, sas institute inc, cary, nc) for continuous measurements, adjusting for age. we used direct standardization to adjust categorical variables and incidence rates of cvd for age in 5-year increments.

we used cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between migraine status and the various outcomes. we calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) and their 95% confidence intervals (cis). the multivariable model controlled for age (continuous), systolic blood pressure categories (10–mm hg increments), antihypertensive medication use (yes or no), history of diabetes (yes or no), body mass index (<25, 25-29.9, or ≥30; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), smoking (never, past, current [<15 cigarettes/d], or current [≥15 cigarettes/d]), alcohol consumption (rarely/never, 1-3 drinks/mo, 1-6 drinks/wk, or ≥1 drinks/d), exercise (rarely/never, less than once a week, 1-3 times a week, or ≥4 times a week), postmenopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use (never, past, or current), history of oral contraceptive use (yes or no), family history of myocardial infarction prior to age 60 years (yes or no), low- and high-density lipoprotein plasma levels (quartiles), cholesterol-lowering medication use (yes or no), as well as randomized treatment assignments. we incorporated a missing value indicator in the outcome models if the number of women with missing information was 100 or more and imputed a value otherwise.

we tested the proportionality assumption of the cox proportional hazards models by including an interaction term for migraine status with the logarithm of time and found no statistically significant violation.

we evaluated effect modification by age (<50, 50-59, or ≥60 years), history of hypertension (yes or no), smoking status (never, past, or current), total cholesterol level (<200, 200-239, or ≥240 mg/dl [<5.17, 5.17-6.20, or ≥6.21 mmol/l]), history of oral contraceptive use (yes or no), and current postmenopausal hormone use (yes or no). we assessed statistical significance of effect modification by adding a multiplicative term for dichotomous variables to the models, and used a trend test across the mean values of categorical variables. all p values were 2-tailed, and p<.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
of the 27 840 participants, 5125 (18.4%) reported any history of migraine. of the 3610 women with active migraine, 1434 (39.7%) reported aura. table 1 summarizes the women's age-adjusted baseline characteristics according to migraine status. compared with women with no migraine history, women with active migraine with aura had a more unfavorable cholesterol profile and were less likely to currently smoke cigarettes, to regularly consume alcohol, and to regularly exercise. they were less likely to be premenopausal but more likely to currently use postmenopausal hormones or to have a history of oral contraceptive use and were more likely to report a family history of myocardial infarction prior to age 60 years. the most adverse cardiovascular risk profile, however, was recorded for women who indicated prior migraine—they were older, had unfavorable cholesterol levels, and were more likely to be hypertensive or obese or to currently smoke cigarettes.

during a mean of 10 years of follow-up (278 086 person-years), we confirmed 580 first major cvd events, 251 ischemic strokes, 249 myocardial infarctions, and 130 ischemic cvd deaths. in addition, 514 coronary revascularizations and 408 cases of angina occurred. in table 2, we report the age-adjusted incidence rates of the outcome events per 10 000 women per year according to migraine status. compared with women with no migraine history, the incidence rates of all outcome events were increased among women who reported active migraine with aura. after adjusting for age, there were 18 additional major cvd events attributable to migraine with aura per 10 000 women per year. women with prior migraine had increased incidence rates specifically for coronary revascularization and angina. in contrast, women with active migraine without aura had incidence rates similar to women with no migraine history.

table 3 summarizes the age- and multivariable-adjusted associations between migraine status and the various vascular events. compared with women with no migraine history, women who reported any history of migraine were at increased risk of all evaluated ischemic vascular outcomes, with the exception of ischemic stroke. the increased risk of cvd was strikingly different according to migraine aura status. compared with women with no migraine history, women who reported active migraine with aura had multivariable-adjusted hrs of 2.15 (95% ci, 1.58-2.92; p<.001) for major cvd, 1.91 (95% ci, 1.17-3.10; p = .01) for ischemic stroke, 2.08 (95% ci, 1.30-3.31; p = .002) for myocardial infarction, 1.74 (95% ci, 1.23-2.46; p = .002) for coronary revascularization, 1.71 (95% ci, 1.16-2.53; p = .007) for angina, and 2.33 (95% ci, 1.21-4.51; p = .01) for ischemic cvd death. women who reported prior migraine had significantly increased risk of coronary revascularization and angina. women who reported active migraine without aura did not have significantly increased risks of any cvd event or angina compared with women without migraine history.

figure 1 shows the age-adjusted cumulative incidence of major cvd and figure 2 shows the age-adjusted cumulative incidence of specific cvd for women with no migraine, active migraine with aura, and active migraine without aura. the curves diverge after a mean follow-up of approximately 6 years, showing increased risks of all evaluated outcomes for women who reported active migraine with aura. the incidence rates of cvd death showed a similar pattern (data not shown).

the association between active migraine with aura and major cvd was not significantly modified by age or total cholesterol levels. the association between active migraine with aura and ischemic stroke was significantly modified by age (p = .01) and marginally significantly modified by total cholesterol levels (p = .06), with the highest association among women younger than 50 years (hr, 6.16; 95% ci, 2.34-16.21) and women with total cholesterol levels of less than 200 mg/dl (<5.17 mmol/l) (hr, 3.80; 95% ci, 1.85-7.80). in contrast, the association between active migraine with aura and myocardial infarction was not significantly modified by age or cholesterol levels and remained elevated among women aged 60 years or older (hr, 1.95; 95% ci, 0.91-4.19) and those with cholesterol levels of 240 mg/dl or higher (≥6.21 mmol/l) (hr, 2.80; 95% ci, 1.48-5.30). the association between active migraine with aura and major cvd, ischemic stroke, or myocardial infarction was not statistically significantly modified by smoking status, history of hypertension, or use of oral contraceptives or postmenopausal hormone therapy. the association between active migraine without aura and any outcome event was not statistically significantly modified by any of the evaluated factors.

comment
in this large, prospective study of initially apparently healthy women aged 45 years or older, any history of migraine was associated with increased risk of major cvd. this increased risk was strikingly different according to aura status. compared with no migraine history, active migraine with aura was associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent major cardiovascular events, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, angina, and death due to ischemic cvd after a mean follow-up of 10 years. these increased risks, which remained after adjusting for a large number of cardiovascular risk factors, ranged from a 1.7-fold increase for coronary revascularization to a 2.3-fold increase for cardiovascular death. women with prior migraine had increased risk of coronary revascularization and angina. in contrast, women who reported active migraine without aura did not have significantly increased risk for any ischemic vascular event.

while the increased risk of ischemic stroke among persons with migraine with aura has been well established,7-10 the association between migraine with aura and overall cvd, particularly coronary heart disease, is less clear.21 a large cohort study of more than 12 000 individuals participating in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study found significant associations between migraine and angina compared with those without a headache history; the association was consistently stronger for participants who reported aura symptoms.20 in contrast, there was no significant association between migraine or aura classification and coronary heart disease. several methodological differences may explain this discrepancy with our findings. these include the headache status ascertainment, which was performed after at least 6 years of follow-up and, thus, was conditional on survival, and the categorization of participants into “other headache with aura,” which most likely were also migraine headaches. interestingly, women in this category had a 1.7-fold increased risk of coronary heart disease, which, however, was not statistically significant.20

two studies found associations between migraine and existing vascular events11,28 and 2 other large studies found associations between migraine and coronary events only in subgroups—one among women with a family history of myocardial infarction19 and the other among persons with migraine who did not have prescriptions for triptans.29 another study30 and a previous report of the whs22 did not demonstrate associations between overall migraine and major coronary events. in the previous report from the whs, any migraine history was not associated with increased risk of subsequent major coronary heart disease after a mean follow-up of 6 years. however, there was a suggestion of increased risk of major coronary events for women with migraine with aura (hr, 1.50; 95% ci, 0.61-3.70) compared with women without migraine. given the findings reported here, the trend was likely not significant due to the shorter follow-up and smaller number of outcome events. with regard to mortality, a cohort study suggested a reduced risk of death among women who reported at least 1 migraine feature compared with all other women.31 in this study, however, no aura information was available.

the biological links by which migraine may be associated with ischemic vascular events are likely to be complex; their precise mechanisms are currently unknown. migraine has been associated with increases in prothrombotic or vasoactive factors, including prothrombin factor 1.2,12 factor v leiden,13 serotonin,14 von willebrand factor,32 and endothelin.33 the release of vasoactive neuropeptides during migraine attacks that may stimulate inflammatory responses has also been implicated.34 some of these have been specifically associated with migraine with aura.12-14 furthermore, migraine, particularly migraine with aura, has been associated with the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase c677t genotype,15,16 which is associated with increased homocysteine levels, a risk factor for vascular events. thus, a synergistic effect between the vascular and endothelial dysfunction of migraine and factors that increase the risk of thrombotic events can be envisioned.

migraine with aura has also been associated with a more detrimental cardiovascular risk profile, including elevated cholesterol levels, higher blood pressure, higher likelihood of hypertension, and increased framingham risk score for coronary heart disease.11 thus, it is possible that migraine with aura may be a characteristic that identifies women at increased risk of progressive atherosclerosis and subsequent vascular events. since coronary stenoses and angina are not caused by thromboembolic events, the association between active migraine with aura and these events in our study may indirectly support this hypothesis. however, the increased risk of any evaluated vascular event remained after controlling for a large number of cardiovascular risk factors.

since migraine with aura has been linked with silent brain infarctions10 and has been described as a consequence of a genetically determined arteriopathy,35 a genetic component with endothelial damage may also be a plausible explanation for the increased risk of vascular events. with regard to ischemic stroke, an association between migraine with aura and congenital heart defects, particularly patent foramen ovale, has been proposed as another potential mechanism.36 this, however, is unlikely to explain the association between migraine with aura and coronary vascular events.

the shapes of the cumulative incidence curves for all outcome events show a striking increased risk after a mean of approximately 6 years of follow-up. potential explanations for this, however, are currently speculative and would have to involve a differential effect for migraine with aura. aside from chance, such explanations may include the design of the whs, underlying biological mechanisms that increase the risk of cvd only after some time period, or a change in environmental factors during follow-up.

our study has several strengths, including a large number of participants and outcome events, high participation rate, long follow-up, prospective design, use of standardized questionnaires, and the homogenous nature of the cohort, which may reduce confounding. furthermore, an end points committee of physicians confirmed all outcome events, with the exception of angina, after medical record review.

several limitations of our study should be considered. first, migraine and aura status were self-reported and were not classified according to strict ihs criteria.26 thus, potential nondifferential misclassification is possible; it would, however, likely yield an underestimation of the migraine-cvd association. our migraine ascertainment allowed us to classify migraine according to modified ihs criteria.26 in our study population, as well as in a substudy of the whs,37 there was consistent agreement with modified 1988 ihs criteria of migraine. in addition, we did not find significant effect modification of the association between active migraine and major cvd or individual outcomes by modified ihs classification status, nor did we find a significant association between nonmigraine headache and any cvd events (data not shown).

second, our aura definition was broad and we had no further details to classify participants according to the ihs criteria for migraine aura. however, the aura prevalence in our study is in the range of that observed in other large population-based studies,3,38 particularly to the 37% among women with migraine in the american migraine study ii.3 furthermore, potential misclassification of self-reported aura status would likely yield an underestimation of the association between active migraine with aura and cvd events.

third, since some aura features are difficult to distinguish from symptoms of transient ischemic attack, and since the latter is a risk factor for subsequent vascular events, particularly stroke, the association between active migraine with aura and cvd may be confounded by this mechanism. however, we believe this is an unlikely explanation, since the association between active migraine with aura and ischemic stroke is strongly apparent in younger women who have very low rates of prevalent transient ischemic attack.39

fourth, we had no detailed information regarding the use of migraine-specific drugs (ie, triptans and ergot alkaloids) during the study. because of their vasoconstrictive ability, these drugs may be associated with increased risk of vascular events. the cardiovascular safety profiles of migraine-specific drugs, however, do not support a strong association with cvd events.29,30,40,41 in addition, since migraine-specific drugs are used by all migraine patients, not only those with aura, it seems an unlikely explanation of our findings. in the whs, women were asked on the 48-month questionnaire to provide information regarding medication use during the previous 2 weeks. the frequency of migraine-specific drug use among women who reported active migraine at baseline was 5.3% and was not significantly different according to aura status (p = .40).

fifth, although we adjusted for a large number of potential confounders, residual confounding is possible since our study design is observational. however, the striking specificity of our findings for active migraine with aura and the biological plausibility makes such an explanation unlikely.

sixth, we had no information regarding the duration of migraine prior to study entry or migraine frequency during follow-up. however, when we updated information on active migraine during follow-up, the association between active migraine and cvd was essentially unchanged (data not shown).

finally, participants of the whs were all health care professionals aged 45 years or older and mostly white; thus, generalizability may be limited. we have no reason, however, to believe that that the biological mechanisms by which migraine with aura may be associated with increased risk of vascular events may be different in other female populations.

in conclusion, in this large, prospective cohort of women, active migraine with aura was associated with an increased risk of subsequent overall and specific ischemic vascular events including coronary heart disease. women who reported active migraine without aura did not have significantly increased risks for any ischemic vascular event. since migraine without aura is far more common than migraine with aura, our data demonstrate no increased risk of cvd for the majority of migraine patients. future research should focus on a better understanding of the relationship between migraine, aura status, and cardiovascular events.
