prospective evaluation of criteria for microbiological diagnosis
of prosthetic-joint infection at revision arthroplasty

a prospective study was performed to establish criteria for the microbiological diagnosis of prosthetic joint
infection at elective revision arthroplasty. patients were treated in a multidisciplinary unit dedicated to the
management and study of musculoskeletal infection. standard multiple samples of periprosthetic tissue were
obtained at surgery, gram stained, and cultured by direct and enrichment methods. with reference to histology
as the criterion standard, sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios (lrs) were calculated by using different cutoffs for the diagnosis of infection. we performed revisions on 334 patients over a 17-month period, of whom
297 were evaluable. the remaining 37 were excluded because histology results were unavailable or could not
be interpreted due to underlying inflammatory joint disease. there were 41 infections, with only 65% of all samples sent from infected patients being culture positive, suggesting low numbers of bacteria in the samples taken. the isolation of an indistinguishable microorganism from three or more independent specimens was highly
predictive of infection (sensitivity, 65%; specificity, 99.6%; lr, 168.6), while gram staining was less useful (sensitivity, 12%; specificity, 98%; lr, 10). a simple mathematical model was developed to predict the performance
of the diagnostic test. we recommend that five or six specimens be sent, that the cutoff for a definite diagnosis
of infection be three or more operative specimens that yield an indistinguishable organism, and that because of its
low level of sensitivity, gram staining should be abandoned as a diagnostic tool at elective revision arthroplasty.

the bacteriological diagnosis of infection generally depends
upon the isolation of a recognized pathogen from a clinical
specimen, the nature and quality of which affect the validity
and utility of the culture results. specimens taken from sites
with colonizing flora, such as the throat or surgical wounds, are
of less diagnostic value than those obtained from normally
sterile sites such as joint spaces, the pleural cavity, the cerebrospinal fluid, the blood, or deep tissue. however these “sterile-site” specimens can be obtained only by puncturing the
skin, a tissue which is heavily colonized with microorganisms.
samples must then be transported to the diagnostic laboratory
for processing and culture.
the pathogens responsible for primary deep-space infections are usually distinct from normal commensal organisms on
the skin, but it is precisely these commensal organisms on the
skin that most commonly infect implantable biomedical devices (34). in this situation it is usually impossible to decide,
simply from the identity of the organism, whether it is clinically
significant or a contaminant derived from the skin of the patient, the medical staff obtaining the sample, or the laboratory
staff processing it.
these issues are of paramount importance in prosthetic joint
infection (pji). the development of prosthetic joints has been
one of the biomedical success stories of the century, with major
health-economic and quality-of-life benefits. as a consequence,
the number of joint replacements performed has increased
each year, with approximately 200,000 primary hip and knee
replacements performed in the united states and 75,000 performed in the united kingdom in 1995. despite improvements
in operative techniques, a proportion of prostheses fail, and
infection is one of the most serious causes of this.
pjis have been classified as “early” and “late,” although to
these categories have been added the classifications of “acute
hematogenous” and “positive intraoperative cultures,” the latter indicating a group with positive cultures without prior suspicion of infections (36). early infections present acutely with
overt wound infection; late infections present with worsening
pain in the joint accompanied by loosening of the prosthesis at
the bone-cement interface and sometimes by sinus tract formation with chronic discharge. it is usually necessary to remove the prosthesis and administer antibiotics, either locally
or systemically, to eradicate the infection; this is commonly
followed by reimplantation of another prosthesis to restore
function. there is controversy over the best surgical strategy,
with some advocating a one-stage exchange and others recommending a two-stage procedure (for reviews, see references 12
and 34). other important questions concern the necessary duration and route of administration of antibiotics in the management of acute and chronic infections. answers to such
questions will require multicenter studies, an essential prerequisite for which is an accurate and robust means of diagnosing
infection.
this is of particular importance because infection is not the
only cause of prosthetic loosening, and it may be difficult to
distinguish septic from aseptic loosening either pre- or peroperatively. the preoperative diagnosis of pji relies on a combination of clinical history, examination, and investigations
including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, c-reactive protein
analysis, plain radiography, isotope scans, and the microscopy
and culture of joint aspirates. despite numerous studies, none
of these diagnostic methods has achieved satisfactory specificity or sensitivity in common practice (11, 12, 14, 24). this may
in part be because of a lack of standardization in the criterion
standard(s) used to diagnose infection when tests are evaluated in studies or in day-to-day practice. the presence of a
sinus tract or of intra-articular pus at operation with organisms
visible on gram staining are specific criteria for defining pji
but are very insensitive (2). microbiological criteria and culture
methods are nonstandardized; histological appearances may
be helpful, with a number of studies reporting that the presence of acute inflammation (more than five neutrophils per
high-power field) in periprosthetic soft-tissue specimens is specific for infection, provided that the patient does not have
inflammatory joint disease (2, 10, 22, 24).
in 1995 we established a multidisciplinary team and a dedicated unit for the management and study of musculoskeletal
infection. with the long-term aim of improving the preoperative diagnosis of pji and of participating in multicenter clinical
trials, we have attempted to define reliable criteria for the microbiological diagnosis of infection at revision arthroplasty. we
have performed a prospective study to assess the significance
of positive cultures and the effect of sample number on our
ability to diagnose pji.
materials and methods
patient recruitment. the study was performed at the nuffield orthopaedic
centre, oxford, united kingdom, which is a secondary referral hospital for
elective orthopedics in southern oxfordshire and a tertiary referral center for
complex procedures including hip and knee revision surgery. all revisions performed between october 1994 and february 1996 (17 months) were studied
prospectively. any patient who had removal of one or both components of the
prosthesis was included. to evaluate microbiological results, we used the presence of acute inflammatory cells in histological specimens as the criterion standard (2, 10, 22, 24). patients were excluded if their histology results could not be
interpreted due to underlying rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory joint
disease.
tissue sampling. antibiotics were stopped (if they were previously taken) at
least 2 weeks preoperatively, and samples were taken before prophylactic antibiotics were given. the participating surgical teams were requested to send a
standard set of samples for culture and histology at the time of prosthesis
removal. for prosthetic hips these were (i) a swab of joint fluid obtained upon
entering the capsule, (ii) capsular tissue, (iii) acetabular membrane, (iv) femoral
membrane, or (v) other tissue (e.g., granulation tissue) if the tissue was abnormal. for prosthetic knees these were (i) a swab of joint fluid obtained upon
entering the capsule, (ii) capsular tissue, (iii) femoral membrane, (iv) tibial
membrane, or (v) other abnormal material. if only one component was revised,
multiple samples of relevant periprosthetic tissue were requested. each sample
was taken with a different set of instruments, including a fresh scalpel blade
where necessary, to reduce the risk of cross contamination, and each specimen
was placed into a separate sterile universal bottle prior to transport to the
diagnostic laboratory.
microbiological specimens. specimens were processed at the oxford public
health laboratory in a class 2 laminar-flow safety cabinet by aseptic technique.
samples were disrupted by vigorous manual agitation with sterile glass beads in
sterile diluent. aliquots of the resulting tissue suspension were inoculated onto
chocolate agar plates (incubated in co2) and blood agar plates (incubated in
co2 and anaerobically). gram staining was performed with a portion of the
sample, and the remainder of the sample was inoculated into robertson’s cooked
meat broth. the plates were examined daily for 7 days; broths were subcultured
terminally at 5 days or sooner if they were turbid. organisms were identified by
standard methods and antibiotic sensitivities were determined by the method of
stokes et al. (35), which is a comparative disc diffusion method (5, 35). the zone
of inhibition of the test organism around an antibiotic disc is compared to the
zone of inhibition of a standard, antibiotic-sensitive control strain. if the zone
size of the test strain is no less than 3 mm smaller than that of the control strain,
it is recorded as susceptible. this method differs from the standard disc diffusion
methods of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards, which
depend on zone size measurements that are interpreted against species- and
antibiotic-specific zone sizes. however, there is no major difference in the performance of the method of the national committee for clinical laboratory
standards and the methods of stokes et al. (4, 35). organisms of the same species
were deemed indistinguishable if they had the same colonial morphology, the
same basic biochemical features as determined by the biochemical profiles generated from appropriate api kits (biomerieux vitek inc., hazelwood, mo.), and
an identical extended antibiogram (13 antibiotics were tested). for subsequent
analysis of each patient, the number of samples yielding an indistinguishable
organism was recorded, together with the total number of samples sent for that
patient.
specimens for histological examination. multiple specimens were also taken
at surgery for histological examination and were fixed in a 10% solution of 40%
formaldehyde. they were routinely processed at the nuffield orthopaedic centre pathology laboratory, and tissue was embedded in paraffin. five-micrometer
sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. tissue sections were examined by a single, experienced, osteoarticular histopathologist (n.a.), who was
unaware of the microbiological findings. on the basis of the histological changes
in these samples, an opinion was given on whether the histological appearances
were considered to be those associated with infection. this decision was made on
the basis of the degree of infiltration by neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes as outlined in previous studies (10, 24, 25), which have shown that the
presence of at least five neutrophils per high-power field is very strongly correlated with significant bacteriological growth.
statistical methods. sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios (lrs)
were used to summarize the performance of the alternative diagnostic criteria.
the clinical implications of the test results were investigated by a process of
bayesian probability revision (32), with the lrs being used to estimate posttest
probabilities of disease over a range of pretest probabilities (19). an lr expresses the ratio of the chance that a given diagnostic test result would be
observed for a patient with the target disorder to the chance that it would be
observed for a patient without the target disorder (19). it can be calculated from
sensitivities and specificities by the relationship lr 5 sensitivity/(1 2 specificity),
and it can be used to calculate the posttest odds of a positive result by the
relationship posttest odds 5 lr 3 (pretest odds). the posttest odds can then be
converted back into a posttest probability by the relationship probability 5 odds
/(1 1 odds).
mathematical modeling. for the purposes of the model, culture-positive samples obtained from patients for whom the histology suggested the presence of
infection were considered to be true positives. culture-positive samples obtained
from patients for whom the histology suggested aseptic loosening infection were
considered to be false positives.
a subject-specific true-positive rate was calculated by averaging the proportion
of culture positive samples from patients with positive histology. similarly, a
subject-specific false-positive rate was calculated by averaging the proportion of
culture-positive samples from patients with negative histology. this approach
was taken to ensure that the estimates were not biased toward the results for
patients from whom high numbers of specimens were available, who may represent a more severely diseased group.
a standard binomial expansion was used to compute the probabilities of all
possible test results for between one and seven samples, based on the estimates
of rates of true-positive and false-positive results. lrs were calculated for each
combination of test results and sample size, and bayesian probability revision
was used to investigate their implications for clinical decision making. in addition, receiver operator characteristic curves were plotted for each of the three
possible cutoffs of one, two, or three culture-positive specimens by using sensitivities and specificities predicted on the basis of varying sample numbers.
results
patient details. there were 334 hip and knee revisions performed in the 17-month period. histology results were not
received for 25 patients, and for a further 12 patients histology
results could not be interpreted for the purposes of this study
due to active rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory joint
disease, leaving 297 patients available for analysis. the patients
ages ranged from 29 to 95 years (mean age, 70 years). there
were 178 females and 119 males. there were 253 hip and 44
knee revisions. forty-one patients (13.8%) had an infected
prosthesis on the basis of histological findings.
three or more culture-positive samples are strongly predictive of infection. a range of organisms was isolated (table 1).
we used the numbers of culture-positive and culture-negative
specimens obtained from patients with positive and negative
histology results to calculate the corresponding sensitivities,
specificities, and lrs. the proportion of infected patients over
all (14%) was used as the pretest probability from which a
posttest probability of infection could be calculated.
a single culture-positive specimen was found to be of no
diagnostic value (lr 5 0.7; posttest probability of infection,
10.6%). if the cutoff for a diagnosis of infection is set at one or
more culture-positive specimens, the lr is 4.3 (sensitivity,
83%; specificity, 81%; posttest probability of infection, 40.7%).
increasing the cutoff to two or more specimens growing the
same organism raises the lr to 25.9, which is highly predictive
of infection (sensitivity, 71%; specificity, 97%; posttest probability of infection, 80.6%). however, these favorable results are
due largely to the impact of patients with three or more culture-positive specimens. when the limited number of patients
with exactly two positive specimens was analyzed (n 5 8), the
lr was found to be low (2.1; posttest probability of infection,
25.2%). by contrast, with a cutoff of three or more specimens
growing the same organism, the test becomes extremely powerful; lr 5 169; sensitivity, 66%; specificity, 99.6%; posttest
probability of infection, 96.4%).
the number of samples sent by surgeons is weakly predictive of infection. operations were performed by 12 orthopedic
surgical teams, one of which performed 133 operations (45%
of the total). the remaining teams performed a mean of 15
operations each. surgeons were requested to provide four or
five independent specimens, as described in the materials and
methods section. in total, 1,206 specimens were obtained from
the 297 patients, with a mean number of 4.06 specimens per
patient. there was variation within and between surgical teams
in the consistency of sampling technique. we were concerned
that these inconsistencies might reflect bias on the part of the
surgeon, with fewer samples being sent from joints believed
not to be infected. this could affect the validity of the study,
because low sample numbers might reduce the chance of diagnosing infection by either histology or culture, while high
sample numbers might increase this chance.
to assess this, we stratified the patients into three bands;
those from whom only one or two samples were received, those
from whom between three and six samples were received, and
those from whom seven or eight samples were received. we
calculated lrs for the presence of a positive histology result
on the basis of the number of samples obtained. the results,
shown in table 2, indicate a small but definite systematic trend
favoring a final diagnosis of infection if multiple samples had
been sent.
sampling bias has only minor effects on the overall performance of the test. because we were concerned about the potential importance of the findings presented above, we analyzed
the diagnostic value of different numbers of positive samples in
two subgroups (table 3). group b is the subgroup (n 5 213)
comprising only those patients from whom three, four, five, or
six specimens were taken. group c is an alternative subgroup
(n 5 239) which excludes all patients operated on by surgeons
with erratic sampling behavior on the basis of an interquartile
range for the number of specimens sent of greater than 2.
group c thus contains only patients operated on by surgeons
who sent between three and five specimens at least 50% of
the time. group a is the whole group (n 5 297), as discussed
above, and is included as a comparator. the three groups have
very similar lrs (and hence posttest probabilities of infection),
suggesting that the samples are drawn from a relatively homogeneous group, irrespective of sampling behavior.
lack of utility of gram staining in diagnosing infection. for
many samples, positive cultures were obtained only from the
enrichment broths, suggesting that the number of organisms
present in the sample was low. this impression was confirmed
by the very poor sensitivity of gram staining, the diagnostic
impact of which we evaluated. its sensitivity, measured against
a positive culture result for the same sample, was 6%, with a
specificity of 99.7% (lr 5 20). measured against a positive
histology result for a patient, gram staining of a single sample
has a sensitivity of 12% and a specificity of 98.8% (lr 5 10).
thus, although a positive gram staining result does predict
infection, the sensitivity is so poor that multiple samples from
a large number of infected patients must be examined for each
positive result. furthermore, management was not altered by
the gram staining result, since patients were treated empirically, once samples were obtained, if the clinical history or
examination of frozen sections of specimens obtained during
surgery were suggestive of infection.
age distributions of prostheses with positive culture or histology results. infection is known to be associated with early
failure of a prosthesis, and hence, the majority of patients with
positive microbiology results should have had revisions within
a few years of implantation. by contrast, the probability of
contamination should be constant, so that patients with falsepositive microbiology results should constitute a roughly constant proportion of the total number of revisions performed,
irrespective of the age of the prosthesis. the date that the
prosthesis was inserted was available for 281 patients (95% of
patients), and we plotted the number of patients against the
age of the prosthesis for histology-positive and -negative patients and separately for patients with none, one or two, and
three or more specimens that were culture positive (fig. 1).
the similarities between the curve for patients with histologypositive specimens and that for patients with three or more
culture-positive specimens is to be expected, but it is also
apparent that the curve for patients with one or two culturepositive specimens is as predicted if the majority of these are
positive because of contamination.
mathematical modeling of the number of samples that
should be taken. even though our study was based on data for
nearly 300 patients, the estimates of test performance for different diagnostic strategies could not be investigated reliably
due to insufficient data. the simple mathematical model offered an alternative approach to scrutinizing the predictive
behavior of alternative diagnostic rules.
the results, shown in table 4 and fig. 2, demonstrate that
the model predicts an excellent combination of sensitivity and
specificity if five or six samples are taken and a cutoff of two or
more culture-positive samples is used to diagnose infection.
use of a cutoff of three or more positive samples gave extremely high specificity, but in order to achieve a satisfactory
sensitivity, the number of specimens that the laboratory would
need to process would be impractical. conversely, by using a
cutoff of one culture-positive sample, for a given number of
samples the test was always more sensitive but lacked specificity.
discussion
we have prospectively evaluated the criteria for the microbiological diagnosis of infection at elective revision arthroplasty. we have demonstrated that the isolation of indistinguishable microorganisms from three or more independent
operative specimens is highly predictive of the presence of
acute inflammatory cells in specimens examined histologically,
our definition of infection. we have further used simple mathematical modeling to demonstrate that the culture of five or six
specimens obtained during surgery is necessary to produce a
diagnostic test that is both sensitive and specific. this appears
to be because this condition is associated with an extremely low
burden of microorganisms, as indicated by the lack of utility of
gram staining, the need for the use of enrichment broths to
obtain positive cultures for many samples, and the frequent
occurrence of culture-negative samples from infected patients.
the key assumption underlying our approach is that histology is a reliable means of diagnosing infection. we believe this
is correct, based on a combination of previously published data
from studies with animals and clinical studies. in a canine
model of prosthetic hip joint infection, there was a strong
correlation between infection and an acute inflammatory response (26, 27). this correlation was less strong if only limited
portions of randomly selected specimens of tissue were sent,
suggesting that infection and the inflammatory response were
multifocal. a similar relationship between the presence of
acute inflammatory cells and infection has also been found in
a number of studies with human tissue obtained during surgery
(6, 9, 22–25, 28, 29). our decision to use histology is also based
on the known unreliability of clinical features in predicting
infection (3). although some cases of prosthetic joint infection
are clinically obvious, many patients who come for elective
revision arthroplasty do not have a history of acute infection,
and for many patients the clinical presentation is indistinguishable from early aseptic loosening (16, 36). for these reasons we
believe that the presence of acute inflammatory cells in histologically examined specimens is a good criterion standard for
the diagnosis of infection at elective revision arthroplasty, provided that individuals with known inflammatory joint disease
are excluded and sufficient numbers of samples are examined
by an experienced pathologist. previous studies have used various criteria for the microbiological diagnosis of infection,
ranging from the isolation of organisms from one direct culture
or two or more broth enrichment cultures (2, 8, 12, 21, 34) to
requiring four of five, five of six, or even five of five specimens
(20) to yield the same organism. although several investigators
have mentioned the need to culture multiple samples in order
to increase sensitivity and to overcome the problem of contamination (1, 3, 8, 16, 20, 21, 25, 30, 31, 34, 36), a standardized
method has been neither defined nor validated. our prospective study indicates that the isolation of an organism from at
least three of several independent specimens is diagnostic of
infection.
for practical purposes we called two organisms indistinguishable on the basis of simple laboratory tests and the extended antibiotic sensitivity pattern. care is needed with this
approach, because the antibiotic sensitivity pattern is not an
infallible way of distinguishing strains, particularly among the
coagulase-negative staphylococci, the dominant group of both
pathogens and contaminants in this series. molecular methods
have shown that the same antibiogram may be shared by two
different strains, and conversely, organisms expressing different
antibiograms may appear to be indistinguishable by genotyping. furthermore, multiple strains can be present in the same
infected joint prosthesis (7, 17, 21, 25). nonetheless, our results do show that in a routine laboratory, simple methods of
identification appear to be adequate in most cases.
we found that a substantial proportion of samples (35%)
obtained from patients who were infected on the basis of
histological criteria failed to yield organisms, despite an extended culture regimen that included an enrichment broth
suitable for the recovery of many fastidious organisms. even
for those patients for whom three or more specimens were
culture positive, it was usual to have at least one other specimen with no growth. these data reinforce the multifocal and
low-grade nature of this infection, which means that sampling
error becomes an important reason for false-negative results.
furthermore, the possibility of sampling bias needs to be considered.
on examining our data, we found definite evidence of sampling bias, with an increasing proportion of infected patients as
more samples were sent. to examine the impact of this on our
results, we compared the whole data set with two subsets of
cases; one in which the “ideal” number of specimens (n 5 3 to
6) was sent and one that included only samples from surgeons
with consistent sampling behavior. results for all groups were
very similar, suggesting that the samples were all drawn from
essentially homogeneous groups of infected and uninfected
patients. the removal of data for patients for whom there were
too few or too many samples still leaves data for more than
70% of the patients, and the performance of the test is unchanged.
our impression that this is a condition associated with very
low numbers of bacteria is strengthened by the poor performance of gram staining. although the rapidity of gram staining makes it potentially useful as a peroperative test, in our
center considerable additional resources would have to be expended to make this possible. it is labor-intensive and has an
inherently low level of sensitivity, and on the basis of the results
of this study, we recommend that it be abandoned for specimens from elective revision arthroplasties.
the apparently low numbers of organisms and the problem
of sampling error mean that a number of culture-negative
specimens is probably inevitable. our modeling suggests that
even for an infected patient, when four samples are taken there
is still a 3.0% chance that all specimens will be culture negative
and a 16% chance that only a single specimen will be culture
positive (table 3). if five specimens are taken, these values fall
to 1.0 and 8.0%, respectively. use of the binomial expansion
assumes that all samples are truly independent. when the
calculated (expected) probabilities were converted into expected absolute numbers, there was very close agreement with
the observed values for the samples from the histology-negative patients (chi-squared 5 1.56; degrees of freedom 5 3; p 5
0.66). an exception was that the observed number of patients
whose specimens were all culture negative, despite positive
histology, was greater than expected (chi-squared
5 17.9; degrees of freedom 5 4; p 5 0.001). this may be due to unrecognized inflammatory joint conditions, accidental preoperative
antibiotic use, or infection with organisms that cannot be cultured by the methods used. our technique would fail to isolate
mycoplasma spp., l-form bacteria, and campylobacter spp., to
name a few, all of which have been described as pathogens in
prosthetic joint infection (15, 33, 37). design of a culture
protocol able to accommodate a very wide range of fastidious
organisms would be impractical for routine diagnostic laboratories.
these considerations may well explain the discrepancy between the conclusions from our modeling (five or six specimens
sent; an infection is diagnosed if two or more specimens are
culture positive) and the actual data themselves (infection was
unequivocally diagnosed if three or more specimens were culture positive). if specimens from a proportion of patients have
nonculturable organisms, the overall performance of the diagnostic rules is reduced by the effect of specimens that can never
yield diagnostic information, however many specimens are
sent. we are testing this hypothesis in a further prospective
study.
definitions of infection have been offered by using scoring
systems that take into account clinical, histological, and microbiological features (13, 18). such systems have not been validated. we have instead used an approach based on the calculation of lrs, which allows us to take into account clinical
epidemiological considerations in interpreting the culture results. we diagnosed infection in 30% of prostheses revised
within the first 4 years after implantation but in only 5% of
prostheses revised between 4 and 8 years postimplantation.
the likelihood ratio can be applied to these different pretest
probabilities of infection (table 5). this is particularly useful
because it demonstrates that when the prior probability of
infection is high (as in early failure), the isolation of bacteria
from only two specimens, while inconclusive, nonetheless
makes the diagnosis of infection more likely. clinical information is also amenable to this approach, so the pre- and peroperative probabilities of infection could be modified further on
the basis of symptoms, macroscopic appearances, and blood
tests. we are undertaking further studies to test this hypothesis.
it is possible that our diagnostic rules could be modified to
take account of organisms that are not part of the normal skin
flora and that have a known pathogenic potential. such cases
of infection might prove to be easier to diagnose on the basis
of the need to use a smaller number of samples. unfortunately,
the numbers of individual species of organism isolated were
too small to calculate organism-specific lrs. in any event,
because the identity of the organism is rarely known in advance, it is unlikely that the number of samples taken during
surgery can be modified on a patient-by-patient basis without
affecting the performance of the diagnostic test.
we conclude that the isolation of indistinguishable microorganisms from three or more independent specimens, to be
taken as part of a standard set of five or six specimens, is an
accurate and practical microbiological definition of infection
at revision arthroplasty. we stress that the use of meticulous
sampling technique for the prevention of the cross contamination of samples is central to this approach and that these observations do not apply to acute infections of prostheses, in
which the bacterial load is higher and for which the diagnostic
issues are more straightforward. culture techniques must make
use of enrichment media because of a very low burden of
microorganisms in most samples, and gram staining should be
abandoned for specimens from elective revisions. in centers
where histology is unavailable (and perhaps when histology
cannot be used), our microbiological criteria can be used alongside clinical data to make the diagnosis of infection more
reliable. we have used these findings to modify our practice.
patients with definite infections by these criteria are treated by
a two-stage revision protocol that includes appropriate antibiotics for 6 weeks before a new prosthesis is reinserted. patients
with fewer than two microbiologically positive samples and
negative histology have early reinsertion of a prosthesis and
receive only prophylactic antibiotics.
although our findings are specific to infected prosthetic hips
and knees, we speculate that they may also hold true for other
low-grade chronic infections wherever pathogens and commensal organisms overlap. this includes infections of other
prosthetic joints and implantable devices, fracture fixations
and nonunions, and other forms of chronic osteomyelitis including vertebral and contiguous osteomyelitis. finally, our
observations highlight the importance of considering sampling
error and bias whenever the result of a diagnostic test is a
qualitative one that depends on the analysis of multiple samples. this is the case for some other microbiological tests (such
as blood cultures) and for the histological diagnosis of multifocal inflammation or neoplasia, particularly lymph node metastasis in patients with cancer and gastric, colonic, or cervical
metaplasia.

a unification of models for meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies

abstract
studies of diagnostic accuracy require more sophisticated methods for their meta-analysis than studies of therapeutic interventions. a number of different, and apparently divergent, methods for meta-analysis of diagnostic studies have been proposed, including two alternative approaches that are statistically rigorous and allow for between-study variability: the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (roc) model (rutter and gatsonis, 2001) and bivariate random-effects meta-analysis (van houwelingen and others, 1993), (van houwelingen and others, 2002), (reitsma and others, 2005). we show that these two models are very closely related, and define the circumstances in which they are identical. we discuss the different forms of summary model output suggested by the two approaches, including summary roc curves, summary points, confidence regions, and prediction regions.

1. introduction
there is increasing interest in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of data from diagnostic accuracy studies (deeks, 2001), (deville and others, 2002), (bossuyt and others, 2003), (khan and others, 2003), (whiting and others, 2004), (tatsioni and others, 2005), (gluud and gluud, 2005). typically, the data from each primary study are summarized as a 2×2 table, based on dichotomized test result against true disease status, from which familiar measures such as sensitivity and specificity can be derived.

several statistical methods for meta-analysis of data from diagnostic test accuracy studies have been proposed (moses and others, 1993), (rutter and gatsonis, 2001), (dukic and gatsonis, 2003), (siadaty and shu, 2004), (reitsma and others, 2005). these methods reflect two important characteristics of such data. first, a negative correlation between sensitivity and specificity is expected because of the trade-off between these measures as the test threshold varies (moses and others, 1993), (deeks, 2001). second, and in contrast to meta-analysis of data from randomized controlled trials, substantial between-study heterogeneity is to be expected and must be incorporated in the models (lijmer and others, 2002). the inferential focus of these methods is also a matter of debate. some authors propose estimating summary measures of sensitivity and specificity, or prediction regions within which we may expect the results of a future study to lie (reitsma and others, 2005), while others suggest that in the presence of substantial heterogeneity, the results of meta-analyses should be presented as summary receiver operating characteristic (sroc) curves (rutter and gatsonis, 2001).

littenberg and moses (1993) see also moses and others, 1993 proposed a method of generating a sroc curve using simple linear regression that has been frequently used. however, the assumptions of simple linear regression are not met and the method is therefore approximate. there is also uncertainty as to the most appropriate weighting of the regression (walter, 2002), (rutter and gatsonis, 2001).

two statistically rigorous methods for the meta-analysis of data from diagnostic test accuracy studies have been proposed (reitsma and others, 2005), (rutter and gatsonis, 2001) that overcome these problems but are necessarily more complex. in this paper, we review the characteristics of these methods. we show that although these have been discussed as alternative ways to analyze such data, they are equivalent in many circumstances and hence often lead to identical statistical inferences. section 2 describes the bivariate model, while section 3 describes the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (hsroc) model. in section 4, we explain the relationship between these two models. in section 5, we discuss the different focus of inference and presentation of model estimates suggested by the two parameterizations. a worked example is presented in section 6, and the implications of the work are discussed in section 7.

2. the bivariate model
the bivariate model is based on an approach to meta-analysis introduced by van houwelingen and others (1993) (see also van houwelingen and others, 2002). it has recently been applied to meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies by reitsma and others (2005).

following reitsma and others (2005), we define μai as the logit-transformed sensitivity in study i, and μbi as the logit-transformed specificity. we use the letter μ where reitsma and others (2005) used θ to avoid a clash of notation with the hsroc model defined in section 3. the bivariate model is a random-effects model in which the logit transforms of the true sensitivity and true specificity in each study are assumed to have a bivariate normal distribution across studies, thereby allowing for the possibility of correlation between them (reitsma and others, 2005):

covariates that affect either sensitivity or specificity or both can be included in a natural way by replacing one or both of the means μa and μb by linear predictors in the covariates. for example, for a single covariate z that may affect both sensitivity and specificity, we could replace μa by μa + νazi and μb by μb + νbzi.

3. the hsroc model
the hsroc model (rutter and gatsonis, 2001) was motivated by a model for ordinal regression (mccullagh, 1980) that has been used to estimate a receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve from a single study with data available for multiple thresholds (tosteson and begg, 1988). the model is formulated in terms of the probability πij that a patient in study i with disease status j has a positive test result, where j = 0 for a patient without the disease and j = 1 for a patient with the disease. in the usual terminology of diagnostic accuracy studies, πi1 is the true-positive rate or sensitivity in study i, while πi0 is the false-positive rate, equal to 1 − specificity. the hsroc model is defined by separate equations for within-study variation (level i) and between-study variation (level ii). (the bayesian formulation originally presented by rutter and gatsonis (2001) requires an additional third level specifying the priors for the model parameters.)

3.1 hsroc level i (within study) model
the level i model for study i takes the form

where xij is a dummy variable denoting the true disease status for a patient in study i with disease status j. rutter and gatsonis (2001) chose to code xij=−12 for those without disease (j = 0) and +12 for those with disease (j = 1). both θi and αi are allowed to vary between studies. rutter and gatsonis (2001) refer to the θi as “cutpoint parameters" or “positivity criteria," as they model the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in each study: true-positive rate (sensitivity) and false-positive rate (1 − specificity) both increase with increasing θi. the αi are “accuracy parameters," as they measure the difference between true-positive and false-positive fractions in each study. when β = 0, the diagnostic odds ratio for each study does not depend on the cutpoint parameter θi, and αi is then the log of the diagnostic odds ratio. β is a “scale parameter" or “shape parameter" which models possible asymmetry in the roc curve by allowing true-positive and false-positive fractions to increase at different rates as θi increases. when β≠0, the diagnostic odds ratio varies with θi even if the accuracy parameter αi is held fixed. β is assumed to be constant across studies, although this assumption can be relaxed somewhat, for example to allow a different value of β in each of several groups of studies (rutter and gatsonis, 2001).

3.2 hsroc level ii (between study) model
level ii models the variation of the parameters θi and αi between studies. in the simplest case, θi and αi are assumed to have independent normal distributions, with θi∼n(θ,σθ2) and αi∼n(λ,σα2). more generally, the means of the two distributions may be determined by linear functions of study-level covariates. for example, with a single covariate z that affects both the cutpoint and accuracy parameters,

where the coefficients γ and λ express the effect of the covariate z on the cutpoint and accuracy parameters, respectively. this model may be extended to include more than one covariate, or to allow the covariates that affect the accuracy parameters to differ from those that affect the cutpoint parameters.

4. relations between the two models
we now clarify the relationship between the bivariate and hsroc models. we shall start from the hsroc model. for brevity, first let b = exp(β/2). we can reexpress level i of the hsroc model by splitting (3.1) into separate equations for those with and without disease:

the bivariate model is written in terms of μai and μbi, the logit transforms of sensitivity and specificity in study i. in the notation introduced in section 3, the sensitivity in study i is πi1 and the specificity is 1 − πi0, so

we can therefore relate the random variables that form the basis of the two models:

this pair of equations tells us that μai and μbi are linear combinations of two random variables, θi and αi, which the hsroc model assumes to have independent normal distributions (conditional on any covariates). any pair of linear combinations of random variables with normal distributions has a bivariate normal distribution see, e.g. dudewicz and mishra, 1988, p. 242. therefore, the hsroc model implies that the joint distribution of μai and μbi is bivariate normal. so the hsroc model is precisely equivalent to the bivariate model. we give explicit expressions for the relationships between their parameters in the subsections that follow.

we can express the relationship more concisely using matrix notation. we may write (4.5) and (4.6) in a single matrix equation as

inverting this,
s is then the transformation matrix associated with the change from the bivariate model coordinates (logit-transformed sensitivity and specificity) to the hsroc model coordinates (cutpoint and accuracy parameters). note that s is not orthogonal (s − 1≠st). as illustrated in section 6, it follows that when plotted in bivariate model space (logit-roc space), the axes corresponding to the coordinates of the hsroc model are not perpendicular to each other.

4.1 relation between parameters of models with no covariates
we can then express the relationship between the parameters of the two models without covariates in terms of the transformation matrix s by taking the expectation and variance of both sides of (4.8):

the assumption of the hsroc model that θi and αi are uncorrelated, i.e. the off-diagonal elements above are zero, fixes the value of b and hence the transformation matrix s. so s is a non-orthogonal transformation that diagonalizes the variance–covariance matrix of the bivariate model. on expanding the right-hand side of (4.10), we find that these off-diagonal elements are zero if and only if b=σb/σa−−−−−−√ or, equivalently,

thus, the shape parameter (β) of the hsroc model is determined solely by the ratio of the variances of logit sensitivity and logit specificity in the bivariate model, and, perhaps surprisingly, is unrelated to their correlation. equations (4.9) and (4.10) then allow us to relate the other parameters of the hsroc model to those of the bivariate model:

we can also invert these equations to give the five parameters of the bivariate model in terms of those of the hsroc model:

4.2 relations between parameters of models with covariates
we now move on to examine the relationship between the models when covariates are included. if the bivariate model is extended to include a single covariate z that affects both the sensitivity and specificity, (4.10) is unchanged, while (4.9) for the expectation of (4.8) becomes

the extension to more than one covariate, with each covariate affecting both accuracy and cutpoint parameters, is straightforward. therefore, a bivariate model in which one or more covariates affect both sensitivity and specificity is equivalent to an hsroc model in which the same covariates are allowed to affect both accuracy and cutpoint parameters.

however, a bivariate model in which different covariates are allowed to affect sensitivity from specificity, or covariates are included for only sensitivity or only specificity, will not be equivalent to an hsroc model including covariates, unless constraints are imposed on the relationship between the coefficients of the covariates in the hsroc model. the converse is also true.

5. focus of inference and model outputs
the two approaches lead to different forms of model output appearing more natural.

5.1 hsroc model
the hsroc model gives rise to a sroc curve by allowing the threshold parameter θi to vary while holding the accuracy parameter αi fixed at its mean λ. for the model without covariates, the expected sensitivity for a given specificity is then given by (rutter and gatsonis, 2001), (macaskill, 2004)

rutter and gatsonis (2001) suggest that the curve is restricted to the observed range of estimated specificities of the studies to discourage extrapolation beyond the data. if β = 0, the curve is symmetric about the “sensitivity = specificity” diagonal. this sroc curve does not depict the uncertainty in any of the parameter estimates and depicts the variability in threshold but not in accuracy.

5.2 bivariate model
as reitsma and others (2005) suggest, confidence and prediction regions in roc space can be constructed using the estimates from the bivariate model. as sensitivity and specificity may be highly correlated, separate confidence intervals for the mean logit sensitivity μa and mean logit specificity μb may be misleading. it is preferable to use an elliptical joint confidence region for both parameters. such an ellipse is most easily generated using a parametric representation (douglas, 1993):

where sa and sb are the estimated standard errors of μˆa and μˆb⁠, r is the estimate of their correlation, and varying t from 0 to 2π generates the boundary of the ellipse. the constant c has been called the boundary constant of the ellipse (alexandersson, 2004); asymptotically, to give a 100(1 − α%) confidence region, c=χ22;α−−−√⁠, where χ2;α2 is the upper 100α% point of the χ2 distribution with two degrees of freedom. when the number of studies is small, it may be preferable to use a more conservative approximate confidence region given by c=2f2,n−2;α−−−−−−−√⁠, where n is the number of studies and f2,n − 2;α is the upper 100α% point of the f distribution with degrees of freedom 2 and n − 2 (douglas, 1993), (chew, 1966). such an ellipse in logit-roc space can then be back-transformed to conventional roc space to give a confidence region for the summary operating point.

it is also possible to construct a prediction region giving the region which has a given probability (e.g. 95%) of including the “true" sensitivity and specificity of a future study. the covariance matrix for the true logit sensitivity and logit specificity in a future study is

in practice, both terms must be estimated by fitting the model to the data. the parameters sa, sb, and r in (5.2) and (5.3) can then be replaced by the corresponding quantities derived from this covariance matrix to give the prediction ellipse in logit-roc space. again, this can be back-transformed to a prediction region for the true sensitivity and specificity of a future study in conventional roc space.

6. example: lymphangiography for diagnosis of lymph node metastasis
as an example, we shall apply both methods to data on 17 studies of lymphangiography for the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in women with cervical cancer, one of three imaging techniques in the meta-analysis of scheidler and others (1997) which has been much used as an example data set for methodological papers on diagnostic meta-analysis (rutter and gatsonis, 2001), (macaskill, 2004), (reitsma and others, 2005). a sroc plot showing the estimates of sensitivity and specificity from the individual studies is shown in figure 1.

we fitted both the bivariate and the hsroc models using the nlmixed procedure in the statistical software package sas (sas institute inc., 2003), using code similar to that given by macaskill (2004) and available from the authors on request. note that our results differ slightly from those in reitsma and others (2005) as they use empirical logit transforms and their standard errors followed by the mixed procedure in sas, where we choose to model the binomial error structure directly using the nlmixed procedure.

table 1 shows the parameter estimates obtained for both models, and the result of applying (4.11)–(4.20) to transform estimates from the hsroc model to the corresponding parameters of the bivariate model and vice versa. the standard errors of the transformed estimates were computed by the delta method using the estimate statement of the nlmixed procedure. as can be seen, the results are virtually identical. (the standard errors are identical in theory due to the close relationship between the delta method and maximum likelihood; cox, 1998; cox and hinkley, 1974, exercise 4.15.) by taking the inverse logit transforms of μa and μb, respectively, and assuming their estimates have a normal distribution, the summary estimate of sensitivity is found to be 0.67 (95% ci, 0.60–0.74) and that of specificity is 0.84 (95% ci, 0.76–0.89). in this example, σab is estimated to be positive, though with large standard error. this implies a positive correlation between sensitivity and specificity across the studies, not the negative correlation that would be expected if the between-study heterogeneity was due mainly to variation in threshold.

figure 2 shows the 95% confidence region for the summary operating point and a 95% prediction region for the true operating point in a single future study in both logit-transformed roc space (left panel) and back-transformed to conventional roc space (right panel). the prediction region covers a greater range of specificity than sensitivity, in contrast to the estimates from the separate studies shown in the sroc plot in figure 1, which exhibit more variation in estimated sensitivity than specificity. this is due to the fact that most of the studies had a considerably larger number of patients with negative results on the reference test than positive results, leading to greater sampling variability in the estimates of sensitivity than specificity. the prediction region is for the true sensitivity and specificity in a future study, not the estimated values.

also shown in figure 2 is the sroc curve (a straight line in logit-transformed roc space). note that the sroc curve takes a conventional shape despite the positive estimate of the correlation between sensitivity and specificity. the left-hand panel also shows the hsroc coordinate axes in logit-transformed roc space. note that these axes do not align with the major or minor axes of the ellipse. the θ axis is parallel to the roc curve, while its horizontal reflection is parallel to the α axis. the method of littenberg and moses (1993) (using unweighted linear regression) gives a curve similar to, but slightly above, the hsroc curve, as shown in macaskill (2004).

7. discussion
we have shown that the hsroc model and the bivariate random-effects model for meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies are very closely related, and in common situations identical. in the absence of study-level covariates, they are different parameterizations of the same model. the bivariate model allows inclusion of covariates that affect sensitivity or specificity or both, while the hsroc model allows covariates that affect accuracy or threshold parameters or both. an hsroc model that allows one or more covariates to affect both accuracy and threshold parameters is equivalent to a bivariate model that allows the same covariates to affect both sensitivity and specificity. however, the hsroc model can be more easily extended to include a covariate to affect the degree of asymmetry of the sroc curve.

the models may differ in the options for introducing greater model parsimony by dropping or combining parameters: the hsroc framework allows the analyst to drop the random effect for the accuracy parameter and assume this is fixed across all studies, and hence that only the threshold parameter varies between studies. this corresponds to perfect negative correlation between the logit transforms of sensitivity and specificity in the bivariate model (σab = − σaσb). the confidence and prediction regions then collapse to lie along the sroc curve. the hsroc framework also allows the assumption of a symmetric sroc curve with constant diagnostic odds ratio by setting β = 0, which in the bivariate model corresponds to equal variances of logit sensitivity and logit specificity (σa2 = σb2). the ability to enforce such constraints on bivariate model parameters may vary between software packages. by contrast, it does not appear natural to set any of the parameters of the bivariate model to zero. one practical advantage of the bivariate model is that it can be fitted in a wider range of software, for example mlwin, sas, or the stata package “gllamm" (rabe-hesketh and others, 2004), whereas the hsroc model is at present only estimable using winbugs or the nlmixed procedure in sas.

as we have seen, the different parameterizations of the hsroc and bivariate models arise from different ideas of the most appropriate meta-analytic summaries of the results of diagnostic test accuracy studies, and have primarily been used to produce these chosen summaries. the hsroc parameterization naturally leads to a sroc curve when the threshold parameter θ is allowed to vary between studies but the accuracy parameter α is fixed at its mean. this may be reasonable when there is little or no detectable heterogeneity in the accuracy parameter, i.e. σα2 is estimated to be close to zero, or when there is considerably greater variability in threshold than in accuracy. the bivariate model parameterization naturally leads to a summary operating point, i.e. a summary sensitivity and specificity, together with confidence intervals for each or a joint confidence region for both together. when there is a considerable degree of between-study heterogeneity, as is common in meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies, a prediction region may be preferable to a confidence region.

in our example in section 6, fitting both models to the same data gave near-identical results in agreement with the formulae derived in section 4.1, when both models were fitted using the nlmixed procedure in sas. however, such close agreement may not always be found in practice, particularly if the models are fitted using different approaches in different software. rutter and gatsonis (2001) originally proposed fitting the hsroc model using a bayesian markov chain monte-carlo method. unlike maximum likelihood estimates, bayesian posterior means or medians are not invariant under nonlinear transformations such as those in section 4.1. reitsma and others (2005) fit the bivariate model using the mixed procedure in sas, which, unlike the nlmixed procedure, requires first calculating empirical estimates of the logit transforms of sensitivity and specificity and their standard errors, treating the latter as fixed and approximating the within-study variability of the logits by a normal distribution. this approach is less computationally demanding but involves some degree of approximation when the study sizes are small. in addition, regardless of the method of estimation, there is typically little information on the covariance parameter σab of the bivariate model unless there are many studies of reasonable size with considerable variation in sensitivity and specificity between them. its estimation may therefore prove troublesome (r. riley and others, in preparation).

another reason for apparent discrepancies between results in previous publications is that when fitting models to the data of scheidler and others (1997), authors have made different assumptions about the equality of parameters between the three imaging techniques assessed, of which for simplicity we have only considered one, lymphangiography, in the example here. rutter and gatsonis (2001) allowed all five parameters of the hsroc model to differ between the three imaging techniques. macaskill (2004) assumed that the two variance parameters σα2 and σθ2 were the same while the other three parameters λ, θ, and β differed. reitsma and others (2005) estimated a bivariate model in which the three variance–covariance parameters σa, σb, and σab are the same for the three imaging techniques and the two location parameters μa and μb differ, thereby constraining the three sroc curves to have the same degree of asymmetry.

it may initially seem surprising that (4.11) for β, the shape parameter of the hsroc model, does not involve the covariance σab of the bivariate model but only the ratio of the variances. in fact, σab only enters (4.14) and (4.15) for the variances of the hsroc parameters. it follows that the equation for the sroc curve given by the hsroc model does not require this covariance. it is therefore possible to use (4.11), (4.13), and (5.1) to estimate the equation of the sroc curve from separate conventional “univariate” random-effects meta-analyses of logit-transformed sensitivity and logit-transformed specificity. these could be performed using any of the widely available packages for random-effects meta-analysis. the estimates obtained by such an approach will not be identical to those from the bivariate model as joint marginal normality of two random variables does not imply they have a bivariate normal distribution. however, if the bivariate normal model does hold, separate univariate analyses should give consistent estimates of the means and variances, with only a slight loss in efficiency (riley and others, 2006). separate univariate analyses may therefore provide an alternative to the method of littenberg and moses (1993) as a way of generating a sroc curve using widely available algorithms. separate univariate analyses may also be useful in providing starting values for the iterative procedures required to fit either the bivariate or the hsroc models, which may aid convergence.

there is empirical evidence that aspects of the design and conduct of diagnostic accuracy studies can lead to bias or increased variation in their results. exploration of potential sources of heterogeneity is therefore a crucial component of systematic reviews of such studies. sources of between-study heterogeneity may include differences in patient selection and clinical setting, disease severity, specifics of the index and reference tests, and interobserver variability (lijmer and others, 1999), (whiting and others, 2004). the expected effect of a covariate on test performance may lead to a preference for one of the two parameterizations implied by the hsroc and bivariate models. for example, “spectrum bias," in which the subjects included in a study are not representative of the patients who will receive the test in practice (whiting and others, 2003), might be expected to affect test accuracy rather than threshold, and might therefore be most appropriately investigated using the hsroc approach. conversely, between-study variation in disease severity will affect sensitivity but not specificity, leading to a preference for the bivariate approach. for most study characteristics, however, there are few a priori reasons to prefer one approach over the other; further empirical research on this issue is needed.

the methods explored in this paper assume that only summary data from each study are available in the form of a 2×2 table. meta-analysis of individual patient data may offer particular advantages for diagnostic research (khan and others, 2003). it would allow differences in patient spectra to be properly accounted for, and enable assessment of the additional information provided by a test above that already known from patient history and clinical examination. for test results that are originally numerical or ordered categorical, it would also capture within-study information about the roc curve that is lost when a particular threshold is chosen and the results collapsed into a summary 2×2 table.

in summary, we have demonstrated that the hsroc and bivariate models are very closely related and often identical. the parameter estimates from either model can be used to produce a summary operating point, an sroc curve, confidence regions, or prediction regions. the choice between these parameterizations depends partly on the degrees of and reasons for between-study heterogeneity. empirical evidence about this would be useful in guiding analysts.

comparison of t-cell-based assay with tuberculin skin test for
diagnosis of mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in a school
tuberculosis outbreak

summary
background the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection
relies on the tuberculin skin test (tst), which has many
drawbacks. however, to find out whether new tests are better
than tst is difficult because of the lack of a gold standard test
for latent infection. we developed and assessed a sensitive
enzyme-linked immunospot (elispot) assay to detect t cells
specific for mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens that are
absent from mycobacterium bovis bcg and most environmental
mycobacteria. we postulated that if the elispot is a more
accurate test of latent infection than tst, it should correlate
better with degree of exposure to m tuberculosis.
methods a large tuberculosis outbreak in a uk school
resulted from one infectious index case. we tested 535
students for m tuberculosis infection with tst and elispot.
we compared the correlation of these tests with degree of
exposure to the index case and bcg vaccination.
findings although agreement between the tests was high
(89% concordance, =0·72, p<0·0001), elispot correlated
significantly more closely with m tuberculosis exposure than
did tst on the basis of measures of proximity (p=0·03) and
duration of exposure (p=0·007) to the index case. tst was
significantly more likely to be positive in bcg-vaccinated than
in non-vaccinated students (p=0·002), whereas elispot
results were not associated with bcg vaccination (p=0·44).
interpretation elispot offers a more accurate approach
than tst for identification of individuals who have latent
tuberculosis infection and could improve tuberculosis control
by more precise targeting of preventive treatment.

introduction
identification and treatment of people who have latent
tuberculosis infection by targeted tuberculin skin testing
and preventive therapy is a cornerstone of tuberculosis
control in developed countries.1 the main drawback of
the tuberculin skin test (tst) is poor specificity, since
previous mycobacterium bovis bcg vaccination and
environmental mycobacterial exposure can lead to falsepositive results.2–4 more than half the burden of
tuberculosis in developed countries is carried by foreignborn immigrants from high-prevalence countries, among
whom bcg vaccination and environmental mycobacterial
exposure are common.5,6 the tst also has several
operational drawbacks, including the need for a return
visit and operator-dependent variability in placement and
reading of the test. a more accurate rapid test for latent
infection is a major priority for improved tuberculosis
control.7
the identification of genes in the m tuberculosis
genome that are absent from m bovis bcg8 and most
environmental mycobacteria9 offers an opportunity to
develop more specific tests for m tuberculosis infection.10
early secretory antigen target-6 (esat-6) and culture
filtrate protein 10 (cfp10) are two such gene products
that are strong targets of the cellular immune response in
tuberculosis patients and contacts.11,12 the presence of
esat-6-specific t cells, detected by the rapid ex-vivo
enzyme-linked immunospot (elispot) assay for
interferon-gamma,13 is a highly sensitive and specific
marker of m tuberculosis infection in patients who have
culture-confirmed tuberculosis; its sensitivity is
substantially higher than that for the tst.14,15 in a uk
pilot study of 50 contacts at risk of latent tuberculosis
infection, we noted a correlation between esat-6
elispot results and the extent of exposure to
tuberculosis cases,16 whereas unexposed people were
uniformly elispot-negative.17,18
in february, 2001, a secondary school student who had
had a chronic cough for 9 months was diagnosed with
sputum-smear-positive cavitatory pulmonary tuberculosis.
the health authority screened 1128 of 1208 students at
the school with tst and diagnosed 69 secondary cases of
active tuberculosis and 254 cases of latent infection. this
outbreak presented a unique opportunity to compare the
effectiveness of the elispot assay with the tst.
in the absence of a gold standard reference test, direct
assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of a new test
for latent tuberculosis infection is impossible.4 however,
since airborne transmission of m tuberculosis is promoted
by increasing duration and proximity of contact with an
infectious case,19–21 a key determinant of infection is the
amount of time spent sharing room air with the source
case.22,23 we formed the hypothesis that if the elispot
assay is a more sensitive and specific test than the tst, it
should correlate more closely than the tst with degree
of exposure to m tuberculosis and should be independent
of bcg vaccination status. two measures of exposure
were prespecified at the time of study design: proximity to
the index case, based on school class and year, and hours
of direct classroom contact. three features of this
outbreak made it particularly suitable for this
investigation: there was one infectious index case with
several hundred contacts; the outbreak occurred in an
enclosed environment; and school timetables permitted
precise quantification of the amount of time each child
spent sharing room air with the source case.

patients and methods
participants
the study was approved by the leicestershire research
ethics committee. we invited 963 students, aged
11–15 years, from the same school as the index case to
participate. we obtained written informed consent from
594 (62%) children and their parents. in may and june,
2001, the school nurses interviewed 550 (57% of the total
invited) of these children about place of birth and history
of tuberculosis exposure outside school. at the same time
they drew 10 ml blood samples that were stored in
sequentially numbered heparinised containers.
tst and elispot testing
leicestershire health authority screened 1128 children
with the heaf test, in accordance with uk guidelines for
tuberculosis contacts (table 1),24 535 of whom were in our
sample of 550. screening was done over 2 weeks, from
march 26 to april 11, 2001, 2 months after the index case
was admitted to hospital for treatment.
tuberculin skin testing was done by standard multiplepuncture heaf test with a six-needle disposable-head heaf
gun (bignall surgical instruments, littlehampton, uk)25
and concentrated purified protein derivative 100 000
tuberculin units per ml (evans medical, liverpool, uk),
in accordance with national guidelines.24 heaf tests were
administered and read by the medical and nursing staff of
the outbreak management team. cutaneous induration
was scored 1 week later, in accordance with standard
guidelines, from grade 0 to 4.25 generally, although the
read-out of the automated heaf test is quantified less
precisely than the mantoux test—ie, grades 0–4 instead of
mm of induration, a continuous variable—the two tests
generally correlate well with each other.24–26
students who reported symptoms underwent chest
radiography and clinical assessment for possible active
tuberculosis, irrespective of skin test results.
asymptomatic students with heaf grades 0 or 1 or heaf
grade 2 and a bcg scar or documented history of bcg
vaccination were deemed uninfected24,25 and no action was
taken; students with heaf grades 3 or 4 (irrespective of
bcg vaccination history) or grade 2 with no evidence of
previous bcg vaccination were deemed infected.24,25 all
underwent chest radiography and those with normal
radiographs were deemed to have latent tuberculosis
infection and received 3 months’ chemoprophylaxis with
rifampicin and isoniazid. students with abnormal
radiographic findings or with symptoms were further
assessed in hospital for active tuberculosis; those with
positive cultures for m tuberculosis from clinical samples or
positive radiological or clinical findings suggestive of
tuberculosis were classified as having active tuberculosis
disease. these students were treated with standard shortcourse chemotherapy for 6 months, including
pyrazinamide and ethambutol for the first 8 weeks.
we did elispot assays in oxford on blood samples
from 545 of the 550 students, 2–4 h after venepuncture.
samples were processed and scored by two scientists who
had no access to personal identifiers or tst results.
how elispot assays are done has been previously
described;13,14 for this study we used a simplified, faster
protocol incorporating elispot plates precoated with
monoclonal antibody to interferon-gamma (mabtech ab,
stockholm, sweden), and a detector monoclonal antibody
to interferon-gamma preconjugated to alkaline-phosphatase
(mabtech). plates were seeded with 2·5105 peripheral
blood mononuclear cells per well: duplicate wells contained
no antigen (negative control), phytohaemagglutinin
(positive control; icn biomedicals, oh, usa),
recombinant dimeric esat-6 (dimesat-6), or one of 12
different peptide pools derived from esat-6 and cfp10.
after overnight incubation at 37°c, 5% carbon dioxide2,
plates were developed with preconjugated detector
antibody and chromogenic substrate, bcip/nbtplus (moss
inc, pasadena, md, usa).
assays were scored by automated elispot counter
(aid-gmbh, strassberg, germany). we scored test wells
as positive if they contained a mean of at least five more
spot-forming cells than the mean of the negative control
wells and this number was at least twice the mean of the
negative control wells. this cut-off14 was predefined
before the results were revealed. assays were deemed
positive if there was a positive response to one or more
pools of the esat-6-derived or cfp10-derived peptides,
or to dimesat-6.
as previously described,14 we used peptides spanning
the length of esat-6 and cfp10 (resgen, huntsville,
al, usa). each peptide was 15 aminoacids long and
overlapped its adjacent peptide by 10 residues; purity was
more than 70%. peptides were arranged into 12 pools
comprising two arrays of six pools each, where each array
contained all 35 peptides from both molecules in
contrasting combinations, so that each peptide was tested
in quadruplicate.
we cloned, expressed, and purified dimesat-6 from
culture supernatant of recombinant lactococcus lactis;
purity was more than 95%.

ascertainment of exposure
we classified school students into four groups of
decreasing degrees of exposure to the index case, based on
proximity and shared activities in school: the same class as
the index case; students in classes in the same year (year 9)
who regularly shared classes with the index case; students
in classes in the same year who shared only weekly events
with the index case; and students in different years (7, 8,
and 10) who shared no school events with the index case
(figure 1). for students in the same school year, we used
the school timetable to quantify direct exposure to the
index case, taking into account the attendance record of
the index case during the likely infectious period, which,
on the basis of duration of cough and associated
symptoms, was 9 months. since the index case mixed with
different students for each academic subject, substantial
numbers of students were exposed. we classified students
from other school years (years 7, 8, and 10) who had
lessons in classrooms immediately after they had been
vacated by the index case as indirectly
exposed. direct and indirect exposure
are expressed in school-weeks
(equivalent to 26 h 40 min).

statistical methods
we focused the analysis on estimating
the strength of association between
degree of exposure to the index case
and the elispot and tst test
results. odds ratios are a function
of test sensitivity and specificity,27
and increase as one or both of these
measures increase. for latent
tuberculosis infection we could not
estimate test sensitivity and test
specificity directly, but were able to
estimate odds ratios relating results of
each test to the likelihood of infection.
we estimated the increase in odds
of a positive test result for unit
increase in exposure by logistic
regression. we used matched-pairs
logistic regression to assess the
significance of the difference in the
associations between the tests, taking
account of the correlation between
tst and elispot test results.
similar analyses were undertaken to
investigate whether elispot and
tst test results were associated with
bcg vaccination, place of birth, and household
tuberculosis contact. all reported p values are two sided.
we investigated trends with use of the 2 statistic.
comparisons between proportions were derived with
fisher’s exact test. we did all analyses with stata
(version 7.0).
role of the funding source
the sponsors of the study had no role in the study
design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation,
writing of the report, or in the decision to submit the
paper for publication.

results
elispot and tst results were available for 535
students—44·3% of the school. our sample was
representative in terms of the proportion of non-white
children (97% in our sample vs 93% in the whole
school); uk-born children (86 vs 86%); children
diagnosed with active tuberculosis (5 vs 6%); and
participants deemed to have latent tuberculosis infection
on the basis of tst result (24 vs 23%, table 1).
the odds of a test result being positive for each
increase across the four stratified exposure groups
increased by a factor of 2·78 (95% ci 2·22–3·48,
p<0·0001) for the elispot assay and 2·33 (1·88–2·88,
p<0·0001) for the tst. the elispot assay correlated
significantly better with increasing exposure across the
four groups than did the tst (p=0·03; figure 1, table 2).
direct exposure of the 148 children in year 9 ranged
from 0 to 17 school weeks: 57 students had some direct
classroom exposure, with a median of 2·2 school weeks
(iqr 1·4–13·4). the odds of a positive elispot result
increased by a factor of 2·51 (1·58–3·99, p<0·0001) with
each week of direct exposure, which was significantly
higher (p=0·007) than that for the tst (odds ratio 1·30
[95% ci 1·10–1·54], p=0·002; table 2).
of the 387 children in years 7, 8, and 10, 196 pupils
had indirect exposure, up to a maximum of 1·16 weeks.
although elispot and tst were more likely to be
positive with increasing exposure, neither showed a
significant correlation (table 2).
elispot assay and tst were positively correlated
with a history of household tuberculosis contact (n=36,
table 2). 76 children were born in countries with a high
prevalence of tuberculosis and climates associated with
increased exposure to environmental mycobacteria (table
1). the mean duration of residence in these countries
was 7·8 years. tst results, but not elispot results,
were significantly associated with birth in one of these
regions (table 2).
for 362 students, the date of bcg vaccination was
documented in the leicestershire health authority
records, of whom 323 were vaccinated at birth. an
additional 105 students had bcg scars but the date of
vaccination was not available because they were born
outside leicester; 101 were born in countries where bcg
vaccination is given at birth. therefore 424 (91%) of 467
bcg-vaccinated students were vaccinated at birth. the
elispot assay showed no significant relation with bcg
vaccination status (p=0·44, table 3). by contrast, bcgvaccinated children were significantly more likely to have
higher heaf grades than unvaccinated children
(p=0·002), with substantially more heaf grade 3 (81 of
467 vs 2 of 68, p=0·001), and grade 2 results in bcgvaccinated individuals (table 3).
of the 128 participants presumed to have latent
tuberculosis infection on the basis of a positive tst
with no evidence of active tuberculosis, 97 (76%)
tested positive with elispot. this elispot-positive
subgroup had significantly higher heaf grades and
significantly more exposure to m tuberculosis than did the
elispot-negative students. heaf grades were
significantly higher among elispot-positive students
than among elispot-negative students (p<0·0001,
figure 2). in the elispot-positive group there were
significantly more students with direct exposure to the
index case than in the elispot-negative group (35 of
97 vs one of 31, p<0·0001; figure 2).
agreement between tst and elispot was high
(=0·72 [95% ci 0·64–0·80], p<0·0001), with
concordant results in 475 (89%) students (table 4). for
students in whom test results were discordant, it is
impossible to know for certain which test was correct
because there is no reference test. however, table 4
shows that an isolated positive elispot result (ie, one
associated with a negative tst) was a strong predictor of
m tuberculosis exposure, whereas an isolated positive tst
result was not. this finding suggests that isolated positive
elispot results are more likely to be true positives than
are isolated positive tst results. for students with
positive tst and elispot results, the relative risk of
direct exposure to the index case, compared with that for
students with negative tst and elispot, was 17·6
(95% ci 8·1–38·0, p<0·001); for those with negative
tst and positive elispot results it was 11·7
(4·2–33·2, p<0·001); and for those with postive tst and
negative elispot results, it was 2·97 (0·6–13·7,
p=0·18).
molecular strain typing by variable-number tandem
repeat, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit, and
spoligotyping showed that all nine secondary isolates of
m tuberculosis from students at the school were identical
to that of the index case. is6110-based restriction
fragment length polymorphism (figure 3) showed that
seven of the nine secondary isolates were identical to that
of the index case, whereas two were very similiar,
differing by one and three bands each.

discussion
in the absence of a gold standard test for latent
tuberculosis infection, the sensitivity and specificity of the
elispot assay or the tst cannot be directly
quantified.4 however, given that the likelihood of latent
tuberculosis infection is determined by exposure to
m tuberculosis,
19–23 we were able to rank the tests according
to their diagnostic accuracy. agreement between tst and
elispot results was high, but discordance in 11% of
students shows that the tests are not equivalent. our
results indicate that elispot probably has higher
sensitivity and specificity than tst. first, the significantly
closer correlation of elispot than tst with degree of
exposure to m tuberculsosis suggests a higher sensitivity for
detection of latent infection. second, tst, but not
elispot, was confounded by bcg vaccination, despite
11–15 years having elapsed since vaccination, which
suggests a higher specificity for the elispot assay.
tst and elispot were more likely to be positive in
students who had a history of household tuberculosis
contact, a marker of m tuberculosis exposure outside
school, than in students without such a history. by
contrast, for the students born in high-prevalence
countries, mainly africa and asia (a risk factor for
environmental myobacterial exposure3,4 and m tuberculosis
exposure) only the tst was significantly more likely to be
positive. given that the elispot assay correlates
strongly with all other measures of m tuberculosis
exposure, its independence from foreign birth suggests
that, unlike tst, it is not confounded by environmental
myobacterial exposure.
the high specificity of elispot might explain the
strong relation between positive elispot results and
tst induration size in individuals who have positive tst
results. the size of the tst response is positively
associated with higher tuberculosis case rates during
follow-up; thus, the elispot assay may have identified
the subgroup of tst-positive individuals who actually
have latent tuberculosis infection. these individuals are
distinct from those whose weakly positive tst responses
represent false-positive results due to antigenic cross
reactivity of purified protein derivative. moreover, the
elispot-positive group had substantially more exposure
to m tuberculosis than did the elispot-negative group.
this improved specificity of the elispot could help to
avoid unnecessary chemoprophylaxis in uninfected
individuals; this ability to screen out false-positive tst
results will become increasingly important as the
prevalence of latent infection falls in low-prevalence
countries.1 the cross-reactivity of purified protein
derivative may explain why a new whole-blood interferongamma elisa based on purified protein derivative
seemed to be confounded by bcg.28,29
there is compelling evidence that the outbreak we
studied was due to one index case, who was the first
symptomatic case of pulmonary tuberculosis in the
school.30 the molecular epidemiology also suggests that
this was a point-source outbreak. only two other children
were potentially infectious.30 both children were
symptomatic for less than 2 weeks before admission to
hospital and both were in year 11, which did not
participate in the study. moreover, their m tuberculosis
isolates were identical to that of the index case by all four
typing methods.
the high rates of tuberculosis infection and disease at
the school are unlikely to merely reflect the epidemiology
of tuberculosis in the local community. first, this outbreak
accounted for a third of all tuberculosis cases in leicester
in 2001. second, all 1226 household contacts of the
69 tuberculosis cases and 254 cases of latent tuberculosis
infection were screened by the health authority and no
cases of infectious pulmonary tuberculosis were identified.
third, four other leicester schools were screened by tst,
and the rates of positive skin tests were 1–4%. fourth,
when year 8 students at this school underwent heaf testing
in 1997–98 only 2·7% were positive.
the minimum exposure to an infectious person that is
required for m tuberculosis transmission is unknown, but
must be low, since many well-documented cases of
infection result from brief exposure31 and many students
who did not share lessons with the source case must have
acquired infection in this way. the amount of exposure
required before transmission of m tuberculosis becomes
inevitable is also unknown. since all students with 5 or
more school-weeks of exposure had positive results on the
elispot assay, however, our findings suggest that 130 h
sharing room air with a person with sputum smearpositive cavitatory tuberculosis is certain to result in
infection.
longitudinal assessment of the positive predictive
value of this assay for subsequent development of active
tuberculosis will be necessary. in one report workers
suggest that t-cell responses to esat-6 in healthy
contacts are associated with subsequent active disease.32
students in our study who had positive elispot but
negative tst results, who have not had chemoprophylaxis,
are receiving close clinical and radiographic follow-up.
we used the heaf test, because it is used for tuberculin
testing in contact investigations in the uk, and is
stipulated in national guidelines.24 since the mantoux
method is more widely used internationally, elispot
should be compared in the future with this method; we
have recently started such studies in several countries.
elispot gives quantitative results the morning after
taking a blood sample and is more convenient, objective,
and rapid than the tst. although tst is cheap, related
indirect costs are associated with return visits and the
trained staff required to administer and read the test.
introduction of elispot might initially increase the cost
of tuberculosis control, but the savings that would follow
from improved diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection
could make it very cost effective in the long term. better
detection of latent infection would lessen the number of
cases of active tuberculosis and, therefore, the attendant
cost of diagnosis, hospital admission and contact tracing.
fewer false-positive results in uninfected contacts
would avoid the costs associated with unnecessary
chemoprophylaxis and its associated toxic effects.

a systematic review of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of tuberculosis infection

background
globally, there are 8 million new tuberculosis (tb) cases and 2 million deaths per year. once infected, active disease develops in about 10% of cases, usually within 1-2 years after exposure. remaining individuals enter into a state of latentcy [latent tuberculosis infection (ltbi)], which can reactivate at a later stage, particularly if the individual becomes immunocompromised.

active tb is predominantly pulmonary in nature. extra-pulmonary tb occurs in approximately 41% of tb cases in england and wales and includes lymphatic, pleural, meningeal, pericardial, skeletal, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and miliary tb. ltbi has no clinical manifestations and is not contagious.

given the infectious nature of pulmonary tb, fast and accurate diagnosis is an important element of tb treatment and control.

objectives
for each form of active tuberculosis, to conduct systematic reviews to evaluate the accuracy of the following groups of tests in patients suspected of active tb:
nucleic acid amplification tests
amplification molecular probe tests
serodiagnostic and biochemical assays
phage-based tests.
to conduct a systematic review to evaluate how effective fully automated liquid culture systems are for isolating and identifying tb.
to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the use of interferon-γ assays for detection of latent tb infection.
to examine the likely nhs and societal consequences of false-positive and-false negative tests.

methods
data sources
literature was identified from electronic databases and other sources. all databases were searched from 1975 to august 2003 for tests for active tb and to march 2004 for tests for ltbi. reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles were scanned for additional studies.

study selection
tests for active tb
any study comparing a rapid test for detection of active tuberculosis with any reference standard was included. 'rapid' tests were those for which a result could be obtained in less than the time taken for standard culture. only case series studies were included. accuracy studies had to report sufficient information to allow the construction of a 2 × 2 contingency table.

tests for latent tb infection
the study selection criteria were (1) testing for ltbi, (2) comparison between tuberculin skin test (tst) and interferon-γ assays based on esat-6 and cfp-10 antigens and (3) information on tb exposure or bacille calmette-guérin (bcg) vaccination or hiv status.

data extraction
data extraction and study quality assessment were undertaken independently by two reviewers.

data synthesis
tests for active tb
for each test comparison, the sensitivity, specificity and 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated. the method proposed by moses and colleagues to fit both symmetric and asymmetric summary receiver operating characteristic (sroc) curves was used. sources of heterogeneity were investigated by adding covariates to the standard regression model.

tests for latent tb infection
interferon-γ assays were examined to establish whether they were more strongly associated with high versus low tb exposure than tst. odds ratios (ors) were calculated for the association between test results and exposures from each study along with their 95% cis. within each study, the or value for one test was divided by that for another to produce a ratio of or (ror).

results
tests for active tb
a total of 212 studies were included, providing 368 data sets. a further 19 studies assessing fully automated liquid culture were included.

overall, nucleic acid amplification test (naat) accuracy was far superior when applied to respiratory samples as opposed to other body fluids. the better quality in-house studies were, for pulmonary tb, much better at ruling out tb than the commercial tests (higher sensitivity), but were less good at ruling it in (lower specificity), but it is not possible to recommend any one over another owing to a lack of direct test comparisons.

the specificity of naat tests was high when applied to body fluids, for example for tb meningitis and pleural tb, but sensitivity was poor, indicating that these tests cannot be used reliably to rule out tb. high specificity estimates suggest that naat tests should be the first-line test for ruling in tb meningitis, but that they need to be combined with the result of other tests in order to rule out disease. evidence for naat tests in other forms of tb and for phage-based tests is significantly less prolific than for those above and further research is needed to establish accuracy.

there is no evidence to support the use of adenosine deaminase (ada) tests for diagnosis of pulmonary tb; however, there is considerable evidence to support their use for diagnosis of pleural tb and to a slightly lesser extent for tb meningitis.

anti-tb antibody test performance was universally poor, regardless of type of tb. fully automated liquid culture methods were superior to culture on solid media, in terms of their speed and their precision.

tests for latent tb infection
in total, 13 studies were included. assays based on rd1-specific antigens, esat-6 or cfp-10, correlate better with intensity of exposure, and therefore are more likely than tst/purified protein derivative (ppd)-based assays to detect ltbi accurately. an additional advantage is that they are more likely to be independent of bcg vaccination status and hiv status.

conclusions
implications for healthcare
the naat tests provide a reliable way of increasing the specificity of diagnosis (ruling in disease) but sensitivity is too poor to rule out disease, especially in smear-negative (paucibacillary) disease where clinical diagnosis is equivocal and where the clinical need is greatest.

for extra-pulmonary tb, clinical judgement has both poor sensitivity and specificity. for pleural tb and tb meningitis, adenosine deaminase tests have high sensitivity but limited specificity. naats have high specificity and could be used alongside ada (or interferon-γ) to increase sensitivity for ruling out disease and naat for high specificity to rule it in.

all studies from low-prevalence countries strongly suggest that the rd1 antigen-based assays are more accurate than tst- and ppd-based assays for diagnosis of ltbi. if their superior diagnostic capability is found to hold up in routine clinical practice, they could confer several advantages on tb control programmes.

recommendations for research
active tb
diagnostic accuracy must be established, preferably prospectively, in a wide spectrum of patients, against an appropriate reference test, and avoiding the major sources of bias such as verification bias, lack of blinding, and inclusion of all indeterminate results.

for pulmonary tb, a study of the accuracy of naat in clinically equivocal smear-negative patients is needed, to identify how high a proportion of false-positive results would be generated in this population.
the place of ada, interferon-γ and lysozyme for diagnosis of pleural tb requires further investigation
the place of ada, for diagnosis of tb meningitis, needs to be established
for both pleural and tbm, the combination of naat tests with other tests such as ada should be examined
the incremental value of combinations of tests, particularly for samples of biological fluids, needs assessment in large, prospective, well-designed studies recruiting representative samples of patients.
interferon-γ assays for the rapid identification of latent tuberculosis infection
research is needed in different epidemiological and clinical settings, not only in developed countries, but also in developing countries, and countries with a high prevalence of tb, of non-tuberculous mycobacteria, in populations with high bcg coverage and in immunosuppressed populations.
trials to evaluate the performance of the main existing commercial assays [whole blood interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and enzyme-linked immunospot assay (elispot)] in head-to-head comparison should be done in both developed and developing countries.
the role of adding more tb-specific antigens to try to improve diagnostic sensitivity needs to be assessed.
longitudinal cohort studies to confirm the positive predictive value of interferon-γ assays for subsequent development of active tb should also be performed.

serum he4 and diagnosis of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women with adnexal masses

background
transvaginal ultrasound and serum ca125 are routinely used for differential diagnosis of pelvic adnexal mass. use of human epididymis 4 was approved in the united states in 2011. however, there is scarcity of studies evaluating the additional value of human epididymis 4.

objective
the objective of the study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of transvaginal ultrasound, ca125, and human epididymis 4 for differential diagnosis of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women with adnexal masses.

study design
this was a cohort study nested within the screen arms of the multicenter randomized controlled trial, united kingdom collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening, based in england, wales, and northern ireland. in united kingdom collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening, 48,230 women randomized to transvaginal ultrasound screening and 50,078 to multimodal screening (serum ca125 interpreted by risk of ovarian cancer algorithm with second line transvaginal ultrasound) underwent the first (prevalence) screen. women with adnexal lesions and/or persistently elevated risk were clinically assessed and underwent surgery or follow-up for a median of 10.9 years. banked samples taken within 6 months of transvaginal ultrasound from all clinically assessed women were assayed for human epididymis 4 and ca125. area under the curve and sensitivity for diagnosing ovarian cancer of multiple penalized logistic regression models incorporating logca125, log human epididymis 4, age, and simple ultrasound features of the adnexal mass were compared.

results
of 1590 (158 multimodal, 1432 ultrasound) women with adnexal masses, 78 were diagnosed with ovarian cancer (48 invasive epithelial ovarian, 14 type i, 34 type ii; 24 borderline epithelial; 6 nonepithelial) within 1 year of scan. the area under the curve (0.893 vs 0.896; p = .453) and sensitivity (74.4% vs 75.6% ;p = .564) at fixed specificity of 90% of the model incorporating age, ultrasound, and ca125 were similar to that also including human epididymis 4. both models had high sensitivity for invasive epithelial ovarian (89.6%) and type ii (>91%) cancers.

conclusion
our population cohort study suggests that human epididymis 4 adds little value to concurrent use of ca125 and transvaginal ultrasound in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses in postmenopausal women.

serum ca125 and transvaginal ultrasound (tvs) have been used in differential diagnosis of adnexal masses in postmenopausal women for the last 4 decades. these tests are the basis of guidelines in most countries for investigation of women with symptoms suspicious of ovarian cancer (oc).1, 2, 3
ajog at a glance
why was this study conducted?
the study was conducted to assess whether inclusion of human epididymis 4 (he4) improves the performance of serum ca125 and transvaginal ultrasound in the differential diagnosis of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women with adnexal masses.

key findings
in 1590 women who underwent clinical assessment for an adnexal mass detected on the first screen in united kingdom collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening, a model incorporating age, transvaginal ultrasound, and ca125 performed similarly to one that also included he4. both had high sensitivity for invasive epithelial ovarian cancer.

what does this add to what is known?
our population-based study suggests that he4 adds little value to concurrent use of ca125 and transvaginal ultrasound in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, especially invasive epithelial disease in postmenopausal women with adnexal masses.


the 2 tests are often interpreted using models, the earliest of which, the risk of malignancy index (rmi),4 incorporates the ca125 value, menopausal status, and simple ultrasound features. since then, there have been numerous tvs-only models (simple rules,5 lr1, lr26), which include further features such as septal thickness, size of solid lesions, and doppler flow, with most recently described adnex model7 also including ca125. these models have been extensively evaluated in secondary care settings.8, 9

in 2011, based on encouraging secondary care data, human epididymis 4 (he4) received approval from the us food and drug administration for use in women presenting with an ovarian mass.

the main advantage of he4 is that, unlike ca125, it is not elevated in endometriosis.10 this led to biomarker algorithms incorporating he4 and ca125 such as the risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm (roma) and more recently the copenhagen index.11 however as highlighted in both recent systematic reviews,12, 13 there are currently not enough studies estimating he4 performance in detecting early-stage tumors in the most relevant group, postmenopausal women in this clinical scenario. in addition, there is a scarcity of studies that investigate the performance of ca125, he4, and tvs in women presenting to primary care physicians/gynaecologists.

a dualistic pathway of invasive epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis has emerged over the past decade. type i invasive epithelial ovarian cancers, which include low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous tumours, are slow-growing, genetically stable indolent cancers, usually diagnosed in the early stage. type ii, mainly high-grade serous cancers, which are the majority of the cancers, are aggressive, are genetically unstable usually harboring p53 mutations, and account for most of the mortality.14 in evaluating the role of he4, it would be important to consider the performance in the 2 groups separately.

in the screen arms of united kingdom collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening (ukctocs), ultrasound data on adnexal masses detected during the initial screen and banked serum samples provided an opportunity to compare models incorporating ca125, he4, and tvs features of the adnexal mass both alone and in combination in a population-based cohort of postmenopausal women.

materials and methods
subjects
between 2001 and 2005, 202,638 postmenopausal women from the general population in england, wales, and northern ireland were randomized to multimodal screening (mms; n = 50,640) using serum ca125 (level i) interpreted by risk of ovarian cancer algorithm and a combination of ca125 and tvs as a second-line test (level ii), tvs screening (uss; n = 50,639), or no screening (n = 101,379) as described previously.15, 16

of 101,279 women randomized to screening, 98,308 (50,078 mms; 48,230 uss) underwent the initial annual (prevalence) screen.17 women with an abnormality underwent a repeat tvs by a senior specialist in gynecological scanning (level ii scan) in the uss group and a repeat ca125 and level ii scan in the mms group. those with a persistent abnormality underwent clinical assessment with the regional center clinical team, who arranged further investigations (tumor markers, tvs, magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography pelvis as appropriate) and were either referred for surgery or managed conservatively. all women who underwent clinical assessment and had banked serum sample within 6 months of the scan were included in this analysis.

there were some women who had oc diagnosed within 18 months of the sample who were not included in the previously mentioned analysis because they did not undergo clinical assessment (no abnormality on screening). serum he4 and ca125 was assayed in those for whom a sample was available.

ca125 and he4 assays
ca125 values were available for all women in the mms arm because the assay was performed as part of their screening protocol, described previously.17 for those in the uss group, recruitment samples were assayed for ca125 using the same generation assay (roche diagnostics, burgess hill, united kingdom) on the roche cobas analyzer as used in the trial.17, 18 he4 assay (roche diagnostics) was run in parallel on all the samples included in the study from both groups.

ultrasound scan
annual scans (level i screen) were performed by level i (certified sonographers, trained national health service (nhs) midwives or doctors trained in gynaecological scanning) or level ii sonographers (senior sonographers, mostly at superintendent level, gynecologists or radiologists specialized in gyncological scanning), while repeat scans following the detection of an abnormality (level ii screens) were performed only by the latter.

the same model of the ultrasound machine (kretz sa2000; kretztechnik ag, zipf, austria) was used at all centers. the ukctocs tvs closest to diagnosis or the last scan in the year 1 screening episode for women managed conservatively was included in the analysis. scan findings recorded on the ukctocs ultrasound form (appendix a) were augmented by independent review of stored static 2-dimensional images. the features captured for each adnexal or midline mass were based on simple morphological groupings (normal, normal with inclusion cyst, unilocular, unilocular solid, multilocular, multilocular solid, solid, or not visualized) based on the international ovarian tumor analysis (iota) definitions from 2000.19

follow-up
follow-up for cancer notification and deaths was through nhs digital for england and wales and northern ireland cancer registry and business services organisation, health and social care northern ireland. women were sent 2 postal follow-up questionnaires (the first 3–5 years after randomization, the second in april 2014).16

medical notes of women diagnosed with oc (as per world health organization 2014 classification) were reviewed by an outcomes review committee who assigned the diagnosis, histological subtype, and stage, as described previously.16

statistical analysis
the primary outcome for this analysis was primary oc diagnosed within a year of the scan.

models were constructed using tvs, ca125, and he4. features used were as follows: (1) age at scan (years); or (2) tvs features, which included (a) the presence of a solid component (papillations, solid areas in cystic lesions, or entirely solid lesions) grouped as not present in either ovary; present in 1 ovary (unilateral); present in both ovaries (bilateral) (supplemental table 1, appendix b); this allowed for the risk associated with bilateral lesions with a solid component to be greater than that of unilateral lesions without the constraint of doubling of risk; (b) locularity defined as no locularity present in either ovary, which included both ovaries with normal morphology, normal morphology with inclusion cyst, solid or not visualized; locularity present in either or both ovaries (ie, morphology was unilocular or multilocular, irrespective of the presence of a solid component). this grouping was done as the model parameters for separate factor levels for uni/multilocular and either/both ovaries were deemed not statistically different, and some were even counterintuitively ordered (this was the only a posteriori decision made in terms of variable creation and model inclusion); (c) ascites (milliliters); or (d) dominant volume (dv). dominant lesion was defined as the adnexal lesion associated with the highest risk of malignancy, based on findings from our previous study in which the risk of epithelial oc was highest in multilocular solid (6.6%), then solid (3.8%), and unilocular solid (2.4%) and lowest in those with persistent normal morphology (0.07%)20; dominant volume was defined as a log volume of the ovary or lesion deemed dominant and not necessarily the largest; or (3) biomarker values: log values of ca125 and he4 were used as continuous rather than categories based on cutoffs.

all continuous variables were explored for whether a statistically superior transformation existed in terms of cancer prediction as well as for collinearity. all predictors collectively comprised the full model. subset versions (ultrasound features; ultrasound plus ca125; ultrasound plus he4; ca125 and he4; ca125 only; and he4 only) were created for purposes of comparison. all were adjusted for age.

two well-known published prediction models were also included: roma and rmi. a modified version (rmi-mod) of the latter was used because data on intraabdominal metastasis were not available. it was not possible to assess lr1, lr2, and adnex models because these were described later and data on the required ultrasound features were not prospectively collected. the ca125 and he4 only models were adjusted for age. there was no single cutoff; instead the ca125 and he4 cutoff varied with age.

multiple imputation was used to account for the missing values in ovary/lesion volume and morphology (details in appendix b). in total, all 20 imputation sets created were used in producing an overall risk prediction model using rubin’s rules.21 this was true also for all the subset models that relied upon imputed data.

the risk prediction model was estimated using a penalised maximum likelihood logistic regression method as proposed by firth22 (further details in appendix b). ten-fold cross-validation was used to explore the performance of the prediction model (and its subsets), in which the estimation for each of the 10 subgroups, and then prediction for the excluded group, was based using all 20 imputation sets.

roma and rmi-mod did not require cross-validation. receiver-operating characteristis curves were used to compare the discriminative ability of the prediction methods. formal comparison of the area under the curve (aucs) for each model was performed using the method of delong et al.23 sensitivity at 90% specificity (similar to most published he4 diagnostic studies)12, 24, 25 was also calculated and the mcnemar test for paired binary outcomes was used to compare differences in sensitivity.

confidence intervals for the aucs and sensitivities were derived using the bias-corrected percentiles from the bootstrap distribution (n = 5000). the brier score (mean squared error difference) and the hosmer-lemeshow test with 10 groups were used to assess model fit. positive and negative predictive values (ppvs, npvs) and numbers needed to treat were included for each of the models.

in addition, the npv and ppv across a range of sensitivities and specificities were calculated. because the prevalence of oc can increase in symptomatic patients presenting to primary care and in those referred to secondary care, the ppv and npv were also calculated at 10% and 15% prevalence.

results
in this study of differential diagnosis nested within the ovarian cancer screening arms of ukctocs, 2086 women (171 mms, 1915 uss) of the 98,308 (50,078 mms; 48,230 uss) who underwent the initial screen were found to have a persistent abnormality and underwent clinical assessment. a blood sample within 6 months of the scan was available in 1611 women (158 mms, 1453 uss). twenty-one women were excluded because they were diagnosed with oc more than a year after the last scan because the aim was to compare performance for detection of oc within a year of the test. in women who had multiple scans, the one within 6 months of the sample was chosen for this study.

the final cohort comprised 1590 women (158 mms, 1432 uss) with adnexal masses. median follow-up from randomization was 10.9 years. seventy-eight (36 mms, 42 uss) were diagnosed with an index cancer within a year of the last scan. the latter included 48 women with invasive epithelial (14 type i and 34 type ii), 24 with borderline epithelial, and 6 with nonepithelial oc. the noncases were similar to all women (n = 98,308) who underwent the prevalence screen (data not shown). cases were older at randomization and therefore at scan (median age, 64.4 vs 60.8 years), heavier, and less likely to have used an oral contraceptive pill (table 1).

cases had a median ca125 of 85.0 (interquartile range [iqr], 24.1, 231.6) ku/l vs 15.3 (iqr, 11.2, 22.1) ku/l in noncases. median he4 was also higher, 92.6 (iqr, 65.6, 215.0) pmol/l in cases vs 55.3 (iqr, 47.1, 68.9) pmol/l in noncases. ninety-six percent of scans (1526) used in the analysis were performed by level ii ultrasonographers and 4% (64) by level i.

the median volume of the dominant adnexal mass was 29.9 ml (iqr, 0.9, 40.9) in cases and 19.4 ml (iqr, 3.9, 27.5) in noncases, and the median largest diameter was 4.4 cm (iqr, 2.2, 7.4) in cases and 3.2 cm (iqr, 2.3, 4.8) in noncases. a solid component was identified in 65.4% of cases (51 of 76) vs 33.2% of noncases (502 of 1503). a total of 42.3% of cases had a multilocular solid cyst compared with 18.4% of noncases with the inverse for multilocular cyst (12.8% of cases and 40.2% of noncases) (table 2).

individual regressions on each predictor variable, using the mi paradigm where necessary, showed highly significant associations with oc except for locularity (supplemental table 2). on comparing the models, the full (ultrasound, ca125 and he4) (auc, 0.896) and the ultrasound plus ca125 model (auc, 0.893) had similarly high (test of difference, p = .453) cross-validated auc and similar sensitivity (75.6% vs 74.4%; p = .564) at fixed specificity of 90% (table 3 and figure).

roma had an auc of 0.854, which was statistically lower to the previously mentioned 2 models. however, its sensitivity did not differ from that of the full model (mcnemar test for paired outcomes, p = .0956) or to the ultrasound plus ca125 model (p = .414). the hosmer-lemeshow test on the cross-validated predictions suggested the full model fit was adequate (p = .316), and the supplemental figure plots the predictions against grouped outcomes in the logit scale.

brier scores showed that the full model had the most accurate predictions, although all scores were low. however, the brier scores for roma were not directly comparable and could not be calculated for rmi-mod. the ppv of the full model and that containing ultrasound and ca125 was 28.1 and 27.8, respectively (table 2).

for the key subgroup analysis by behavior, roma had similarly high sensitivity (87.5%) to the previously mentioned 2 models (89.6%, 89.6%) for invasive epithelial oc, and for type ii cancers (94.1%, 94.1%, 91.2%) (table 4). all 3 models had similar sensitivity for late-stage disease and seemed to detect more aggressive cancers. for the early stage, the ultrasound plus ca125 model had the highest sensitivity (84.2%) (supplemental table 3).

the npv and ppv of the full model and that containing ultrasound and ca125 did not vary significantly across a range of sensitivities and specificities (supplemental table 5) or oc prevalence (supplemental table 6).

thirteen women (12 invasive, 1 borderline epithelial) who developed ovarian cancer within 1.5 years of the sample were not included in this analysis because they were not referred for clinical assessment. samples were available in 7 of 8 women with a normal tvs. he4 levels were elevated (>128 pmol/l) in 1 woman and ca125 (>30 ku/l) in 2 (supplemental table 4). samples were not available for the he4 assay in the 5 women (4 invasive, 1 borderline) who had a normal ca125 (<30 ku/l) screen) and no tvs.

comment
principal findings
despite encouraging preliminary data on he4, our results suggest that in postmenopausal women its role in differential diagnosis of adnexal masses is limited. it adds little value to the concurrent use of serum ca125 and simple ultrasound features, either for detection of oc overall or the invasive epithelial oc subgroup.

results in context
our results suggesting ca125 and ultrasound have the best performance are in keeping with the us (american college of obstetricians and gynecologists)2 and scottish3 referral guidelines for women with symptoms/adnexal mass. neither biomarkers (ca125 or he4) alone nor tvs alone performed well, bringing into question the sequence of tests (ca125 followed by tvs) in the uk national institute for health and care excellence guidance for detection of ovarian cancer in primary care, especially in women older than 50 years. of note, the guidance does include repeat ca125 in women with persistent symptoms.1

roma, which combines he4 and ca125, had high sensitivity for invasive epithelial and type ii ocs (mostly high-grade serous), similar to that of the ultrasound, ca125, and he4 model, supporting its use as an alternative in settings where tvs may not be readily available. it is currently used in clinical practice in the united states and some private clinics in the united kingdom.26

in our study, he4 alone performed less well (lower sensitivity and auc) compared with ca125 alone, although the differences were not significant. the sensitivity of he4 alone in postmenopausal women was lower than the pooled sensitivity (77%; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.81) at similar specificity (91%; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.94) reported in the most recent systematic review.12 key contributing factors were the meta-analysis using a variety of tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescent microparticle immuno assay), blood and serum values, varying marker thresholds in different studies, and unavailability of raw data, resulting in categorizations as in the papers. equally important was the use of hospital cohorts with high oc prevalence (15–59%) compared with 5% in our population-based cohort.

because our cohort includes women who might never have presented with a symptomatic adnexal mass, we calculated the ppv and npv at higher oc prevalence of 10%, which may be closer to that in the primary care population, and 15%, similar to prevalence in secondary care referral clinics in the united kingdom. while both increased with higher disease prevalence, there was no additive value of he4. it would therefore be difficult to justify including he4 in triage unless tvs was not locally available.

it is also important to note that no definitive conclusions can be drawn that the model including he4 has lower sensitivity for differential diagnosis of early-stage ovarian cancer because the numbers involved are too small.

clinical and research implications
it is likely that symptom awareness campaigns will result in women presenting with masses midway between those described in our population cohort and those currently seen in secondary care and rapid access clinics.27 if 12–50%28, 29 of the 10 million uk women aged >55 years30 presented with alarm symptoms every year, this could equate to 1.2 million women requiring tests, with a significant proportion being referred to secondary care. therefore, a simple cost-effective protocol that is easy to implement is critical, given the widespread oc symptom awareness campaigns.

based on our findings, the additional cost and logistics of performing he4 is not justified because the positive and negative predictive values of including he4 with ultrasound and ca125 were similar. a prospective study to confirm these findings is needed. in the united kingdom, one such study is the refining ovarian cancer test accuracy scores,27 with data collection underway.

strengths and limitations
the key strength of our study is the minimization of selection bias seen in previous diagnostic studies through the use of a prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation design.31 we included serum samples collected from all women with adnexal masses (population cohort) detected on the initial ovarian cancer screen of 98,308 ukctocs participants from the general population. completeness of follow-up through postal questionnaires and electronic health record linkage to cancer and death registry to ascertain diagnosis of oc in these women was 98.9%. oc diagnosis was independently confirmed by an outcomes review committee.16 while the numbers reflect the low incidence of oc, they are likely to be more representative of the proportion of women with oc who are seen in primary care as compared with secondary care case control sets. general practitioners in the united kingdom would expect to see a woman with oc every 5 years and typically carry out 25,000 consultations per 1 case of oc.32

the study of 1590 women with adnexal masses (78 ovarian cancers, 1512 controls) had 90% power to detect a difference in the auc of 10% between the full model (auc, 0.896) and another model. the small numbers, however, precluded a split of the data into training and test set. instead, 10-fold cross-validation of the models limited the upward bias of prediction using the same data. we used a bespoke multiple imputation model using chained equations for missing data, methodology designed to reduce the known small-sample bias of maximum likelihood, and use of age rather than menopausal status (as in roma, rmi) whose definition could be challenging.

there remains an element of selection bias because 12 women with invasive epithelial oc (4 mms, 8 uss) were not detected on the initial screen and therefore did not undergo clinical assessment. however, we were able to assay the samples in 7 of these cases. additionally, self-selection resulted in ukctocs participants being healthier and less deprived than the general population.33

of note, the cohort includes women with adnexal masses that might never become symptomatic. tvs alone in our cohort did not perform as well as in the iota group studies.8, 9 a number of factors are likely to contribute to this difference: the latter conducted in secondary care symptomatic patients with larger adnexal masses (median diameter of 10.6 cm in stage i and 8.5 cm in stage ii–iv7 vs 4.4 cm in our study), more advanced disease,7 additional features including doppler, and tvs performed by iota-trained sonographers.34

of note, the majority of our scans (96%) were performed by senior nhs ultrasonographers. similar variables were captured as those in the nhs, making our findings generalizable to this setting. capture of data using earlier iota definitions19 prevented evaluation of more recent iota models (which include size of the solid component, number of papillations, etc).

finally, it was not possible using this study design to evaluate the performance of he4 as a first-line test because all the women were triaged to clinical assessment based on ca125 or tvs findings. separate analysis of performance of he4 as a first-line screening test in ukctocs is underway using a different sample set.

our population-based study suggests that in differential diagnosis of ovarian cancer, especially invasive epithelial disease in postmenopausal women with adnexal masses, he4 adds little value to the concurrent use of ca125 and transvaginal ultrasound.

systematic review and economic evaluation of helicobacter pylori eradication treatment for non-ulcer dyspepsia

abstract
objectives
to evaluate efficacy and cost effectiveness of helicobacter pylori eradication treatment in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia infected with h pylori.

design
systematic review of randomised controlled trials comparing h pylori eradication with placebo or another drug treatment. results were incorporated into a markov model comparing health service costs and benefits of h pylori eradication with antacid treatment over one year.

data sources
six electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials from january 1966 to may 2000. experts in the field, pharmaceutical companies, and journals were contacted for information on any unpublished trials. trial reports were reviewed according to predefined eligibility and quality criteria.

main outcome measures
relative risk reduction for remaining dyspeptic symptoms (the same or worse) at 3-12 months. cost per dyspepsia-free month estimated from markov model based on estimated relative risk reduction.

results
twelve trials were included in the systematic review, nine of which evaluated dyspepsia at 3-12 months in 2541 patients. h pylori eradication treatment was significantly superior to placebo in treating non-ulcer dyspepsia (relative risk reduction 9% (95% confidence interval 4% to 14%)), one case of dyspepsia being cured for every 15 people treated. h pylori eradication cost £56 per dyspepsia-free month during first year after treatment.

conclusion
h pylori eradication may be cost effective treatment for non-ulcer dyspepsia in infected patients but further evidence is needed on decision makers' willingness to pay for relief of dyspepsia.

introduction
there is unequivocal evidence that infection with helicobacter pylori is the principal cause of peptic ulcer disease. the organism is present in 85-95% of patients with peptic ulcer disease, and treating the infection is effective in healing these ulcers.1 treatment to eradicate h pylori results in permanent cure of peptic ulcer disease, whereas 60-80% of such patients relapse within a year if treated with antisecretory drugs alone.

the evidence for an association between h pylori and non-ulcer dyspepsia is more uncertain. many trials evaluating the efficacy of h pylori eradication treatment for non-ulcer dyspepsia have been poorly designed and have given conflicting results.2 a recent review of the literature indicated that h pylori eradication treatment is effective in non-ulcer dyspepsia,3 but the results of other reviews that include more recent trials have been less clear.4,5

several well designed trials have been published in the past two years. these have also given conflicting results, suggesting that any effect of h pylori eradication treatment on non-ulcer dyspepsia is at best small and may not be an efficient use of resources. we have conducted a rigorous systematic review of available randomised trials and performed an economic analysis of the results to establish whether h pylori eradication is a cost effective treatment for non-ulcer dyspepsia.

methods
systematic review
search strategy
randomised controlled trials fulfilling the eligibility criteria listed in the box were suitable for inclusion in the review, regardless of language and publication status. we identified studies by searching six electronic databases using both subject terms and text words; by reviewing bibliographies of retrieved trials; by contacting experts in 15 countries and pharmaceutical companies; and by requesting information of articles in peer review or in press from editors of general medical and gastroenterology journals (full details of the searches are given on the bmj's website). electronic searches were initially undertaken in march 1999, and updated in may 2000. in addition, we routinely scanned general medical and major gastroenterology journals over the previous year to ensure inclusion of the most recent studies.

investigator reliably blinded to treatment allocation

analysis according to allocation, regardless of compliance (intention to treat)

percentages of participants excluded from all analysis

assessment of eligibility and trial quality
dyspepsia was defined according to published definitions.6,7 two investigators independently reviewed all identified papers according to the eligibility and quality criteria. abstracts were not included unless further details were available from the authors. where disagreements occurred a third reviewer was involved and the majority view taken. the quality of trials was evaluated according to predefined criteria (see box). the quality assessment focused on whether the methods used for randomisation, concealment of allocation, and blinding of participants and investigators were stated. use of intention to treat analyses and completeness of follow up were also recorded, and the use of validated dyspepsia and quality of life measures was noted. trials described as randomised but which did not state a method of randomisation were included.

data extraction
a single investigator extracted data from eligible trials on a standardised form, which was checked by a second investigator. data from intention to treat analyses were used whenever they were provided, and outcomes were recorded for the final assessment. where dyspepsia outcomes were recorded in categories they were regrouped into an a priori dichotomy of those with improved (mild symptoms) or resolved dyspepsia (no symptoms) versus those with the same or worse dyspepsia (moderate or severe symptoms). dichotomies and scale measures of dyspepsia were recorded as reported, as were assessments of quality of life.

data synthesis
we expressed the effect of eradication in each trial as a relative risk, comparing the numbers remaining dyspeptic in the eradication group with those in the comparison group. we pooled relative risks using a fixed effect (mantel-haenszel) model, the appropriateness of which we assessed using a test of homogeneity and of funnel plot asymmetry.8 we then converted the outcome to relative risk reduction (100×(1−relative risk)%) and calculated the number needed to treat as: 100/((relative risk reduction)×(mean dyspepsia rate in placebo group)).

we estimated the impact of treatment on quality of life by combining standardised effect sizes because a mixture of instruments to measure quality of life had been used in the trials. all results were reported with 95% confidence intervals. we performed sensitivity analyses, using stata (version 6.0), to investigate the impact of individual trials on the overall results. the review was undertaken according to a protocol published in the cochrane library and will be regularly updated as a cochrane review as more information becomes available.

economic evaluation
using the computer program treeage version 3.5 (treeage software, williamstown, ma), we incorporated estimates from the systematic review into a markov model (see bmj's website for details) to establish the cost effectiveness of h pylori eradication treatment in non-ulcer dyspepsia.

strategies compared in the model
the model compared h pylori eradication with one month of antacid treatment in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia, with follow up over one year (the same duration as the trials). for the model, it was assumed that antacid treatment acted as an inexpensive placebo9 and that patients whose symptoms continued despite treatment would be given advice on lifestyle and reassurance by their general practitioner but no additional treatment beyond the first month.

costs and benefits identified in the model
the model evaluated the impact of h pylori eradication from a health service perspective, incorporating the costs of drugs and visits to a general practitioner as given in published sources (table ​(table11 ). the benefit of treatment was measured as the number of months of minimal or no dyspeptic symptoms during the year. the response rate at one year for those receiving antacids was estimated from the placebo group in the systematic review and converted into a monthly probability of recurrent dyspepsia. we applied the relative risk reduction from the review to estimate the response rate for those receiving h pylori eradication treatment. we tested the robustness of the results in one way sensitivity analyses.

the main areas of uncertainty in the model are the estimate of the relative risk reduction and the maximum willingness to pay for one month free of dyspepsia we assumed that the relative risk of dyspepsia in patients given h pylori eradication treatment had a log normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation derived from the pooled estimate from the meta-analysis. we then conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using monte carlo simulation of 100013 and repeated this analysis for high and low cost eradication regimens. we used an excel 97 spreadsheet to construct a set of cost effectiveness acceptability curves to reflect uncertainty in both effects and the maximum willingness to pay.14–16

results
our initial search identified 5146 articles, but, after scanning titles and abstracts, we found only 47 trials that seemed to evaluate h pylori eradication treatment in non-ulcer dyspepsia. twelve of these trials met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review (see bmj's website for details of studies). ten trials compared h pylori eradication treatment with placebo or placebo plus a proton pump inhibitor with follow up of 3-12 months.17–26 we considered the other two trials27,28 separately because they compared h pylori eradication treatment with an alternative drug treatment and followed patients for only three months or less.

effect of h pylori eradication treatment on dyspepsia symptoms
one trial22 did not give results as dichotomous outcomes, and we could not obtain this information from the authors. this trial evaluated 84 patients and reported no change in mean dyspepsia score between those randomised to h pylori eradication treatment and those given placebo. the remaining nine trials17–21,23–26 evaluated a total of 2541 patients and defined dyspepsia cure as no symptoms or mild symptoms not interfering with daily activities. the mean placebo response rate at one year was 28% (range 7-51%), and the mean h pylori eradication treatment response rate was 36% (range 21-58%). an unusually high placebo response rate was observed in two trials21,26 and two others included some patients with predominant reflux symptoms,17,24 but there was no significant heterogeneity between the trial results (heterogeneity test χ2=7.09, df=8, p=0.53). there was also no evidence of funnel plot asymmetry.

overall, there was a small but significant benefit of h pylori eradication treatment at 12 months (relative risk reduction 9% (95% confidence interval 4% to 14%)) (fig ​(fig1).1). the number of patients needed to treat with h pylori eradication treatment to cure one extra case of non-ulcer dyspepsia was 15 (95% confidence interval 10 to 31). the point estimate of the relative risk reduction did not vary by more than 2% and remained significant when any one trial was omitted from the analysis. the meta-analysis included several studies that were available in abstract and for which there were no full papers to review. when these were excluded in a sensitivity analysis the effect of h pylori eradication on symptoms remained at a similar level (relative risk reduction 7% (1% to 12%)).

of the other two trials, sheu et al compared bismuth subcitrate, amoxicillin, and metronidazole with h2 receptor antagonist in 41 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia,27 and dhali et al compared bismuth subcitrate, tetracycline, and metronidazole with sucralfate in 62 patients.28 both trials used scale measures of dyspeptic symptoms and showed significant benefits of h pylori eradication compared with the alternative treatment.

none of the trials formally evaluated individual dyspepsia symptoms, although two prospectively subdivided patients into the categories of ulcer-like and dysmotility-like dyspepsia.20,21 similar proportions of patients in these categories responded to h pylori eradication treatment.

effect of h pylori eradication on quality of life
three trials presented data on quality of life at 12 months that were suitable for meta-analysis. two trials used the psychological general wellbeing index,18,20 and one used the sf-36.17 overall, h pylori eradication treatment had no significant effect on quality of life compared with placebo (standardised mean difference 0.01 (95% confidence interval −0.12 to 0.15)).

quality of trials included in review
all the trials that compared h pylori eradication with placebo were double blind, placebo controlled, and with follow up of at least three months. four trials described the population from which non-ulcer dyspepsia patients were recruited and stated the method of randomisation,17,18,20,21 but only one mentioned the method used to conceal allocation at randomisation.18 all trials used validated dyspepsia questionnaires and excluded patients with confirmed peptic ulcer disease or oesophagitis before enrolment.

in four trials repeat endoscopy was performed at 12 months to ensure that patients remained free of peptic ulcer disease,18,20,21,26 but only two reported these results: 6/164 (4%) and 7/143 (5%) of patients taking placebo developed peptic ulcer disease at 12 months' follow up compared with 1/164 (0.6%) and 3/150 (2%) in the treatment groups.18,21 although repeat endoscopy was not part of the protocol of the mccoll trial,17 nine patients underwent endoscopy during follow up because of persistent symptoms: all three patients in the treatment group had normal results, whereas four of the six patients in the placebo group had peptic ulcer disease.

two trials reported endoscopic oesophagitis as an outcome measure at 12 months,18,29 and these found oesophagitis to be slightly more common in the patients allocated to h pylori eradication treatment. however, these events were relatively rare (17/297 (6%) in the treatment group and 9/306 (3%) in the placebo group), and the difference between the groups was not significant (relative risk 2.07 (0.94 to 4.56)).

cost effectiveness analysis
our cost effectiveness analysis estimated that h pylori eradication would be £31.76 more expensive per patient per year than the antacid strategy (cost of antacid strategy £55.25, cost of h pylori eradication strategy £87.01) but that patients receiving h pylori eradication treatment would benefit by an average of an extra 0.56 months free from dyspepsia than those given antacid. this yielded an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of £56 per extra month free from dyspepsia. this finding was robust to all one way sensitivity analyses except for the size of relative risk reduction (table ​(table2).2).

the decision as to whether h pylori eradication treatment is cost effective in non-ulcer dyspepsia depends on the maximum willingness to pay for each month free of dyspepsia and the uncertainty that the decision maker is willing to tolerate. this is shown in the cost effectiveness acceptability curve (fig ​(fig2).2). if a decision maker is willing to accept a 20% chance of the policy being incorrect, then, for a maximum willingness to pay of £75 a month free of dyspepsia, the “base case scenario” would be acceptable. if the maximum acceptable cost were £25, then only cheaper eradication regimens would be cost effective.

discussion
the results of our systematic review are based on well designed and executed randomised trials. the trials were usually large, with no evidence of imbalance in baseline characteristics. outcomes were assessed with validated dyspepsia questionnaires; drop out rates were low; and intention to treat analyses were reported for extended follow up.

the meta-analysis estimated a significant 9% reduction in the number of patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia remaining dyspeptic after the use of h pylori eradication treatment. of the nine trials included in this analysis, only three reported a significant benefit of eradication treatment.17,24,26 while there has been lively debate about the apparent differences in the results of these trials,30 there is in fact no evidence of statistical heterogeneity in their results so the differences may be explained by chance. none of the nine trials had sufficient power to detect treatment benefits as small as that observed in this meta-analysis. our overall result is also supported by the two small trials that showed a benefit for h pylori eradication treatment at 2-3 months over h2 receptor antagonists27 or sucralfate28 in non-ulcer dyspepsia patients.

the mechanism by which h pylori eradication treatment reduces dyspepsia symptoms in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia is unclear.31 h pylori causes most gastric and duodenal ulcers, and the therapeutic effect noted in this meta-analysis might be due to the treatment of undiagnosed peptic ulcer disease. all patients underwent endoscopy before entry into the trials to exclude peptic ulcer disease, but in this relapsing and remitting disorder patients with an ulcer diathesis do not always have an ulcer associated with their dyspepsia.32,33 this is emphasised by the observation that 4% of the patients enrolled into the placebo groups of two of the trials we reviewed developed peptic ulcer disease during follow up. h pylori eradication treatment may therefore be effective only in treating the small subset of patients with peptic ulcer disease that has been misclassified as non-ulcer dyspepsia. this possibility does not invalidate our conclusion: pragmatically, patients with dyspepsia and normal results on endoscopy gain a modest benefit from h pylori eradication.

what is already known on this topic
the efficacy of h pylori eradication treatment for non-ulcer dyspepsia is controversial

randomised controlled trials have given conflicting results

previous systematic reviews have suggested that such treatment might be of benefit, but they did not include all relevant trials or evaluate cost effectiveness of treatment

what this study adds
h pylori eradication is of small but statistically significant benefit for dyspepsia symptoms of patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia

an estimated 15 infected patients would need h pylori eradication treatment to cure one extra case of non-ulcer dyspepsia

despite the small clinical effect, h pylori eradication treatment might be a cost effective intervention for non-ulcer dyspepsia

cost effectiveness of eradication
the effect of h pylori eradication treatment on dyspeptic symptoms in non-ulcer dyspepsia is small, and so it is important to evaluate whether it is cost effective. as a baseline estimate, our markov model suggested h pylori eradication cost an extra £56 for each month free from dyspepsia in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. the model was constructed to provide a conservative estimate of cost effectiveness. we did not extend the effect of treatment beyond the length of the trials, although benefits should continue to accrue. the model compared h pylori eradication treatment with antacid, as definitive evidence for the effectiveness of more expensive treatments such as antisecretory or prokinetic treatment is lacking.34 we have also not assessed the potential for increasing antimicrobial resistance rates, as the additional impact of treating non-ulcer dyspepsia on the present rate of antibiotic prescribing in the community is likely to be small.35 the markov model applies only to patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia diagnosed after endoscopy and should not be extrapolated directly to the management of undiagnosed dyspepsia.

data from observational studies have suggested that h pylori eradication treatment may increase the incidence of reflux disease.36 however, the randomised controlled trials in our meta-analysis did not report a significant increase in reflux symptoms or oesophagitis with eradication treatment, and we did not include gastro-oesophageal reflux in the model.

non-ulcer dyspepsia is a common problem that is distressing for patients and responsible for a substantial healthcare costs.37 treating the infection could be cost effective provided a cost of £75 per month free from dyspepsia is acceptable. this cut off point is open to debate, and more research is needed into the willingness to pay for relief of dyspepsia symptoms. if cheaper h pylori eradication regimens were used the cost would be less than £25 per month free from dyspepsia. to place this in context, this is half the cost of long term treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease with antisecretory treatment.38

efficacy, tolerability, and upper gastrointestinal safety of celecoxib for treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: systematic review of randomised controlled trials

abstract
objective: to determine the efficacy, gastrointestinal safety, and tolerability of celecoxib (a cyclo-oxygenase 2 (cox 2) inhibitor) used in the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

design: systematic review of randomised trials that compared at least 12 weeks' celecoxib treatment with another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) or placebo and reported efficacy, tolerability, or safety. trials identified from manufacturer and by searching electronic databases and evaluated according to predefined inclusion and quality criteria. data combined through meta-analysis.

participants: 15 187 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

main outcome measures: efficacy: western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index; american college of rheumatology responder index and joint scores for rheumatoid arthritis. tolerability: withdrawal rates for adverse effects. gastrointestinal safety: incidence of ulcers, bleeds, perforations, and obstructions.

results: nine randomised controlled trials were included. celecoxib and nsaids were equally effective for all efficacy outcomes. compared with those taking other nsaids, in patients taking celecoxib the rate of withdrawals due to adverse gastrointestinal events was 46% lower (95% confidence interval 29% to 58%; nnt 35 at three months), the incidence of ulcers detectable by endoscopy was 71% lower (59% to 79%; nnt 6 at three months), and the incidence of symptoms of ulcers, perforations, bleeds, and obstructions was 39% lower (4% to 61%; nnt 208 at six months). subgroup analysis of patients taking aspirin showed that the incidence of ulcers detected by endoscopy was reduced by 51% (14% to 72%) in those given celecoxib compared with other nsaids. the reduction was greater (73%, 52% to 84%) in those not taking aspirin.

conclusion: celecoxib is as effective as other nsaids for relief of symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and has significantly improved gastrointestinal safety and tolerability.

what is already known on this topic
long term nsaid use is associated with the development of peptic and duodenal ulcers

cox 2 specific inhibitors are claimed to cause fewer gastrointestinal complications

the national institute for clinical excellence has recently recommended that cox 2 specific inhibitors are used in patients with arthritis who are at risk of gastrointestinal complications but not in those taking prophylactic aspirin

what this study adds
systematic review of randomised trials shows that celecoxib is as effective as other nsaids for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis

celecoxib has significantly improved gastrointestinal safety and tolerability compared with standard nsaids

an improvement in gastrointestinal safety was still evident in patients who were also taking aspirin

introduction
arthritis is a widespread, potentially disabling disease. of the two common forms, osteoarthritis is more prevalent than rheumatoid arthritis. the impact of arthritis on pain, disability, and quality of life results in a considerable burden to the individual, health services, and society.

non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are prescribed for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and provide effective relief from symptoms. however, serious gastrointestinal complications occur with their use. nsaids cause peptic and duodenal ulcers, which may perforate and bleed and even lead to death.1 there are between 2000-2500 deaths annually in the united kingdom due to use of nsaids. 2 3

nsaids control pain and inflammation by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase 1 and 2 (cox 1 and cox 2) enzymes. inhibition of the cox 1 enzyme is responsible for the associated gastrointestinal toxicity. celecoxib was developed as a cox 2 specific inhibitor to provide relief without the associated gastrointestinal complications.

we conducted a systematic review of all published and unpublished trials to determine if celecoxib is as effective as other nsaids for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and if there is evidence of greater gastrointestinal tolerability and safety.

methods
inclusion criteria
for the assessment of efficacy we included randomised controlled trials if they were double blind, compared celecoxib at a licensed therapeutic dose for at least 12 weeks with placebo or another nsaid at a standard dose (defined as being within the range recommended within the british national formulary4) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, and reported efficacy, tolerability, or safety outcomes. in addition, to investigate safety we considered data on doses of celecoxib above those recommended for treatment. placebo comparisons were included to demonstrate the sensitivity of efficacy outcomes and to investigate gastrointestinal toxicity.

outcome measures
we present efficacy outcomes for results of the western ontario and mcmaster universities (womac) osteoarthritis index for pain (scored 0 to 20), stiffness (scored 0 to 8), and physical function (scored 0 to 68). we used the american college of rheumatology (acr-20) responder index and evaluations of improvement in the numbers of painful or tender and swollen joints for trials of rheumatoid arthritis.

drug tolerability was assessed by considering rates of withdrawal due to any adverse event, any gastrointestinal adverse event, and specific gastrointestinal adverse events at 12 weeks. gastrointestinal safety was assessed by comparing the incidence of ulcers detected by routine endoscopy at 12 and 24 weeks and the incidence of symptomatic ulcers, perforations, bleeds, and obstructions up to 24 weeks.

study identification
we aimed to include all randomised trials of celecoxib, regardless of whether or not they had been published. we obtained from the manufacturer reports from all industry sponsored randomised controlled trials that were completed by 25 may 2000 and that compared celecoxib with placebo or other nsaid in people with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. we also searched medline, embase, and the cochrane controlled trials register from 1998 to march 2001 using the search terms celecoxib, celebrex, and sc-58635.

appraisal of trial quality
the quality of the trials was assessed according to predefined criteria. to assess the potential for bias we considered the method of randomisation, concealment of allocation, blinding of trial investigators and patients, completeness of follow up, and analysis according to intention to treat.

data extraction
summary outcome data were extracted from the original company trial reports as these provided more comprehensive data than that given in the published peer reviewed literature. jjd abstracted data, which were checked by mdb. we combined multiple celecoxib treatment arms within trials that randomised to more than one dose.

data synthesis
separate meta-analyses were undertaken for each comparison and outcome. we analysed efficacy data separately for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis as the diseases manifest with different levels of pain, stiffness, and swelling and were assessed in the trials with different outcome measurements. data on patients randomised to receive 800 mg celecoxib per day (above the recommended dose) were included in tolerability and safety analyses but excluded from efficacy analyses. we analysed tolerability and safety data for the two diseases combined as there is no evidence for a causal link between the nature of the disease and adverse events related to treatment, and the biological plausibility of such a relation is considered low.

dichotomous data were summarised as relative risks and combined with the mantel-haenszel method; continuous data were summarised as differences in means and combined by using the inverse variance method.5 all results are given with 95% confidence intervals. we computed homogeneity statistics to test the agreement of the individual trial results with the overall meta-analytical summary.5 if we detected significant heterogeneity (p<0.1) we also calculated random effects estimates using dersimonian and laird method.5 analyses were carried out in stata v6.0 with the metan macro.

results
we obtained reports of 17 trials, nine of which (15 187 patients) fulfilled the inclusion criteria.6–14 we excluded eight in which follow up was less than 12 weeks. all included trials compared celecoxib with at least one nsaid (diclofenac, naproxen, or ibuprofen); five trials also had a placebo control group. all nine trials reported efficacy and tolerability outcomes, but we excluded three from the efficacy analysis as the results were not available separately for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. four studies assessed upper gastrointestinal safety by endoscopy at 12 weeks, 7–9 13 one study assessed the same outcome at 24 weeks.10 the largest study (n=7968) reported on symptomatic upper gastrointestinal disease after 26 weeks of treatment.11 the table gives full details of the studies.

trial quality
all nine trials were of high quality. all were randomised with adequate concealment of treatment allocation and achieved double blinding with double dummy tablets. they described withdrawals and exclusions and used intention to treat analyses with missing data for efficacy analyses being estimated by carrying the last value forward.

after 12 weeks of treatment, 56% of patients in the placebo group had dropped out due to poor efficacy or adverse events. dropout rates in celecoxib and other nsaid groups were lower (39% on celecoxib 200 mg per day; 32% on celecoxib 400 mg per day; 39% on naproxen 1000 mg per day; 26% on diclofenac 150 mg per day).

effectiveness of celecoxib for treatment at 12 weeks
rheumatoid arthritis—in two placebo controlled trials with 1373 patients celecoxib provided significant improvement in all outcomes compared with placebo: 49% more patients (95% confidence interval 25% to 78%) met the acr-20 responder criteria, 39% more (21% to 61%) had reductions in the number of painful or tender joints, and 34% more (14% to 56%) had reductions in the number of swollen joints (fig 1). 7 12 three trials with 2019 patients compared celecoxib with other nsaids (naproxen 500 mg twice daily in two trials 7 12 and diclofenac 75 mg twice daily in one10). there were no significant differences, with all drugs being equally effective for all outcomes. with celecoxib the acr-20 responder rate was 4% higher (−20% to 36%), 9% more (−10% to 32%) showed improvement in the number of painful or tender joints, and 2% more (−15% to 22%) showed improvement in the number of swollen joints (fig 1).

osteoarthritis—in three placebo controlled trials with 1947 patients, compared with placebo celecoxib resulted in significant (p<0.0001) improvement in all components of the womac scale—pain (mean difference−1.4, −1.7 to −1.0), stiffness (−0.7, −0.8 to −0.5), and physical function (−4.4, −5.7 to −3.3)—as well as the composite womac score (−5.7, −7.5 to −3.9) (fig 1). 6 13 14 the same three trials compared celecoxib with naproxen 500 mg twice daily in 1917 patients. there were no significant differences between celecoxib and naproxen, with both drugs being equally effective for all components of the womac scale: pain (0.0, −0.7 to 0.7), stiffness (0.1, −0.1 to 0.2), and physical function (0.4, −1.0 to 1.8) and the composite womac score (0.4, −1.5 to 2.3) (fig 1).

tolerability
celecoxib versus placebo—five trials with 3826 patients reported drug related withdrawals after 12 weeks' treatment (fig 2). 6 7 12–14 withdrawal due to adverse events occurred more often on celecoxib than on placebo, both for any adverse event (relative risk 1.49, 1.15 to 1.92) and for all gastrointestinal adverse events (1.68, 1.07 to 2.65). however, withdrawals due to abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea, or vomiting were not significantly increased with celecoxib compared with placebo.

celecoxib versus nsaid—seven trials with 5425 patients reported drug related withdrawals after 12 weeks' treatment (fig 2). 6–9 12–14 in six trials the nsaid was naproxen 500 mg twice daily 6–8 12–14 and in the other one it was diclofenac 75 mg twice daily and ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily.9 there was no significant difference between celecoxib and nsaid in the incidence of withdrawals for all adverse events. however, there was a significant decrease in the number of withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse events (0.54, 0.42 to 0.71), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 35 at three months. of the specific gastrointestinal adverse events, there were significantly fewer withdrawals due to abdominal pain and dyspepsia in the celecoxib group compared with other nsaids (0.41, 0.26 to 0.67, and 0.59, 0.36 to 0.98, respectively). the incidence of withdrawals due to diarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting were not significantly different between celecoxib and other nsaids.

ulcers detected by endoscopy
celecoxib versus placebo—two trials with 933 patients reported on ulcers detected by endoscopy after 12 weeks treatment. 7 13 although there was no significant difference in the number of ulcers detected between the groups, the results were compatible with up to a threefold increase in the incidence of ulcers (fig 3).

ulcers, perforations, bleeds, and obstructions at 24 weeks
the class study of 7968 patients investigated the incidence of serious upper gastrointestinal events (bleeds, perforations, obstructions) in those taking celecoxib (3987 given celecoxib 800 mg per day; above the recommended dose) compared with other nsaids (1985 took ibuprofen, 1996 took diclofenac).11 patients were monitored and withdrawn from the trial due to adverse events, if endoscopy indicated a symptomatic ulcer, if prolonged use of an ulcer healing treatment was required, or if treatment did not control the symptoms of arthritis. at six months the overall rates of withdrawal were 40% for celecoxib, 42% for diclofenac, and 47% for ibuprofen. with celecoxib the incidence of serious adverse events, bleeds, perforations, or obstructions (n=11) was nearly half that with the other nsaids (n=20), but this difference was not significant (p=0.11, fig 4).

among the participants withdrawn from the trial for safety reasons, 19 patients taking celecoxib were found to have ulcers on endoscopy compared with 29 patients taking other nsaids. when ulcers were included within the definition of serious adverse events the reduction with celecoxib became significant (p=0.03, fig 4).

benefits of celecoxib in patients receiving low dose aspirin
four trials compared celecoxib with other nsaids and provided data on the incidence of ulcers detected by endoscopy in patients according to whether or not the patients were taking aspirin (up to 325 mg/day). 7–9 13 the benefit of celecoxib seemed greater in those not taking aspirin (73% reduction in incidence, 52% to 84%) compared with those taking aspirin (51% reduction in incidence, 14% to 72%), although the difference between subgroups was not significant (p=0.18, fig 5).

in the class study 1739 patients were taking aspirin.11 the reduction in the incidence of clinical ulcers, perforation, bleeds, and obstructions was smaller in those taking aspirin (19% reduction, −63% to 60%) than in those not taking aspirin (50% reduction, 8% to 72%). this difference between the subgroups was not significant (p=0.44).

discussion
in this review of randomised controlled trials we have shown that celecoxib is as effective as other nsaids for the relief from symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. the confidence intervals around the point estimates of efficacy were reasonably narrow, which mean that it is unlikely that there were clinically important differences. compared with other nsaids, however, celecoxib showed increased upper gastrointestinal safety and tolerability. rates of withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse event, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain were 40-60% lower, while the incidence of ulcers and serious upper gastrointestinal events was 40-75% lower.

our conclusions are robust and unlikely to be influenced by bias. beyond the stated involvement of mdb, the industrial sponsors had no involvement in the review process once the protocol had been agreed. we included published and unpublished studies, and we insisted that the companies involved provided a signed legal statement confirming that they had made available data from all celecoxib trials that were completed before our inclusion date. we evaluated the impact of including unpublished studies by sensitivity analyses for main outcomes (presented in figs 1–4); our findings and interpretation did not change. results of further phase 4 trials (the success trial) have recently been partially published in abstract form since we completed our search. we did not add these to our review as they are incomplete and could introduce bias.15

as we abstracted data directly from original trial reports we minimised the effects of missing data and errors in transcription. access to individual patient data would have allowed us to investigate further any variation in treatment effect with patient characteristics.

all included trials were designed and executed to meet standards required for licensing. although withdrawals were common, the potential biases due to unequal withdrawals act in a conservative direction.

for most analyses we did not detect any heterogeneity, which supports pooling of different doses of drugs and disease states. each analysis comprised large numbers of patients, baseline characteristics were similar, all patients had active disease at the start of the study, and efficacy outcomes assessed were those routinely required for licensing of drugs for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (womac and acr-20). additional efficacy outcomes that we investigated but have not reported here showed similar patterns of benefit.

tolerability
withdrawals for adverse events have been used as a measure of tolerability because long term use of nsaids typically leads to gastrointestinal disturbances and discontinuation of the drug. estimates of withdrawal rates with placebo are difficult to interpret as a measure of tolerability because placebo groups had high attrition rates because of poor control of symptoms. withdrawal rates with active treatment were lower. significantly fewer withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse events occurred with celecoxib (about 3%) than with other nsaids (about 6%); withdrawals due to abdominal pain and dyspepsia approximately halved.

upper gastrointestinal safety
long term treatment with nsaids is associated with gastrointestinal ulcer disease.1–3 there was no significant increase in ulcers detected endoscopically with celecoxib compared with placebo, despite the difference in withdrawal rates. the incidence of ulcers was 70% lower with celecoxib compared with other nsaids. for every 100 patients treated with nsaids for 12-24 weeks, 23 developed either a gastric or duodenal ulcer, 16 of which would have been prevented if the patients had received celecoxib, giving a number needed to treat of six.

not all ulcers detected by endoscopy progress to a serious event as some heal spontaneously. a more informative outcome measure is the actual incidence of events. in a single trial the incidence of ulcers, bleeds perforations, or obstructions was determined in almost 8000 patients receiving celecoxib or another nsaid (diclofenac or ibuprofen). although the power of the study was reduced by a high withdrawal rate and a resulting low incidence of events, there was a significant 40% reduction in ulcers, bleeds, perforations, or obstructions in the celecoxib group, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 208 at six months. the dose of celecoxib used in this trial was twice the recommended maximum dose, which indicates that celecoxib does not exhibit the increased gastrointestinal toxicity with higher doses typical of other nsaids.

the publication of the class trial has been criticised for not reporting results beyond the six month follow up. 16 17 the company trial report indicates that while all participants started treatment at least six months before the study ended, the average follow up was only seven months. importantly, duration of treatment (medians of 273, 257, and 186 days), total withdrawal rates (55%, 53%, and 65% for celecoxib, diclofenac, and ibuprofen respectively), and reasons for withdrawal varied significantly between treatment groups. although variable follow up can be properly accounted for by using time to event analyses, withdrawal related to treatment cannot. we therefore present results at the longest follow up to which all participants could contribute, which reduces but does not eradicate these problems. upper gastrointestinal safety beyond six months cannot reliably be determined from this trial.

other potential adverse events
this review was limited to assessing only upper gastrointestinal safety. recently the vigor (vioxx gastrointestinal outcomes research) trial of rofecoxib has raised concerns about serious cardiovascular effects with the use of cox 2 inhibitors.18 while it is important to evaluate this concern, this was not possible here as the celecoxib trials we included did not report outcomes comparable with those assessed in vigor (all trials started recruitment before publication of vigor). this issue should be a priority for a future systematic review when adequate data on both celecoxib and rofecoxib are available.

prophylactic use of aspirin
aspirin is commonly prescribed to prevent cardiovascular disease, and, like nsaids, it inhibits cox 1 thus increasing the risk of a gastrointestinal event. subgroup analysis of patients taking aspirin still showed a significant reduction (51%) in the incidence of ulcers detected by endoscopy in those taking celecoxib compared with other nsaids, though the reduction was greater (74%) in those not taking aspirin. while the class study was not adequately powered to investigate subgroup analyses for serious upper gastrointestinal events, the same pattern of results was observed, suggesting benefit in users and non-users of aspirin. the dose of aspirin used for prophylaxis in the united kingdom is typically 75 mg daily, considerably less than the 325 mg commonly prescribed in the united states, where most of these trials were conducted. the present weight of evidence does not suggest that celecoxib should be withheld from aspirin users as currently recommended by the national institute for clinical excellence (nice), but further research should clarify the size of the possible reduction in efficacy in this group.

in conclusion, this meta-analysis provides strong evidence of the effectiveness of celecoxib for relief of pain and inflammatory symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, the level of effectiveness being equivalent to that of other nsaid. however, the tolerability and gastrointestinal safety of celecoxib is substantially superior.

fibroscan-ast (fast) score for the non-invasive identification of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with significant activity and fibrosis: a prospective derivation and global validation study

summary
background
the burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is increasing globally, and a major priority is to identify patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) who are at greater risk of progression to cirrhosis, and who will be candidates for clinical trials and emerging new pharmacotherapies. we aimed to develop a score to identify patients with nash, elevated nafld activity score (nas≥4), and advanced fibrosis (stage 2 or higher [f≥2]).

methods
this prospective study included a derivation cohort before validation in multiple international cohorts. the derivation cohort was a cross-sectional, multicentre study of patients aged 18 years or older, scheduled to have a liver biopsy for suspicion of nafld at seven tertiary care liver centres in england. this was a prespecified secondary outcome of a study for which the primary endpoints have already been reported. liver stiffness measurement (lsm) by vibration-controlled transient elastography and controlled attenuation parameter (cap) measured by fibroscan device were combined with aspartate aminotransferase (ast), alanine aminotransferase (alt), or ast:alt ratio. to identify those patients with nash, an elevated nas, and significant fibrosis, the best fitting multivariable logistic regression model was identified and internally validated using boot-strapping. score calibration and discrimination performance were determined in both the derivation dataset in england, and seven independent international (france, usa, china, malaysia, turkey) histologically confirmed cohorts of patients with nafld (external validation cohorts). this study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number nct01985009.

findings
between march 20, 2014, and jan 17, 2017, 350 patients with suspected nafld attending liver clinics in england were prospectively enrolled in the derivation cohort. the most predictive model combined lsm, cap, and ast, and was designated fast (fibroscan-ast). performance was satisfactory in the derivation dataset (c-statistic 0·80, 95% ci 0·76–0·85) and was well calibrated. in external validation cohorts, calibration of the score was satisfactory and discrimination was good across the full range of validation cohorts (c-statistic range 0·74–0·95, 0·85; 95% ci 0·83–0·87 in the pooled external validation patients' cohort; n=1026). cutoff was 0·35 for sensitivity of 0·90 or greater and 0·67 for specificity of 0·90 or greater in the derivation cohort, leading to a positive predictive value (ppv) of 0·83 (84/101) and a negative predictive value (npv) of 0·85 (93/110). in the external validation cohorts, ppv ranged from 0·33 to 0·81 and npv from 0·73 to 1·0.

interpretation
the fast score provides an efficient way to non-invasively identify patients at risk of progressive nash for clinical trials or treatments when they become available, and thereby reduce unnecessary liver biopsy in patients unlikely to have significant disease.

introduction
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is rising in prevalence along with levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes, such that it is now the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide.1 prevalence in the general population is 25–35%, but this rises to 70% in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes.1 although most patients with nafld do not progress to advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, the high prevalence of nafld means that many patients do develop chronic liver disease, and that nafld is now one of main indications for liver transplantation in europe2 and the usa.3 a key challenge is the identification of patients who are at greatest risk of clinical progression by way of worsening liver fibrosis, and who might benefit from treatment with new pharmacotherapies.4, 5

research in context

evidence before this study

existing diagnostic scores focus only on fibrosis and have not been successful in enhancing screen failure rates in clinical trials. the concept of identifying patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, an elevated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score, and f2 fibrosis for the purpose of inclusion in clinical trials had not been previously considered. pubmed searches for those terms up to september, 2019, with no language restrictions, did not reveal any publications in this area. previous studies had only focused on identifying patients with fibrosis but not concomitant evaluation of inflammation.

added value of this study

this study provides a solution to better identify patients who might be candidates for clinical trials or treatments as they become available. there is a high screen failure rate at liver biopsy because of the absence of such tools. this score will reduce the number of patients having unnecessary liver biopsy.

implications of all the available evidence

the results of this study have the potential to help clinicians and investigators in their decision making, to better select patients for clinical trials or access to emerging therapies, and streamline the need for liver biopsies among patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in clinical care, probably resulting in a reduction in the number of biopsies required. future research should focus on studying the performance of the fast (fibroscan-ast) score in primary care.


currently, identification of patients with active nash and significant fibrosis can be done using non-invasive markers that risk-stratify liver fibrosis6 or require percutaneous liver biopsy. the use of non-invasive markers includes algorithms,7 serum biomarkers,8 and imaging modalities,9 but makes no determination of the presence or degree of inflammatory liver injury. the presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) and more profound liver cell injury, as determined by measures of steatosis (lobular inflammation and ballooning),10 are crucial drivers of the development of liver fibrosis in patients with nafld and will be important in risk stratification.

we present a prespecified secondary analysis of a previously published study,11 with the aim of developing an algorithm to diagnose, among people with suspected nafld, those with nash, significant liver fibrosis (≥f2), and elevated nafld activity score (nas≥4). this combination of criteria is important, as the presence of fibrosis alone is insufficient for recruitment to clinical trials. moreover, the presence of inflammation defined by nash and elevated nas will be important in identifying patients who could benefit from anti-inflammatory therapies, as these interventions might not be as relevant for patients with fibrosis but no or minimal inflammatory injury. studies have shown that histological responses to trial medications are more common in patients with elevated nas.12 we aimed to develop an algorithm to identify this subgroup of patients for clinical trial eligibility and for optimal prescription of therapies.

methods
study design
this prospective study was done as a derivation cohort before validation in multiple global cohorts (named external validation cohorts hereafter). the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (tripod) guidelines13 were followed to report the development and internal and external validation of the prediction model for diagnosis of nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2 (appendix p 3).14

the derivation cohort was a cross-sectional, prospective, multicentre study. consecutive patients were recruited from seven tertiary care liver centres across england (university hospitals birmingham nhs foundation trust, birmingham; addenbrooke's hospital, cambridge; royal free hospital, london; freeman hospital, newcastle upon tyne; university hospitals plymouth nhs trust, plymouth; queen's medical centre, nottingham; and john radcliffe hospital, oxford). the study was approved by the north wales research ethics committee (13/wa/0385) and by the local research ethics committee at each centre. the study was done in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and in agreement with the international conference on harmonisation guidelines on good clinical practice. the primary objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter (cap) and secondary objectives were to assess the diagnostic accuracy of liver stiffness measurement (lsm) by vibration-controlled transient elastography (vcte), comparing cap and lsm by vcte with other non-invasive tests and also to develop a score combining lsm by vcte, cap, and biological markers to diagnose nash. results for the identification of steatosis and fibrosis were reported by eddowes and colleagues,11 whereas we report the prespecified secondary objective of the development of a score to identify patients with nash and significant liver cell injury and fibrosis.

participants
eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, able to give written informed consent, and scheduled (independently from this study) to have a liver biopsy for investigation of suspected nafld (usually as a result of abnormal liver enzymes and an ultrasound scan showing an echobright liver) within 2 weeks before or after lsm by vcte and cap measurements. all patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study. eligible patients were negative for hepatitis b surface antigen, anti-hepatitis c virus antibody, hepatitis c virus rna, and hepatitis b virus dna. patients were excluded in case of ascites, pregnancy, active implantable medical device (such as pacemaker or defibrillator), liver transplantation, cardiac failure or clinically significant valvular disease, haemochromatosis, refusal to have liver biopsy or blood tests, alcohol consumption above recommended limits (>14 units per week for women and >21 units per week for men), diagnosis of active malignancy or other terminal disease, or participation in another clinical trial within the previous 30 days. age, sex, body-mass index (bmi), and presence of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia were recorded for each patient. a 12 h fasting blood sample was obtained locally and then shipped to a central laboratory for assessment.

procedures
percutaneous liver biopsy was done in all patients and used as the reference. specimens were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin and picrosirius red. slides were analysed independently by two experienced pathologists (pb, vp) masked to each other's reading, and to the patient's clinical and fibroscan data. in case of disagreement, they reviewed the slides together to reach consensus. steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation grades, fibrosis stage, and nas were assessed using the nash clinical research network (crn) scoring system.10 nash was diagnosed using the fatty liver: inhibition of progression (flip) definition (at least grade one for steatosis, ballooning, and lobular inflammation).15

lsm by vcte and cap were both measured using fibroscan 502 touch devices equipped with both m and xl probes (echosens, paris, france) by nurses or physicians trained and certified by the manufacturer and masked to the patient's histological evaluation.16, 17 patients were asked to fast for at least 3 h before the examination. probe selection was done using the automatic probe selection tool embedded in the device software. patients were placed in the supine position with their right arm fully abducted, and measurements were done by scanning the right liver lobe through an intercostal space. cap is an average estimate of ultrasound attenuation at 3·5 mhz and is expressed in db/m. lsm by vcte is an average estimate of stiffness (young's modulus) at a shear wave frequency of 50 hz and is expressed as kpa. only examinations with at least ten valid individual measurements were deemed valid.

the main outcome was the diagnosis of nash (using flip definition) with nas 4 or higher, and fibrosis stage 2 or higher (nas and fibrosis stage scored using crn scoring system; combination of criteria hereafter referred to as nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2). the models considered five predictor variables: lsm by vcte, cap, aspartate aminotransferase (ast), alanine aminotransferase (alt) or ast:alt ratio (aar). we anticipated that only one of ast, alt, and aar would be included in the final model.

external validation cohorts
data from seven clinical studies were gathered to perform the external validation of the score. data came from north america, europe, and asia. five cohorts came from tertiary care liver centres, one cohort came from a bariatric surgery centre, and one cohort came from a study of screening for nafld in patients having a routine colonoscopy. all external validation cohort data were collected in the framework of a clinical study for which the local ethical committee granted approval. all patients from each study gave written informed consent to participate in the study. each study was done in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and in agreement with the international conference on harmonisation guidelines on good clinical practice. enrolment dates of each study are shown in the appendix (p 5) together with descriptions of external validation cohorts. datasets were locked at the date of the last inclusion (appendix p 5). however, the chinese wenzhou, french, and turkish nafld studies were ongoing at database lock (wenzhou was expected to end in december, 2022, the french open registry had no planned termination date, and the turkish study terminated in may, 2019). in each external validation study, patients were recruited consecutively, fibroscan operators were masked to patients' clinical data, and all liver biopsy results were read by expert pathologists who were masked to patient clinical data and fibroscan device results. for the two studies that had all patients measured with both m and xl probes (chinese hong-kong and french nafld cohorts), the fibroscan examination corresponding to the xl probe was considered if the patient's bmi was greater or equal to 32 kg/m2; otherwise the m probe was considered.

all external validation cohorts excluded patients who met the following criteria: non-metabolic comorbidities that could have induced liver lesions such as viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, excessive alcohol consumption, or hiv; bmi higher than 32 kg/m2 if only the m probe was available for the study; less than ten valid measurements for fibroscan; missing data for the developed score; liver biopsy results that were non-interpretable or with missing data for the target of nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2; or a time interval greater than 1 year between fibroscan and liver biopsy. in each external validation cohort, patients had their individual lesions of steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning grades, and fibrosis stage scored according to the nash crn scoring system.10 from these individual items, a diagnosis of nash was made according to the flip definition,15 and the nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2 outcome was computed.

statistical analysis
sample size was determined for the primary objective of estimating the accuracy of cap to achieve a 5% standard error in the estimates of the area under the receiver operating curve (auroc) parameter in the subgroup using the xl probe. assuming two-thirds of recruited patients would use the xl probe, and allowing for 30% dropout, the target sample size was set at 450. this sample size was judged adequate to provide robust estimates for predictive models based on five covariates, with over 30 events per variable at an expected prevalence of 50%. the score was developed on the 350 patients in the derivation cohort. eight (2%) of 350 patients had missing data for cap, ast, or alt, and since the proportion of observations with missing data was less than 3%, single imputation was done using stochastic regression imputation.18, 19 the selection of parameters was based on the combination of lsm by vcte (related to liver fibrosis), and cap (related to liver steatosis), with factors linked to nash, inflammation, and fibrosis (ast, alt, aar). parameters were combined into a multivariable logistic regression model. akaike's information criterion was used to select between ast, alt, and aar as the optimal parameter to combine to lsm by vcte and cap. the relative importance of each parameter was appraised using the wald test. nested models were compared using the likelihood ratio test. optimal exploratory variable transformations were selected using multivariable first-degree fractional polynomials to optimise the model.20 in this method, first order fractional polynomials are formulated as a power transformation of the predictors taken from the set −2, −1, −0·5, 0, 0·5, 1, 2, 3. optimal power is selected for each predictor (considered in order of decreasing statistical significance) using a backward stepwise selection procedure.20

the model was internally validated using 2000 bootstrap samples.19 within each bootstrap iteration, we refitted the model and evaluated the performance in the bootstrap sample (apparent performance) and in the original data (test performance). performance was assessed in terms of auroc. the optimism was quantified as the mean differences of the performance estimates, and the shrinkage factor computed and applied to each regression coefficient in the original model to adjust the model for overfitting. alternative methods such as cross-validation could have been used to perform the internal validation of the score, but bootstrapping is considered superior to cross-validation as it allows quantification of the extent of overfitting and optimism.13 bootstrapping also provides an estimate of a correction factor (called shrinkage factor) that can be used to adjust the regression coefficients for overfitting such that better performance will be obtained when applying the score to new patients.

model performance was assessed by calibration and discrimination in both the derivation and validation cohorts. calibration (the agreement between observed outcomes and prediction) was assessed using calibration plots and a smoothing technique based on locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (loess).19 discrimination was assessed using auroc (similar to harrell's c-statistic). cutoffs for sensitivity (≥0·90) and specificity (≥0·90) were derived in the derivation cohort. when appraising performance at a given cutoff, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), and negative predictive value (npv) were computed together with 95% cis (see appendix p 7 for potential risk of bias in each external validation cohort). auroc comparison was done using the delong test. statistical analyses were done using the software r, version 3.4.1.21 this study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, nct01985009.

results
between march 20, 2014, and jan 17, 2017, we assessed 450 potentially eligible participants (figure 1), 350 of whom were included in the fibroscan-ast (fast) score construction, which was subsequently validated in seven cohorts (total of 1026 patients). as reported in table 1, the derivation cohort had broadly similar demographic, metabolic, serological, and histological characteristics to patients in the pooled validation cohorts. nash was reported in 241 (69%) of 350 patients in the derivation cohort and 595 (58%) of 1026 patients in the pooled validation cohort. nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2 was reported in 174 (50%) of 350 patients in the derivation cohort and 277 (27%) of 1026 patients in the pooled validation cohort.

models combining lsm by vcte; cap; and ast, alt, or aar were compared (appendix p 9). ast was determined to be the best parameter to combine with lsm and cap. further nested model comparison was done (appendix p 10), which showed that a model combining lsm, cap, and ast had significantly better predictive properties than models with only one or two of these predictors. this resulted in the following equation for the fast score:

the fast score was sensitive to each individual histological component (appendix p 20). as the derived fast score is the predicted probability from the logistic regression model it is bounded between 0 and 1, and can be interpreted in a probabilistic manner. auroc in the bootstrap sample (apparent performance) was 0·803 (95% ci 0·758–0·849) and in the original data (test performance) 0·804 (0·790–0·806), showing little over-optimism (−6·0 × 10−4, −4·3 × 10−2 to 4·7 × 10−2). predictive performance of fast score in terms of discrimination, calibration, and diagnostic accuracy (figure 2) indicated an auroc of 0·80 (95% ci 0·76–0·85) with satisfactory calibration of predicted probabilities.

diagnostic performance of fast score in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values is represented in figure 2c by cutoff value. figure 2d illustrates the performance of fast score as it might be used in the context of identifying patients for therapies or drug trials for nash. the screen failure rate represents the proportion of screened participants having liver biopsy that would not meet the histological target (nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2) and would therefore not be randomised in trials or considered for treatment. if fast score was used to identify such patients, the screen failure rate would decrease from 174 (50%) of 350 patients with increasing fast cutoffs as illustrated in figure 2d, although more patients would be identified as false negatives for nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2 (missed case rate). the histological characteristics of misclassified patients are detailed in the appendix (p 19).

external validation of the score was evaluated alongside calibration plots for each external validation cohort (figure 3). calibration was satisfactory for the chinese hong-kong, french, and turkish nafld cohorts, which have a prevalence of nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2 similar to the derivation cohort. however, for cohorts with a lower prevalence of the outcome, fast score overestimates the probability of having nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2. corresponding aurocs are provided (table 2), with good to excellent discrimination in all external validation cohorts except for the turkish nafld cohort, which had modest performance. best discrimination was observed in the french bariatric surgery cohort, with an auroc of 0·95 (95% ci 0·91–0·99).

cutoff for sensitivity (≥0·90) was 0·35 and for specificity (≥0·90) was 0·67 in the derivation cohort (full diagnostic performance in the appendix, p 11), with characteristics for validation cohorts detailed in table 2. using the dual cutoff approach, ppv in the derivation cohort was 0·83 (84/[84+17], 95% ci 0·75–0·87), npv was 0·85 (93/[93+17], 0·77–0·88), and 136 (39%) of 350 patients were in the grey zone between the two cutoffs. when applying these cutoffs to the external validation cohorts, ppv was in the same order of magnitude with a similar sensitivity in the chinese hong-kong, french, and turkish nafld cohorts. the usa screening cohort had a ppv in the same order of magnitude but a lower sensitivity. the chinese wenzhou nafld with the lowest prevalence of nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2, had a lower ppv but similar sensitivity. npv was high in all external validation cohorts.

fast was compared with fib-4 and the nafld fibrosis score (nfs) for the identification of patients with nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2 in the subgroup of patients from the derivation and external validation cohorts that had all parameters needed to compute those three scores (derivation cohort n=339, pooled external validation cohort n=981). corresponding aurocs and diagnostic performance using the dual cutoff approach (appendix p 12) were inferior to the fast score. indeed, discrimination was significantly higher for the fast score in the derivation and in the pooled external validation cohort. using the dual cutoff approach in the pooled validation cohort, nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2 yielded a similar number of patients in the grey zone (311 [32%] of 981 patients) as did fast (304 [31%]), nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2 yielded a slightly higher ppv (0·72 [18/25] with nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2 vs 0·69 [132/190] with fast), but lower npv (0·83 [536/645] with nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2 vs 0·94 [453/484] with fast), and failed to identify most of the patients with nash+nas≥4+f≥2 (sensitivity 0·07 [18/272] with nash + nas ≥ 4 + f ≥ 2 vs 0·49 [132/272] with fast). nfs had a larger grey zone than fast (444 [45%] of 981 patients with nfs vs 304 [31%] of 981 patients with fast) with lower ppv (nfs 0·50 [51/101] vs fast 0·69 [132/190]) and npv (nfs 0·85 [370/436] vs fast 0·94 [453/484]). moreover, the addition of metabolic parameters to the score were appraised and did not provide significant improvement in terms of discrimination (appendix p 15).

discussion
in this prospective cohort study, we present a new, simple, non-proprietary score that identifies patients with progressive nash and has been validated in multiple large global cohorts.

there has been considerable debate as to which patients with nash should be the focus of monitoring and treatment, although data have suggested that the degree of fibrosis is a major driver of clinical outcomes.22, 23, 24 our choice of nash with nas ≥ 4 and f ≥ 2 is based on this literature and also many therapeutic studies that show the presence of elevated necro-inflammatory activity is linked to progressive injury and pharmacological response.12, 25

the fast score, in keeping with recommended practice, was configured to have two thresholds, a rule-out and a rule-in cutoff. this allowed for classification of more than 70% of patients in the validation cohorts. moreover, fast score has good performance characteristics with a negative likelihood ratio of 0·2 (rule-out, cutoff) and a positive likelihood ratio of 5 (rule-in, cutoff), ratios that are maintained in the validation groups. thus, this test could have a substantial influence on clinical decision making and be an important adjunct in identifying patients for clinical trials or commencement of pharmacotherapies. 33 patients had types of lesion on their biopsy samples that were neither in-keeping with nafld nor were normal. although some of these patients had some fibrosis or steatosis, the pathologist did not feel it was appropriate to grade them for items of the nas or fibrosis according to the nash crn scoring system, which would have biased the construction of the score. we therefore decided to build the score using a completely nafld cohort. although this might affect the performance of the score in the derivation cohort, it would have no effect on performance in the multiple validation cohorts.

as with any other predictive models, the performance of the fast score will be determined by the population to which it is applied: the spectrum bias will affect the sensitivity and specificity of the score, and the prevalence of the target patients will affect predictive values.26 for example, the ppv of any test will be different in primary versus secondary care, although the npv will remain robust. this test will be of greatest value in secondary care, in which consideration for biopsy and eligibility for trials or treatment will be evaluated. these patients will inevitably have received some form of vetting, but we know from screening data for clinical trials that there is a high rate of screen failure for trials. we believe the fast score will help to identify the patients suitable for clinical trials and emerging therapies more efficiently and reduce unnecessary liver biopsies.

using such tools is inevitably a trade-off between reducing false positives and avoiding too many false negatives. this requires an understanding of the relative impact of these effects (ie, fewer biopsies and the potential problems that result from patients not being considered for treatment), which is limited, and the efficacy of new treatments is unknown.

in generating this score, we sought to determine the performance of standard liver blood tests or other widely used algorithms in identifying patients with progressive nash. the performance of these parameters in isolation was inferior to the fast score (appendix p 9), and indeed other than the addition of ast values, there was no evidence that addition of other elements (eg, metabolic syndrome parameters) improved the performance of the fast score (appendix p 15).

one of the challenges with such tests is dealing with patients in the grey zone. decision making for such patients will be influenced by individual characteristics, proximity to thresholds (low or high), and operator confidence. in many cases, it might be appropriate to repeat the test at a suitable interval (eg, 2–3 months), whereas in others it might be useful to consider an alternative modality or proceed with liver biopsy. patient choice will be a key determinant of this decision making.

we, and others, have shown that cap and lsm by vcte measurements are widely applicable in patients with nash, with a low failure rate (3%) and good performance in determining the degree of liver steatosis and fibrosis.11, 27 importantly, we also showed that lsm values only correlated with fibrosis, and were not influenced by other histological parameters or type of probe used.

our study has several strengths. firstly, it is prospective in nature and has undergone extensive validation across multiple large global cohorts. secondly, fast score performance is good across the full range of validation cohorts. auroc ranged from 0·74 to 0·95, with ppv up to 0·85 and npv ranging from 0·73 to 1 using the dual cutoffs approach, with cutoffs derived in the derivation cohort. thirdly, the wide availability of fibroscan devices based on vcte technology, the need for just a serum ast value, its non-invasive nature, its low cost per scan, and its modest requirement to attain technical proficiency required to do the scans, mean the method can be rolled out easily across most clinical practices. roll-out is further aided by the free availability of the equation, which is also accessible through an app.

there are several weaknesses to this study, including the requirement for a fibroscan device, which could affect uptake. use of fast in primary care will require investment in devices and personnel, although there are many examples of such models being introduced successfully.6 another potential criticism is that our score focuses on patients with fibrosis stage 2 or higher, with some contending that identifying patients with more advanced fibrosis (≥stage 3) should be the priority. at this stage, clinical trials are aiming to recruit patients with stage 2 and 3 fibrosis, and we therefore believe that stage 2 fibrosis and above constitutes a reasonable target group. we derived cutoffs for the identification of patients with advanced fibrosis (f≥3) in our cohort (appendix p 16,17). the performance characteristics were good, with moderate likelihood ratios to rule-out and rule-in such patients.

in two validation cohorts there was only access to the m probe, so patients with a bmi greater than 32 kg/m2 were excluded, which could bias the performance of the score in those cohorts.

finally, fast score performed least well in terms of calibration in low prevalence populations, and caution should be exercised when interpreting the score in these settings, although discrimination performance of the score was good. in a future study, recalibration of scores could be considered to correct miscalibration while keeping the same level of discrimination. however, to do so we need to know which prevalence would be representative of the population, in whom the score would be used, and a robust reference cohort with that low prevalence.

in summary, we believe the fast score will allow for the more efficient identification of an at-risk group of patients with progressive nash that merit consideration for further treatment.

a methodological review of how heterogeneity has been examined in systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy

background
systematic reviews of therapeutic interventions are now commonplace in many if not most areas of healthcare, and in recent years interest has turned to applying similar techniques to research evaluating diagnostic tests. one of the key parts of any review is to consider how similar or different the available primary studies are and what impact any differences have on studies' results. between-study differences or heterogeneity in results can result from chance, from errors in calculating accuracy indices or from true heterogeneity, that is, differences in design, conduct, participants, tests and reference tests. an important additional consideration for diagnostic studies is differences in results due to variations in the chosen threshold for a positive result for either the index or reference test.

dealing with heterogeneity is particularly challenging for diagnostic test reviews, not least because test accuracy is conventionally represented by a pair of statistics and not by a single measure of effect such as relative risk, and as a result a variety of statistical methods are available that differ in the way in which they tackle the bivariate nature of test accuracy data:

methods that undertake independent analyses of each aspect of test performance
methods that further summarise test performance into a single summary statistic
methods that use statistical models that simultaneously consider both dimensions of test performance.
the validity of a choice of meta-analytical method depends in part on the pattern of variability (heterogeneity) observed in the study results. however, currently there is no empirical guidance to judge which methods are appropriate in which circumstances, and the degree to which different methods yield comparable results. all this adds to the complexity and difficulty of undertaking systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy.

objectives
our objective was to review how heterogeneity has been examined in systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies.

methods
systematic reviews that evaluated a diagnostic or screening test by including studies that compared a test with a reference test were identified from the centre for reviews and dissemination's database of abstracts of reviews of effects. reviews for which structured abstracts had been written up to december 2002 were screened for inclusion. data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms by one reviewer and checked by a second.

results
a total of 189 systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. the median number of studies included in the reviews was 18 [inter-quartile range (iqr) 20]. meta-analyses (n = 133) have a higher number with a median of 22 studies (iqr 20) compared with 11 (iqr 13) for narrative reviews (n = 56).

identification of heterogeneity
graphical plots to demonstrate the spread in study results were provided in 56% of meta-analyses; in 79% of cases these were in the form of plots of sensitivity and specificity in the receiver operating characteristic (roc) space (commonly termed 'roc plots').

statistical tests to identify heterogeneity were used in 32% of reviews: 41% of meta-analyses and 9% of reviews using narrative syntheses. the χ2 test and fisher's exact test to assess heterogeneity in individual aspects of test performance were most commonly used. in contrast, only 16% of meta-analyses used correlation coefficients to test for a threshold effect.

type of syntheses used
a narrative synthesis was used in 30% of reviews. of the meta-analyses, 52% carried out statistical pooling alone, 18% conducted only summary receiver operator characteristic (sroc) analyses and 30% used both methods of statistical synthesis. of the reviews that pooled accuracy indices, most pooled each aspect of test performance separately with only a handful producing single summaries of test performance such as the diagnostic odds ratio. for those undertaking sroc analyses, the main differences between the models used were the weights chosen for the regression models. in fact, in 42% of cases (27/64) the use of, or choice of, weight was not provided by the review authors.

the proportion of reviews using statistical pooling alone has declined over time from 67% in 1995 to 42% in 2001, with a corresponding increase in the use of sroc methods, from 33% to 58%. however, two-thirds of those using sroc methods also carried out statistical pooling rather than presenting only sroc models. reviews using sroc analyses also tended to present their results as some combination of sensitivity and specificity rather than using alternative, perhaps less clinically meaningful, means of data presentation such as diagnostic odds ratios.

investigation of heterogeneity sources
three-quarters of meta-analyses attempted to investigate statistically possible sources of variation, using subgroup analysis (76) or regression analysis (44). the median number of variables investigated was four, ranging from one variable in 20% of reviews to over six in 27% of reviews. the ratio of median number of variables to median number of studies was 1:6.

the impact of clinical or socio-demographic variables was investigated in 74% of these reviews and test- or threshold-related variables in 79%. at least one quality-related variable was investigated in 63% of reviews. within this subset, the most commonly considered variables were the use of blinding (41% of reviews), sample size (33%), the reference test used (28%) and the avoidance of verification bias (25%).

conclusions
the emphasis on pooling individual aspects of diagnostic test performance and the under-use of statistical tests and graphical approaches to identify heterogeneity perhaps reflect the uncertainty in the most appropriate methods to use and also greater familiarity with more traditional indices of test accuracy. this is an indication of the level of difficulty and complexity of carrying out these reviews. it is strongly suggested that in such reviews meta-analyses are carried out with the involvement of a statistician familiar with the field.

recommendations for further research
the following areas are suggested for further research.

further methodological work on the statistical methods available for combining diagnostic test accuracy studies is needed.
sufficiently large, prospectively designed primary studies of diagnostic test accuracy that compare two or more tests for the same target disorder are needed so that sources of heterogeneity are minimised and comparative accuracy can be established in a wide spectrum of patients.
use of individual patient data meta-analysis in diagnostic test accuracy reviews should be explored to allow heterogeneity to be considered in more detail.
