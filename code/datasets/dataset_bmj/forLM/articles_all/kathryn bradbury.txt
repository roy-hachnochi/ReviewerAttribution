fluid intake and dietary factors and the risk of incident kidney stones in uk biobank: a population-based prospective keywords: kidney stones fluid diet uk biobank longitudinal abstract background: fluid intake and diet are thought to influence kidney stone risk. however, prospective studies have been limited to small samples sizes and/or restricted measures. objective: to investigate whether fluid intake and dietary factors are associated with the risk of developing a first kidney stone. design, setting, and participants: participants were selected from uk biobank, a populationbased prospective cohort study. outcome measurements and statistical analysis: cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the association between fluid intake and dietary factors and the risk of a first incident kidney stone, ascertained from hospital inpatient records. results and limitations: after exclusion, <UNK> <UNK> participants were available for the analysis, of whom <UNK> had hospital admission with an incident kidney stone over a mean of <UNK> yr of follow-up. for every additional drink <UNK> ml) consumed per day of total fluid, the risk of kidney stones declined by <UNK> (hazard ratio [hr] = <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval [ci] <UNK> <UNK> similar patterns of associations were observed for tea, coffee, and alcohol, although no association was observed for water intake. fruit and fibre intake was also associated with a lower risk (hr per <UNK> g increase of fruits per day = <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> and hr per <UNK> g fibre per day = <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> whereas meat and salt intake was associated with a higher risk (hr per <UNK> g increase in meat per week = <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> and hr for always vs never/ rarely added salt to food = <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> vegetable, fish, and cheese intake was not associated with kidney stone risk. conclusions: the finding that high intake of total fluid, fruit, and fibre was associated with a lower risk of hospitalisation for a first kidney stone suggests that modifiable dietary factors could be targeted to prevent kidney stone development. patient summary: we found that higher intake of total fluid, specifically tea, coffee, and alcohol (but not water), and consumption of fruit and foods high in fibre are linked with a reduced likelihood of developing kidney stones. <UNK> introduction kidney stones are a common cause of morbidity, with a lifetime prevalence of <UNK> in england, with incidence rates having increased substantially over the last few decades worldwide <UNK> taking into account diagnostic and treatment costs and the additional socioeconomic burden from sickness leave, the fiscal impact of kidney stones on the wider economy is considerable <UNK> kidney stones also have a high recurrence rate, with approximately half of patients having a recurrent episode over <UNK> yr and up to <UNK> over <UNK> yr <UNK> it is therefore important to identify modifiable risk factors that can be targeted for the prevention of developing kidney stones. certain dietary factors are considered to be major contributors to the increasing incidence of kidney stones, specifically a diet low in fibre and high in animal protein, fat, and sodium <UNK> additionally, it has been suggested that increasing fluid intake is an effective method to reduce the risk of kidney stone formation <UNK> however, whilst there have been several prospective studies on diet and fluid intake and the subsequent risk of developing kidney stones, they have typically been small or focused on a narrow range of dietary factors. to address these limitations, we investigate the association between a wide range of dietary factors and fluid intake, including specific types of beverages, and the risk of developing incident kidney stones, as assessed through hospital inpatient records, in a large uk-based prospective cohort of half a million participants without prevalent kidney stones. <UNK> patients and methods <UNK> population participants were selected from uk biobank, a populationbased study designed to improve the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of a range of diseases and conditions <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> approximately <UNK> <UNK> women and men aged between <UNK> and <UNK> yr attended one of <UNK> baseline assessment centres located throughout england, scotland, and wales. all participants provided sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related information collected through touchscreen questionnaires and verbal interviews, as well as completed a range of physical measurements. electronic signed consent was obtained, which included consent for on-going linkage to medical and health-related records. uk biobank received approval from the national information governance board for health and social care and the national health service north west centre for research ethics committee (ref: <UNK> <UNK> diagnosis of kidney stones kidney stones were ascertained using hospital inpatient records, which contain data on hospital admissions, operations, and procedures obtained for the entire cohort from hospital episode statistics for england, scottish morbidity record for scotland, and patient episode database for wales. diagnoses were recorded using the international classification of diseases (icd) coding system; operations and procedures were recorded using the office of population censuses and surveys: classification of intervention and procedures, version <UNK> <UNK> coding system. participants with a kidney stone or renal colic were identified using <UNK> codes <UNK> and <UNK> (as either a primary or a secondary diagnosis), and <UNK> codes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> (as either a primary or a secondary operative procedure). the codes are described in detail in supplementary table <UNK> <UNK> assessment of dietary factors and fluid intake dietary and fluid intake was self-reported at baseline for all <UNK> <UNK> participants using a short touchscreen food-frequency questionnaire (ffq), designed to capture “usual” intake of common food and drink items, as well as to seek information about common sources of various nutrients <UNK> daily intake of tea, coffee, water, fresh fruit, dried fruit, cooked vegetables, and salad/raw vegetables, and weekly intake of oily fish, nonoily fish, processed meat, poultry, beef, lamb/mutton, pork, cheese, bread, and cereal were collected. participants were also asked whether they added salt to their food. dietary data from the oxford webq, a more detailed questionnaire than the ffq <UNK> available for <UNK> <UNK> participants at either baseline or <UNK> yr after recruitment, was used to account for regression dilution bias (ie, random error in estimated intake introduced by fluctuations in dietary intake over time and/or measurement error using the ffq). for more detail on the derivation of dietary variables from the ffq and the oxford webq, see the supplementary material. <UNK> covariates townsend deprivation score was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status and was assigned to each participant corresponding to the output area of their residential postcode at recruitment. educational qualifications, ethnic background, smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, and calcium supplementation use were collected via the touchscreen questionnaire at recruitment. body mass index (bmi; <UNK> ) was derived from weight (kg) using scales and standing height (metres) measured during the physical examination at recruitment. <UNK> statistical analysis of the <UNK> <UNK> participants enrolled in uk biobank, <UNK> participants with a prevalent kidney stone identified via either self-report at recruitment and/or hospital inpatient records (ie, with a relevant diagnostic or operation code before the date of recruitment) were excluded. in an attempt to account for the possibility that pre-existing conditions would

reported in the touchscreen questionnaire as making major changes to their diet over the last <UNK> yr due to illness were also excluded. this resulted in an analytical dataset of <UNK> <UNK> participants (see fig. <UNK> for a flowchart of the exclusion criteria). person years were calculated from the date of recruitment <UNK> until the first incident diagnosis of kidney stones, date of death, or last date of hospital admission <UNK> march <UNK> whichever came first. cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between dietary factors as measured using the ffq at recruitment and subsequent risk of the first kidney stone. as the analyses presented here generally involve a comparison of risks across more than two categories, the floating absolute risk method was used to estimate the <UNK> confidence intervals (cis) <UNK> tests for linear trends across the baseline ffq categories of intake were based on the mean intake derived from the oxford webq. all models were assessed for the proportionality of hazards assumption using schoenfeld residuals. the main analyses were adjusted for age (in single years), sex, townsend deprivation score (quintiles), education (no qualifications, cse/o-level/gcse or equivalent, as/a-level or equivalent, higher education, or other professional qualification), ethnicity (white, mixed background, black, asian, or

<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ), and use of calcium supplementation (no and yes). participants with missing data or who responded “prefer not to answer/do not know” for any of the covariates were assigned to a separate category for that covariate. the proportion of data that was assigned as missing or prefer not to answer/do not know was <UNK> for each covariate, with the exception of education <UNK> in secondary analyses, dietary factors significantly associated with the risk of kidney stones in the main analyses were included as covariates in order to explore whether mutual adjustment for dietary factors affected previously observed associations. to account for reverse causation, participants who were censored within the first <UNK> yr of follow-up were excluded

and a range of dietary factors were associated with the risk of developing a first incident kidney stone. these results provide further evidence that diet is a potentially important modifiable factor for the prevention of kidney stone formation. similar to meta-analyses of previous observational studies, we found a linear dose-response reduction in the risk of kidney stones with increasing amount of fluid intake <UNK> when compared with fluid intake of zero to six glasses per day (approximately <UNK> l), individuals who drank <UNK> glasses or more (equivalent to <UNK> l) had a <UNK> reduced risk of developing kidney stones. this level of fluid intake is similar to that administered in trials, which have found that increased fluid intake decreases the recurrence of kidney stones <UNK> international guidelines recommend that patients with kidney stones should increase their fluid intake to achieve a urine volume of <UNK> l/d in order to reduce stone recurrence <UNK> in our study, the reduction in risk with total fluid intake was primarily due to tea, coffee, and alcohol, which is consistent with the findings of a recent meta-analysis <UNK> however, in contrast with the findings from the meta-analysis, we found no association between water intake and kidney stone risk, which suggests that specific beverages may have differential effects on kidney stone formation, and that beverages that exert a diuretic effect (thereby causing urine dilution) or that contain caffeine may be of particular relevance. with regard to other dietary factors, we found that higher meat intake was associated with an increased risk of kidney stones; however, previous prospective studies that have focused mainly on animal protein intake have produced inconsistent findings <UNK> two

stones <UNK> it is possible that fruit might reduce the risk through increased urinary citrate (even from noncitrus fruit) and/or its relatively high fibre content <UNK> strengths of the current study are the large sample size, wide range of measures available on dietary factors and possible confounders, and cohort-wide linkage to longitudinal data on hospital inpatient admissions. however, this does mean that patients who seek treatment solely through primary care or who do not seek any medical attention are not captured. whilst this will lead to an underascertainment of cases, it is unlikely that the association with dietary factors differ markedly between those cases seeking hospital treatment and those who do not. the availability of detailed data on dietary intake from multiple <UNK> recall questionnaires (oxford webq) suggests that total fluid intake corresponded well with categories as defined by the baseline ffq, providing assurances that the latter is a robust indicator of overall fluid intake. the use of updated data from the oxford webq meant that we could take into account random error caused by changes in diet over time and/or measurement error of the ffq, whilst the ffq used in uk biobank has been shown to be a well-established and reliable tool <UNK> it does not enable an accurate estimation of nutrient intake, and hence we were unable to test the association specifically with intake of dietary calcium or animal protein, nor could we take into account other dietary factors that may be relevant for stone disease (eg,types of soft drinks or juice) <UNK> we also had insufficient information to explore dietary patterns, and hence were not able to investigate the hypothesis that a dash- or mediterranean-style diet is associated with a lower kidney stone risk <UNK> as many patients diagnosed with a first kidney stone may modify their diet (eg, by increasing fluid intake) based on medical advice after their initial diagnosis, our intention was not to assess the dietary determinants of kidney stone recurrence, but rather the extent to which dietary factors influence the risk of developing a first incident kidney stone. however, in order to examine whether our findings might have been caused by reverse causation, whereby participants experiencing symptoms may have changed their diet (eg, by drinking more fluids) prior to being admitted to hospital with a kidney stone, we excluded a fig. <UNK> – cox proportional hazards models investigating the association between intake of other dietary factors and the risk of developing

changed their diet in the last <UNK> yr due to illness. we also excluded participants who were diagnosed within <UNK> yr of baseline and the results were not materially altered. there are some other limitations to this study. no information was available on stone composition (such as uric acid, calcium oxalate), and hence it was not possible to investigate whether dietary factors differentially affect the development of stone subtypes. whilst we were able to take into account a wide range of potential confounders that did not make an appreciable difference to the risk estimates, confounding by other factors remains a possibility and causality cannot be inferred based on these findings. <UNK> conclusions increased fluid intake, as well as consumption of fruit and foods high in fibre, was associated with a lower risk of developing a first kidney stone, whilst higher meat consumption and salt intake were associated with a higher risk. the lower risk of kidney stones observed for tea, coffee, and alcohol, but not water, might reflect a potential diuretic effect and warrants further investigation. overall, this study suggests that the risk of kidney stones could be decreased through relatively simple dietary modifications.

fruits and vegetables (< <UNK> servings/week, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ≥ <UNK> servings/week, unknown), and red and processed meat <UNK> servings/week, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> servings/week, unknown). we also restricted the analysis to those with a university or college degree, and separately, to those who do not have a job that usually or always involves standing or walking or manual work. we also examined mean bmi and body fat percentage in <UNK> year age categories. for each age decade separately (ie, participants <UNK> years, <UNK> years and <UNK> years) linear regression was used to calculate mean body fat percentage in single units of bmi, and to calculate mean bmi and body fat percentage in each category of physical activity <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> excess met-hours per week). to explore the repeatability of self-reported physical activity, including effects of measurement error and possible changes in activity over time, we used a subsample of <UNK> <UNK> uk biobank participants who were eligible for the current study and who completed a repeat assessment visit <UNK> years after recruitment (see online supplementary tables <UNK> and <UNK> for these participants, we calculated excess met-hours per week from their answers to the touchscreen questionnaire completed at the repeat assessment centre visit, as described above. then for each category of excess met-hours per week defined at baseline, we calculated the mean excess met-hours per week at their baseline visit (to assess comparability of the subsample with the full cohort) and the mean excess met-hours per week at the repeat visit (to assess measurement error in reporting physical activity and change over time). the subsample of participants who completed a repeat assessment centre visit <UNK> years after recruitment was similar at baseline to the full cohort with regard to reported physical activity. however, at the repeat assessment, for participants in the highest category of physical activity defined at baseline <UNK> excess met-hours per week), the mean excess met-hours/week was much lower than at baseline <UNK> compared with <UNK> for men and women). for the lowest category of physical activity defined at baseline, the mean excess met-hours/week was somewhat higher at the repeat assessment than at baseline <UNK> compared with <UNK> for men and women). overall, this represents regression to the mean of almost <UNK> (calculated from the ratio of the range of mean values at the repeat assessment to the range of mean values at baseline). the pearson's correlation coefficients between recruitment and repeat measurements of bmi and body fat percentage in the subsample of participants who completed a repeat assessment centre visit were <UNK> for both bmi and body fat percentage. supplementary data all p values were two sided and <UNK> was considered statistically significant. results participant flow is shown in figure <UNK>

categories of physical activity were slightly larger and the differences in body fat percentage were slightly smaller with older age (see online supplementary figures <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> discussion in this large sample of middle-aged british men and women, more physical activity was associated with a lower bmi and a lower body fat percentage, although even men and women who did the most physical activity were, on average, overweight. more physical activity was also associated with a lower body fat percentage within each category of bmi, with an average <UNK> percentage points lower body fat in the most active, compared with the least active individuals. most of the difference in body fat percentage with physical activity was between the very low and moderately high levels of physical activity <UNK> and <UNK> excess met-hours per week, respectively); there was relatively little difference in body fat percentage between moderately high and very high levels of physical activity <UNK> and <UNK> excess met-hours per week, respectively). the current study is large, and height and weight were measured by trained staff using standardised techniques. we examined whether important lifestyle factors (diet quality, education and job type) which varied by physical activity level might modify the associations between physical activity, bmi and body fat percentage. in each of these sensitivity analyses, the results were essentially unchanged, although because this is an observational study we cannot rule out confounding by other factors. a limitation of the study is that physical activity was self-reported. analysis of the subsample who had a repeat measurement of physical activity <UNK> years after baseline indicates <UNK> regression to the mean, which represents the error in reporting physical activity and true changes in physical activity over time. the likely consequence of regression to the mean in physical activity levels over time is bias of associations towards the null, so that the true association between physical activity and body composition measures is likely to be stronger than that observed in this study. participants were not given any specific instructions prior to body fat measurement. hydration status, exercise and food consumption can have small effects on body fat values measured by bioimpedance; had these factors been standardised between participants, we may have seen slightly stronger associations between body fat percentage and physical activity. the study is cross-sectional, and therefore we can only show associations between reported physical activity and contemporaneous body composition. we cannot infer cause and effect: lower levels of physical activity may lead to greater adiposity, but it is also possible that increased adiposity leads to less physical activity. previous small studies <UNK> in young athletic populations have found inverse relationships between measures of physical fitness and bmi and body fat <UNK> <UNK> small studies <UNK> in young adults have also shown that, for a given bmi, athletes have a lower body fat percentage than <UNK> <UNK> these findings are, however, of limited relevance to older adults in the general population, who experience the highest burden of obesity-related disease. an analysis of <UNK> <UNK> participants in the china kadoorie biobank, aged <UNK> years, found relatively weak associations between physical activity and either bmi or body fat percentage: a difference of <UNK> total met-hours per week was associated with <UNK> <UNK> lower bmi, and <UNK> percentage points lower body <UNK> participants in the china kadoorie biobank differed from those in uk biobank in ethnicity and lifestyle, and also had a lower average bmi <UNK> (sd <UNK> <UNK> in men; <UNK> (sd <UNK> <UNK> in women). their physical activity levels were comparable with the middle to upper range of physical activity of uk biobank participants, and in this range we also saw only a small difference in body fat percentage. variation in bmi in the general population is largely due to differences in body fatness, but by definition it incorporates adipose and lean body mass, and it is therefore difficult to disentangle the roles of adipose and lean mass in associations of bmi with health outcomes. for example, a higher bmi is an established risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer, and probably increases risk through higher circulating sex hormones produced by the enzyme aromatase in the adipose tissue from precursor <UNK> several cohort studies have also shown that more physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, even after adjustment for bmi, and this finding is often taken as evidence that physical activity is independent of adiposity as a risk factor for postmenopausal breast <UNK> our results suggest, however, that adjustment for bmi may not have fully controlled for adiposity in these analyses. in conclusion, in this sample of middle-aged british adults who were free from self-reported long-standing illness, men and women who reported doing the most physical activity had a lower bmi and a lower body fat percentage than those who reported doing the least physical activity. we also report new evidence that, for a given bmi, men and women who reported doing more physical activity had a lower body fat percentage; the greatest difference was observed between low and moderate levels of physical activity. bmi incorporates adipose and lean mass, but is most strongly related to adiposity, and consequently is associated with morbidity and mortality from a wide range of diseases. however, to disentangle the possible effects of physical activity and adiposity on disease risk, future research should focus on more specific measures of adiposity.

a prospective investigation of body size, body fat composition and colorectal cancer risk in the uk biobank go to: abstract obesity has been consistently associated with a greater colorectal cancer risk, but this relationship is weaker among women. in the uk biobank, we investigated the associations between body size (body mass index [bmi], height, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio) and body fat composition (total body fat percentage and trunk fat percentage) measurements with colorectal cancer risk among <UNK> men and women followed for <UNK> years on average. multivariable hazard ratios (hrs) and <UNK> confidence intervals <UNK> for developing colorectal cancer <UNK> incident cases) were estimated using cox proportional hazards models. among men, when the highest and lowest fifths were compared, bmi (hr = <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ptrend < <UNK> waist circumference (hr = <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ptrend < <UNK> waist-to-hip ratio (hr = <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ptrend < <UNK> total body fat percentage (hr = <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ptrend = <UNK> and trunk fat percentage (hr = <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ptrend = <UNK> were associated with greater colorectal cancer risk. for women, only waist-to-hip ratio (hr for highest versus lowest fifth = <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ptrend = <UNK> was positively associated with colorectal cancer risk. greater body size (overall and abdominal adiposity) was positively associated with colorectal cancer development in men. for women, abdominal adiposity, rather than overall body size, was associated with a greater colorectal cancer risk. go to: introduction a substantial body of evidence has shown that excess adiposity is associated with a greater risk of developing colorectal cancer. a meta-analysis of <UNK> cohort studies reported that a <UNK> <UNK> increment in body mass index (bmi) was associated with greater risk of developing colon cancer in both sexes, but that this relationship was weaker among women (relative risk [rr] = <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> <UNK> compared to men (rr = <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the same meta-analysis, bmi (per <UNK> <UNK> increment) was related to rectal cancer risk for men (rr = <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but not women (rr = <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> potential reasons for a weaker relationship between adiposity and colorectal cancer among women compared to men are not clear. it has been suggested that hormone replacement therapy (hrt) use, which has been consistently associated with lower risk of developing colorectal <UNK> may counteract the detrimental effects of excess adiposity on colorectal <UNK> support for this hypothesis was provided by the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition (epic) study which found that larger waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio were associated with a greater risk of developing colon cancer among non-hrt users only, with no relationship observed for hrt <UNK> however, inconsistent findings have been reported in other studies which have investigated whether hrt use modified the relationship between obesity and colorectal <UNK> additional studies with large numbers of incident cases are required to investigate how adiposity relates to colorectal cancer risk among users and non-users of hrt. body fat composition measurements that distinguish between adipose and non-adipose mass can be estimated using bioelectrical impedance. such technologies, however, have previously been unavailable in large-scale prospective cohort studies so it is uncertain how body fat composition parameters relate to colorectal cancer development. in the current analysis, we prospectively investigated the associations between colorectal cancer risk and body size (bmi, body weight, height, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio) and body fat composition (total body fat percentage and trunk fat percentage) measurements in the uk biobank study. the uk biobank is a large prospective cohort study including over <UNK> participants. the large number of incident colorectal cancer cases provided substantial statistical power to investigate the body size and colorectal cancer relationships according to hrt use, physical activity levels, and across colorectal cancer subsites. go to: materials and methods study participants the uk biobank aims to investigate the genetic, lifestyle, and environmental causes of a range of important <UNK> men (n = <UNK> and women (n = <UNK> aged <UNK> to <UNK> years who were registered with the nhs between <UNK> and <UNK> were recruited in <UNK> study centres across the uk. ethical approval for the uk biobank was obtained from the north west multi-centre research ethics committee (reference number <UNK> the national information governance board for health and social care in england and wales, and the community health index advisory group in scotland. all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of these approvals. at recruitment all participants gave informed consent to participate in uk biobank and be followed-up, using a signature capture device. during the baseline recruitment visit, participants were asked to complete a touchscreen self-administered questionnaire, which included questions on socio-demographics (including age, education and townsend deprivation score), health and medical history, lifestyle exposures (including smoking habits, dietary intakes, physical activity, and alcohol consumption), early life exposures, and medication use. exclusions prior to the onset of analyses included: participants with prevalent cancer at recruitment (n = <UNK> and those with missing body size and composition measurements (n = <UNK> therefore, our analysis included <UNK> participants <UNK> men and <UNK> women). body size and composition measurements at the baseline assessment centre visit, trained staff used standard procedures to collect and record the body size and composition measurements. body weight was measured using the tanita <UNK> body composition analyser. participants were asked to remove their shoes and heavy outer clothing before <UNK> height was measured in a barefoot standing position using the saca <UNK> device. bmi was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in metres. waist circumference and hip circumference were measured using the wessex non-stretchable sprung tape measurement. waist-to-hip ratio was calculated by dividing waist circumference by hip circumference. the tanita <UNK> body composition analyzer (tanita, tokyo, japan) was used to assess bioelectrical impedance measures including total body fat percentage, and trunk fat percentage. colorectal cancer case ascertainment cancer cases within the uk biobank cohort were identified through linkage to national cancer registries. complete follow-up was available through <UNK> november <UNK> for england and wales and <UNK> december <UNK> for scotland. cancer incidence data were coded using the <UNK> revision of the international classification of diseases <UNK> proximal colon cancer included those within the caecum, appendix, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, and splenic flexure <UNK> distal colon cancer included those within the descending <UNK> and sigmoid <UNK> colon. overlapping <UNK> and unspecified <UNK> lesions of the colon were also included. cancer of the rectum included cancer occurring at the rectosigmoid junction <UNK> and rectum <UNK> statistical analysis hazard ratios (hrs) and <UNK> confidence intervals (cis) were estimated using cox proportional hazards models. age was the primary time variable in all models. time at entry was age at recruitment. exit time was age at whichever of the following came first: colorectal cancer diagnosis, death, or the last date at which follow-up was considered complete. models were stratified by age at recruitment in <UNK> categories, townsend deprivation index fifths, and region of the recruitment assessment centre. possible non-proportionality was assessed using an analysis of schoenfeld <UNK> with no evidence of nonproportionality being detected. the associations between body size and body fat composition measurements with risks of colorectal cancer, colon cancer, proximal colon cancer, distal colon cancer, and rectal cancer were analysed separately for men and women. heterogeneity of associations across anatomical cancer subsites was assessed by calculating <UNK> statistics. participants were grouped into sex-specific fifths of bmi, body weight, height, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, total body fat percentage, and trunk fat percentage. in additional analyses, each body size and composition measurement was modelled on the continuous scales (bmi [per <UNK> <UNK> increase], body weight [per <UNK> kg increase], height [per <UNK> cm increase], waist circumference [per <UNK> cm increase], waist-to-hip ratio [per <UNK> increase], total body fat percentage [per <UNK> increase], and trunk fat percentage [per <UNK> increase]), and bmi was also modelled according to predefined categories <UNK> <UNK> [reference group], <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the multivariable models were adjusted for physical activity (metabolic equivalent tasks [met] hours/week; fifths), smoking status and intensity (never; former; current <UNK> cigarettes/day]; current <UNK> cigarettes/day]; current [intensity unknown]; unknown), alcohol consumption frequency (never; special occasions only; <UNK> times/month; <UNK> times/week; <UNK> times/week; daily or almost daily; unknown), family history of colorectal cancer (no; yes; unknown), prevalent diabetes (no; yes; unknown), regular aspirin/ibuprofen use (no; yes; unknown), qualifications (none; national exams at age <UNK> years [cses/o-levels/gcses or equivalent]; vocational qualifications [nvq/hnd/hnc] or optional national exams at ages <UNK> to <UNK> years [a-levels/as-levels or equivalent]; other professional qualifications; college/university degree; unknown), ever use of hrt (no, yes, unknown), and frequency of red and processed meat consumption <UNK> times/week; <UNK> times/week; <UNK> times/week; <UNK> times/week; unknown). trend tests across body size and composition measurement fifths were calculated by assigning the median value of each category and modelling as continuous terms in cox regression models. the body size and colorectal cancer associations were further assessed across subgroups of ever hrt use, menopausal status (pre-menopausal and post-menopausal), prevalent diabetes (no or yes), and physical activity levels (met hours/week; thirds). interaction terms (multiplicative scale) between these variables and body size were included in separate models; the statistical significance of the cross-product terms were evaluated using the likelihood ratio test. to evaluate possible reverse causality, cases diagnosed within the first two years of follow-up were excluded in sensitivity analyses. statistical tests used in the analysis were all two-sided and a pvalue of <UNK> was considered statistically significant.

measurements were positively related to colorectal cancer risk among men. for women, only greater abdominal adiposity was associated with elevated colorectal cancer risk, and this relationship did not differ by hrt use. our finding that bmi was positively related to colorectal cancer risk for men is in accordance with a large body of epidemiological <UNK> for women, we observed no association between bmi and colorectal cancer development, which is inconsistent with a recent analysis from the million women’s study (n = <UNK> <UNK> and two meta-analyses of <UNK> individual prospective <UNK> this suggests that the null finding we observed between bmi and colorectal cancer among women may be the consequence of insufficient follow-up time and recorded case numbers that are necessary to detect the weak-to-moderate strength association which has previously been reported. we found that greater abdominal adiposity measurements were positively related to colorectal cancer risk in men and women, findings consistent with the epic study and meta-analyses of prospective <UNK> but inconsistent with the findings from a national institutes of health (nih)-aarp diet and health study analysis that reported positive associations for waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio for men, but null relationships for <UNK> this was the first large-scale study to investigate how body fat composition measurements relate to colorectal cancer risk. analyses of total body fat percentage and colorectal cancer revealed similar relationships to those observed for bmi. for men, greater total body fat percentage was associated with elevated risks of developing colorectal cancer and colon cancer, a finding in that is in accordance with results from a swedish cohort study which reported a rr of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> p-trend = <UNK> for colorectal cancer (n = <UNK> cases) when the highest and lowest fourths were <UNK> for women, we observed a null relationship between colorectal cancer risk and total body fat percentage, a result consistent with a sub-study of <UNK> post-menopausal women (n = <UNK> cases) from the women’s health <UNK> for trunk fat percentage, we found a positive relationship with colorectal cancer and colon cancer risk for men, and null associations for women. in general, our results for body fat composition were consistent with our findings for body size measurements. it is not known why the positive relationships between adiposity and colorectal cancer are weaker and more inconsistent for women. one proposed explanation, is that greater exposure to estrogens in women may mitigate the potential tumorigenic effects of excess adiposity on the <UNK> experimental and epidemiological studies suggest that estrogens are potentially protective against the development of colorectal <UNK> while in observational studies, ever use of hrt has been consistently associated with lower colorectal cancer <UNK> in the epic study, abdominal adiposity was only associated with greater colon cancer risk among non-hrt users, with no relationship observed for hrt <UNK> however, in the current uk biobank study, we found no evidence that hrt use modified the abdominal adiposity and colorectal cancer relationship, as we observed consistent positive relationships among users and never users of hrt. there is evidence that the different formulations of hrt (e.g. estrogen only or estrogen plus progestin) may have distinct associations with colorectal cancer <UNK> we did not have information on the formulation of hrt used which may explain why we did not observe effect modification of the abdominal adiposity and colorectal cancer relationship by hrt use. nonetheless, it remains possible that higher endogenous circulating levels of estrogens found in women may lessen the impact of adiposity on colorectal cancer development. most recently, a case-control analysis nested within the women’s health initiative found that higher levels of endogenous circulating estradiol and estrone were associated with a lower colorectal cancer risk in post-menopausal women who were non-hrt <UNK> in the same study, the positive waist circumference and colorectal cancer relationship was strengthened, and became statistically significant, after the multivariable models were additionally adjusted for endogenous circulating estrogen <UNK> this suggests that higher endogenous circulating estrogen concentrations may mask the body size and colorectal cancer relationship in post-menopausal women, and that future studies investigating how adiposity relates to colorectal cancer development in post-menopausal women should incorporate estrogen measurements to limit the effects of this confounding <UNK> the biological mechanisms that underlie the relationship between adiposity and colorectal cancer development are uncertain. adiposity is associated with metabolic and endocrinologic abnormalities, such as alterations in insulin and insulin-like growth factor signalling. experimental and epidemiological evidence indicate that hyperinsulinemia and elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor- <UNK> <UNK> may promote colorectal tumorigenesis by stimulating mitogenesis and inhibiting <UNK> excess body weight is considered a chronic inflammatory state characterised by increased adipose secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as <UNK> <UNK> which has been shown to promote tumour initiation in experimental <UNK> higher adiposity is also inversely related to the secretion of adiponectin, an adipose tissue secreted adipokine which has been shown to lower secretion of inflammatory cytokines, improve insulin sensitivity, and inhibit cell growth and <UNK> in epidemiological studies, higher adiponectin levels have, in general, been associated with lower colorectal cancer <UNK> the current analysis represents one of the largest single studies investigating the relationships between body size and composition with colorectal cancer risk to date. this was the first time that bioelectrical impedance measurements, that distinguish between adipose and non-adipose mass, have been used on such a large-scale to assess how total body fat percentage and trunk fat percentage relate to colorectal cancer development. the large number of incident colorectal cancer cases allowed analyses by hrt use, physical activity levels, diabetes status, menopausal status, and tumour anatomical site, and the detailed phenotypic information collected from uk biobank participants enabled us to carefully adjust for known colorectal cancer risk factors. a limitation of our analysis is that body size and composition measurements were collected from all participants on one occasion; however, with an average follow-up of <UNK> years it is unlikely that body measurements would have changed markedly during this time to substantially alter our results. in conclusion, in this prospective analysis of uk biobank participants, which used the most comprehensive panel of anthropometric measurements of any study to date, greater body size (overall and abdominal adiposity) was positively associated with colorectal cancer development in men. for women, abdominal adiposity, rather than overall body size, was associated with a greater colorectal cancer risk, and this relationship was unaffected by hrt use. the null result observed for the bmi and colorectal cancer among women may have been a consequence of insufficient follow-up time and recorded case numbers to detect the weak-to-moderate strength association which has previously been reported. our findings add to the large body of evidence which supports the promotion of weight control in population-wide cancer prevention programmes.

organic food consumption and the incidence of cancer in a large prospective study of women in the united kingdom abstract background: organically produced foods are less likely than conventionally produced foods to contain pesticide residues. methods: we examined the hypothesis that eating organic food may reduce the risk of soft tissue sarcoma, breast cancer, non-hodgkin lymphoma and other common cancers in a large prospective study of <UNK> <UNK> middle-aged uk women. women reported their consumption of organic food and were followed for cancer incidence over the next <UNK> years. cox regression models were used to estimate adjusted relative risks for cancer incidence by the reported frequency of consumption of organic foods. results: at baseline, <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of women reported never, sometimes, or usually/always eating organic food, respectively. consumption of organic food was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of all cancer <UNK> <UNK> cases in total) (rr for usually/always vs <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval (ci): <UNK> soft tissue sarcoma <UNK> <UNK> ci: <UNK> or breast cancer <UNK> <UNK> ci: <UNK> but was associated for non-hodgkin lymphoma <UNK> <UNK> ci: <UNK> conclusions: in this large prospective study there was little or no decrease in the incidence of cancer associated with consumption of organic food, except possibly for non-hodgkin lymphoma. main organic food production involves avoiding artificial fertilisers and pesticides and using crop rotation and other forms of husbandry to maintain soil fertility, control weeds and diseases. all food sold as organic in the united kingdom must be certified as organic by approved organic control bodies (defra, <UNK> the market for organic foods in the united kingdom has grown rapidly during the last <UNK> years: sales of organic food products totalled <UNK> million in <UNK> and over <UNK> billion at the peak of the market growth in <UNK> (soil association, <UNK> <UNK> since <UNK> sales of organic food in the united kingdom have declined slightly, but still account for a significant share of the market (defra <UNK> soil association, <UNK> dairy and ‘chilled convenience’ products and fresh fruit and vegetables are the most commonly purchased organic products (soil association, <UNK> the main reason for consumers to buy organic food is because they believe it to be healthier (soil association, <UNK> a systematic review on organic food (smith-spangler et al, <UNK> compared pesticide residues between organic and conventional crops, and found that organic foods were less likely to be contaminated with any detectable pesticide residue. this review (smith-spangler et al, <UNK> and another (dangour et al, <UNK> also compared the nutrient composition of organically and conventionally produced crops and found little difference for most nutrients, except a higher content of phosphorus in organic foods. occupational pesticide exposure has been linked, albeit not conclusively, with a higher risk of certain cancers, particularly non-hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and breast cancer (dich et al, <UNK> mostafalou and abdollahi, <UNK> smith-spangler et al <UNK> noted a dearth of studies examining organic food consumption in relation to health outcomes, and to our knowledge, no study has investigated organic food consumption in relation to cancer risk. in this study we investigated the relationship between the reported frequency of consumption of organic food and subsequent cancer incidence, overall and for <UNK> individual cancer sites or types in a large prospective study of middle-aged women in the united kingdom. materials and methods participants and data in <UNK> <UNK> million middle-aged women who had been invited for breast cancer screening at screening centres throughout england and scotland joined the million women study by completing a study questionnaire and by giving written consent. women have been re-surveyed about <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> years after recruitment. full details of the study design and methods are described elsewhere (the million women study collaborative group, <UNK> and study questionnaires can be viewed at www.millionwomenstudy.org. all study participants are flagged on the national health service central registers, so that cancer registrations and deaths are routinely notified to the study investigators by the office for national statistics, england and the information services division, scotland. this information includes the date of each such event and codes the site and morphology of the cancer according to the international classification of diseases <UNK> and <UNK> the study was approved by the oxford and anglia multi-centre research ethics committee. baseline data on the consumption of organic food at the <UNK> survey, completed in <UNK> on average, women were asked ‘do you eat organic food?’ with four possible categorical responses: ‘never, sometimes, usually, and always.’ women were also asked if they had changed their diet because of illness in the previous <UNK> years. the same questions were asked at the <UNK> survey. statistical analysis the baseline for follow-up for this analysis was the <UNK> survey when organic food consumption was first reported. the end of follow-up for cancer incidence was <UNK> december <UNK> eligible women contributed person-years from baseline until the date of registration with the cancer of interest, date of death, date of emigration, or end of follow-up, whichever was soonest. in addition, women diagnosed with any cancer other than the cancer of interest (except non-melanoma skin cancer) during the follow-up period were censored at the date of diagnosis of that cancer. we examined cancer incidence in relation to frequency of consumption of organic food for all cancers combined (except non-melanoma skin cancer) and for <UNK> of the most common cancer sites or types of cancer: oral cavity and pharynx <UNK> oesophagus <UNK> stomach <UNK> colorectum <UNK> pancreas <UNK> lung <UNK> malignant melanoma <UNK> breast <UNK> endometrium <UNK> ovary <UNK> kidney (renal cell carcinoma) <UNK> bladder <UNK> brain <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> non-hodgkin lymphoma <UNK> multiple myeloma <UNK> and leukaemia <UNK> we also examined the incidence of soft tissue sarcoma <UNK> in relation to the frequency of consumption of organic food; this is a rare cancer but we analysed it because there was a prior hypothesis. at the <UNK> survey, <UNK> <UNK> women reported their consumption of organic food. we excluded women diagnosed with any cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer <UNK> before baseline or who reported having changed their diet because of illness within the <UNK> years before baseline <UNK> <UNK> excluded). for analyses of endometrial cancer, women who had a hysterectomy were excluded <UNK> <UNK> excluded). for analyses of ovarian cancer, women who had a bilateral oophorectomy were excluded <UNK> <UNK> excluded). cox regression models using attained age as the underlying time variable were used to estimate relative risks for incident cancer by the reported frequency of consumption of organic foods at baseline. all analyses were stratified by age, geographical region <UNK> regions corresponding to the areas covered by the cancer registries), and socioeconomic status (in fifths, based on the townsend deprivation index (townsend et al, <UNK> analyses were adjusted for body mass index (bmi; <UNK> kg <UNK>

eaten (none, poultry only, and red or processed meat). we assigned women with missing data for these adjustment variables to a separate category. missing data accounted for <UNK> for any variable, except for bmi <UNK> and alcohol consumption <UNK> information on socioeconomic status, height, parity, strenuous physical activity, and age at menarche was collected from the recruitment survey. information on bmi, smoking status, alcohol consumption, fibre intake, and meat intake was collected from the <UNK> survey. to investigate reverse causality, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding the first <UNK> years of follow-up. analyses for breast cancer were additionally adjusted for hormone replacement therapy use (never, past, current, and not known) at baseline. for all cancers, we also restricted the analysis to women who reported never consuming organic food at baseline and at the <UNK> survey, compared with women who reported usually or always consuming organic food at both study time points. for individual cancer sites, relative risks are presented in the form of a plot, comparing women who usually/always ate organic food and women who sometimes ate organic food with women who never ate organic food. the position of the square indicates the value of the relative risk, and its area is inversely proportional to the variance of the logarithm of the risk in that group, indicating the amount of statistical information for that group alone. in figure <UNK> because more than two groups were compared, variances were estimated by treating the relative risks as floating absolute risks, yielding group-specific confidence intervals (g-s ci) (easton et al, <UNK> the method does not alter the relative risks but enables valid comparisons between any two exposure groups, even when neither group is the reference group. when only two categories are compared (as in the text), conventional confidence intervals are used. we also examined the risk of non-hodgkin lymphoma by the reported frequency of organic food consumption at baseline (usually/always vs never) according to sub-groups of socioeconomic status, bmi, smoking status and other factors. results in total, <UNK> <UNK> women reported their frequency of consumption of organic food at baseline, had not been diagnosed with any cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer) before baseline, and had not changed their diet because of illness in the last <UNK> years. at baseline, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of women reported never eating organic food, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> reported sometimes eating organic food, and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> reported usually or always eating organic food. table <UNK> shows characteristics of these women and information about follow-up. after a mean follow-up time of

found little evidence for a decrease in the incidence of all cancers associated with usually or always consuming organic food, except perhaps for non-hodgkin lymphoma. a systematic review comparing organic foods to conventional produce found that organic produce had a <UNK> lower risk for contamination with any detectable pesticide residue (smith-spangler et al, <UNK> in terms of health-related outcomes, the systematic review found that small cross-sectional <UNK> (curl et al, <UNK> and cross-over <UNK> (lu et al, <UNK> studies in children have shown significantly lower levels of organophosphate pesticide metabolites among children on organic diets compared with conventional diets. however, the review found no studies that have compared pesticide exposure among consumers of conventional compared with organic foods in adults. exposure to pesticides in the general population, excluding occupational and accidental exposure, is mainly via residues on food. regular testing of the food supply in the united kingdom is undertaken to monitor levels of chemical residues in foods. the concentration of pesticide residues found in foods is generally low. the latest available report from the pesticide residues committee, for the quarter ending december <UNK> shows that pesticide residues were detected in <UNK> of food samples tested, but were above the maximum permitted level in only <UNK> of the food samples (the expert committee on pesticide residues in food, <UNK> the international agency for research on cancer has classified some of the detected pesticides, such as ddt (international agency for research on cancer, <UNK> and chlorothalonil (international agency for research on cancer, <UNK> as possibly carcinogenic to humans. owing to a lack of data, some of the other pesticides that were detected are not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans (international agency for research on cancer, <UNK> some, but not all, epidemiological studies have shown a higher incidence of non-hodgkin lymphoma with occupational exposure to certain pesticides (baris and zahm <UNK> bassig et al, <UNK> these studies have been limited by small sample size and errors in obtaining accurate measurements of cumulative pesticide exposure. we found a <UNK> lower risk of non-hodgkin lymphoma in women who reported usually or always eating organic food compared with women who reported never eating organic food. this lowered risk remained after excluding the first <UNK> years of follow-up. the analyses were adjusted for a range of personal characteristics of women, including dietary fibre and meat intake. in addition, the associations for non-hodgkin lymphoma were similar within sub-groups of socioeconomic status, bmi, height, smoking, alcohol, exercise, fibre intake, red and processed meat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake. however, we performed multiple tests and therefore we cannot rule out chance as an explanation for this finding. epidemiological studies have reported higher risks of soft tissue sarcoma among farmers and forestry workers, and with exposure to herbicides and organochlorine compounds (dich et al, <UNK> our results showed no significant association between organic food consumption and risk of soft tissue sarcoma. however, only <UNK> cases of soft tissue sarcoma accrued during follow-up and we had limited power to detect an association with organic food consumption. small studies conducted in the early <UNK> suggested a link between pesticide exposure and increased risk of breast cancer (falck et al, <UNK> wolff et al, <UNK> although later studies have not confirmed this association (ingber et al, <UNK> our findings do not support the hypothesis that breast cancer risk might be reduced with lower pesticide exposure as we observed a slightly higher risk of breast cancer in women who usually or always ate organic food compared with women who never ate organic food. women who reported consuming organic food were of a higher socioeconomic status, consumed more alcohol, and on average had slightly lower parity than women who never ate organic food, and these factors are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. although we adjusted for nine potential confounding factors including alcohol and socioeconomic status, the relative risk of <UNK> could well be because of residual confounding. it is also possible that women who reported frequently consuming organic food are more likely to attend breast cancer screening and therefore are more likely to be diagnosed with screen-detected breast cancer, which could account for the slightly higher risk of breast cancer in those that reported usually or always consuming organic food. reporting of consumption of organic food at baseline remained reasonably stable <UNK> years later. never and usually/always were distinct groups at baseline with little overlap between them <UNK> years later. however, we do not have any information on how long women in our study had been consuming organic food before baseline. consumption of organic food was related to various factors including geographical region, with a slightly higher proportion of women in the south and south west of england reporting usually or always eating organic food compared with women in the north of england and scotland. consumption of organic food was also related to certain individual characteristics including smoking, exercise, and red and processed meat consumption. however, all analyses were adjusted for these potential confounders. this is a very large study with virtually complete follow-up and with detailed information on potentially important confounders including smoking, deprivation, reproductive and hormonal factors, body size, dietary factors, and other health indicators. approximately two-thirds of women in the million women study responded to the <UNK> survey and answered the question on organic food. the main differences between responders and non-responders to the <UNK> survey were the proportion of current smokers at recruitment <UNK> vs <UNK> and the proportion of women in the upper third of socioeconomic status at recruitment <UNK> vs <UNK> this would, however, not affect the comparisons here, especially as we adjust for smoking and socioeconomic status. a limitation of this study is that the frequency of organic food consumption was self-reported. however, there is likely to be a true difference in organic food consumption in the extreme frequency categories, that is, between those that reported never consuming organic food, and those that reported usually or always consuming organic food, and it is the comparison between these two groups that we have focussed on. in addition, we do not have information on the types of organic food eaten, such as fruits and vegetables, dairy products, or meat. uk sales data indicate that dairy and chilled convenience products account for <UNK> of the organic food market, and fruit and vegetables account for <UNK> of the organic market (soil association, <UNK> a systematic review on organic food found that organic fruit and vegetables are less likely to contain detectable pesticide residues (smith-spangler et al, <UNK> however, we did not test blood or tissue samples from our participants to confirm that women who reported usually or always consuming organic food had lower exposure to pesticides than those who reported never consuming organic food. as far as we are aware, this is the first cohort study to examine the association between the consumption of organic food and the risk of cancer, and is particularly relevant given that health concerns have been identified as the primary motivation for consumers’ purchase of organic food (hughner et al, <UNK> in summary, we did not find a reduced risk of cancer overall, or for <UNK> specific cancer sites or types among women who usually or always consume organic food. however, we did find a reduced risk of non-hodgkin lymphoma. replication of this result is needed but future prospective studies would need to be extremely large and to follow participants for long periods (e.g., a cohort of <UNK> <UNK> people followed for a decade) to have sufficient power to examine the association between organic food consumption and non-hodgkin lymphoma. blood markers of pesticide exposure could also be examined in relation to reported organic food consumption and risk of non-hodgkin lymphoma.

and follow-up procedures of epic has been described previously <UNK> briefly, between <UNK> and <UNK> approximately <UNK> participants, mostly aged between <UNK> and <UNK> years, were recruited from <UNK> centres in <UNK> european countries (denmark, france, germany, greece, italy, netherlands, norway, spain, sweden, and the uk). participants provided information on socio-demographic characteristics, dietary intakes, and lifestyle factors. the study was approved by the international agency for research on cancer ethics committee and local ethics committees in the participating countries. all participants gave written informed consent. selection of cases and controls in most centres, follow-up for cancer incidence and mortality was conducted via record linkage with regional and national registries. in france, germany, and greece, follow-up was by a combination of methods, including health insurance records, cancer and pathology registries and active follow-up through study subjects and their next-of-kin <UNK> cases were participants who were diagnosed with incident invasive melanoma of the skin (who international classification of diseases-oncology <UNK> edition <UNK> codes <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> digit behaviour code <UNK> signifying invasive malignancies) during follow-up, and who had donated a blood sample and had not been diagnosed with cancer (except for

study centre, sex, age at blood collection (± <UNK> year), and date (± <UNK> months), time of day (± <UNK> hours), and fasting status (< <UNK> hours, <UNK> to <UNK> hours, > <UNK> hours) at blood collection. the present study includes <UNK> cases and <UNK> controls <UNK> male cases and controls; <UNK> female cases and controls). laboratory measurements approximately <UNK> of participants provided a blood sample at recruitment <UNK> in most centres whole blood was transported to a local laboratory, processed within <UNK> hours, and transported to be stored centrally in liquid nitrogen at <UNK> at the international agency for research on cancer. in denmark, all blood samples were stored locally in nitrogen vapour at <UNK> and in sweden all blood samples were stored in electric freezers at <UNK> in the oxford cohort, samples were sent at ambient temperature to a central laboratory in norfolk, uk with a mean transit time of <UNK> days. igf-i concentration was measured in serum samples, except for the participants from norway and umeå (sweden), for which citrated plasma and edta plasma samples were used, respectively. igf-i concentration was measured in the cancer epidemiology unit (oxford, united kingdom) using the automated ids-isys immunoassay system from immunodiagnostic systems ltd (tyne & wear, uk) <UNK> laboratory personnel were blind to the case-control status of the samples and each case-control set was analysed in the same batch, together with duplicate quality control samples. the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <UNK> and <UNK> at an overall mean concentration of <UNK> nmol/l. statistical analyses all statistical analyses were run using stata version <UNK> (stata corp, college station, tx). participant characteristics were compared between cases and controls, for men and women separately, using the paired-sample t test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. igf-i concentration was logarithmically transformed (using the natural log transformation) to approximate a normal distribution. among controls only, geometric mean serum igf-i concentrations by participant characteristics were investigated using analysis of variance (anova), adjusted for batch, age at blood collection (as a continuous variable), sex, country, and alcohol intake. tests for linear trends across categories were performed by scoring categories with consecutive integers. odds ratios (ors) and <UNK> confidence intervals (cis) for melanoma by quintiles of sexspecific serum igf-i concentration at baseline (based on the sex-specific distributions in the controls) were estimated using conditional logistic regression, conditioned on the matching variables and. in the multivariable model, to allow for finer adjustment for age, the model was adjusted for age at blood collection (in months, as a continuous variable), as well as education (primary/none, secondary, degree), height (sex-specific quartiles), bmi (sexspecific quartiles), smoking status (never, former, current), alcohol intake <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> g/d), marital status (married/co-habiting, unmarried/not co-habiting), physical activity (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, active <UNK> and in women only, use of menopausal hormone therapy (current, not current). for all covariates, any missing values were assigned to a separate category. the odds of melanoma associated with a doubling of igf-i concentration were investigated as described above but using the logarithm to the base <UNK> of serum igf-i concentration. using conditional logistic regression, conditioning on the matching factors and adjusting for the covariates listed above (where relevant), we also examined the association between igf-i and melanoma subdivided by major participant characteristics: sex, age at blood collection (< <UNK> years, ≥ <UNK> years), bmi (< <UNK> <UNK> , ≥ <UNK> <UNK> ), height (sex-specific medians: < <UNK> cm (men) or < <UNK> cm (women), ≥ <UNK> cm (men) or ≥ <UNK> cm (women)), and age at case diagnosis (< <UNK> years, ≥ <UNK> years). in addition, to investigate the possibility of reverse causality we examined the association between igf-i and melanoma subdivided by time between blood collection and diagnosis (< <UNK> years, ≥ <UNK> years). finally, to explore whether igf-i may be differentially associated with sub-types of melanoma, we examined the association between igf-i and melanoma risk in categories of anatomical site (head and neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs) and histological sub-type (superficial spreading and nodular melanoma) of the tumour. for these analyses, controls were assigned to the same category as their matched case. for the bmi subgroup analysis, participants were only included if both the case and matched control had a bmi <UNK> <UNK> , or if both case and matched control had a bmi ≥ <UNK> <UNK> , with similar rules for the analyses subdivided by height and age at blood collection. tests for heterogeneity of risk between sub-groups were performed using the likelihood ratio test, comparing models with and without the interaction term between the logarithm of circulating igf-i concentration and the variable of interest. all statistical tests were two-sided, and <UNK> was considered statistically significant. results among men, cases were slightly taller, were more likely to have a university degree, and less likely to be current smokers, compared to the controls. among women, cases were also slightly taller, but were otherwise similar to controls with regards to the characteristics listed in table <UNK> among the cases, the mean time from blood collection to diagnosis was <UNK> years. among the controls, geometric mean igf-i concentrations were significantly lower in women, in those who were older at blood collection, and in those who drank the most alcohol (table <UNK> among women, current menopausal hormone therapy users had lower mean igf-i concentrations. the lowest concentrations of igf-i were in the <UNK> and <UNK> quartiles of bmi and the highest concentrations were in the <UNK> and <UNK> quartiles. circulating igf-i concentrations differed by country; participants from the netherlands had the highest mean igf-i concentrations. there was no significant association between serum igf-i concentrations and the risk of melanoma in either the basic model, or in the fully adjusted model, further adjusted for age at blood collection, education, height, bmi, smoking status, alcohol intake, marital status, physical activity, and use of menopausal hormone therapy. in the fully adjusted model, the or for a doubling in igf-i concentration was <UNK> <UNK> ci: <UNK> <UNK> (table <UNK> when we examined the associations in pre-specified sub-groups, we found no significant differences in associations by sex, age at blood collection, bmi, height, age at diagnosis, or years between blood collection and diagnosis, or by anatomical site or histological sub-type accepted of the tumour <UNK> for all subdivisions) (table <UNK> article this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved. discussion to the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to examine circulating concentration of igf-i measured in adulthood in relation to the risk of melanoma. we found no association overall, or for specific anatomical sites or histological sub-types of melanoma. furthermore, we found no evidence of heterogeneity in the association between circulating igf-i concentrations and risk of melanoma by sex, age at blood collection, bmi, height, age at diagnosis, or time between blood collection and diagnosis. three small case-control studies have examined circulating igf-i concentrations and risk of melanoma, but the findings were inconsistent <UNK> the reason for the inconsistency in the results of these case-control studies is unclear, but the selection of controls in a case-control study can bias the association between exposure and disease <UNK> in addition, the results of case-control studies may be influenced by reverse causation bias if the presence of disease affects circulating igf-i concentrations. laboratory work has indicated that the igf-i axis may play a role in melanoma progression; specifically, studies have reported that igf-i enhances survival and migration of melanoma cells in vitro <UNK> however, the present large prospective study did not find any relation between circulating igf-i concentrations and the risk of developing melanoma. the strengths of our study include the large sample size, and the nested-case control design, which allowed for the collection of blood samples before diagnosis of melanoma. a limitation of our study is that we did not have information on some of the major risk factors for melanoma – sun exposure, skin phototype, or family history of melanoma <UNK> – and therefore we were unable to adjust for these factors in our analysis. however, these factors would only distort the association of igf-i with melanoma if they were also associated with circulating igf-i concentrations. in a previous case-control study, adjusting for number of lifetime blistering sunburns, ability to tan and hair colour did not appreciably alter the association between igf-i and melanoma risk <UNK> in addition, in this study we used a single measure of circulating igf-i concentration, but previous work has shown good reproducibility of circulating igf-i concentrations over three (intra-class correlation <UNK> <UNK> and five <UNK> years <UNK> finally, more than <UNK> of circulating igfi is bound to igf binding protein <UNK> <UNK> and we did not measure igfbps in this study. igfbps may affect the bioavailability and signalling of igf-i, but the regulation of igf-i action by the igfbps is complex and not fully characterised <UNK> prospective studies of breast <UNK> and prostate cancer <UNK> have found positive associations with circulating igf-i concentrations and cancer risk, that were not changed after adjustment for the predominant binding protein, <UNK> in conclusion, in this large prospective study, which included a total of <UNK> cases of incident melanoma, we did not find any evidence that circulating igf-i concentration measured in adulthood was associated with the risk of melanoma.

consumption of meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs and risk of ischemic heart disease a prospective study of <UNK> incident cases among <UNK> <UNK> participants in the pan-european epic cohort abstract background: there is uncertainty about the relevance of animal foods to the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease (ihd). we examined meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs and risk for ihd in the pan-european epic cohort (european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition). methods: in this prospective study of <UNK> <UNK> men and women in <UNK> european countries, diet was assessed with validated questionnaires and calibrated with <UNK> recalls. lipids and blood pressure were measured in a subsample. during a mean of <UNK> years of follow-up, <UNK> participants had a myocardial infarction or died of ihd. the relationships of animal foods with risk were examined with cox regression with adjustment for other animal foods and relevant covariates. results: the hazard ratio (hr) for ihd was <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for a <UNK> increment in intake of red and processed meat, and this remained significant after exclusion of the first <UNK> years of follow-up (hr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> risk was inversely associated with intakes of yogurt (hr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> per <UNK> increment), cheese (hr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> per <UNK> increment), and eggs (hr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> per <UNK> increment); the associations with yogurt and eggs were attenuated and nonsignificant after exclusion of the first <UNK> years of follow-up. risk was not significantly associated with intakes of poultry, fish, or milk. in analyses modeling dietary substitutions, replacement of <UNK> kcal/d from red and processed meat with <UNK> kcal/d from fatty fish, yogurt, cheese, or eggs was associated with <UNK> lower risk of ihd. consumption of red and processed meat was positively associated with serum non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and systolic blood pressure, and consumption of cheese was inversely associated with serum non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. conclusions: risk for ihd was positively associated with consumption of red and processed meat and inversely associated with consumption of yogurt, cheese, and eggs, although the associations with yogurt and eggs may be influenced by reverse causation bias. it is not clear whether the associations with red and processed meat and cheese reflect causality, but they were consistent with the associations of these foods with plasma non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and for red and processed meat with systolic blood pressure, which could mediate such effects. clinical perspective what is new? we followed up the health of <UNK> <UNK> men and women in <UNK> european countries for <UNK> years to examine the relevance of intake of animal foods to the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease. higher consumption of red and processed meat was positively associated with the risk for ischemic heart disease. consumption of the other animal foods examined was not positively associated with risk; intakes of fatty fish, yogurt, cheese, and eggs were modestly inversely associated with risk. what are the clinical implications? higher intake of red and processed meat may increase the risk of ischemic heart disease. substituting other foods for red and processed meat may reduce the risk of ischemic heart disease. introduction ischemic heart disease (ihd) is the commonest disease and cause of death in <UNK> the risk of ihd is affected by diet, but there is uncertainty about the relevance of intake of animal foods such as red and processed meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, and eggs. meat and dairy products are major dietary sources of saturated fatty acids; in the united kingdom, for example, meat and meat products contribute <UNK> of saturated fat intake in adults, and milk and milk products contribute <UNK> controlled feeding trials have shown that high intakes of saturated fatty acids raise circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, an established risk factor for ihd, suggesting that higher intakes of foods rich in saturated fatty acids may increase the risk of <UNK> meta-analyses of previous prospective studies of meat and the incidence of fatal ihd have suggested that intake of processed meat may be associated with higher risk, whereas intake of unprocessed red meat might <UNK> for dairy products and eggs, systematic reviews of prospective studies have reported no consistent evidence that higher intakes are associated with a higher risk of <UNK> consumption of fatty fish might reduce the risk of ihd because it is a rich source of long-chain <UNK> fatty acids, and a meta-analysis has suggested an inverse association between overall fish consumption and mortality from <UNK> here, we report the relationships of these foods with the risk of ihd in epic (european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition), a cohort of half a million men and <UNK> to assess whether associations might be the result of reverse causation, we examined the results after excluding the first <UNK> years of follow-up. to assess whether associations might be explained by known metabolic risk factors for ihd, we examined the cross-sectional associations of food intake with cholesterol fractions and blood pressure in a subsample of participants, interpreting the relationships of foods with risk with respect to their associations with non–high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol and systolic blood pressure. methods because of the sensitive nature of the data collected for this study, requests to access the data set from qualified researchers trained in human subject confidentiality protocols may be sent to the international agency for research on cancer at http://epic.iarc.fr/access/index.php. study population epic is a prospective study of <UNK> <UNK> men and women recruited through <UNK> centers in <UNK> european countries, mostly between <UNK> and <UNK> participants in epic completed dietary and lifestyle questionnaires, and the majority also provided blood samples and had their blood pressure measured. the baseline data were centralized at the world health organization’s international agency for research on cancer in lyon, france. all participants gave written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the ethics review boards of the international agency for research on cancer and the institutions where participants were <UNK> dietary intake during the year before enrollment was measured by country-specific diet assessment methods, in most centers food frequency questionnaires; these were validated with a standardized, coordinated <UNK> dietary intakes estimated with a standardized and computerized <UNK> recall method were also collected from an <UNK> random sample across all centers <UNK> years after recruitment. the sample was stratified by age and sex, with weighting according to predicted disease rates in these strata, and distributed equally by season and day of the <UNK> details of the categorization of foods are given in the online-only data supplement. assessments of the nondietary variables were based on responses in the baseline questionnaires and categorized into the following groups: smoking (never, former, current <UNK> or unknown number of cigarettes per day, current <UNK> cigarettes per day, current <UNK> cigarettes per day, or unknown <UNK> of the cohort]); alcohol intake (not current drinker, sex-specific fifths of current intake: cut points in men were <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> g/d; cut points in women were <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> g/d); physical activity (cambridge physical activity index, based on occupational physical activity and cycling/other physical exercise and categorized in approximate quartiles called inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, active, and unknown <UNK> highest education level obtained (none or primary school only, secondary school, vocational qualification or university degree, unknown <UNK> employment status (currently employed or student, neither, unknown <UNK> and history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (each self-reported: yes, no, unknown <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> respectively]). body mass index (bmi;

smoking; self-reported history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia; physical activity; employment status; level of education; bmi (these last <UNK> covariates were all categorical variables, with unknown categories added); current alcohol consumption (categorical); and intakes of energy, fruit and vegetables, dietary fiber from cereals, and percent energy from sugars (each continuous). in the main analyses of calibrated food intakes, the results for each animal source food were also adjusted simultaneously for the other animal source foods. participants were divided into fifths of self-reported intake for each animal food according to the recruitment questionnaire (for any foods with <UNK> zero values, the categories were approximate fifths), with the quintiles calculated for all included participants, and a trend test was performed by scoring the categorical fifths of intake <UNK> to <UNK> and treating this as a continuous variable. to test for whether the data were compatible with a linear trend, we also fitted models with the fifths of intake treated as a categorical variable. there were no significant improvements in fit when we compared the categorical intake model with the continuous (trend test) intake model, suggesting that any associations between food intake and risk were approximately linear. then, to improve the comparability of dietary data across participating centers and to correct for measurement error in relative risk estimates, the dietary data from the subset of participants with <UNK> recalls were used to provide statistically calibrated estimates of dietary intakes for all included participants. hrs were calculated for increments in observed and calibrated intake of each food. observed food intakes were calibrated with a fixed-effect linear model in which center- and sex-specific <UNK> recall data from an <UNK> random sample of the cohort were regressed on the observed intakes, generating a calibrated intake corresponding to each observed <UNK> the sizes of the increments were chosen to approximate the difference in mean <UNK> recall intake between participants in the lowest and highest fifths of observed intake and with reference to the increments used in previous publications such the world health organization’s review of the carcinogenicity of red and processed <UNK> using the results from the mutually adjusted risks model, we estimated the effects of substituting <UNK> kcal/d of each other animal food for <UNK> kcal/d of red and processed meat from the ratios of the risk (as measured by the hr) for each food in turn and the risk for red and processed <UNK> for example, if p and r represent the hrs per <UNK> kcal/d yogurt and per <UNK> kcal/d red and processed meat in the mutually adjusted risks model, the effect of substituting <UNK> kcal/d yogurt for <UNK> kcal/d red and processed meat is estimated by the ratio p/r; the difference in covariance was used to estimate the <UNK> ci. to examine whether the overall results might be influenced by reverse causality, we repeated the analyses after excluding the first <UNK> years of follow-up (ie, with follow-up for all participants beginning <UNK> years after the date of recruitment). to examine whether associations between the animal foods and ihd risk were consistent across subgroups of other risk factors, we also conducted separate analyses for subsets of sex, smoking status (never, former, and current), prior disease status (participants with or without a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia), age at recruitment <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> years), bmi <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> european region (northern europe: denmark, norway, and sweden;

for red and processed meat, there was a large and highly significant association with risk in the countries with complete case verification but not in the other countries. for milk, there was a small positive association with risk in the countries with complete verification but not in the other countries. associations of foods with plasma lipids and blood pressure in a comparison of the participants in the highest fifth of intake of red and processed meat with those in the lowest fifth of such intake, non-hdl cholesterol was higher by <UNK> mmol/l <UNK> and systolic blood pressure was higher by <UNK> mm hg <UNK> for processed meat, the difference in systolic blood pressure between these groups of participants was <UNK> mm hg <UNK> comparing participants in the highest fifth of intake of cheese with those in the lowest fifth of such intake showed that non-hdl cholesterol was lower by <UNK> mmol/l, whereas the intake of cheese was unrelated to systolic blood pressure (see tables ix and x in the online-only data supplement). discussion in this large european cohort, we observed a positive association between red and processed meat intake and risk of ihd, with a <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> higher risk per <UNK> increment in calibrated intake. red and processed meat showed separate (albeit borderline significant) associations with risk, which were each of similar magnitude. the association of risk with red and processed meat was observed after exclusion of the first <UNK> years of follow-up and in participants without diabetes mellitus, elevated blood pressure, or proatherogenic lipids. these additional results therefore reduce the likelihood of reverse causation or residual confounding. in comparison, a previous meta-analysis of meat intake and risk of ihd reported that unprocessed red meat consumption was not associated with risk of ihd, whereas processed meat was, with a <UNK> higher risk per <UNK> increment in <UNK> however, that previous review included only <UNK> events from <UNK> studies for unprocessed red meat, including <UNK> case-control study; for processed meat, it included <UNK> <UNK> events from <UNK> studies, but most cases derived from <UNK> study for which the end point was total cardiovascular mortality rather than incident mi and fatal ihd. a subsequent meta-analysis also concluded that processed meat but not unprocessed red meat was associated with ihd mortality, on the basis of up to <UNK> deaths resulting from <UNK> hence, further work is needed to understand potential reasons for the differences in the results of the current study, which were based on <UNK> ihd events. we observed no clear association of ihd risk with consumption of either white fish or fatty fish (although there were a borderline significant inverse association for fatty fish and a significant inverse association for fatty fish in the substitution analyses; see below). the possible protective role of fish in ihd has been investigated for <UNK> years. a previous analysis of fish consumption and mortality in epic found no evidence that higher intakes of total, white, or fatty fish were associated with mortality from <UNK> in contrast, a meta-analysis of <UNK> deaths in <UNK> cohort studies suggested that there was an overall significant inverse association between fish intake and ihd mortality, but the association was not linear, and the relative risk in the highest category of fish intake was not significantly lower than that in the lowest <UNK> dairy products are a major source of dietary saturated fatty acids, but prospective observational studies have generally not shown a higher risk of ihd with a higher intake of foods such as milk, yogurt, and <UNK> we observed no association of milk with risk of ihd, which is consistent with a meta-analysis of <UNK> incident ihd cases in <UNK> prospective <UNK> we observed that yogurt consumption was inversely associated with risk of ihd. however, this association did not persist after exclusion of the initial <UNK> years of follow-up, and it showed heterogeneity by smoking status, with no association in never smokers (suggesting therefore that the observed association may partly be explained by changes in diet resulting from preclinical disease or residual confounding by smoking). yogurt consumption is associated with healthy dietary patterns, behaviors, and lifestyle <UNK> yet a meta-analysis of <UNK> prospective studies (number of cases unclear) reported no association between yogurt consumption and risk of <UNK> we also observed that cheese consumption was inversely associated with risk of ihd; again, this inverse association was not significant after we excluded the first <UNK> years of follow-up, although the estimate was only slightly attenuated. a meta-analysis of <UNK> prospective studies with <UNK> incident cases showed a lower risk for ihd in participants with a relatively high intake of <UNK> it has been suggested that cheese has constituents that might act to reduce the risk of ihd, for example, that the calcium in cheese forms insoluble soaps with fatty acids, thus reducing absorption of saturated fatty acids, and that the calcium also binds to bile acids, reducing their enterohepatic circulation and possibly leading to a cholesterol-lowering <UNK> egg consumption was inversely associated with ihd risk overall, but this association was no longer evident after exclusion of the first <UNK> years of follow-up, perhaps because of limited power or because people with preclinical disease may have reduced their egg consumption. a recent meta-analysis of <UNK> prospective studies including <UNK> incident cases reported no association of egg consumption with risk of coronary heart <UNK> whereas a recent large prospective study in china including <UNK> <UNK> incident cases of ihd reported that egg intake was inversely associated with <UNK> it is possible that the risk associations found in the observational studies resulted from the dietary pattern often accompanying high egg intake or the cluster of other risk factors in people with high egg <UNK> the positive association we observed between red and processed meat and risk of ihd might be related to the saturated fat content of these foods. however, although dairy products are also relatively rich in saturated fats, intake of dairy products was not positively related to ihd risk in this study; in fact there was a suggestion of an inverse association between cheese intake and future risk of ihd. this finding might suggest that different food sources of saturated fat and different proportions of individual saturated fatty acids contained within meat and dairy foods may differ in their impact on risk of ihd, which would affect the interpretation of previous studies of total dietary saturated fatty acids and <UNK> it is also possible that plant sources of protein may be associated with a lower risk of ihd than animal <UNK> and this should be considered in future analyses. substitution of other animal foods for red and processed meat our analyses showed that red meat and processed meat were positively associated with risk for ihd, whereas the other animal foods were not associated or were inversely associated with risk. we therefore conducted analyses modeling isocaloric dietary substitutions, which showed that fatty fish, yogurt, cheese, and eggs were associated with significantly lower risks for ihd when substituted for red and processed meat <UNK> lower risk per <UNK> kcal substituted per day). plant foods might also be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease than animal <UNK> and may be considered in future analyses. possible roles of plasma lipids and blood pressure the positive associations of red and processed meat and the inverse association of cheese consumption with the risk of ihd might be explained by the associations of these foods with well-established risk factors for ihd such as cholesterol fractions and systolic blood pressure. compared with participants in the lowest fifth of intake of red and processed meat, those in the top fifth had a higher non-hdl cholesterol by <UNK> mmol/l and a higher systolic blood pressure by <UNK> mm hg; the difference in systolic blood pressure was larger for processed meat than for red meat <UNK> and <UNK> mm hg, respectively), consistent with previous observations and possibly caused by the high salt content of most processed <UNK> on the basis of results from the emerging risk factors collaboration and the prospective studies <UNK> these differences would be expected to be associated with higher ihd risks of <UNK> and <UNK> respectively. such modeling suggests that the observed (uncalibrated) <UNK> higher risk in the top fifth of intake of red and processed meat could be readily explained by the differences in blood lipids and blood pressure. other mechanisms might also be involved; for example, higher intakes of red and processed meat might increase the risk of ihd through the conversion of carnitine in meat into trimethylamine <UNK> compared with participants in the lowest fifth of intake of cheese, those in the top fifth had lower non-hdl cholesterol by <UNK> mmol/l but no significant difference in systolic blood pressure. again on the basis of results from the prospective studies collaboration, this difference in lipids would be expected to be associated with a <UNK> lower ihd risk, indicating that the observed <UNK> lower ihd risk in the top fifth of intake of cheese might only partly be explained by standard lipid fractions. strengths and limitations strengths of this study are the large number of cases, the prospective design, the wide range of diets across europe, the calibration of the dietary data with <UNK> recalls, and the ability to adjust for major risk factors for ihd and to estimate the impacts of associations with circulating lipids and blood pressure. as with all observational studies, a potential limitation is that the associations may be influenced by confounding by other risk factors. we have adjusted our results for major risk factors for ihd, including smoking and bmi, as well as socioeconomic factors. however, because the magnitudes of the associations we observed were relatively modest, we cannot discount that the results have been influenced by residual confounding by adiposity, socioeconomic factors, or other unmeasured factors. another potential limitation is that, because of the multicenter design of the cohort, there were some variations in the ascertainment and validation of the end point; the positive association of red and processed meat with risk for ihd was strong in the countries with complete validation of cases. it is also possible that associations of specific foods with risk may vary between populations as a result of differences in associations with other aspects of diet. conclusions this large prospective study in europe shows a moderate positive association between consumption of red and processed meat and risk of ihd, and it suggests a modest inverse association between consumption of cheese and ihd risk. it is not clear whether these associations reflect causality, but they were consistent with the associations of these foods with plasma non-hdl cholesterol and for red and processed meat with systolic blood pressure, which could mediate such effects.

dietary assessment in uk biobank: an evaluation of the performance of the touchscreen dietary questionnaire abstract uk biobank is an open access prospective cohort of <UNK> <UNK> men and women. information on the frequency of consumption of main foods was collected at recruitment with a touchscreen questionnaire; prior to examining the associations between diet and disease, it is essential to evaluate the performance of the dietary touchscreen questionnaire. the objectives of the present paper are to: describe the repeatability of the touchscreen questionnaire in participants (n <UNK> <UNK> who repeated the assessment centre visit approximately <UNK> years after recruitment, and compare the dietary touchscreen variables with mean intakes from participants (n <UNK> <UNK> who completed at least one of the four web-based <UNK> dietary assessments post-recruitment. for fish and meat items, <UNK> % or more of participants reported the same or adjacent category of intake at the repeat assessment visit; for vegetables and fruit, and for a derived partial fibre score (in fifths), <UNK> % or more of participants were classified into the same or adjacent category of intake (κweighted > <UNK> for all). participants were also categorised based on their responses to the dietary touchscreen questionnaire at recruitment, and within each category the group mean intake of the same food group or nutrient from participants who had completed at least one web-based <UNK> dietary assessment was calculated. the comparison showed that the dietary touchscreen variables, available on the full cohort, reliably rank participants according to intakes of the main food groups. uk biobank is a prospective cohort of half a million men and women from across the uk. information on a broad range of exposures, including diet, was collected from the participants at an assessment centre, and linkage to cancer and death registries, as well as other medical records, enables many hypotheses to be <UNK> the uk biobank dataset is an open access resource; any bona fide researcher can apply to use the data for health-related research that is in the public <UNK> at recruitment, the touchscreen questionnaire used in uk biobank asked twenty-nine questions about diet, most of which gathered information about the average frequency of consumption of main foods and food groups over the past year. prior to using the data from the touchscreen questionnaire in diet–disease analyses, it is important to examine the reproducibility of the dietary questions. future studies in uk biobank may rank participants according to dietary intake from the touchscreen questionnaire and assess relative risk of disease across categories of intakes; misclassification in the ranking of participants according to dietary intakes will be expected to underestimate associations between diet and disease <UNK> using a subsample of approximately <UNK> <UNK> participants who completed a repeat of the assessment centre <UNK> about <UNK> years after recruitment, enables an examination of the combination of the variation in response to the questionnaire as well as true changes in intake over time, both of which contribute to misclassification of long-term dietary <UNK> the agreement between the touchscreen questionnaire, which asked about frequency of consumption, and a more detailed dietary assessment method which gathers information on actual amounts of food consumed, can be used to further evaluate the touchscreen dietary data. a web-based <UNK> dietary assessment <UNK> was also used in uk biobank to gather additional information on dietary intakes; over <UNK> <UNK> participants completed at least one <UNK> dietary assessment, and the mean intakes from the <UNK> dietary assessments can be used for this purpose. the objectives of the present paper are to describe the reproducibility of the touchscreen questions, using the subsample of participants who repeated the assessment centre visit, and to examine the agreement between the dietary touchscreen variables and the group mean intakes from the web-based <UNK> dietary assessments conducted on a large subsample of participants. dietary assessment touchscreen questionnaire the touchscreen questionnaire used in the main study contained twenty-nine questions about diet and eighteen questions about alcohol. the touchscreen questionnaire asked about the frequency of consumption over the past year of the following food groups: cooked vegetables, salad/raw vegetables, fresh fruit, dried fruit, oily fish, other fish, processed meats, poultry, beef, lamb, pork, cheese, salt added to food, tea, water, as well as questions on the type of milk most commonly consumed, type of spread most commonly consumed, number of slices and type of bread most commonly consumed, number of bowls and type of breakfast cereal most commonly consumed, cups of coffee and type most commonly consumed, as well as questions on the avoidance of specific foods and food groups (eggs, dairy products, wheat, sugar), age last ate meat (for participants who reported never consuming processed meats, poultry, beef, lamb or pork), temperature preference of hot drinks, changes in diet in the past <UNK> years, and variation in diet. four of the dietary questions used in the pilot study were altered slightly for the main phase: these were the questions on avoiding specific foods and food groups; spread type; bread type; and variation in diet. a total of <UNK> participants completed only the pilot version of the touchscreen; for analyses on these questions the participants answering only the pilot version were excluded. details of the possible answers for each dietary touchscreen question are given in the supplementary <UNK> we also generated a partial fibre score from the touchscreen questionnaire using the questions on fresh fruit, dried fruit, raw vegetables, cooked vegetables, bread type and bread intake, and breakfast cereal type and breakfast cereal intake. further detail on how we generated the partial score is given in the supplementary methods and supplementary table <UNK> web-based <UNK> dietary assessments in early <UNK> the main study protocol was modified to include a number of enhancements to the assessment centre <UNK> these enhancements included the oxford webq, a web-based <UNK> dietary assessment tool, which asks about the consumption of up to <UNK> types of foods and thirty-two types of drinks during the previous <UNK> h. the mean daily intakes of nutrients were calculated by multiplying the frequency of consumption of each food or drink by a standard portion size and the nutrient composition of that particular item. the web-based <UNK> dietary assessment has been compared with an interviewer-administered <UNK> recall completed on the same day, with spearman's correlation coefficients for the majority of nutrients calculated from the webq ranging between <UNK> and <UNK> (mean of <UNK> participants who were recruited between april <UNK> and september <UNK> completed the <UNK> dietary assessment at the assessment centre. in addition, after the recruitment period closed, an email was also sent out every <UNK> months a total of four times between february <UNK> and june <UNK> (online cycle <UNK> february <UNK> to april <UNK> online cycle <UNK> june <UNK> to september <UNK> online cycle <UNK> october <UNK> to december <UNK> online cycle <UNK> april <UNK> to june <UNK> to participants who had provided an email address at recruitment, inviting them to complete the oxford webq online using their own computer. the email invitations were sent on variable days of the week, and participants were given <UNK> d to complete it for cycles <UNK> and <UNK> and this was extended to <UNK> d for cycles <UNK> and <UNK> after which the link expired. for all analyses, we excluded <UNK> dietary assessments where the energy intakes were greater than <UNK> <UNK> kj for men <UNK> records from a total of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> %)), and <UNK> <UNK> kj for women <UNK> records from a total of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> %)). in a sensitivity analysis, we also excluded <UNK> dietary assessments where participants specified that their diet for that day was not typical because of fasting or illness; this did not have a large effect on the results, so all results are reported with these participants included. repeatability of the touchscreen questionnaire approximately <UNK> <UNK> participants who resided in the area surrounding uk biobank's coordinating centre in stockport undertook a full repeat of the assessment centre visit, between august <UNK> and june <UNK> approximately <UNK> years after <UNK> to assess the long-term repeatability of the dietary questions on the touchscreen questionnaire, as well as the new partial fibre score, we used the subsample of participants who had completed the repeat assessment centre visit and examined the agreement between participants’ responses to the dietary questions on the touchscreen questionnaire completed at baseline and the repeat visit. for this analysis, questions where the possible responses were categorical, i.e. questions on fish, meat, cheese, types of milk, spread, bread, cereal, salt added to food, temperature of hot drinks, major changes to diet, and variation in diet, we cross-tabulated the answers as recorded. for questions that used direct entry responses, we truncated or collapsed answers into categories to enable cross-tabulation as follows: for servings of fruit and vegetables we used <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for the derived partial fibre score we categorised participants into fifths based on the whole cohort. for age last ate meat we used <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> years; for slices of bread we used <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for bowls of breakfast cereal we used <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for cups of tea and coffee and glasses of water we used <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for all questions, participants selecting ‘do not know’, ‘prefer not to answer’ or ‘less than one’ were assigned to separate categories, except for number of bread slices where ‘less than one’ was combined with <UNK> because of very low numbers for both of these groups. for the question on foods avoided we created binary variables for each food item, e.g. consumers/non-consumers of dairy products. after excluding participants who answered ‘do not know’ or ‘prefer not to answer’ at either baseline or the repeat visit, we also assessed agreement using the κ coefficient. bootstrapping with <UNK> <UNK> replications was used to calculate ci around the κ coefficient. in a separate analysis, we also further excluded participants who reported, at the repeat visit, making a major change to their diet in the past <UNK> years. we also examined κ coefficients by sex, age <UNK> years, <UNK> years) and bmi <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for most of the dietary touchscreen questions, the categories of responses to the dietary questions were ordinal, ranging from least frequently eaten to most frequently eaten; therefore for these questions the κ coefficient with quadratic weighting was used, which is equivalent to the intra-class correlation coefficient and allows for the fact that a change from category <UNK> to category <UNK> reflects closer agreement over time than, for example, a change from category <UNK> to category <UNK> κ values <UNK> indicate excellent agreement, values between <UNK> substantial agreement, <UNK> moderate agreement, <UNK> fair agreement, and <UNK> poor <UNK> for questions where the responses were not ordinal, e.g. bread or spread type mainly used, only the percentage in the same category is given, κ values were not calculated. agreement between the intakes of foods and food groups and the partial fibre score from the touchscreen dietary questions and group mean intakes from the <UNK> dietary assessment we created new variables for the weight (in g) from the <UNK> dietary assessments of the food groups that were included in the touchscreen questionnaire: total vegetables; total fresh fruit; total dried fruit; oily fish; other fish; processed meat; poultry; beef; lamb; pork; cheese; tea; caffeinated coffee; decaffeinated coffee; water; white sliced bread; granary brown or mixed flours sliced bread; wholemeal sliced bread; bran cereal; wholewheat cereals; porridge; muesli; and plain cereals, sweetened oat crunch-type cereals, other sweetened cereals, and other cereals. this was done by using the steering file of the oxford webq which contains the serving size of each food item listed in the <UNK> dietary assessment, in g (data not shown). to estimate daily intake, the serving size in g was multiplied by the frequency reported in the <UNK> dietary assessment. the top frequency category was open ended and differed by food group; these were coded so that <UNK> = <UNK> <UNK> = <UNK> <UNK> = <UNK> <UNK> = <UNK> less than one was coded as <UNK> dietary variables from the <UNK> dietary assessments were chosen to match the touchscreen food groups as closely as possible; details of the individual dietary variables from the <UNK> dietary assessment that formed each food group are given in supplementary table <UNK> for the purposes of comparing the touchscreen dietary variables with the <UNK> dietary assessments, we grouped participants into categories for each food group based on the touchscreen questionnaire (for the main food groups of meat, fruit and vegetables we typically used four categories per food group), and these were compared with the <UNK> dietary assessments in two ways. firstly, within each category we calculated the mean intake (in g) of the same food group from participants who completed the <UNK> dietary assessment tool at the assessment centre; this first analysis shows how well the touchscreen and <UNK> dietary assessment tool agree when they are completed on the same day. secondly, in each category we calculated the group mean intake of the corresponding food group from <UNK> dietary assessments from participants who had completed one or more online <UNK> dietary assessments. for participants who completed more than one online <UNK> dietary assessments, we first averaged the values from all of their completed online dietary assessments. in this second analysis, we excluded the <UNK> dietary assessments that were completed at the assessment centre on the same day as the touchscreen questionnaire; we used only the online <UNK> dietary assessments because the aim was to take into account both change over time and variation in day-to day intakes, and therefore we wanted a lag time of at least a few months between the touchscreen questionnaire and the <UNK> dietary assessment. to rank the participants by weekly red meat consumption based on the touchscreen, we summed the frequencies for beef, pork and lamb/mutton, using the following coding: ‘never’ = <UNK> ‘less than once per week’ = <UNK> ‘once per week’ = <UNK> <UNK> times per week’ = <UNK> <UNK> times per week’ = <UNK> ‘once or more daily’ = <UNK> the same approach was used for total meat consumption based on the touchscreen, which was the sum of processed meat, poultry, beef, pork and lamb/mutton. go to: results the initial dataset for the present study consisted of <UNK> <UNK> participants who completed the touchscreen questionnaire at the recruitment visit. of the participants, <UNK> <UNK> repeated the touchscreen questions at the repeated assessment centre visit; the median time between administrations was <UNK> <UNK> percentile <UNK> years. in total, <UNK> <UNK> participants completed at least one <UNK> dietary assessment with plausible energy intakes and <UNK> <UNK> completed at least two <UNK> dietary assessments; <UNK> <UNK> participants

discussion in the present paper, we describe the reproducibility of the touchscreen questionnaire in the subsample of approximately <UNK> <UNK> participants who completed it about <UNK> years apart. for the main food groups, fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, as well as the new partial fibre score, there was moderate to substantial agreement between the responses to the dietary touchscreen questions at baseline and the repeat visit. we also compared the touchscreen questionnaire, which typically asked about the frequency of consumption of the main food groups, with the data from the <UNK> dietary assessment, which gives an estimate of actual intakes of foods and nutrients and was completed at least once by about <UNK> <UNK> participants, by categorising participants based on the answers to the touchscreen questionnaire and calculating the group mean intake from the <UNK> dietary assessments within each category. for all foods and food groups, as well as for the partial fibre score, the comparison with the group mean intakes from the <UNK> dietary assessment data showed that the touchscreen questionnaire categorisation reliably ranked participants by the estimated average intake. we have confirmed for the major food groups that participants stay relatively stable in terms of the assessment of dietary exposures during <UNK> years of follow-up. the questions on the consumption of meat and oily fish from the touchscreen questionnaire, particularly, showed substantial agreement with the repeat measure approximately <UNK> years later. the questions on the consumption of fresh fruit showed substantial agreement while the question for dried fruit showed moderate agreement. in our cohort, a high proportion of participants reported consuming dried fruit less than once daily <UNK> %), whereas only a small proportion <UNK> %) reported consuming fresh fruit less than daily; foods eaten infrequently tend to have relatively lower reproducibility than foods eaten more <UNK> we found similar reproducibility of the dietary touchscreen questionnaire by sex and age. however, we observed systematically better agreement in the dietary touchscreen questionnaires for participants who had a bmi < <UNK> <UNK> compared with those with a bmi > <UNK> <UNK> other studies have found some differences in the reproducibility of an ffq between normal-weight and overweight participants for <UNK> and <UNK> but the differences were inconsistent and the reproducibility was not systematically worse among overweight participants. the poorer reproducibility of the dietary touchscreen questions among overweight participants should be considered in future uk biobank studies. a <UNK> period between administrations of the touchscreen questionnaire allows us to examine the long-term reproducibility of the questionnaire – any changes will be due to a combination of variability in response to the questions and true dietary changes over time, both of which contribute to misclassification of long-term dietary <UNK> examining this longer-term reproducibility is vital for future prospective work from uk biobank on diet and disease development and we have shown that over <UNK> years of follow-up that the vast majority <UNK> %) of participants report the same or adjacent category of consumption for the main food groups of fruit, vegetables, meat and fish, as well as our derived estimated partial fibre score (in fifths). the mean daily intakes of the main food groups from all <UNK> dietary assessments in uk biobank were similar to or slightly higher than those of the same food groups from the uk national diet and nutrition survey (ndns) for adults aged <UNK> years or older, which is not unexpected given the known under-reporting of energy intakes in ndns, by a magnitude of approximately <UNK> <UNK> and the non-representativeness of the uk biobank <UNK> in addition, the age categories in ndns <UNK> years, and <UNK> years or older) are wider than the age range of participants in uk biobank <UNK> years). the mean intake of vegetables from the <UNK> dietary assessments in uk biobank was <UNK> g compared with <UNK> g for adults aged <UNK> years or older in ndns, for fresh fruit it was <UNK> g in uk biobank and <UNK> g for fresh/canned fruit in ndns, for oily fish it was <UNK> g compared with <UNK> g, for white fish it was <UNK> g compared with <UNK> g, for poultry it was <UNK> g compared with <UNK> g, for red and processed meat it was <UNK> g compared with <UNK> g, and for total meat it was <UNK> g compared with <UNK> <UNK> the comparison of the touchscreen dietary variables with the group mean intakes from the <UNK> dietary assessments showed that the touchscreen dietary questions discriminate between low and high intakes of main food groups. the comparison also showed classic regression to the mean. this occurs because participants will randomly over- and under- report on the touchscreen questionnaire; when participants are categorised based on the answers to the touchscreen questions the lowest category will include a disproportionate number of people who reported an intake lower than their true intake, and the top category will include a disproportionate number of people who reported an intake higher than their true intake, thus the mean intakes from the <UNK> dietary assessment re-measurement for each category will be closer <UNK> for the comparison with the group mean intakes from the <UNK> dietary assessment completed at the recruitment centre, as expected, there is less regression to the mean because the two measures were completed on the same day. the new variables that we generated, of food groups in weight amounts from the <UNK> dietary assessments, can be used to correct for regression dilution bias in diet–disease analyses. this can be done using the approach we have shown in this paper, by grouping participants according to baseline intakes reported at the touchscreen and calculating the mean intakes from the <UNK> dietary assessments within each group. the relative risk of disease can be reported for each category of intake, and the data from the <UNK> dietary assessments can be used to generate the trends in risk per increment (in g/d) in dietary intake. the touchscreen questionnaire included questions on fruit, vegetables, bread and breakfast cereals, and from this we were able to estimate a partial fibre score for the whole cohort. according to the ndns, the food groups in the touchscreen questionnaire that were used to estimate the fibre score contribute <UNK> % of the total fibre intakes for this age group. the other categories in ndns that were major sources of fibre but were not asked about in the touchscreen were: potatoes; pasta, rice, pizza and other miscellaneous cereals; and biscuits; buns, cakes, pastries and fruit pies; which together contributed another <UNK> % to fibre intakes for adults aged <UNK> years and <UNK> therefore, our estimated partial fibre score from the touchscreen is not a complete estimate of fibre intake. for epidemiological studies that investigate the associations between dietary intakes and health outcomes it is not necessary to determine food and nutrient intakes with absolute accuracy, but it is important to demonstrate that the questionnaire can discriminate between people with low and high intakes; the comparison of the touchscreen partial fibre score with the group mean intakes from the <UNK> dietary assessments confirmed that the touchscreen partial fibre score that we derived does separate uk biobank participants with low and high intakes of dietary fibre. this variable will be returned to uk biobank, and there will now be an estimated partial fibre score for the whole cohort, which can be used to assess the relationships between fibre and disease. the partial fibre score should not be regarded as a measure of absolute fibre intake and therefore it should not be used for direct comparison with recommended intakes or intakes in other populations. this work has shown that the main dietary touchscreen variables, including the new partial fibre score, show moderate to substantial reproducibility over a <UNK> period, and comparison with the mean intakes from the <UNK> dietary assessments showed that the touchscreen variables reliably rank participants according to the intake of main foods and food groups. this work underlies future research examining diet–disease associations in uk biobank.

diet and colorectal cancer in uk biobank: a prospective study abstract background most of the previous studies on diet and colorectal cancer were based on diets consumed during the <UNK> methods we

on a short food-frequency questionnaire (n = <UNK> <UNK> dietary intakes were re-measured in a large sub-sample (n = <UNK> <UNK> who completed an online <UNK> dietary assessment during follow-up. trends in risk across the baseline categories were calculated by assigning re-measured intakes to allow for measurement error and changes in intake over time. results during an average of <UNK> years of follow-up, <UNK> cases of colorectal cancer occurred. participants who reported consuming an average of <UNK> g/day of red and processed meat compared with <UNK> g/day had a <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval (ci): <UNK> higher risk of colorectal cancer. participants in the highest fifth of intake of fibre from bread and breakfast cereals had a <UNK> <UNK> ci: <UNK> lower risk of colorectal cancer. alcohol was associated with an <UNK> <UNK> ci: <UNK> higher risk per <UNK> g/day higher intake. fish, poultry, cheese, fruit, vegetables, tea and coffee were not associated with

colorectal cancer risks key messages previous studies have found an increased risk of colorectal cancer in those with high intakes of red and processed meat. most previous studies collected information on dietary intakes during the <UNK> or earlier and patterns in meat consumption have since changed. in addition, few studies have used re-measured intakes to reduce the impact of measurement error, and to quantify the amount of red and processed meat that is associated with an increased risk. measurement error generally biases the associations towards the null value; the associations observed in previous studies that did not re-measure intakes may be underestimated. our study found that people who were consuming red and processed meat four or more times per week, had a <UNK> increased risk of colorectal cancer compared with those who were consuming red and processed meat less than twice a week. background in october <UNK> the international agency for research on

whether previous risk estimates are relevant to current eating patterns. in addition, tumour <UNK> as well as the underlying aetiology of bowel <UNK> may differ by anatomical sub-site, but there are few data on the associations between dietary factors and risk of sub-sites of colorectal cancer. uk biobank is a prospective cohort study of half a million men and women recruited between <UNK> and <UNK> and provides the opportunity to investigate prominent hypotheses related to diet and colorectal cancer in a contemporary population-based cohort in the uk. we have previously shown that the dietary data collected from the uk biobank short food-frequency touchscreen questionnaire, which generally asks about frequency of consumption of main foods and food groups, is highly <UNK> these data are available on all uk biobank participants. in addition, dietary intakes were re-measured in a large sub-sample of participants (n = <UNK> <UNK> who completed at least one online <UNK> dietary assessment and these data can be used to correct for regression dilution and other forms of measurement <UNK> the objective of the current study is to systematically examine the associations of colorectal-cancer risk with the intake of foods and food groups included in the short food-frequency touchscreen questionnaire: meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, milk, cheese, alcohol, tea and coffee, as well as fibre intake, and to use re-measured dietary intakes to quantify the risk at actual levels of intake in uk biobank. we also examined the associations between intakes of food and food groups with anatomical sub-sites of colorectal cancer. methods study and participants uk biobank is a prospective cohort study of half a million men and women aged <UNK> years recruited from across the uk between <UNK> and <UNK> the uk biobank protocol is available online <UNK> potential participants were identified from national health service patient registers and invited to attend a local assessment centre. permission for access to patient records for recruitment was approved by the national information governance board for health and social care in england and wales, and the community health index advisory group in scotland. at the assessment centre, the participants completed a touchscreen questionnaire, which collected information on socio-demographic characteristics and diet, lifestyle, reproductive and environmental factors. anthropometric measurements were taken using standardized procedures. the touchscreen questionnaire and other resources are shown on the uk biobank website (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/resources/). since recruitment, participants have been followed for cancer incidence and mortality via electronic linkage with cancer and death registries. uk biobank has ethical approval from the north west multi-centre research ethics committee. at the touchscreen, all participants gave informed consent using a signature-capture device. the uk biobank

collected in uk <UNK> briefly, at the recruitment assessment centre visit, participants completed a touchscreen questionnaire that included <UNK> questions on diet, most of which asked about the frequency of consumption of main foods and food groups. the questions used in this manuscript are those that asked about the frequency of consumption of processed meat, poultry, beef, lamb, pork, oily fish, non-oily fish, fresh fruit, dried fruit, raw vegetables, cooked vegetables, cheese, tea and coffee. a further <UNK> questions about alcohol consumption were used to estimate intakes of beer, wine (red and white) and spirits. more detail about the questions, and possible responses, is given in the supplementary methods, available as supplementary data at ije online. we also used the fibre score that we generated from the questions on fruit, vegetables, bread and breakfast cereal and described <UNK> and which, when compared with the large sub-sample of participants who completed at least one web-based <UNK> dietary questionnaire, was shown to discriminate between people with low and high intakes of <UNK> we also derived an estimate of dairy-milk intake, using the questions on consumption of main type of milk, bowls of breakfast cereal, cups of tea and cups of coffee. more details on the derivation of the estimate of milk intake are given in the supplementary methods, available as supplementary data at ije online. after recruitment, participants who had provided uk biobank with an e-mail address were, between february <UNK> and june <UNK> invited via e-mail once every <UNK> months for a total of four times to complete an online <UNK> dietary assessment. a large sub-sample of participants (n = <UNK> <UNK> completed at least one online <UNK> dietary assessment during this <UNK> the <UNK> dietary assessment asks about the consumption of up to <UNK> types of foods and <UNK> types of drinks during the previous <UNK> <UNK> portion sizes for each item were specified and participants select how many portions they consumed; for most items, a specific portion size was used, e.g. one apple, one sausage, one rasher of bacon, one slice of ham. for other items, such as pasta and rice, the portion size was specified as a ‘serving’. the mean daily intakes of nutrients were calculated by multiplying the frequency of consumption of each food or drink by a standard portion size and the nutrient composition of that particular item. the web-based <UNK> dietary assessment has been compared with an interviewer-administered <UNK> recall completed on the same day, with spearman’s correlation coefficients for the majority of nutrients calculated from the web-based <UNK> dietary assessment ranging between <UNK> and <UNK> (median of <UNK> assessment of outcome prevalent and incident cancer cases within the uk biobank cohort were identified through linkage to cancer and death registries. eligible participants contributed person-years from date of attendance at the assessment centre at recruitment until the date of first registration with cancer [except non-melanoma skin cancer <UNK> <UNK> date of death or last date of follow-up <UNK> november <UNK> for england and wales and <UNK> december <UNK> for scotland), whichever was earliest. the endpoint for these analyses is first diagnosis of colorectal cancer <UNK> codes <UNK> or primary underlying cause of death colorectal cancer, whichever was first. proximal colon cancers were defined as those that occurred within the caecum, appendix, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon and splenic flexure <UNK> distal colon cancers were those that occurred within the descending <UNK> and sigmoid <UNK> colon. overlapping <UNK> and unspecified <UNK> lesions of the colon were categorized as colon cancers. cancer of the rectum included cancers occurring at the recto sigmoid junction <UNK> and rectum <UNK> for participants who had a diagnosis of colon cancer and rectal cancer on the same date (n = <UNK> during follow-up (and no previous cancer diagnosis), colon cancer was assumed to be the first incident cancer in the sub-site analyses. for participants who had a diagnosis of proximal colon cancer and distal colon cancer on the same date (n = <UNK> during follow-up (and no previous cancer diagnosis), proximal colon cancer was assumed to be the first incident cancer in the sub-site analyses. statistical analysis we examined the associations between colorectal-cancer incidence and reported consumption of total red and processed meat, red meat, processed meat, poultry, fish, dairy milk, cheese, fruit, vegetables, fibre, alcohol, tea and coffee as reported on the short food-frequency touchscreen questionnaire at recruitment. participants were generally divided into four categories of food intake according to their reported consumption on the short food-frequency touchscreen questionnaire at recruitment. the cut-offs for the categories were chosen so that there was a reasonable and similar number of participants in each group, as far as the distribution of data allowed. the mean food or nutrient intakes assigned to each baseline category were from the participants within each category who had completed at least one online <UNK> assessment (participants who had completed more than one <UNK> dietary assessment were assigned the mean from their records). these re-measured intakes were used to estimate the trends in risk; this approach reduces the impact of regression dilution bias and other forms of measurement <UNK> we have previously described how we generated the mean intakes of foods and food groups from the <UNK> dietary <UNK> briefly, we grouped together foods in the <UNK> dietary assessment that corresponded to the same food group in the short food-frequency touchscreen questionnaire. for example, to get the mean intakes of non-oily fish, we calculated the sum (in grams) of the following items: white fish, battered fish, breaded fish and tinned tuna. for each participant who completed a <UNK> dietary assessment, the serving size in grams for each relevant food item was multiplied by the frequency reported in the <UNK> dietary <UNK> cox-regression models using attained age as the underlying time variable were used to estimate hazard ratios (hrs) for incident colorectal cancer by the reported frequency of foods, food groups and fibre from the short food-frequency touchscreen questionnaire at recruitment. minimally adjusted analyses were stratified by age <UNK> years, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> years), sex, geographical region <UNK> regions) and socio-economic status (in fifths, based on the townsend deprivation <UNK> for covariates where participants could select ‘do not know’ or ‘prefer not to answer’, these responses were combined into an ‘unknown’ category. multivariable models were adjusted for education (college or university degree, vocational qualifications, optional national exams at ages <UNK> years, national exams at age <UNK> years, none of the above, unknown), smoking status (never, past, current <UNK> cigarettes per day, current <UNK> cigarettes per day, current <UNK> cigarettes

equivalent (met)-hours per week, moderate: <UNK> excess met-hrs per week, high: <UNK> excess met-hours per week, <UNK> alcohol intake <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> g/day, unknown) (except for analyses where alcohol was the main exposure), family history of colorectal cancer (mother, father or sibling having had colorectal cancer, no family history, unknown), aspirin or ibuprofen use (regular use, not

<UNK> live births, unknown), menopause (pre-menopausal, post-menopausal, unsure because of hysterectomy, unsure because of other reason, unknown), oral contraceptive agent (oca) use (never, ever, unknown) and hormone replacement therapy (hrt) use (never, ever, unknown). we conducted a sensitivity analysis for colorectal cancer excluding participants who reported that they had made a major change in their diet in the past <UNK> years due to illness (n = <UNK> <UNK> or preferred not to answer the question about whether they had made any major changes to their diet in the past <UNK> years (n = <UNK> we also ran the fully adjusted model, adjusting for body mass index (bmi) <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> unknown) instead of waist circumference. we also adjusted the result for total red and processed meat by each covariate separately, to examine which factors attenuated the minimally adjusted hr. to test for heterogeneity of the main associations by sex, we compared models with and without an interaction term for the main exposure (as the continuous trend variable) and sex and evaluated the significance using the likelihood ratio test. in an additional analysis, we further adjusted red meat for processed meat and vice versa using the fully adjusted model and fitting red meat and processed meat as continuous variables. we investigated the association between incident colorectal cancer and type of fish (oily or non-oily) and type of alcoholic drink (beer, wine or spirits). we also investigated the association between incident colorectal cancer and source of fibre (fibre from fruit, vegetables or bread and breakfast cereals). for this analysis, the p-value for trend is based on the mean intakes at baseline in each category because estimates of fibre from fruit, vegetables and cereals are not available from the <UNK> dietary assessments. for the main exposures, we also examined the associations for colon <UNK> code: <UNK> and rectal cancer <UNK> codes: <UNK> separately and for proximal colon <UNK> codes: <UNK> and distal colon <UNK> codes: <UNK> separately. we also examined the associations between type of alcoholic drink and colon and rectal cancer separately because of the prior hypothesis that beer may increase the risk of rectal <UNK> to test for heterogeneity of the main associations by sub-site (colon vs rectal and proximal colon vs distal colon), we fitted separate cox-regression models for each sub-site using a competing-risk approach and compared the risk coefficients and standard errors in the subgroups of interest using likelihood

percentage, had a higher alcohol intake and had lower intakes of fruit, vegetables and fibre. the same was true for processed-meat intake, with the exception of age, which was similar between the two categories. participants in the highest category of processed-meat intake (men and women combined) reported higher intakes of bacon, ham and sausages in the online <UNK> dietary assessments (mean

of incident colorectal cancer, we found that a <UNK> increment in processed-meat intake (equivalent to about one rasher of bacon or one slice of <UNK> was associated with an <UNK> <UNK> ci: <UNK> ptrend = <UNK> greater risk of incident colorectal cancer. we also found that each <UNK> increment in red-meat intake (equivalent to about one thick slice of roast beef or the edible portion of one

alcohol (by volume) beer] was associated with an <UNK> <UNK> ci: <UNK> ptrend < <UNK> greater risk of incident colorectal cancer. intake of fibre from bread and breakfast cereals (but not fibre from vegetables or fruit) was also associated with a reduced risk. the directions of our results for red and processed meat are in agreement with the latest systematic review from the wcrf continuous update project, which summarized the evidence from available prospective studies for red and processed <UNK> however, the magnitudes of our estimates are nearly twice as large. this may be in part because we used re-measured intakes (using the data from the large sub-sample, n = <UNK> <UNK> to fit the trends in risk per increment in mean intake. this approach reduces the impact of measurement error in the assessment of food intakes and measurement error tends to bias associations towards the <UNK> adjusting for waist circumference, alcohol and, to a lesser extent, smoking attenuated the results for red and processed meat. however, the fully adjusted models were adjusted for <UNK> variables that are known or suspected confounders and, for processed meat in particular, the fully adjusted results were still strong. we further adjusted red and processed meat for milk, cheese and fibre from bread and breakfast cereals and the results were unchanged. when we excluded participants who reported having made major changes to their diet in the past <UNK> years due to illness, the point estimates remained similar, indicating that reverse causality is not likely to explain the associations. we found an increased risk for greater alcohol intake, in line with the wcrf <UNK> when we looked at type of alcoholic drink, we found an association between beer and colorectal cancer. our results for fibre are in agreement with those reported in a recent meta-analysis on fibre and colorectal cancer, which found that, in analyses by fibre type, only fibre from cereals, but not from fruit or vegetables, was inversely associated with <UNK> different types of fibre may have different effects on stool transit time and weight, which may explain the different associations with colorectal cancer, but more research is needed to clarify the physiological effects of different types of fibre. alternatively, the intake of fibre from cereals will be correlated with wholegrain intake, which has also been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of colorectal <UNK> it is possible that phytochemicals or other non-fibre components of wholegrains are responsible for the observed associations. the wcrf review found an inverse association between fish and risk of colorectal cancer; however, this finding was driven by one study and was not robust to removal of that study from the <UNK> we did not find any associations between fruit and vegetables and colorectal cancer. the wcrf systematic review found a very weak inverse association between vegetables and colorectal cancer, which might be explained by residual confounding, and no association for <UNK> in our study, the hr for <UNK> higher milk intake was <UNK> <UNK> ci: <UNK> the wcrf systematic review found an inverse association between milk intake and colorectal cancer [hr for <UNK> g/day = <UNK> <UNK> ci: <UNK> the uk biobank short food-frequency touchscreen questionnaire did not contain all sources of milk and therefore there may be more measurement error in our categorization of milk intakes, which would tend to bias the association towards the null. interestingly, we found heterogeneity by sex for red and processed meat, red meat, processed meat and alcohol, with the association stronger in men and null in women. the explanation for these differences by sex is unclear and could be a chance finding. however, there is evidence that the association between other factors, such as <UNK> and <UNK> and colorectal-cancer risk, differs between men and women. we also found heterogeneity by sub-site of the colon for the same food items—red and processed meat, processed meat and alcohol—with the associations stronger for distal cancer and null for proximal cancer, and previous work has shown that women are more likely to develop cancers in the proximal colon, whereas men are more likely to develop cancers in the distal <UNK> future epidemiological studies examining dietary, lifestyle and anthropometric factors in relation to colorectal-cancer risk should examine associations by sex and by site and/or characteristics of the tumour. strengths of this study are the large number of participants and the ability to adjust for known and potential confounders. we have previously reported good reproducibility of the short food-frequency touchscreen <UNK> this indicates that the participants’ reporting of food groups, including meat consumption, in uk biobank is stable. we were also able to reduce the impact of regression dilution bias and other measurement errors, and quantify actual intakes, using the re-measured dietary intakes on the large sub-sample of participants who completed at least one <UNK> dietary assessment. recruitment for uk biobank is recent, from <UNK> to <UNK> so the results we present here indicate that red and processed meat, as is typically consumed in the present day, is associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer. we were not able to adjust for total energy intake because the short food-frequency touchscreen questionnaire did not ask about every food group and therefore estimated total energy intake was not available. importantly, we adjusted for measures of body size (waist circumference in the main analysis and bmi in a sensitivity analysis) and physical activity; adjusting for body size and physical activity has been shown to better approximate objectively measured total energy expenditure (and therefore true energy intake) than estimated energy intake from a food-frequency <UNK> a large sub-sample completed a <UNK> dietary assessment during follow-up. previous work has shown that uk biobank participants who completed at least one <UNK> dietary assessment were more likely to be women, older, of white ethnicity, less deprived and more educated than those that did not complete a <UNK> dietary <UNK> nevertheless, the approach we used to calculate the trends based on re-measured intakes has been shown to be robust to various factors influencing which participants provide a second <UNK> we did not have information about participation in bowel-screening programmes during follow-up and participants who underwent bowel screening would be more likely to be diagnosed with bowel cancer and it is possible that participating in screening could be associated with dietary intakes. although this study is one of the largest single studies to report on dietary factors and cancers at sub-sites of the colorectum, more data are needed for reliable estimation of the associations between dietary factors and sub-sites of the colorectum. conclusions in conclusion, in this systematic analysis of a contemporary cohort of half a million men and women from the uk population, we found that consumption of red and processed meat and alcohol was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. we also found that fibre from bread and breakfast cereals was associated with a reduced risk. the current recommendation by the uk government department of health is that people should not eat more than <UNK> g of red and processed meat a <UNK> participants in the highest category of red and processed-meat consumption were consuming an average of <UNK> g of red and processed meat per day and thus this group was on average meeting the current recommendation but still had a <UNK> <UNK> ci: <UNK> increase in risk of colorectal cancer compared with those who ate an average of <UNK> g of red and processed meat per day. therefore, our results suggest that reductions in meat intake below the current recommendation may further reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.

foods, macronutrients and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women: a large uk cohort abstract background: the role of diet in breast cancer aetiology is unclear; recent studies have suggested associations may differ by estrogen receptor status. methods: baseline diet was assessed in <UNK> using a validated questionnaire in <UNK> <UNK> postmenopausal uk women without previous cancer, who had not changed their diet recently. they were followed by record linkage to national cancer and death databases. cox regression yielded adjusted relative risks for breast cancer for <UNK> food items and eight macronutrients, subdivided mostly into five categories of baseline intake. trends in risk across the baseline categories were calculated, assigning re-measured intakes to allow for measurement error and changes in intake over time; p-values allowed for multiple testing. results: women aged <UNK> (standard deviation (sd <UNK> years at baseline were followed for <UNK> (sd <UNK> years; <UNK> <UNK> were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. alcohol intake had the strongest association with breast cancer incidence: relative risk (rr) <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval (ci) <UNK> per <UNK> g/day higher intake, p ¼ <UNK> <UNK> there were inverse associations with fruit: rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> per <UNK> g/day higher intake, p ¼ <UNK> <UNK> , and dietary fibre: rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> per <UNK> g/day increase, p ¼ <UNK> <UNK> . fruit and fibre intakes were correlated (q ¼ <UNK> and were greater among women who were not overweight, so residual confounding cannot be excluded. there was no heterogeneity for any association by estrogen receptor status. conclusions: by far the strongest association was between alcohol intake and an increased risk of breast cancer. of the other <UNK> intakes examined, higher intakes of fruit and fibre were associated with lower risks of breast cancer, but it is unclear whether or not these associations are causal. introduction breast cancer incidence is generally greater in high-income than low-income <UNK> much of this variation is due to reproductive factors such as parity and breastfeeding, together with variations in screening and <UNK> but other risk factors might be involved. many studies have explored the possible role of diet, with the main hypotheses being that risk may be increased by high intakes of alcohol, fat, meat and dairy products, and that risk may be decreased by high intakes of fibre, fruits and <UNK> there is now convincing evidence that alcohol increases the risk of breast <UNK> a recent systematic review of prospective studies concluded that there was no definite evidence that any other dietary factors were associated with the risk of developing breast cancer, although there was limited

meat intake may be risk factors for breast <UNK> we report here results from an analysis of the relation between intakes of a wide range of foods and macronutrients and breast cancer incidence among postmenopausal women in the million women study, a large prospective study in the uk. to cover the most prominent hypotheses for effects of diet on breast cancer <UNK> we examined risk in relation to <UNK> dietary items and macronutrients (meat type and quantity, fish, milk, cheese, yogurt, eggs, fruit, vegetables, alcohol, energy, percentage of energy from protein, dairy protein, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, free sugars and dietary fibre). associations were examined overall for any invasive breast cancer, and separately by er status. methods study population participants in

the analyses reported here. participants were asked about their usual diet during a typical week, including about <UNK> quantitative or semi-quantitative questions (see: <UNK> nutrient intakes were calculated by multiplying the frequency of consumption of each food by the specified portion size and the nutrient composition of that item. the short-term repeatability of most of the diet questions

correlation coefficient was <UNK> (range from <UNK> for polyunsaturated fat to <UNK> for <UNK> for these analyses we categorized reported intakes at baseline into five groups except for fish, where three categories were used: no fish; any fatty fish (salmon, sardines, kippers/herring, trout, and mackerel]; and non-fatty fish only [tuna, cod/haddock, ‘fish & chips’ and other seafood). for meat, the five categories were of the type of meat consumed: never ate meat; ate poultry but no red meat key messages • in this large prospective study, we systematically examined associations of <UNK> foods and eight macronutrients with breast cancer risk, overall and by estrogen receptor status. • the strongest finding was a positive association of alcohol consumption with breast cancer risk, in line with previous evidence. • none of the <UNK> other foods and macronutrients examined was strongly associated with breast cancer risk; both fruit and fibre intakes, which are correlated, showed

processed meat. for other foods the categories were selected to provide substantial numbers in each of the five groups, while respecting the integer nature of some of the data (e.g. items of fruit consumed per day). vegetables comprised cooked vegetables (except potatoes) and salad items/raw vegetables; and fruit comprised fresh fruit, dried fruit and stewed or tinned fruit. for the eight macronutrients studied here, the cut-points for the five groups were quintiles of intake. in supplementary analyses we examined breast cancer risk: by types of fruit and sources of fibre (for sources of dietary fibre, the mean intakes were from the baseline questionnaire because the coding of food subgroups and composite foods was not directly comparable to that in the <UNK> dietary assessment data); by intakes of alcohol, stratified by intakes of fruit and fibre; and by intakes of soya foods and types of vegetables. repeat measures of intake in each baseline category were derived from a web-based <UNK> dietary assessment tool, the oxford <UNK> completed by <UNK> <UNK> women on average <UNK> years after baseline and before the end of follow-up. ascertainment of breast cancer participants were followed by record linkage to the uk nhs databases on cancer registrations and deaths. data for england were provided by nhs digital and the office for national statistics, and for scotland by the information services division, nhs scotland. information on estrogen receptor (er) status of the incident breast tumours was provided by public health england/national cancer

between intakes of food groups and macronutrients were examined by calculating spearman non-parametric correlation coefficients. for analyses of relative risk of breast cancer, women were generally divided into five baseline categories of food or nutrient intake. for estimating trends in risk, the food and nutrient intakes assigned to each baseline category were the means in each baseline category re-measured in the <UNK> dietary recall (for women with more than one <UNK> dietary recall, data were used just from the first). this non-parametric approach reduces the impact of regression

hormonal therapy for menopause (no, yes). the non-dietary data were from the <UNK> re-survey, except for socioeconomic group, strenuous exercise and height, which were from the recruitment questionnaire. to ensure that the same women were being compared in all analyses, the small number with a missing value for each particular variable were assigned to a separate category for that variable. in analyses of factors with more than two categories, rrs were treated as floating absolute risks, allowing estimation of group-specific confidence intervals for all categories including the reference <UNK> this method allows any two exposure groups to be compared. most dietary variables considered here have no natural baseline category, so the middle category was used as the reference group. for trends in breast cancer risk per specified increment in dietary intake, conventional cis are used (for alcohol, the estimates of linear trend were in drinkers only, because non-drinkers may have different characteristics). international journal of epidemiology, <UNK> vol. <UNK> no. <UNK> <UNK> downloaded from <UNK> by guest on <UNK> march <UNK> heterogeneity in the associations between

this extent of multiple testing. when examining trends in breast cancer risk for the <UNK> dietary items examined, we used the magnitudes of <UNK> statistics to assess the strengths of associations and applied a bonferroni correction to nominal p-values by multiplying the values by <UNK> some allowance for the hundreds of individual rr estimates in the tables and plots was made by quoting their

risks of ischaemic heart disease and stroke in meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians over <UNK> years of follow-up: participants <UNK> <UNK> participants with no history of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, or angina (or cardiovascular disease) were classified into three distinct diet groups: meat eaters (participants who consumed meat, regardless of whether they consumed fish, dairy, or eggs; <UNK> <UNK> fish eaters (consumed fish but no meat; <UNK> and vegetarians including vegans <UNK> <UNK> based on dietary information collected at baseline, and subsequently around <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> main outcome measures incident cases of ischaemic heart disease and stroke (including ischaemic and haemorrhagic types) identified through record linkage until <UNK> results over <UNK> years of follow-up, <UNK> cases of ischaemic heart disease and <UNK> cases of total stroke <UNK> ischaemic stroke and <UNK> haemorrhagic stroke) were recorded. after adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle confounders, fish eaters and vegetarians had <UNK> (hazard ratio <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> lower rates of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters, respectively <UNK> for heterogeneity). this difference was equivalent to <UNK> fewer cases of ischaemic heart disease <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> fewer) in vegetarians than in meat eaters per <UNK> population over <UNK> years. the associations for ischaemic heart disease were partly attenuated after adjustment for self reported high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and body mass index (hazard ratio <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> in vegetarians with all adjustments). by contrast, vegetarians had <UNK> higher rates of total stroke (hazard ratio <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> than meat eaters, equivalent to three more cases of total stroke <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> more) per <UNK> population over <UNK> years, mostly due to a higher rate of haemorrhagic stroke. the associations for stroke did not attenuate after further adjustment of disease risk factors. conclusions in this prospective cohort in the uk, fish eaters and vegetarians had lower rates of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters, although vegetarians had higher rates of haemorrhagic and total stroke. introduction vegetarian and vegan diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, partly due to perceived health benefits, as well as concerns about the environment and animal <UNK> in the united kingdom, both the representative national diet and nutrition survey <UNK> and a <UNK> ipsos mori survey estimated about <UNK> million vegetarians and vegans living in the <UNK> evidence suggests that vegetarians might have different disease risks compared with <UNK> but data from large scale prospective studies are limited, because few studies have recruited sufficient numbers of vegetarian participants. for ischaemic heart disease, some but not all previous studies reported significantly lower risks of mortality from ischaemic heart disease in vegetarians than in <UNK> in terms of incidence, the only previous study (the european prospective investigation into cancer (epic)-oxford) reported that vegetarians had a lower risk of ischaemic heart disease than <UNK> but at the time of publication the study had an insufficient duration of follow-up to separately examine the risks in other diet groups (fish eaters and vegans). for stroke, two previous <UNK> including one that included epic-oxford <UNK> found no significant differences in risk of total stroke deaths between vegetarians and non-vegetarians. however, no previous studies have examined the incidence of stroke in relation to vegetarian diets, or have examined the main stroke types. we report here the risks of both incident ischaemic heart disease and stroke in people with distinct dietary habits—that is, meat eaters, fish eaters and vegetarians (including vegans)—with a separate evaluation of ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes, over <UNK> years of follow-up in the epic-oxford study. methods study population and design epic-oxford is a prospective cohort study of about <UNK> <UNK> men and women who were recruited across the uk between <UNK> and <UNK> details of the recruitment process have been described <UNK> individuals were recruited from either general practices or by postal questionnaire. the general practice recruitment method recruited <UNK> men and women aged <UNK> to <UNK> who were registered with participating general practices, all of whom completed a full questionnaire on their diet, lifestyle, health characteristics, and medical history. the postal recruitment preferentially targeted vegetarians, vegans, and other people interested in diet and health, and recruited <UNK> <UNK> participants aged <UNK> or older. a full questionnaire was mailed to all members of the vegetarian society and all surviving participants of the oxford vegetarian <UNK> and respondents were invited to provide names and addresses of relatives and friends who were also interested in receiving a questionnaire. a short questionnaire was also distributed to all members of the vegan society, enclosed in vegetarian and health food magazines, and displayed in health food shops; and a full questionnaire was subsequently mailed to all those who returned the short questionnaire. despite the targeted recruitment of the postal method, about <UNK> of meat eaters in the cohort were recruited by post. subsequently, a follow-up questionnaire was sent to participants in <UNK> which asked similar questions on their diet and lifestyle, and participants returned the questionnaires between <UNK> and <UNK> a participant flowchart of the recruitment process and inclusion into this study is shown as supplementary figure <UNK> the study protocol was approved by a multicentre research ethics committee (scotland a research ethics committee) and all participants provided written informed consent. assessment of diet group and diet the full baseline questionnaire collected responses to four questions about consumption of meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs, in the form of “do you eat any meat (including bacon, ham, poultry, game, meat pies, sausages)?” or similar for the other three food groups. these four questions were used to classify participants into meat eaters (participants who reported eating meat, regardless of whether they ate fish, dairy, or eggs), fish eaters (participants who did not eat meat but did eat fish), vegetarians (participants who did not eat meat or fish, but did eat one or both of dairy products and eggs), and vegans (participants who did not eat meat, fish, dairy products, or eggs). the follow-up questionnaire sent in <UNK> included identical questions on consumption of meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs (yes/no). therefore, at both baseline and follow-up, participants were classified into one of four diet groups: meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans. owing to the small number of vegans, vegetarians and vegans were combined as one diet group in the main analyses, but the two groups were examined separately for each outcome in secondary analyses. the baseline questionnaire also included a semiquantitative food frequency section containing <UNK> items, which asked about dietary intake over the past year, and which was previously validated using <UNK> days (in four sets of four days) of weighed dietary records and selected recovery and concentration <UNK> for calculation of food and nutrient intakes, the frequency of consumption of each food or beverage was multiplied by a standard portion size (mostly based on data from the uk ministry of agriculture, fisheries, and <UNK> and nutrient content of each food or beverage (based on mccance and widdowson’s food composition <UNK> because our prespecified analysis plan was to examine disease risks associated with distinct dietary groups, the associations of individual foods and nutrients with risks were not assessed in this study, but information on intakes of foods and nutrients were used in descriptive and secondary analyses. assessment of other characteristics in addition to diet, the baseline questionnaire also asked questions on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and medical history, including questions on education level, smoking, physical activity, use of dietary supplements, and use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy in women. socioeconomic status was categorised by use of the townsend deprivation <UNK> based on the participants’ postcodes. for physical activity, based on their responses to questions asked about their occupation and their time spent participating in activities including walking, cycling, and other physical exercises, participants were categorised by a validated physical activity index with four <UNK> alcohol consumption was determined from responses to five items on the food frequency questionnaire. questions relating to smoking and alcohol consumption were also asked on the follow-up questionnaire in <UNK> for biological measurements, body mass index was calculated from participants’ self reported height and weight at recruitment, which was previously found to be accurate compared with measured height and weight in a validation study of about <UNK> <UNK> all participants were also asked at recruitment whether they were willing to

self reported body mass index, and measures of blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and blood lipids (total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), non-hdl-c), the means and <UNK> confidence intervals are presented, after adjustment for sex and age at entry (in <UNK> age groups), alcohol consumption <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> g/day), and physical activity (inactive, low activity, moderately active, very active, <UNK> cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and <UNK> confidence intervals for the associations between diet group (meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians including vegans) and each outcome of interest, with meat eaters as the reference group. for participants who completed both the baseline and follow-up questionnaire, diet group and relevant time varying covariates (smoking and alcohol consumption) were updated at follow-up. the underlying time variable was the age at recruitment to the age at diagnosis, death, or administrative censoring, whichever occurred first. for acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, events were censored on the respective outcomes of interest. for total stroke, ischaemic stroke, and haemorrhagic stroke, events were censored on any stroke. all analyses were stratified by sex, method of recruitment (general practice or postal), and region (seven regions across the uk), and adjusted for year of recruitment (per year from <UNK> to <UNK> education (no qualifications, basic secondary (eg, o level), higher secondary (eg, a level), degree,

moderately active, very active, unknown), dietary supplement use (no, yes, unknown), and oral contraceptive use (no, yes ever, unknown) and hormone replacement therapy use (no, yes ever, unknown) in women. we used wald tests to test for heterogeneity of risk between diet groups. the proportional hazards assumption was assessed on the basis of schoenfeld residuals, and was not violated for the variables of interest in the adjusted model for either ischaemic heart disease or stroke <UNK> for all categories). self reported history of high blood pressure (no, yes, unknown), high blood cholesterol (no, yes, unknown), diabetes (no, yes, unknown), and body mass index <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> unknown) were assessed as potential physiological mediators, since these factors were known to be associated with vegetarian <UNK> as well as being established cardiovascular risk <UNK> total fruit and vegetable intake, total dietary fibre, and total energy intake (each continuous) were assessed as possible relevant dietary factors. we assessed the effects of potential physiological mediators and possible relevant dietary factors by adding each variable one at a time to the previous model. an additional model was also fitted including all potential physiological mediators. to estimate the population impact of vegetarian diets on cardiovascular health, we assessed the absolute risk difference for each outcome between meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians. predicted incidence and absolute risk differences were presented as per <UNK> population over <UNK> years, and were estimated by use of hazard ratios and <UNK> confidence intervals expressed as floating absolute <UNK> which do not alter the value of the hazard ratios but assign an appropriate <UNK> confidence interval to all groups, including the reference group (thereby allowing an estimation of the uncertainty in the effect size in the reference group). in meat eaters, predicted incidence over this time period of each outcome was calculated as <UNK> where <UNK> incidence in meat <UNK> and represents the predicted <UNK> year survival (that is, non-incidence) in meat eaters. by subtracting this estimate of survival from <UNK> and multiplying by <UNK> the resulting estimate represents incidence per <UNK> population over <UNK> years. for all other diet groups, predicted incidence was calculated as <UNK> where hr represents the hazard ratio or confidence intervals for each outcome in that diet group. by applying hr or confidence interval estimates in each diet group as an exponential to survival in the reference group, srhr represents the predicted <UNK> year survival rate in the each of the other diet groups. absolute risk differences were then calculated as the crude differences between the predicted incidence per <UNK> population over <UNK> years between each diet group and the meat eaters. additional sensitivity analyses included analyses using baseline diet group only, excluding participants with less than five years of follow-up, including participants recruited via the postal method only, censoring at age <UNK> or setting entry time at age <UNK> to evaluate possible differences by age at event, and performing multiple imputation (with <UNK> imputations) for missing covariates. the percentages of missing values in the covariates were <UNK> for the townsend deprivation index, <UNK> for physical activity, <UNK> for education level, and less than <UNK> for each of the other covariates. we assessed heterogeneity in the associations between diet group and risk of ischaemic heart disease or stroke by sex, age at recruitment <UNK> or <UNK> years), smoking status (never, former, or current), body mass index <UNK> or <UNK> presence of risk factors (one or more of self reported history of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, or diabetes), and any long term treatment for any illness or condition (no, yes) by adding appropriate interaction terms to the cox models and testing for statistical significance of interaction across strata using likelihood ratio tests. all analyses were performed with stata version <UNK> or <UNK> (stata corp, tx, united states) and p values less than <UNK> were considered significant. patient and public involvement no members of the community or patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or implementation of the study. they were not asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. we are appreciative of our participants who, although not partners, were engaged in the progress of epic-oxford through follow-up questionnaires. the results are disseminated to study

including subtypes, in meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans in a cohort with a large proportion of non-meat eaters. we observed lower rates of ischaemic heart disease in fish eaters and vegetarians than in meat eaters, which appears to be at least partly due to lower body mass index and lower rates of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes associated with these diets. conversely, vegetarians had higher risks of haemorrhagic and total stroke. comparison with other studies in a collaborative meta-analysis of five previous prospective studies (adventist mortality

from ischaemic heart disease <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> than <UNK> in other analyses of death from ischaemic heart disease, the death rate ratios comparing vegetarians with

vegetarians with non-vegetarians (meat and fish eaters <UNK> the risk ratio for ischaemic heart disease comparing vegetarians with non-vegetarians was <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> for stroke, previous analyses, including one study that included epic-oxford data but with fewer cases than the present <UNK> reported no significant differences in stroke mortality by diet <UNK> and pooled analyses showed a similar <UNK> however, previous studies only reported on stroke <UNK> which might be strongly influenced by treatment as well as the underlying disease <UNK> and no studies were found which reported on the two subtypes of stroke. interpretation of results and implications the results of the present study showed that fish eaters and vegetarians had lower risks of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters. the associations were attenuated after adjustment for self reported high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, and body mass index, which suggests that part of the associations might be attributed to these factors. however, the lower risk in vegetarians and vegans remained marginally significant after adjustment for all of these factors. the reason for such differences is not certain, but could be partly attributed to lower concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c; or non-hdl-c concentrations as a surrogate) associated with meat-free <UNK> differences that were not fully accounted for by adjusting for self reported high blood cholesterol. previous meta-analyses of prospective studies showed that lower concentrations of non-hdl-c or ldl-c were associated with lower risks of ischaemic heart <UNK> furthermore, both randomised trials of statin <UNK> and mendelian randomisation <UNK> have confirmed a causal association of ldl-c with ischaemic heart disease. hence, fish eaters and vegetarians, who have lower non-hdl-c (table <UNK> or ldl-c than meat <UNK> could have lower risks of ischaemic heart disease. however, the possible beneficial roles of generally healthier diets that included high intakes of fruit and <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> cannot be excluded, despite little change in the hazard ratios after adjustment for these individual components. for stroke outcomes, the combined results from two randomised statin trials reported <UNK> higher risks of haemorrhagic stroke per <UNK> mmol/l reduction in <UNK> which are consistent with results of observational studies of cholesterol concentrations and haemorrhagic <UNK> a recent study that included observational and genetic evidence from china alongside the trial evidence from western countries has suggested this inverse association between ldl-c and haemorrhagic stroke might be <UNK> these previous studies corroborate the findings of the present study, indicating that vegetarians, who have relatively low ldl-c, had higher risks of haemorrhagic stroke. for ischaemic stroke, previous prospective studies and randomised trials have consistently shown weak positive associations of non-hdl-c or ldl-c levels with <UNK> which is supported by recent mendelian randomisation <UNK> this apparent discordance between previous evidence and those of the present study for ldl-c levels and ischaemic stroke suggests that other dietary factors associated with the lack of animal food consumption could contribute to the observed associations. results of several studies in japan, showing that individuals with a very low intake of animal products had an increased incidence and mortality from haemorrhagic and total stroke, and also a possibly higher risk of ischaemic stroke <UNK> suggest that some factors associated with animal food consumption might be protective for stroke. vegetarians and vegans in the epic-oxford cohort have lower circulating levels of several nutrients (eg, vitamin <UNK> vitamin <UNK> essential amino <UNK> and long chain <UNK> polyunsaturated fatty <UNK> and differences in some of these nutritional factors could contribute to the observed <UNK> serum concentrations of these nutritional factors and non-hdl-c have only been measured in a subset of the epic-oxford cohort, and therefore their role in the observed associations of vegetarian diets with ischaemic heart disease or stroke cannot be accurately determined in the current context, but should be further investigated. high blood pressure is an established major risk factor for both ischaemic heart disease and <UNK> and recent evidence confirmed this is true for all age groups, especially for haemorrhagic <UNK> however, given that the vegetarians in the epic-oxford study had lower blood pressure than the meat eaters, and the fact that the association between diet group and stroke risk became slightly stronger after adjustment for history of high blood pressure, this factor is unlikely to account for the higher risks of haemorrhagic and total stroke observed among vegetarians in the present study. furthermore, although differential treatment of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension in the different diet groups could influence their subsequent disease risk, this does not appear to be the case in the epic-oxford study; previous analyses in this cohort have shown that although vegetarians had lower use of drug treatment overall than non-vegetarians, no significant differences were seen in the use of specific treatments for high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, or diabetes by diet group, among those individuals who reported a diagnosis of these <UNK> misclassification of stroke cases, such as the misclassification of haemorrhagic stroke as ischaemic stroke, cannot be excluded as a possible explanation for the possibly discrepant results for ischaemic stroke, although previous adjudication studies of stroke types confirmed the reliability of hospital admission records and death certificates in the uk for diagnosis of stroke types in the uk population over this calendar <UNK> although age is also an important risk factor for both ischaemic heart disease and stroke, and meat eaters in the present study were on average <UNK> years older than the vegetarians, age is known accurately in our cohort, and therefore any potential confounding or cohort effect is accounted for by the analyses that use age as the underlying time variable and further adjust for calendar year of entry. the current study focused on the examination of risks associated with predefined dietary groups, and therefore the relative contributions of individual foods have not been assessed. future research could benefit from dose-response analyses of foods that distinguish the diet groups, including meat, fish, dairy, and eggs, to identify possible optimal levels of consumption for balancing risks from different outcomes. such analyses might be better performed in other large scale cohorts with greater numbers of people who consume these foods, or pooled analyses from multiple cohorts with varying levels of consumption. methods such as diet optimisation modelling or linear <UNK> could also be explored to identify optimal diets for disease prevention while respecting individual dietary choices. strengths and limitations the strengths of this study include a large sample size, a long follow-up, and outcome ascertainment by linkage to medical records that minimised the loss to follow-up. because the exposure of interest was distinct diet groups, defined by the exclusion of animal foods, the chance of misclassification of exposure was relatively low. long term adherence to diet groups in the cohort was also generally high, and where possible we updated the exposure and important confounders at <UNK> year follow-up to allow for any changes. the analyses also included adjustment for multiple confounders, assessment of several possible mediators, and sensitivity analyses to confirm the robustness of the results. among the limitations of the present study, diet group was self reported, and reasons for choosing each diet were not recorded. changes in diet group or other behaviours not captured by the follow-up were also possible, and the composition of vegetarian diets could have changed during follow-up owing to increasing availability of vegetarian foods, but differences in nutrient intakes between the diet groups were similar at baseline and at <UNK> reverse causality is possible but not likely, because the results were similar after we excluded the first five years of follow-up, and most participants had followed their current diet (eg, vegetarian) for more than five years at the time of recruitment. information on drug treatment use (including statins) at recruitment was not available. as with all observational studies, residual confounding from either dietary or non-dietary factors is possible, which might be particularly relevant if results were of borderline significance. generalisability could be limited, because the present study was based predominantly on white european individuals. conclusions overall, the present study has shown that uk adults who were fish eaters or vegetarians had lower risks of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters, but that vegetarians had higher risks of stroke. future work should include further measurements of circulating levels of cholesterol subfractions, vitamin <UNK> amino acids, and fatty acids in the cohort to identify which factors might mediate the observed associations. additional studies in other large scale cohorts with a high proportion of non-meat eaters are needed to confirm the generalisability of these results and assess their relevance for clinical practice and public health. what is already known on this topic vegetarian and vegan diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, but the potential benefits and hazards of these diets are not fully understood previous studies of two diet groups have reported that vegetarians have lower risks of ischaemic heart disease than non-vegetarians however, no evidence has been reported of a difference in the risk of mortality from stroke, possibly because of limited available data and lack of available evidence on stroke subtypes what this study adds this study showed that fish eaters and vegetarians (including vegans) had lower risks of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters vegetarians (including vegans) had higher risks of haemorrhagic and total stroke than meat eaters further research is needed to replicate these results in other populations and to identify mediators that might contribute to the observed associations
