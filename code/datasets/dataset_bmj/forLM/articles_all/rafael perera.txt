abstract objective to assess the effect of community prescribing of an antibiotic for acute respiratory infection on the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in an individual child. study design observational cohort study with follow-up at two and <UNK> weeks. setting general practices in oxfordshire. participants <UNK> children with acute respiratory tract infection, of whom <UNK> received a β lactam antibiotic. main outcome measures antibiotic resistance was assessed by the geometric mean minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for ampicillin and presence of the <UNK> resistance element in up to four isolates of haemophilus species recovered from throat swabs at recruitment, two weeks, and <UNK> weeks. results prescribing amoxicillin to a child in general practice more than triples the mean minimum inhibitory concentration for ampicillin <UNK> µg/ml v <UNK> µg/ml, <UNK> and doubles the risk of isolation of haemophilus isolates possessing homologues of <UNK> <UNK> v <UNK> relative risk <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> two weeks later. although this increase is transient (by <UNK> weeks ampicillin resistance had fallen close to baseline), it is in the context of recovery of the element from <UNK> of children with haemophilus isolates at recruitment and from <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> at some point in the study. conclusion the short term effect of amoxicillin prescribed in primary care is transitory in the individual child but sufficient to sustain a high level of antibiotic resistance in the population. go to: introduction the correlation between community use of penicillin and penicillin resistance across <UNK> european countries has recently been reported as <UNK> the regression line rises steeply—for example, in france the rate of penicillin prescribing is <UNK> times that in the united kingdom but the proportion of non-susceptible streptoccus pneumoniae is <UNK> times higher <UNK> v <UNK> this steep dose-effect relation contrasts starkly with the weak relation between antibiotic prescribing and resistance that we and others have previously reported from uk general <UNK> <UNK> although a strong correlation between antibiotic prescribing and resistance might seem inevitable from a darwinian perspective, the relation is <UNK> actual resistance levels will depend on the pattern of antibiotic use, the specific interaction between bacterium and drug, the potential for transmission, and the stage the country is at in the evolution of resistance. for example, sweden and denmark have higher rates of penicillin prescribing than the uk but lower resistance, while finland has lower prescribing but higher <UNK> similarly, community studies from iceland have shown that the association between a reduction in prescribing and resistance is not <UNK> <UNK> to develop an effective strategy to manage antibiotic resistance in the community we need to understand what is happening at the level of the individual patient, not just to inform care of patients but also to provide firm estimates for the population models that should inform policy on antibiotic prescribing. the highest rates of antibiotic prescribing in primary care are to children with respiratory illness but surprisingly there have been few prospective controlled studies of the impact of such prescribing on resistance in a community setting. in the <UNK> brook reported isolation of β lactam producing bacteria in <UNK> of children one week after antibiotic treatment of otitis media or pharyngitis and <UNK> after three months compared with a constant <UNK> in <UNK> a paper from malawi in <UNK> reported recovery of co-trimoxazole resistant pneumococci in <UNK> of children one week after malaria treatment with co-trimoxazole compared with <UNK> in controls but with no difference after four <UNK> an australian study in <UNK> reported a twofold increase in the odds of recovery of resistant pneumococci in children who had used β lactam antibiotics in the two months before swab <UNK> we report a prospective study in children from uk general practice with new methods for identifying a highly mobile integrative and conjugative element (ice) that encodes β lactamase and circulates among nasopharyngeal haemophilus <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> go to: methods participants general practitioners initially recruited <UNK> children aged <UNK> months to <UNK> years presenting with either otitis media or a suspected respiratory infection. thirty one were excluded from this analysis because they were prescribed a macrolide <UNK> co-amoxiclav <UNK> or received a further course of antibiotics at another consultation during the <UNK> week follow-up period <UNK> we therefore included <UNK> children, of whom <UNK> were prescribed a β lactam antibiotic (amoxicillin <UNK> cephradine <UNK> at presentation and <UNK> received no antibiotic. data collection and follow-up a research nurse collected information on sociodemographic details, type of infection, child's past antibiotic use, and treatment for current illness as well as obtaining ethical consent from the parent. information on antibiotic prescribing was confirmed from the medical records. children were followed up on two occasions, at two weeks and <UNK> weeks after recruitment. microbiology a trained research nurse took throat swabs. each cotton tipped wooden swab was transported in enriched tryptic soy broth. the samples were vortexed and the broth stored at <UNK> for batch processing. at the time of processing, <UNK> µl samples were inoculated onto two haemophilus selective media: columbia agar (enriched with haemin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) plus bacitracin, and the same agar with the addition of <UNK> µg/ml ampicillin. plates were incubated at <UNK> plus <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> hours. up to four morphologically different colonies were picked from the bacitracin plate and two morphologically different colonies from the ampicillin plate. the colonies were purified by subculturing on to chocolate agar. assessment of ampicillin minimum inhibitory concentration level (etest, ab biodisk, solna, sweden) was performed in accordance with us national committee of clinical and laboratory standards guidelines. the presence of the integrative and conjugative element homologous to <UNK> was performed following a method previously <UNK> with a multiplex assay targeting regions of the topoisomerase gene and orf <UNK> (as annotated in the complete sequence of <UNK> accession number <UNK> table <UNK>

gaa gc we looked for the integrative and conjugative element in the haemophilus species isolated from the bacitracin agar plate (which selects for haemophilus species and against other bacterial genera). we estimated the minimum inhibitory concentration for ampicillin from isolates selected from the ampicillin agar plate. the extent of double counting of isolates based on morphological appearance was assessed by comparing the dna sequences of regions of the mdh and frdb housekeeping genes in <UNK> isolates (four isolates from <UNK> plates). identical mdh and frdb alleles would suggest that strains of haemophilus species were indistinguishable. results showed no double counting of indistinguishable strains in <UNK> plates, one isolate double counted in <UNK> plates, and two isolates double counted in seven plates. we have therefore presented the integrative and conjugative element data using the child rather than the isolate as a denominator. analysis analysis of data was performed with spss for windows (version <UNK> we used the <UNK> test to compare categorical data between groups at each visit. as the minimum inhibitory concentration for ampicillin is highly skewed we applied a log transformation to this measurement and used geometric means to summarise this measure. we used t tests to compare the means between groups at each visit and paired t tests to compare the means within groups. where data are reported in relation to individual children rather than individual isolates, the denominator is limited to children in whom haemophilus species were isolated (because antibiotic resistance is a characteristic of the colonising bacterium, not of the child). as we recovered haemophilus species from nearly all children, however, the results would be similar if we included all children in the denominator. go to: results completeness of follow-up and recovery of target bacterium loss to follow-up was small: nine children <UNK> at two weeks, <UNK> children <UNK> at <UNK> weeks. recovery of haemophilus species was high and increased with each visit: <UNK> <UNK> children at baseline, <UNK> <UNK> at two weeks, and <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> weeks, with

haemophilus species were not isolated from every child at every visit (see text). go to: discussion the short term effect of amoxicillin prescribed in primary care is transitory in the individual child but sufficient to sustain a high level of antibiotic resistance in the population. the inclusion of commensal as well as pathogenic haemophilus species and the focus on mobile resistance elements allowed us to avoid the bias inherent in previous studies (that is, the differential recovery of bacteria in intervention and treatment groups). it also allowed us to characterise the bacterial flora from more than a single isolate even when we sampled by throat swab. although the design was observational, the similarity of baseline characteristics and levels of initial resistance, plus the lack of any suggestion that the integrative and conjugative element is associated with disease virulence or a pathogenic <UNK> <UNK> makes serious confounding unlikely. the integrative and conjugative element can be isolated from both pathogenic h influenzae and commensal h parainfluenzae and like a plasmid moves freely between them by horizontal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it is this global gene pool of transferable antibiotic resistance elements that maintains antibiotic resistance in the community. we recognise that other potential respiratory tract pathogens accrue resistance (including penicillin resistance in pneumococci and methicillin resistance in staphylococci) by mutation of chromosomal genes rather than conjugative mechanisms and therefore we cannot necessarily generalise our results to those species. our results, however, are consistent with the report by nasrin et al of a doubling of odds of isolation of penicillin resistant pneumococci from children who had received a β lactam antibiotic within two months but not six <UNK> prescribing antibiotics to children remains common practice. a paper published in <UNK> reported that <UNK> of children aged <UNK> years in the uk (the group of patients who receive most antibiotics in the community) receive an average of <UNK> prescriptions for a β lactam antibiotic from their general practitioner each <UNK> although a reduction in prescribing (and the strategy of recommending a <UNK> hour delay before filling antibiotic prescriptions) has probably resulted in about a <UNK> fall in consumption since <UNK> unpublished data reported to the paediatric subgroup of the standing advisory committee on antibiotic resistance suggest that community antibiotic prescribing is again rising. using our results to estimate the effect of this prescribing on resistance is not straightforward. if our ability to recover an integrative and conjugative element mirrors the change in transmission potential, the marginal effect of community prescribing on the proportion of children in the uk who are able to transmit an integrative and conjugative element at any one time is perhaps <UNK> however, this does not imply a marginal <UNK> impact on resistance because this is not a static system. for example, applying a transmission dynamics model to data from finland, austin et al showed that a paediatric prescribing rate of <UNK> days of antibiotics each year, and an estimated duration of carriage of a β lactamase producing strain of moraxella catarrhalis of just over one month, was consistent with an increase in community prevalence of these strains by about <UNK> a year to an equilibrium level of about <UNK> these parameter estimates are not dissimilar in magnitude to the prescribing rates cited above and the duration of increased recovery of the integrative and conjugative element we observed. clinical implications in the few cases where it is appropriate to repeat the prescription of an antibiotic within under three months, it may be sensible to choose one (for example, co-amoxiclav) that has activity against β lactamase producing strains, rather than give a further course of amoxicillin. from a population perspective, the issue of concern is the high (about <UNK> equilibrium level of recovery of resistant haemophilus species to which the children receiving antibiotics returned after <UNK> weeks and the endemic carriage of the integrative and conjugative element by nasopharyngeal haemophilus species. this may indicate that bacteria can adapt to carry the resistance element with minimal metabolic cost and therefore without much biological disadvantage in the absence of antibiotic selection. in this situation, the model proposed by austin et al further predicts that any reduction in community resistance is likely to need a substantial and sustained reduction in community <UNK> one option that deserves further investigation, and is supported by nasrin's <UNK> is to reduce the duration of each course of antibiotics prescribed in the community. a more radical option is to advise stopping prescribing antibiotics to any child with respiratory infection in the community except in well defined and exceptional circumstances. although such a strategy may be easier to implement than a discretionary policy based on the difficult, and perhaps impossible, clinical discrimination between viral and bacterial infection, it does run the risk of some children with bacterial disease being treated later in the course of their illness. what is already known on this topic uk general practitioners are strongly encouraged to reduce antibiotic prescribing to minimise the risk of antibiotic resistance epidemiological studies of the likely effect of reducing antibiotic prescribing outside hospital on antibiotic resistance have reported inconsistent results what this study adds prescribing amoxicillin to a child in general practice doubles the risk of recovering a β lactamase encoding resistance element from that child's throat two weeks later this risk falls back to the level seen before treatment within <UNK> weeks, but a β lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic should probably be prescribed during this period the <UNK> resistance element is endemic in uk children, but reversal of this will require further substantial and sustained changes in antibiotic prescribing in the community

abstract background: the charlson comorbidity index is widely used in <UNK> administrative data, however, there is no translation for read/oxmis coded data despite increasing use of the general practice research database (gprd). our main objective was to translate the charlson index for use with read/oxmis coded data such as the gprd and test its association with mortality. we also aimed to provide a version of the comorbidity index for other researchers using similar datasets. methods: two clinicians translated the charlson index into read/oxmis codes. we tested the association between comorbidity score and increased mortality in <UNK> <UNK> patients from the gprd using proportional hazards models. results: this read/oxmis translation of the charlson index contains <UNK> codes. our validation showed a strong positive association between charlson score and age. cox proportional models show a positive increasing association with mortality and charlson score. the discrimination of the logistic regression model for mortality was good (auc = <UNK> conclusion: we have translated a commonly used comorbidity index into read/oxmis for use in uk primary care databases. the translated index showed a good discrimination in our study population. this is the first study to develop a co-morbidity index for use with the read/oxmis coding system and the gprd. a copy of the comorbidity index is provided for other researchers using similar databases. background studies of patient health should take into consideration any independent predictors that will affect the outcome of interest. individual disease status is an important predictor of mortality and health care usage especially in studies of older patients, and in many cases, subjects may have more than one co-existing illness at the same time. investigators may wish to conduct risk adjustment for the additional health effects of these co-morbid diseases. previous research has led to the development of summary comorbidity measures which classify patients according to their disease burden <UNK> the most widely used and validated index of comorbidity was developed by charlson and colleagues in the late <UNK> <UNK> the charlson index includes <UNK> categories of comorbid disease weighted based on their association with <UNK> year allcause mortality. because the charlson index is weighted and allows for additive scoring, it can take into account both the number and the severity of comorbidity to provide a summary of disease burden for each individual patient <UNK> the index has been validated in several different populations, and has been widely used in studies involving cancer patients and survivors <UNK> recognizing the potential for its use in large database studies that require risk adjustment for individual patients, the charlson index has previously been adapted for use with administrative data <UNK> these adaptations involve searching individual level hospital claims data for codes corresponding to the charlson index categories. however, these adaptations generally apply only to <UNK> coded data, an international coding system for classification of diseases, symptoms and signs. there is no current translation of the charlson index for read and oxmis coded data, two systems which are based on <UNK> and are widely used in british primary care. data using the read and oxmis coding system has recently been made more readily available from the general practice research database (gprd), a uk-based database of clinical primary care records. the gprd is the world’s largest source of anonymised longitudinal data from primary care, and currently contains information on <UNK> million active patients from <UNK> general practices in the uk <UNK> with increasing use of the gprd for academic and epidemiological research, there is a need for a gprd-compatible research tool that will allow categorization and adjustment for patient comorbidity. the main aim of this paper is to develop a comorbidity index based on the charlson index for use with read/oxmis coded data. we also describe the performance of the new measure by testing whether comorbidity is associated with increased mortality in a cohort of patients from the gprd. it is our hope that the newly developed and tested translation of the charlson score can be used by other researchers working with read/oxmis coded data and the gprd. methods development of read/oxmis codes lists the original charlson index consists of <UNK> diagnostic categories which provide the basis for assigning weighted scores to each comorbid disease. deyo et al <UNK> describe a validated translation of each diagnostic category of the charlson index to <UNK> codes. we used the <UNK> codes suggested by deyo et al to guide development of the read/oxmis code lists used in this comorbidity index. figure <UNK> summarizes our process for translation of the index to read/oxmis codes using one of the charlson diagnostic categories, myocardial infarction, as an example. using definitions provided by deyo et al for each charlson diagnostic category, we searched the general practice research database medical dictionary (version <UNK> copyright © <UNK> for potentially relevant read/ oxmis codes. this dictionary includes the gprd medical code for the type of event, the read/oxmis code for the event and a description of the medical term. we identified potential read/oxmis terms using two search strategies. firstly, we used specific terms in the <UNK> cm description of the event to search the gprd dictionary. read codes have a hierarchical structure, with a top level code for a disease category branching into more precise and specific codes. therefore, our second strategy involved identifying relevant top level read codes and including all lower level codes. by using the wild card (*), and hierarchies of read codes, we generated a list of all potentially related codes. we conducted these read/oxmis searches for <UNK> of the diagnostic categories used in the charlson index. we treated the cancer codes separately, and included all read codes starting with ‘b’, but excluding all codes for benign cancer <UNK> cancer in situ <UNK> and neoplasms of uncertain behaviour <UNK> we tried to be over-inclusive in the searching and used broad search terms when possible. two clinicians experienced in the use of read codes (pwr and sh) independently reviewed the list of all read/oxmis codes identified through searches of the gprd medical dictionary. the clinicians selected relevant read/oxmis codes and rejected codes not corresponding to <UNK> codes used in the deyo adaptation of the charlson index. a third clinician resolved any disagreement on coding. we calculated the degree of inter-rater agreement between the two clinicians reviewing read/oxmis code lists using the kappa score, which provides an estimate of the level of agreement between the two raters above that occurring due to chance. the final list of read/oxmis codes in this adaptation of the charlson index is available in additional file <UNK> <UNK> read/oxmis codes were used in more than one diagnostic category. these overlaps only occurred between diabetes and peripheral vascular disease (i.e. ‘gangrene diabetic’ was coded as both ‘diabetes’ and ‘peripheral vascular disease’), and between diabetes and diabetes with complications. one clinician (pwr) determined that the codes should be classified as diabetes codes. data source the gprd is the world’s largest anonymised database of primary care records <UNK> practices participating in the gprd record data on clinical diagnoses, test results, prescriptions and referral data from primary care. clinical data is coded using read/oxmis codes, along with the date of original onset for chronic or recurrent conditions. gprd recording guidelines direct practices to provide a record of all significant morbidity events in the patient’s medical history, including a summary of events that occurred before the patient joined the practice <UNK> the data from practices undergoes quality control procedures and several validation studies have shown a high level of data completeness within the gprd <UNK> validation dataset as part of a study looking at the unmet needs of longterm survivors of cancer, we received a dataset containing primary care records between <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> for all patients in the gprd with a diagnosis of breast, colorectal or prostate cancer and more than five years survival. we also received data on a control population of patients with no record of breast, colorectal or prostate cancer, matched to the cancer survivors by age, gender and practice on a ratio of <UNK> the dataset included data on <UNK> breast cancer survivors, <UNK> colorectal cancer survivors, <UNK> prostate cancer survivors, and <UNK> control patients (total n = <UNK> <UNK> patients). we used individual level clinical data in this dataset to test the adapted charlson index. assessing the comorbidity measure following translation of the charlson index to read/ oxmis codes, we tested whether an increasing comorbidity score was associated with increased patient mortality. to achieve this, we applied the adapted weighted charlson index to the patient cohort obtained from the gprd. our adapted comorbidity score used the original charlson score which does not include age, however, charlson and colleagues have also developed a combined age-comorbidity index <UNK> cox proportional hazards models were fit with mortality from july <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> august <UNK> as the dependent variable. charlson score was coded as a continuous ordinal indicator variable, and was included along with age as explanatory variables. survival was measured in days and associations are reported using hazard ratios with charlson score of <UNK> as the referent group. all analyses were conducted using stata mp (version <UNK> college station, tx). discriminatory power of the model the area under a receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve, or c-statistic, can be used to quantify how well a predictor based on a number of variables discriminates a dichotomous outcome <UNK> we used a logistic model to estimate the relationship between death (dichotomous outcome coded <UNK> and the charlson index, after adjusting for age, quintiles of the the index of multiple deprivation (imd) and gender, before producing the roc curve. model discrimination was assessed by the area under the roc curve. adjusting variables we included age in <UNK> gender and socioeconomic status in the models for adjustment. age was categorized in <UNK> groups of similar sizes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the gprd dataset includes an index of multiple deprivation (imd) score to estimate socioeconomic status at practice level. the imd covers a range of indicators including income, employment, health deprivation and disability, education, skills and training, housing, and geographical access to services for each small area in the uk <UNK> imd scores were grouped into quintiles based on the spread of scores within each country in the uk. results coding exercise the inter-rater agreement between the two clinicians for including read/oxmis codes in the charlson index was <UNK> with a kappa of <UNK> indicating a moderate level of agreement <UNK> including the cancer codes, a total of <UNK> read/oxmis codes were included in this adaptation of the charlson index. characteristics of the cohort the mean age of the cohort was <UNK> (sd <UNK> and <UNK> of the patients were female. the high percentage of female patients is due to the high proportion of breast cancer survivors and gender matched controls in the cohort. table <UNK> shows the frequency and percentages of patients with each of the diagnoses included in the comorbidity index. the original charlson index weights each disease category on the strength of its association with mortality. using the original charlson weights for each disease category, the breakdown by index score in our dataset is shown in figure <UNK> most of the patients in the validation dataset had no comorbid disease (n = <UNK> there were a few patients with a very high charlson score above <UNK> there was a strong positive association between increasing charlson score and increasing age (p < <UNK> patient mortality in total, <UNK> patients died during the five-year period from july <UNK> <UNK> to august <UNK> <UNK> figure <UNK> shows the survival curves for the population stratified according to charlson score. mortality was significantly associated with a charlson score of <UNK> or more, with a positive increasing association as charlson score increases (table <UNK> there was an increased risk of death amongst older patients and amongst males. discrimination of the model the discrimination of the logistic regression model was good, with an area under the curve (auc) of <UNK> (figure <UNK> this indicates that the adaptation of the charlson index is a good predictor of mortality in the validation dataset. discussion we have translated a commonly used comorbidity index into read/oxmis codes for use with uk primary care databases. in a cohort of cancer survivors and matched controls, a higher comorbidity score in this adaption of the charlson index was associated with an increased risk of mortality after adjusting for age, deprivation scores and gender. the translated comorbidity index showed a good discrimination our study population. to our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a comorbidity index for use with this disease coding system. although this adaptation of the charlson index can be applied to any read/oxmis coded dataset, we hope that our adapted version of the charlson index will be especially useful to the increasing number of researchers conducting work using the gprd. gprd data provides an opportunity to conduct large scale epidemiological research in primary health care use, health outcomes and pharmacology. the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mrha), which manages the gprd, has recently announced plans to link gprd data with hospital episodes statistics (hes), cancer registrations and office for national statistics databases. these linkages will increase the value of conducting research using the gprd, as researchers will be able to trace patient pathways through primary and secondary care. our adaptation of the charlson index is available in additional file <UNK> and can be imported into statistical software for use with other datasets. this index can be used to quickly categorize patients into different comorbidity levels, and will add explanatory power when conducting analyses using read/oxmis coded datasets and the gprd. we tested the association between increasing charlson score and mortality, which was the primary outcome used in the development of the original score. our results confirm the hypothesis that patients with a greater burden of disease will die sooner. one unexpected result was a large jump in the risk of mortality in patients with a charlson score of <UNK> or above. this is likely due to the number of patients in our cohort with metastatic cancer, which generally has a very poor prognosis in the small but high risk group of patients with a score of <UNK> or more <UNK> limitations this comorbidity index performed well in our validation exercise, however, there are several areas where the model may be inadequate. firstly, it is possible that some codes were not included when developing the read/oxmis code lists for assessment. by using broad search terms, hierarchical searches of read codes, and two reviewers to independently assess records, fewer potentially relevant read/oxmis codes were excluded from the final adaptation of the charlson index. secondly, we used the original disease weights developed by the authors of the original charlson index almost twenty years ago. one recent criticism of the charlson index is that certain diseases have an improved prognosis since the original score was developed. for instance, according to the original charlson weighting, a positive aids disease status carries an equivalent mortality risk to a diagnosis of metastatic cancer. only eight patients in our dataset were diagnosed with aids, therefore, this issue is unlikely to affect our validation results. in studies where a larger proportion of individuals are hiv/aids positive, investigators may wish to use updated weights for hiv/aids taking into account that the burden of disease and mortality is lower now than in the <UNK> <UNK> thirdly, recording of clinical outcomes in primary care settings may be incomplete; a recent study demonstrated that even major outcomes such as cancer may not be recorded in patient electronic records <UNK> although the gprd data is subject to a number of quality checks, it is possible that disease recording is incomplete. however, many of the previous adaptations of the charlson index have used administrative data, where patient history and comorbid disease may not be as recorded as accurately as the clinical data available in datasets such as the gprd <UNK> omissions of major comorbid diseases can result in an incorrect final charlson score in any study. these omissions are not an intrinsic limitation in the tool that we have developed, but may affect its functional ability in datasets such as the gprd. future work should continue to validate the accuracy of disease coding in administrative datasets and the gprd. our validation population of long-term cancer survivors is unusual; these patients are older and sicker than the general population. the cancer survivors have a charlson score of at least <UNK> and a high proportion are female owing to the high number of breast cancer survivors. other patient cohorts using this adapted comorbidity index will likely have different trends in mortality and consultation behaviour. future studies should apply this charlson adaptation to other study populations to measure mortality and use of primary care services. we were also unable to consider race or ethnicity in the analysis as this information is not routinely collected in the gprd. these limitations, however, do not affect the development and translation of the charlson index to read/oxmis codes, but may affect the results of the validation exercise. conclusions in conclusion, we have developed an adaptation of the charlson comorbidity index for use in read/oxmis databases and the gprd which predicts <UNK> mortality in a cohort of patients. our adaptation is provided in a downloadable format (additional file <UNK> for other researchers using similar databases. with increasing use of large datasets for epidemiological research, researchers must consider how disease status will affect their outcomes of interest. tools such as the charlson index can provide a summary of comorbidity for use in large studies, and this paper demonstrates the utility of an adaptation of the charlson score in primary care coded data.

a b s t r a c t background this is an update of a cochrane review first published in the cochrane library in issue <UNK> <UNK> otitis media with effusion (ome) or ’glue ear’ is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or infection. it is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of ’grommets’. potential treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. autoinflation devices have been proposed as a simple mechanical means of improving ’glue ear’. objectives to assess the effectiveness of autoinflation compared with no treatment in children and adults with otitis media with effusion. search methods we searched the cochrane ear, nose and throat disorders group trials register; the cochrane central register of controlled trials (central); pubmed; embase; cinahl; web of science; biosis previews; cambridge scientific abstracts; ictrp and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. the date of the most recent search was <UNK> april <UNK> selection criteria we selected randomised controlled trials that compared any form of autoinflation to no autoinflation in individuals with ’glue ear’. data collection and analysis two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included studies. main results eight studies, with a total of <UNK> participants, met the inclusion criteria. overall, the studies were predominantly assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias; unclear risk was mainly due lack of information. there was no evidence of selective reporting. pooled estimates favoured the intervention, but did not show a significant effect on tympanometry (type <UNK> and b) at less than one month, nor at more than one month. similarly, there were no significant changes for discrete pure-tone audiometry and non- discrete audiometry. pooled estimates favoured, but not significantly, the intervention for the composite measure of tympanogram or audiometry at less than one month; at more than one month the result became significant (rri <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a politzer device under one month (rri <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> and over one month (rri <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> none of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions. authors’ conclusions all of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow-up. however, because of the low cost and absence of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. primary care could prove a beneficial place to evaluate such interventions and there is ongoing research in this area. further research should also consider the duration of treatment, the long-term impact on developmental outcomes in children and additional quality of life outcome measures for children and families. p l a i n l a n g u a g e s u m m a r y autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (glue ear) otitis media with effusion (ome) or ’glue ear’ is very common in children and the hearing loss and discomfort, especially where the effusion is bilateral and long-lasting, may lead to problems with language, development and behaviour. there are a number of treatment options including steroids, antibiotics, decongestants, antihistamines and surgery (the insertion of grommets (ventilation tubes)). grommet insertion is one of the commonest operations of childhood. the best treatment strategy remains controversial, however, as glue ear often resolves spontaneously within a few months. autoinflation is a technique whereby the eustachian tube (the tube that connects the middle ear and the back of the nose) is reopened by raising pressure in the nose. this can be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose, blowing up a balloon through each nostril or using an anaesthetic mask. the aim is to introduce air into the middle ear, via the eustachian tube, equalising the pressures and allowing better drainage of the fluid. this review included eight randomised controlled trials of autoinflation for glue ear. all of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow-up. the reviewauthors used a combined outcomemeasurewhich included any outcome signifying improvement (as defined in the individual studies) and measured outcomes at the time points ’up to one month’ and ’more than one month’. improvement was demonstrated only in ’more than one month’ analyses. subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a politzer device at both under one month and over one month. none of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions. the authors conclude that the evidence for the use of autoinflation in the short term appears favourable. given the small number of studies and the lack of long-term follow-up, the long-term effects associated with the use of these devices cannot be determined. b a c k g r o u n d this is an update of a cochrane review first

forcing of air through, the eustachian tube by the raising of intranasal pressure. this may be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose, blowing up a balloon through each nostril, use of an anaesthetic mask or a politzer device. the aim of these procedures is to introduce air into the middle ear, via the eustachian tube, to equilibrate the pressures. this is most likely to help in

primary care physicians or specialists using tympanometry (type b or <UNK> either alone or in combination with simple or pneumatic otoscopy or audiometry. the type of diagnosis used in each trial is presented in the table characteristics of included studies. types of interventions we included trials that studied any form of autoinflation (a technique to increase intranasal pressure repeatedly either through a nasal balloon or by other methods) compared to no autoinflation and which were unconfounded. by unconfounded, we mean studies where the two groups were treated equally, except for the provision of the intervention to one group. other treatments (e.g. analgesia, decongestants or short courses of antibiotics) were permitted provided these were provided equally. autoinflation interventions were classified into similar groups by an ent surgeon, based on the description of the intervention whilst blinded to the outcomes of the study (see appendix <UNK> for a brief description of the interventions). types of outcome measures primary outcomes • improvement in tympanogram (to type <UNK> or a tympanogram) • differences in hearing level on pure-tone audiogram (average <UNK> db improvement over the frequencies <UNK> hz to <UNK> hz) • improvement measured as a composite of change in tympanogram and/or audiometry (post hoc) secondary outcomes • adverse effects of autoinflation • presence or absence of fluid in middle ear cavity time points of outcome assessment • up to and including one month from commencement of autoinflation • more than one month

<UNK> pubmed; embase; cinahl; lilacs; koreamed; indmed; pakmedinet; cab abstracts;web of science; isrctn; clinicaltrials.gov; ictrp; google scholar and google. we modelled subject strategies for databases on the search strategy designed for central. where appropriate, we combined subject strategies with adaptations of the highly sensitive search strategy designed by the cochrane collaboration for identifying randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials (as described in the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions version <UNK> box <UNK> (handbook <UNK> search strategies for major databases including central are provided in appendix <UNK> searching other resources we scanned the reference lists of identified publications for additional trials and contacted trial authors where necessary. in addition, we searched pubmed, tripdatabase, the cochrane library and google to retrieve existing systematic reviews relevant to this systematic review, so that we could scan their reference lists for additional trials. we searched for conference abstracts using the cochrane ear, nose and throat disorders group trials register. data collection and analysis selection of studies the trials search co-ordinator of the cochrane ear, nose and throat disorders group assessed abstracts of all studies identified by the initial search and excluded clearly irrelevant studies. one review author assessed abstracts for relevance and we obtained full texts for these. two review authors independently assessed all full-text articles. differences in opinion about inclusion of studies were resolved by discussion with a third review author. the review authors were not blind to the journal of origin, the authors, the institutions or the magnitude of results. data extraction and management two reviewauthors independently extracted study data using standardised forms. we entered data into revman <UNK> (revman <UNK> and a second review author checked the data. data extracted and presented included: author, publication year, journal, participants (numbers, duration of illness, demographics, characteristics of the disease, etc.),

data synthesis we carried out analysis on the basis of intention-to-treat. where possible we combined data to give a summary measure of effect. when outcome data obtained were binary - recovered or improved glue ear or audiometry improvement - we used relative risks of improvement to compare interventions. the data reported in the trials mainly used ’ears’ as their analysis unit despite using individuals as randomisation units. to correct for this and to give adequate weight to the studies we adjusted the outcomes using the ’design effect’, which takes into consideration the association found in using both ears from the same individual (deeks <UNK> we estimated the ’design effects’ fromthe blanshard data (full data set provided by author) at one month and three months for participants with either types b or <UNK> tympanograms or only type b tympanograms. minor differences in correlation between intervention and control groups (smaller at three months) were found, but an average was used, as differences could be due to sampling variation. for participants with type b or <UNK> tympanograms the design effect at one month was <UNK> while at three months it was <UNK> for participants with only type b tympanograms the design effect was <UNK> for both one and three months follow-up. we used the appropriate design effect (for less than one month or more than one month by tympanogram type at entry) to obtain adjusted risk ratios (rr) for all studies that provided data for the outcome. we calculated and then entered the log(rr) and the se(log(rr)) into revman <UNK> (revman <UNK> as the focus of the review is on recovery/improvement we emphasise the use of a positive outcome and refer to the rr obtained as the ’relative risk of improvement’ or rri; instead of using the term risk ratio which is normally associated with a negative outcome (e.g. death). when data were continuous, we used mean differences to compare interventions. we used the giv (generic inverse variance) method with a random-effects model to pool studies together and examined heterogeneity using <UNK> test and <UNK> statistic. funnel plots were not used as the number of studies found was too small for these to provide relevant information. we carried out analyses using revman <UNK> subgroup analyses subgroup analyses had been planned on the basis of the diagnosis of otitis media with effusion and the extent of the hearing loss measured on audiometry. however, insufficient studies were identified to allow these analyses. we also planned subgroups according to age (under three years, three to <UNK> years and over <UNK> years). however, we could not identify any papers of sufficient quality including children aged under three years and only one paper included children over <UNK> years (lesinskas <UNK> r e s u l t s description of studies results of the search from the <UNK> update searches, we retrieved a total of <UNK> references. following first-level screening (i.e.

<UNK> reported improvement in tympanometric peak pressure (tpp) and hearing recovery (used as primary outcome of improvement in the pooled estimate). none of the studies reported developmental test results, behavioural test results, language and speech development, quality of life or family function. d i s c u s s i o n overall autoinflation appears to have a beneficial effect on the resolution of glue ear, with a low incidence of adverse side effects (table <UNK> six of the eight studies showed beneficial effects at least in the short term(maximumduration of follow-up in the included studies was three months), while one of the two that reported a negative effect in the short term reported a positive effect in the long term (two months). this is in keeping with a previous systematic review on the use of autoinflation (reidpath <UNK> this reviewconcludes that the evidence for the use of autoinflation in the treatment of glue ear in children is conflicting but suggests that it may be of clinical benefit in the short term. there are several limitations in the collection and interpretation of the findings. the type of device used may be critical in determining the benefits of autoinflation. pooled effect estimates suggest politzerisation to be more effective than the classic otovent® device or carnival blower with a balloon attached. however, both papers that used politzerisation as themethod of autoinflation had slightly different entry criteria to the rest. they were deemed suitable for inclusion in this review as they both used multiple criteria to make the diagnosis of otitis media with effusion (ome) (hearing loss, tympanometry and, in one paper, otoscopy). information in this area is sparse. a study (hanner <UNK> not part of this review) comparing two differentmethods of autoinflation (valsalva versus otovent®) did not identify a difference between them, however a reanalysis of their data showed a significant difference in favour of otovent® (relative risk of improvement (rri) <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval (ci) <UNK> to <UNK> duration of treatment and follow-up also appear to be factors in determining the effects of autoinflation. autoinflation seems more beneficial in the short term (one month or less of treatment) than in the longer term. paradoxically the meta-analysis of composite outcomes shows the relative risk of improvement at one month or less to be non-significant (rri <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> whilst the relative risk of improvement at more than one month is significant (rri <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> the results are affected by the two studies that found autoinflation to be markedly worse than control at least in the short term (brooker <UNK> de nobili <UNK> leading to significant heterogeneity <UNK> = <UNK> the study by brooker <UNK> did not continue follow-up for longer than one month, therefore it was not included in the composite outcomes at longer time frames. the study by de nobili <UNK> reported percentage of ears at different tympanogram levels (b, <UNK> <UNK> and a) at baseline, <UNK> days and two months. for our calculations we have assumed that all ears in the category b and <UNK> are included and ears in categories a and <UNK> will not revert to worse tympanograms. de nobili <UNK> reports a positive difference (in favour of autoinflation) for the two-month follow-up. a final important difference is that for this study most omes are resolved within the two months of follow-up; five out of <UNK> ears remain as <UNK> or b. several differences were noted in the duration of the intervention (range <UNK> days to threemonths) and also in the duration of follow-up, ranging from cessation of the intervention to two months after the intervention. only three studies continued to follow up participants after the intervention had ceased (arick <UNK> lesinskas <UNK> stangerup <UNK> for these reasons it is difficult to determine whether the benefits of autoinflation are sustained after treatment. the combined effects show a mixed pattern of autoinflation, with both statistical and clinical heterogeneity. considerable heterogeneity may be due to the populations, the intervention or the outcome definitions. one study (brooker <UNK> found autoinflation to be worse than control; another (denobili <UNK> showed it to be worse in the short term <UNK> days) but better in the long term (two months). the children in brooker’s study are comparable to those in other studies in terms of age, but there are few data with which to compare the prognostic characteristics of the control and intervention groups in this study with the other studies. for de nobili <UNK> it is difficult to assess if the assumption made about the change in tympanogram for ears is potentially affecting the results (no data on improvement at ear or individual level are provided). brooker’s populations may be different to those of other studies in that the proportion of controls recovering in this trial was much higher than in any other studies. a possible reason for this is the outcome reported, which is a composite of improvement in pure-tone audiogram and tympanogram. another difference is that it is suggested in the paper that only children with type b tympanograms were included, but this was not clearly stated. hence, heterogeneity could be explained if autoinflation is helpful to children with type <UNK> but not type b tympanograms. subgroup analyses of the blanshard <UNK> and stangerup <UNK> papers suggest that this might be the case (although the effect size is not statistically significant in either subgroup). finally, brooker did not use a standardised otovent® device, instead using a carnival blower and balloon. this may be a less effective or even harmful method of autoinflation, however the independent rater classified this intervention to be equivalent to otovent®. the studies mainly gave information on tympanometry and composite outcomes. autoinflation does not appear to improve puretone audiometry thresholds. only one study reported otoscopy findings so it is difficult to comment on this outcome. reduction of hearing loss is an important outcome for children and parents, but there was little evidence within the included studies to address the impact of hearing loss. the development of a quality of life questionnaire specifically for children with hearing loss means that the impact of hearing loss could be assessed in future studies (umansky <UNK> however, it appeared that autoinflation was beneficial at one and twomonths. a large primary care study is in progress (williamson <UNK> which will report on one and three-month outcomes. adverse events do not appear to differ significantly between intervention and control groups. data for compliance were variable. there is some anecdotal evidence that some children, possibly in selected groups, do get pain when undertaking autoinflation and that continued enthusiasm for the procedure over time can wane. blanshard <UNK> comments that “significant improvementwas seen only in those who used the treatment with a high compliance for the duration of the study”. more details on adverse events and compliance are needed from trials, along with evidence on how to achieve good compliance. limitations the heterogeneity of trial designs, inclusion criteria, interventions, outcome reporting and time scalesmakes it difficult to drawrobust conclusions. another factor that affects validity is the variation in the level of data analysis. most studies used ears as their data analysis unit, but some used patients. to overcome this problem we estimated thewithin-patient correlation. furthermore, some studies reported their outcomes as continuous variables and some as dichotomous variables. definitions of improvement varied in the studies that reported dichotomous outcomes. the quality of the trials was variable, in particular none of the studies used blinding of participants or assessors and some studies used inferior methods of randomisation. one of the major concerns in children with glue ear is possible developmental sequelae; none of the included papers looked at this issue. currently there are no proven treatments that affect speech and language development, including grommets (browning <UNK> therefore, it is not possible to say whether the statistically significant improvements in tympanometry translate into clinically significant benefits. this is an important consideration when reviewing treatments for a self limiting condition such as otitis media with effusion; there is a real possibility that watchful waiting without interventionmay have similar long-term outcomes to other interventions. a u t h o r s ’ c o n c l u s i o n s implications for practice although this analysis does not enable us to make any firm conclusions, the evidence appears favourable at least in the short term. therefore, it may be reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion (ome). one particular concern is the level of adherence: are the child and parent willing to tolerate the inconvenience of the procedure? a recent cochrane review has concluded that the benefits of grommets for ome compared to watchful waiting are small and then diminish over time (browning <UNK> currently most autoinflation interventions are instigated in secondary care.with increased awareness and the ability to instruct and educate parents and children in their use, this intervention would be well suited to primary care and there is ongoing research in this area (williamson <UNK> the use of a politzer device appears promising, however due to the limited amount of information available it is difficult to make any definitive recommendation. none of these trials provided data on long-term sequelae such as language development. however, the trials of ventilation tubes suggest there is little longterm impact achieved through treatment of otitis media with effusion (browning <UNK> implications for research all of the studies we included were small and of limited duration of treatment and follow-up. further studies with larger numbers of participants and longer duration of intervention, completed in primary care, are much needed. studies need to provided further evidence on adverse events and treatment compliance. further studies should also consider the impact of autoinflation on both developmental and hearing loss outcomes in children with otitis media with effusion. the heterogeneity suggests that the method of autoinflation, including the device used, may be important and thismerits further investigation. studies looking at factors predicting which children may benefit from autoinflation would help in identifying subgroups of children for whom autoinflation could be recommended. future work could also include the possibility of investigating whether autoinflation is effective in preventing disease relapses in children prone to ome. a c k n owl e d g e m e n t s we are grateful to all authors who supplied us with additional

a b s t r a c t background people with type <UNK> diabetes mellitus are at increased risk from cardiovascular disease. dietary <UNK> polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) are known to reduce triglyceride levels, but their impact on cholesterol levels, glycemic control and vascular outcomes are not well known. objectives to determine the effects of <UNK> pufa supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes, cholesterol levels and glycemic control in people with type <UNK> diabetes mellitus. search methods we carried out a comprehensive search of the cochrane library,medline, embase, bibliographies of relevant papers and contacted experts for identifying additional trials. selection criteria all randomised controlled trials were included where <UNK> pufa supplementation or dietary intake was randomly allocated and unconfounded in people with type <UNK> diabetes. authors of large trials were contacted for missing information. data collection and analysis trialswere assessed for inclusion. authorswere contacted formissing information.datawas extracted and quality assessed independently in duplicate. fixed-effect meta-analysis was carried out. main results twenty three randomised controlled trials <UNK> participants) were included with a mean treatment duration of <UNK> weeks. the mean dose of <UNK> pufa used in the trials was <UNK> g/d. no trials with vascular events or mortality endpoints were identified. among those taking <UNK> pufa triglyceride levels were significantly lowered by <UNK> mmol/l <UNK> confidence interval (ci) <UNK> to - <UNK> p < <UNK> and vldl cholesterol lowered by <UNK> mmol/l <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> p = <UNK> ldl cholesterol levels were raised by <UNK> mmol/l <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> p = <UNK> no significant change in or total or hdl cholesterol, <UNK> fasting glucose, fasting insulin or body weight was observed. the increase in vldl remained significant only in trials of longer duration and in hypertriglyceridemic patients. the elevation in ldl cholesterol was non-significant in subgroup analyses. no adverse effects of the intervention were reported. authors’ conclusions <UNK> pufa supplementation in type <UNK> diabetes lowers triglycerides and vldl cholesterol, butmay raise ldl cholesterol (although results were non-significant in subgroups) and has no statistically significant effect on glycemic control or fasting insulin. trials with vascular events or mortality defined endpoints are needed. p l a i n l a n g u a g e s u m m a r y <UNK> polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) for type <UNK> diabetes mellitus people with type <UNK> diabetes are known to be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (such as heart attack or stroke). type <UNK> diabetes mellitus is the fourth leading cause of death in developed countries with a two fold excess mortality and a two to four fold increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. the typical dyslipidemia (abnormality in blood lipids) associated with type <UNK> diabetes is a combination of hypertriglyceridemia (high levels of fats (triglycerides) in the blood), low levels of hdl (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol and abnormal ldl (low density lipoprotein) composition. low levels ofhdl cholesterol and high levels of ldl cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, while the raised levels of triglycerides are less clearly linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. several pharmacologic approaches have been used to treat diabetic dyslipidemia and standard dietary approaches focus on restriction of saturated fat and limitation of simple carbohydrate and alcohol intake. in the late <UNK> several investigators reported on the use of dietary supplementation with fish oil as a means of treating diabetic dyslipidemia. dietary fats and oils from different sources differ considerably in their fatty acid composition. animal fat is rich in saturated fatty acids, vegetable and marine oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. most fish oils are of the so-called <UNK> variety <UNK> polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas)). we identified <UNK> randomised trials (maximumduration of eightmonths) including <UNK> people in which <UNK> pufa was compared to a vegetable oil or placebo. none of the trials looked at cardiovascular endpoints in cardiovascular disease or death as an outcome measure. the review shows that although some types of fat in the blood are reduced through <UNK> supplementation, others including ldl cholesterol (which may promote heart disease) were increased. control of blood sugar levels was not affected by the treatment. there were no other adverse effects of the interventions noted. clinical outcome trials of sufficient duration are required to establish conclusively the role of <UNK> pufa in type <UNK> diabetes but our results do not suggest a major harmful effect on the balance of blood fats and confirm that it has no adverse affect on blood sugar control. b a c k g r o u n d description of the condition diabetes mellitus is ametabolic disorder resulting froma defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. a consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. for a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under ’additional information’ in the information on the metabolic and endocrine disorders group in the cochrane library (see ’about the cochrane collaboration’, ’collaborative review groups’). for an explanation of methodological terms, see the main glossary in the cochrane library. type <UNK> diabetes mellitus is the fourth leading cause of death in developed countries with a two fold excess mortality and a two to four fold

levels of ldl cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd), while the raised levels of triglycerides are less clearly linked to an increased risk of cvd. several pharmacologic approaches have been used to treat diabetic dyslipidemia (ada <UNK> these include use of <UNK> <UNK> coenzyme a (hmg co-a) reductase inhibitors (promoting the removal of ldl cholesterol from the blood) (pyorala <UNK> fibric acid derivatives (exact mechanism of action unclear, but probably includes stimulating triglyceride breakdown and ldl cholesterol removal fromthe blood) (elkeles

of the native inhabitants of greenland (inuits) (mouraoff <UNK> despite ingesting up to <UNK> percent of calories as fat (predominantly of marine origin), this population had a lower incidence of coronary heart disease compared to individuals with similar fat intake on a more conventional diet (bang <UNK> dietary fats and oils from different sources differ considerably in their fatty acid composition. animal fat is rich in saturated fatty acids. vegetable and marine oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. polyunsaturated fatty acids are characterised by the presence of more than one double bond (allowing themto stay liquid at very low temperatures). the designation using <UNK> or the greek symbol omega- <UNK> or <UNK> and <UNK> has been applied in the case of fatty acids with the first double bond three or six carbon atoms from the end of the chain. most fish oils are of the <UNK> variety and most vegetable oils are of the <UNK> variety, although alpha-linoleic acid is an <UNK> fatty acid found in canola oil. the <UNK> fatty acids found in fish oils are predominantly eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) or docosahexaenoic acid (dha). how the intervention might work the beneficial effect of marine-derived <UNK> pufa on cardiac risk markers and on lowering cardiovascular mortality and sudden death in the general population have previously been reported in the gissi-prevenzione (gissi <UNK> and dart <UNK> trials (burr <UNK> and in a subsequentmeta-analysis (bucher <UNK> the results of a later secondary prevention trial on coronary heart disease (chd) and

benefit <UNK> pufa in people with diabetes has been shown in two previous reviews. in a previous review of the role of <UNK> pufa in diabetes (friedberg <UNK> benefit in reducing triglyceride levels was suggested. however, the authors included non-randomized studies and studies including people with both type <UNK> and type <UNK> diabetes. their review included studies up to june <UNK> concerns were also raised about the possibility of harm from <UNK> pufa supplementation. early non-randomised studies in patients with type <UNK> diabetes suggested that <UNK> pufa might be associated with a deterioration in glycemic control (friday <UNK> glauber <UNK> this concern was addressed in the first publication of this systematic review, which showed that <UNK> pufa supplementation has no adverse effects on glycemic control (farmer <UNK> <UNK> why it is important to do this review the first publication of this cochrane review was limited to randomized trials involving patientswith type <UNK> diabetes and included searches for trials up to september <UNK> (farmer <UNK> the current review includes randomised trials searched up to september <UNK> and differs to our previous review in the following respects: • title was changed from ’fish oil in people with type <UNK> diabetes mellitus’ to <UNK> polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) for type <UNK> diabetes mellitus’; • first author was changed to janine hartweg; • change in outcomes from baseline to end-of-trial was used to calculate the pooled effect sizes; • a further five trials up to <UNK> were identified and included in the analysis; • two further outcomes are included in addition to those previously pooled. we therefore set out to update our previous systematic review of dietary supplementation using <UNK> pufa among peoplewith type <UNK> diabetesmellitus. although our primary aimwas to identify trials in whichmorbidity was studied, we also identified secondary aims of establishing the extent to which changes in serum lipids and deterioration in glucose control occurs following <UNK> pufa supplementation . o b j e c t i v e s to assess the effects of <UNK> pufa supplementation on death and vascular events in peoplewith type <UNK> diabetesmellitus.we also wished to establish changes in lipids and whether deterioration in glucose control occurs. m e t h o d s criteria for considering studies for this review types of studies papers of any language were considered. trials were eligible if they were randomized placebo or vegetable oil controlled trials of <UNK> polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) (including crossover trials) as the only intervention in participants with type <UNK> diabetes. as no phase-specific information was available for crossover trials, data were used only from the first intervention period to prevent measurements from the second period being affected by effects carried over from the first intervention period. where serial measurement of an outcome was given during the intervention phase, data were obtained from the final measurement since thatmeasurement was considered the conclusion of the study. the effect of trial design was explored in a sensitivity analysis. types of participants adults with type <UNK> diabetes mellitus. the diagnosis of type <UNK> diabetes among the participants of trials included in the review was established using the standard criteria valid at the time of the beginning of the trial. types of interventions trials in which participants were randomised to any type of dietary supplementation with <UNK> pufa were included. no restrictions were imposed on dose or formulation, although trials where the effect of <UNK> pufa could not be separated from the effect of simultaneously applied interventions, such as exercise or monounsaturated fatty acids, were not included. no restrictions were placed on the range of compounds used as controls in the study. some vegetable oils contain <UNK> pufa, or complex fatty acids that might be metabolised to form omega- <UNK> pufa. types of outcome measures primary outcomes • fatal myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death; • proven non-fatal myocardial infarction; • coronary or peripheral revascularization procedures. secondary outcomes • triglycerides • total cholesterol • hdl cholesterol • ldl cholesterol • vldl cholesterol • <UNK> • fasting glucose • fasting insulin • body weight • adverse effects timing of outcome measurement primary outcome measures will require studies of long duration to yield meaningful results. we anticipated that changes in secondary outcome measures would develop and remain stable over a short period of time and so we included studies of any duration, combining studies of short duration (three to eight weeks) and medium duration (three to six months). search methods for identification of studies electronic searches we searched the specialised register of the former cochrane diabetes group and the cochrane central register of controlled trials, as well as an electronic literature search of medline and embase (from the beginning of each database until april <UNK> in two phases to identify trials involving <UNK> our original search was conducted for publications from <UNK> to <UNK> and the second search was conducted up to <UNK> using a protocol that included the cochrane collaboration’s search strategy for randomized controlled trials (dickersin <UNK> adapted for each database), using a similar search strategy for both phases (see appendix <UNK> we searched for records in all languages. the bibliographic sections of all publications of included or excluded trials were searched for additional trials. searching other resources dr cr sirtori (milan) and dr e ryan (edmonton, alberta), two trialists, were consulted in an attempt to identify any other overlooked, unpublished or ongoing studies. we did not attempt to contact other authors where the size of the trials was small. data collection and analysis selection of studies the titles, abstracts and keywords of every record were retrieved to determine the relevant trials. full articles were retrieved for further assessment if the information given suggested that the trial <UNK> included patients with type <UNK> diabetes mellitus, <UNK> compared fish oil with placebo or vegetable oil, <UNK> assessed one or more clinically relevant outcome measures, <UNK> used random allocation for the comparison groups. when there was any doubt regarding these criteria from the information given in the title and abstract, the full article was retrieved for clarification. when differences in opinion existed, these were resolved by consensus referring back to the original article. the full articles retrievedwere examined independently by the two investigators to identify relevant trials.discrepancieswere resolved by consensus. data extraction and management two reviewers extracted data from the studies independently. disagreements were resolved by consensus. the data extraction form included the type of trial (randomised or cross-over), type of <UNK> polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) and type of control (including dose), length of intervention, trial setting, diabetes diagnosis, baseline characteristics of intervention and control groups (including age, gender, duration of diabetes, co-morbidity and complications, and treatment), outcomes assessed and biochemical outcome data in relation to study duration. assessment of risk of bias in included studies two investigators independently assigned quality scores to studies with discrepancies resolved by consensus. a score developed from the criteria of jadad and schulz (jadad <UNK> schulz <UNK> was used to assess study quality, which had a possible range from zero to five with a cutoff of two used to designate studies of high versus low quality. the criteria used were: • was the study randomised? was the method of randomisation appropriate? • was the study double-blinded? were the methods of blinding appropriate? • was compliance assessed? • were there dropouts and withdrawals and were the numbers and reasons for withdrawal stated? did more than <UNK> percent of those randomized complete the study? kappa values were calculated for inter-rater agreement on quality. data synthesis extracted data were analyzed using the cochrane reviewmanager software. quantitative analysis was based on changes in themeans between baseline and endpoint measures. standard deviation of the mean difference was calculated from the standard deviations of the mean at the beginning and end of each trial by assuming a degree of correlation of <UNK> (rice <UNK> trials were included in the pooled analysis where change data of the intervention and control groups could be obtained from calculations of the mean difference and standard deviation (sd). a fixed-effect model was used for the pooled results. where heterogeneity was indicated in the pooled analysis, a random-effects model was applied. effect sizes are presented as weighted mean differences with <UNK> percent confidence intervals. heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-squared test with the significance set at a p value of < <UNK> where serial measurement of an outcome was given during the intervention phase, comparisons were made with the final measurement. where a trial used two sets of doses, included comparisons of epa and dha, or more than one control group, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine which comparison gave the smallest effect size (tramer <UNK> which was then included. publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot method (egger <UNK> subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity subgroup analyses were planned a priori and undertaken for the following variables: • length of intervention (less than two months, longer than two months); • dose of <UNK> pufa (more than <UNK> g eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), less than <UNK> g epa); • type of <UNK> pufa (where epa or docosahexaenoic acid (dha) was given separately, the result which had the smallest effect size was included for statistical analysis to prevent sample • duplication (tramer <UNK> • baseline triglyceride level (studies including only hypertriglyceridemic patients, studies including not only hypertriglyceridemic patients). sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses were carried out on: • quality (two points or less on quality scale (low quality), more than two points on quality scale (high quality)); • blinding; • trial design (cross-over versus parallel design studies); • exclusion of any particularly large study (to see how much they dominate the results). r e s u l t s description of studies

main results this systematic review pools <UNK> randomized controlled trials of <UNK> supplementation studying a total of <UNK> patients with type <UNK> diabetes mellitus. none of the trials examined hard clinical endpoints (such as cardiovascular events or death). in the trials reviewed, <UNK> supplementation had a statistically significant triglyceride- and vldl cholesterol lowering effect. a statistically significant increase in ldl cholesterol was noted after <UNK> supplementation. ldl was not significantly increased in subgroup analyses of hypertriglyceridemic patients, high or low <UNK> polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) doses and in trials lasting longer than two months. <UNK> supplementation did not result in any statistically significant increase in fasting glucose, <UNK> or fasting insulin. no other adverse effects were reported. overall, the subgroup analyses are difficult to interpret as up to <UNK> of the trials included in the hypertriglyceridemia, high dose and long duration subgroups were identical (that is including hypertriglyceridemic patients on a high dose of fish oil in a long trial) (connor <UNK> morgan <UNK> making it therefore difficult to determine which of these factors really caused the differential response. non-hypertriglyceridemia, long study duration and low doses of <UNK> pufa may have contributed to a greater reduction in triglyceride and levels, whereas hypertriglyceridemia and trials of longer duration may have had a contribution to the larger reductions in vldl levels. subgroup analyses did not indicate variables that increased in ldl cholesterol levels. overall completeness and applicability of evidence our data are relevant to clinicians managing patients with type <UNK> diabetes. they indicate that, in hypertriglyceridemic and normotriglyceridemic patients, dietary supplementation with omega- <UNK> pufa leads to a modest lowering of triglycerides without any statistically significant effect on glycemic control. the increases in ldl are not significant in hypertriglyceridemic patients. it is unlikely that <UNK> pufa will be prescribed in normotriglyceridemic patients, but our results do not provide evidence to discourage their use as over-the-counter preparations provided the formulation has been manufactured to eliminate undesirable contaminants. <UNK> pufa has been suggested to have beneficial effects in other diseases including crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis and breast, colon and prostate malignancies (connor <UNK> and our results show that <UNK> pufa represents a

reduction of <UNK> for the primary endpoint of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) are encouraging. quality of the evidence severalmethodological challenges were encountered in the course of this review. eleven of <UNK> trials used a cross-over design and phase-specific data were not available for any of these. for pooling results from cross-over and parallel group design studies, ideally, individual patient data or at least phase-specific data should be available. in the absence of these data, three approaches are possible. the first is not to analyse data from cross-over studies. the second is to pool parallel group design and cross-over trials separately. the third is to treat first phase data from cross-over studies as coming from parallel group design studies, pool these with data from parallel group design studies and look for heterogeneity in the analysis. we adopted the latter approach and our sensitivity analysis did not show any association between study design and direction or magnitude of effect. use of the cross-over design to study <UNK> pufa supplementation has other potential drawbacks. <UNK> pufa is incorporated into biologic membranes and presumably would require washout periods of appropriate duration to minimize any carryover effect. in our review, only four of the <UNK> cross-over studies had a washout period. despite these limitations, the main findings of the review were similar if crossover studies were included or excluded from the analysis. another methodological problem is the use of <UNK> as an outcome measure in trials of short duration. glycated haemoglobin or <UNK> provide an integrated measure of glycemic control over a period of approximately <UNK> weeks. the use of such measurements in studies of short duration will underestimate any effects on glycemic control. this may have occurred in several trials included in this review (see tables). the random-effects model was used where the studies were sufficiently different to assume some level of heterogeneity that could have been ignored in a fixed-effect model, but except for vldl cholesterol, the conclusions did not change when the results were analyzed with either model. it is interesting to compare the current systematic review with that of friedberg et al. (friedberg <UNK> despite the differences in design of that review to farmer et al (farmer <UNK> and our current review, the findings of the two reviews are similar and are in keeping with the results of the largest trial performed in this area (sirtori <UNK> potential biases in the review process the subgroup and sensitivity analyses require elaboration to undertake a more comprehensive comparison between groups with different characteristics. this will be addressed in a further publication. limitations of our systematic review include the limited number of trials with emerging cardiovascular risk markers as outcomes, and small trial sizes with a median of <UNK> participants. another significant limitation of our study is the shorter duration of the included trials. some trials did not describe methods of randomisation or blinding so that the degree of rigor with which they were conducted was not clear. it was not possible to pool all the identified outcomes because of non-standardised measurement units, and non-reporting of changes in outcomes. the findings from the funnel plot analysis (figure <UNK> may indicate bias in reporting, selection or methodology of the trials. however, we included trials reported in any language to reduce selection and language bias, and an assessment was made of the quality of the trials. figure <UNK> a u t h o r s ’ c o n c l u s i o n s implications for practice in hypertriglyceridemic patients, dietary supplementation with <UNK> pufa leads to amodest lowering of triglycerides without any clinically significant effect on glycemic control, and omega- <UNK> polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) may represent a reasonable therapeutic strategy in these individuals. implications for research arecent reviewincluded patientswith diabetes as part of a high risk group analysis, but also included non-randomised control trials (balk <UNK> three previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effect of <UNK> pufa on cardiovascular events, lipid and glycemicmarkers in type <UNK> diabetes (farmer <UNK> friedberg <UNK> montori <UNK> however, we considered lipid cardiovascular risk factors beyond these markers, and used changes in the mean from baseline to the end of the trial in the pooled analysis.we have also identified more recent randomised trials. the slight increase in ldl cholesterol seen with the use of fish oil represents a cause for concern and long-term studies assessing hard cardiovascular endpoints in patients with diabetes are needed. in conclusion, our systematic review demonstrates the difficulties of existing trial designs. rigorously designed and conducted randomised controlled trials are required, using standardised units measuring both established and emerging cardiovascular risk markers in type <UNK> diabetes, to enable more conclusive pooled analyses and improve the precision of the effect size estimates. larger trials of longer duration would conclusively establish the role and mechanisms of <UNK> pufa in cardiovascular disease risk reduction in type <UNK> diabetes. one trial sub-group analysis awaits reporting (gissi <UNK> and four such end-point trials are in progress (aforrd <UNK> ascend <UNK> galan <UNK> origin <UNK>

a b s t r a c t background quit and win contests were developed in the <UNK> by the minnesota heart health program, and have been widely used since then as a population-based smoking cessation intervention at local, national and international level. since <UNK> an international contest has been held every two years in as many as <UNK> countries <UNK> objectives to determine whether quit and win contests can deliver higher long-term quit rates than baseline community quit rates. to assess the impact of such programmes, we considered both the quit rates achieved by participants, and the population impact, which takes into account the proportion of the target population entering the contest. search strategy we searched thecochranetobaccoaddictiongroup specializedregister,with additional searches ofmedline, embase,cinahl, psycinfo and google scholar. search terms included competition*, quit and win, quit to win, contest*, prize*. most recent search date was november <UNK> selection criteria we considered randomized controlled trials, allocating individuals or communities to experimental or control conditions. we also considered controlled studies with baseline and post-intervention measures. data collection and analysis data were extracted by one author and checked by the second. we contacted study authors for additional data where necessary. the main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking for at least six months from the start of the intervention. we used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available.we decided against performing ametaanalysis, because of the heterogeneity of the included studies, and the small number of scientifically valid studies. main results five studies met our inclusion criteria. three demonstrated significantly higher quit rates <UNK> to <UNK> for the quit and win group than for the control group at the <UNK> assessment. however, the population impact measure, where available, suggests that the effect of contests on community prevalence of smoking is small, with fewer than one in <UNK> smokers quitting because of the contest. levels of deception, where they could be quantified, were high. although surveys suggest that international quit and win contests may be effective, especially in developing countries, the lack of controlled studies precludes any firm conclusions from this review. authors’ conclusions quit and win contests at local and regional level appear to deliver quit rates above baseline community rates, although the population impact of the contests seems to be relatively low. contests may be subject to levels of deception which could compromise the validity of the intervention. international contests may prove to be an effective mechanism, particularly in developing countries, but a lack of well-designed comparative studies precludes any firm conclusions. p l a i n l a n g u a g e s u m m a r y do quit and win contests encourage people to give up smoking controlled trials suggest that quit and win contests may help some smokers to quit, but they have little effect on community smoking rates. fewer than one smoker in <UNK> quits because of the contests. deception levels, where they can be measured, are often high. international quit and win contests are often well supported, especially in developing countries, but there is no clear evidence from trials that they are effective. b a c k g r o u n d the quit and win contest was first developed by the minnesota hearthealth program (mhhp), and was run in threeminnesota communities in the early <UNK> usingmassmedia and posters and brochures distributed to schools, workplaces and medical facilities (lando <UNK> the prize was a holiday to disneyworld, in a raffle for those achieving biochemically validated cessation at onemonth post-programme. a validated quit rate of <UNK> achieved at one month, although <UNK> of those originally claiming to have quit did not turn out to be smoke-free, and relapse rates at <UNK> months were high. the success of the programme has been influential, particularly in the usa, where it has been the model for many recruitment and cessation campaigns. the rationale for developing the quit and win model was based on a number of assumptions: • widespread quit attempts may benefit from a network of support from family, friends, colleagues, and other smokers trying to quit, and from non-smoking members of the community; • most smokers prefer to try and quit on their own rather than seeking treatment; • most quit attempts fail within the first <UNK> days, with less than half surviving even for one week; • the possibility of winning a large prize could offset the discomforts of quitting, and could attract large numbers of smokers to make the attempt; • after <UNK> days of abstinence, the intrinsic reinforcements for quitting are more likely to maintain abstinence. the key features of the seminal mhhp contests, many of which remained unchanged through their national and international versions, were: <UNK> smoking status was validated prior to entry, and quitting was biochemically validated among potential winners. <UNK> smokers were adults <UNK> and pledged to quit for <UNK> days on the target quit date. <UNK> a large grand prize was offered, e.g. a family holiday, plus several smaller prizes such as bicycles or health club membership. <UNK> prizes were donated, or paid for by donation. <UNK> contests were heavily promoted through the media, through school children, and through community organizations and worksites. <UNK> support was sought from health professionals and community leaders. <UNK> contests were run and promoted by a local volunteer task force, led by a single paid staff member. quit and win competitions have subsequently been developed and extended to national and international applications. in <UNK> the north karelia project in finland adopted it as part of a community- based smoking cessation programme, and in the following year the programme was offered nationally on finnish television, reaching an estimated <UNK> of adult smokers, and enrolling <UNK> of the adult smoking population. among smokers who saw at least one of the eight programmes, <UNK> made a quit attempt, and <UNK> of those who made a quit attempt were abstinent at sixmonth follow up (korhonen <UNK> in <UNK> under the auspices of the world health organization, the first international quit & win contest was conducted, with <UNK> countries participating. the contest has been run every two years since then, and has grown exponentially. estimated quit rates at one year follow up have shown great variation across different countries, with year <UNK> continuous abstinence rates reported to range from <UNK> (argentina) to <UNK> (regional china), and an average across all participating countries of <UNK> (sandstrom <UNK> the <UNK> contest, the latest for which full details are readily available, awarded a grand prize of <UNK> and six regional prizes of <UNK> drawn from among the national winners. this contest attracted <UNK> participants from more than <UNK> countries. the most recent international quit and win contest was held in may <UNK> and was administered by the national public health institute in helsinki, finland (klt <UNK> preliminary results for this contest are available on the organizers’ web site <UNK> while competitions and incentives may offer benefits in increased participation rates, there are attendant risks to such a mechanism. verification, especially in a community-based intervention, is often a thorny issue. an australian study which interviewed a pseudo-random sample of <UNK> entrants to a national stop-smoking lottery, with amain prize of a car worth <UNK> found that <UNK> of those who had entered were either never-smokers or exsmokers at the time they signed up, even though a condition of entry was being a verified current smoker (chapman <UNK> furthermore there are limitations to quit rates of participants as the indicator of the success of a community-based programme such as this. the mhhp, for example, has demonstrated that achieved quit rates cannot be assessed in isolation from community participation rates (lando <UNK> at first sight, the intervention community’s quit rate of <UNK> appeared less impressive than the control group’s <UNK> however, the participation rate for the intervention group was <UNK> the eligible smoking population, compared with the control community’s <UNK> yielding a public health impact (participation rate x cessation rate) more than four times greater than for the control group. as thismeasure highlights the interdependence of participation and cessation rates in any assessment of the success of a cessation programme, we propose to use it in this review to evaluate the studies, where the data will support it. any enhanced participation rate that incentives may deliver also has to be weighed against the stability of the long-term quit rates that are achieved. smokers who elect to take part in a cessation programme that offers material rewards may be differently motivated from those who sign up to more conventional cessation methods, and this may be reflected in differential relapse rates. cost effectiveness the use of rewards and incentives increases the costs of running smoking cessations programmes, and the question must arise of whether the outlay is justified by the benefits that the component delivers. in other words, how many more quit attempters will join a programme that rewards their participation, and how much, if at all, is the quit rate enhanced by the end of programme follow up ? there is some evidence that community-based programmes fare better thanworkplace ones in incentive-based recruitment (nelson <UNK> pawtuckethearthealth program(phhp) proactively recruited smokers at the annual octoberfest between <UNK> and <UNK> and also at local worksites from <UNK> to <UNK> on a cost effectiveness analysis, those recruited at worksites cost more per participant than those recruited at the octoberfest. however, because of the lower quit rates among the octoberfest recruits, the cost per successful quitter was much lower for the worksite recruits. any attempt to rate the efficacy of a programme needs to be clear about the unit by which success is measured. this review will attempt some assessment of the cost effectiveness of programmes that incorporate reward mechanisms. the issue of calculating and comparing programme costs, however, is problematic. those studies which report a costing component rarely take full account of all the direct and indirect costs involved, and sometimes make a series of rather tenuous assumptions to support their estimate. o b j e c t i v e s to assess the effects of community-based contests such as quit and win on rates of smoking cessation. we will address the following questions: (i) cessation: <UNK> competitions, contests and incentives affect rates of smoking cessation or rates of relapse a) among the participants and b) among the target population? <UNK> the amount and type of incentive alter the rates of smoking cessation? (ii) recruitment: <UNK> do prizes improve recruitment to community smoking cessation programmes? <UNK> does the amount and type of incentive alter the effect on recruitment ? (iii) general: <UNK> what are the costs to the community of incentives and contests ? <UNK> how great is the risk of disbenefits arising from the use of competitions and incentives, eg false claims, ineligible applicants ? m e t h o d s criteria for considering studies for this review types of studies randomized controlled trials allocating communities to intervention or to control conditions. controlled trials with baseline measures and post-intervention outcomes types of participants adult smokers, either gender, within the targeted community. types of interventions population-based quit

participation in smoking cessation programmes. public health impact (participation rate x cessation rate), wherever the data are available. search methods for identification of studies we searched the cochrane tobacco addiction group specialized register , which includes studies identified by systematic electronic searches of multiple databases, handsearching of specialist journals, and ’grey’ literature (conference proceedings and unpublished reports not normally covered by most electronic indexing systems). in addition, we have used specifically developed strategies to search four electronic databases, embase, medline, cinahl and psycinfo. search terms included competition*, contest*, prize*, quit and win, quit to win. for the <UNK> update, we also searchedgoogle scholar, using the search string [“quit and win” smoking]. the most recent search was november <UNK> data collection and analysis there were four stages in the review process: stage <UNK> one author prescreened all search results (abstracts), for possible inclusion or as useful background stage <UNK> two authors independently assessed relevant studies for inclusion. we resolved discrepancies by consensus. the co-ordinating editorwas available to resolve any persistent disagreements. we have noted reasons for the non-inclusion of studies. stage <UNK> author extracted data, and the second author checked them. this stage included an evaluation of quality. two independent authors assessed each study according to the presence and quality of the randomization process, whether or not trialists and assessors were ’blinded’, whether the analysis was appropriate to the study design, and the description of withdrawals and dropouts. stage <UNK> decided not to performameta-analysis of the included studies, because of their paucity, heterogenity of design and variable quality.we have presented the results in a narrative form, and have also tabulated themain findings of each study (summary table

to their global status (most recently inmay <UNK> has been outlined briefly in the background section of this review. the practicality and relative success of the mhhp contests, with participation rates of between <UNK> <UNK> follow-up abstinence rates (nonverified self report) at six to eight months of between <UNK> and <UNK> have encouraged other health promotion teams to run and evaluate similar contests. other landmark local and national quit andwin contests are summarized intable <UNK> later studiesmodified some of the contest parameters; the eligible age was lowered from <UNK> to <UNK> in the <UNK> swedish contest and to <UNK> in finland <UNK> and raised to <UNK> in the hunter valley intervention; contest duration was varied in the <UNK> commit contests, and increased to six weeks in the medicine hat contest. prizes could be cash (phhp, commit, buffalo, kick it!), holidays (stanford five city <UNK> finland <UNK> sweden <UNK> buffalo, heartbeatwales <UNK> uk <UNK> hat, kick it!) or consumer goods (buffalo, hunter valley <UNK> [a car],q&wuk <UNK> hat, kick it!). international quit andwin, run under the auspices of theworld health organization (who), and administered through the national public health institute (ktl) in finland, has been held every two years since <UNK> although each participating country runs its own national competition, to the agreed rules of the controlling body, all national prize winners are entered for a super prize draw <UNK> plus six regional prizes of <UNK> each, with their chances of winning proportionate to the number of participants registered in each country. the international quit and win campaign also conducts a one-year follow-up survey. from the <UNK> contest onwards, there have also been prize draws for supporters of successful quitters, and for health professionals involved in the administration of the contests (sandstrom <UNK> table <UNK> summarizes the international contests held to date. although much has been written about the quit and win experience, and the concept has been widely applied, evaluations have generally not been conducted to rigorous trial standards. we found five studies which compared a quit and win contest with a no-contest control group. lando <UNK> randomized <UNK> smokers to receive the national cancer institute’s quit for good self-help programme, <UNK> to receive the minnesota quit and win self-help materials, and <UNK> to act as a non-intervention control group. participants were contacted by phone seven months later, to assess smoking status, recall and use of the brochures, and for a rating of their usefulness. this trial tested the efficacy and acceptability of different self-help cessation materials, and did not include the prize element of the full quit and win contest. bains <UNK> compared quit rates of <UNK> entrants for aquit andwin contest in two counties of eastern ontario with a non-participant control group. the controls were smokers who had not entered the contest and who lived in the same area or in two adjacent counties. they had been contacted by a process of random telephone calls. the quit and win contest offered the chance to win <UNK> to those participants who abstained for the month leading up to the draw. the winners’ smoke-free status was confirmed by a nominated ’buddy’. all entrants received a ’quit kit’ of support materials, including cessation advice, maintenance tips, a list of local cessation programmes, and a fridge magnet with the number of a health information unit line. follow up was by telephone interview at one year. mcalister <UNK> described a quasi-experimental evaluation of a quit and win contest held in pitkaranta (in russian karelia). following on the success of the <UNK> international quit and win contest held in the area in may, the study team ran a continuous contest from september <UNK> tomarch <UNK> registering smokers required to quit for at least four weeks to be eligible to win prizes. the monthly draw was for a three-day break innorthkarelia.winners were verified by carbon monoxide (co) monitoring. competing smokers could also nominate a ’supporter’ (usually a spouse or friend), who was also eligible for a prize draw. leaflets and the local press featured role-model stories and encouragement throughout the duration of the contest. baseline surveys were conducted in pitkaranta and in a neighbouring comparison district (suojarvi), and a panel of daily smokers <UNK> in pitkaranta and <UNK> in suojarvi) were re-surveyed one year later. hahn <UNK> used a quasi-randomized study to compare <UNK> quit and win contestants <UNK> of all registrants) in lexington-fayette county, kentucky, with <UNK> randomly selected smokers from outside the contest area. the intervention group received various forms of quitting assistance, including weekly mailed postcards giving gender-specific advice throughout the contest period, an online cessation web site, a toll-free quit line and the chance to win a grand prize of <UNK> or one of five <UNK> prizes. the contest was widely promoted through mass media, physicians, community organizations and worksites. intervention and control subjects were surveyed by phone at baseline and at three, six and twelve months, with all claims of abstinence verified by urinary cotinine and the testimony of a nominated ’buddy’. the trialists also reported separately (hahn <UNK> on a sub-group of <UNK> contest participants and <UNK> controls defined as low-income (earning less than <UNK> a year). hawk <UNK> reported a campaign in erie and niagara counties (new york state), in which participants could choose to enter a one-month quit and win contest with a grand prize of <UNK> or could receive a free two-week supply of nicotine patches or gum, or could combine both options. the contest alone attracted <UNK> smokers, the free nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) alone <UNK> smokers, and the combination <UNK> smokers. background smoking demographics were collected by two telephone surveys which over-sampled smokers. publicity materials included leaflets and newsletters targeting african american and latino residents, who had higher rates of smoking than non-hispanic white residents. as well as comparing abstinence rates, the study set out to determine the characteristics of the participants in their self-selected groups, and to identify predictors of quitting. risk of bias in included studies one of the five included studies (lando <UNK> was a randomized controlled trial, but gave no details about themethods of randomization, and was therefore rated ’b’ (unclear) for concealment of allocation. bains <UNK> mcalister <UNK> and hahn <UNK> were all controlled trials, without random allocation (rated ’c’, not applicable). hawk <UNK> was an observational comparison study (rated ’c’, not applicable). lando <UNK> conducted the study in an area that for three years had been taking part in the minnesota heart health program (mhhp), so that there was already a heightened awareness of the smoking cessation campaign and of quit and win contests in particular. indeed, the participants had all taken part in baseline screening for the mhhp, and <UNK> of all participants across the three arms of the study had entered previous quit and win contests. it is likely they would already be familiar with the quit and win materials that some of them were being asked to test. the authors commented that smokerswere somewhat under-represented in the mhhp, with a smoking cohort of less than <UNK> compared with the population prevalence rate of over <UNK> that <UNK> the adult population presented for the initial mhhp screening, and that study participants were drawn only from the screened group, the under-representation of smokers within that group meant that less than <UNK> of the smoking population of the area was eligible to participate in the trial. it is also likely that those who did would be unusually receptive to making a quit attempt. similarly, mcalister <UNK> derived his experimental group from a population survey linked with the <UNK> international quit and win contest held in pitkaranta (russian karelia). this was one of nine demonstration areas, designated by theworld health organization ’an intensive campaign area’ (korhonen <UNK> furthermore, the study programme in pitkaranta received support throughout from staff at the north karelia project, and from the national publichealth institute of finland (organizers of international quit and win). the comparison community for the study was neighbouring suojarvi, which had no history of intensive antismoking activities. although the economy and demography of the two areas were described as ’very similar’, no direct comparisons were reported or quantified. the authors point out that the greater success in following up the experimental group was probably attributable to the more intense activity and interest in smoking issues among health workers in pitkaranta. bains <UNK> assembled an experimental cohort of almost all <UNK> <UNK> of the smokers who were participating in a <UNK> quit and win contest held in two eastern ontario counties, while the control group was composed of smokers who had not entered the contest but had responded positively to a random telephone dialling programme. the two groups were therefore very differently constituted, and displayed many baseline disparities (see the included studies table). hahn <UNK> similarly targeted contestants in a local quit and win contest (bluegrass <UNK> but unlike bains selected the controls from outside the contest catchment area. there were significant differences between the groups by age, gender, education, income and stage of change, but these were controlled for in the analyses. attrition rates were <UNK> for the intervention group and <UNK> for controls. hawk <UNK> did not randomize participants to the three interventions, but explored differences between the self-selected groups. all claims of abstinencewere by unvalidated self-report, and length of follow up varied between four and seven months. follow up was achieved for about <UNK> of sampled participants, in similar proportions across all three groups. the telephone survey-based reference group is likely to be subject to similar constraints to those reported for bains <UNK> above. only one of the included studies (hahn <UNK> attempted to validate every claim of abstinence by testing for urinary cotinine, and this study also routinely cross-checked with the testimony of a nominated ’buddy’. two of the studies did not use biochemical validation, but relied upon self report (lando <UNK> or ’buddy’ confirmation (bains <UNK> both studies acknowledged that the reported quit rates might therefore be somewhat inflated by false claims. in the mcalister study, only the potential winners of the prize draw had their claims of abstinence biochemically tested, using expired co. hawk <UNK> did not attempt any form of validation. lando <UNK> <UNK> andhawk <UNK> presented quit rates as both an intention-to-treat analysis (i.e. including all participants randomized in the denominator, and assuming those lost to follow up to be continuing smokers) and on a responders-only basis. hahn <UNK> reported quit rates in an intention-to-treat analysis as both <UNK> point prevalence and continuous abstinence measures, and distinguished throughout between self-reported and biochemically validated rates. bains <UNK> reported quit rates based only on those who gave follow-up information at one year, but with a follow-up rate of <UNK> of the intervention group and <UNK> of the controls, this is unlikely to have significantly compromise the final comparisons. effects of interventions hahn,mcalister and bains all found significant differences in the one-year quit rates between the experimental and control participants. hahn <UNK> reported a <UNK> <UNK> biochemically validated quit rate at <UNK> months for the quit and win group, compared with <UNK> <UNK> for the controls (p < <UNK> this contrasts with <UNK> self-reported abstinence rates of <UNK> and <UNK> respectively. only <UNK> of self-reported quitters who agreed to provide a urine sample actually did so. logistic regression analysis, controlling for baseline differences in stage of change, age, education and marital status, showed that at <UNK> months follow up the intervention group had more than five times the odds of confirmed abstinence than the control group (or <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> those who completed the study were significantly older, more likely to bemarried, and to have higher educational level and income than those who dropped out. women, ethnic minorities and those with an income below <UNK> were as likely to quit as men, whites, and those with a higher income. mcalister <UNK> reported a <UNK> <UNK> quit rate in pitkaranta comparedwith <UNK> p < <UNK> in the comparison community of suojarvi, for smokerswho had abstained for longer than the previous month. the corresponding point prevalence quit rates were <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> p < <UNK> this result should be viewed with some caution, for the reasons given earlier, and because follow-up rates were relatively low and disparate; the study team re-contacted <UNK> of the experimental panel at one year, but only <UNK> of the controls. bains <UNK> reported a <UNK> quit rate among the random survey control group <UNK> on an intention-to-treat basis, or <UNK> on a responders-only basis), and a <UNK> quit rate among the experimental group, based on <UNK> responders. an intention-to-treat analysis would yield a quit rate of <UNK> still substantially higher than in the control group. the authors urge caution, however, in interpreting these results, since the two groups were profoundly different. the experimental group, comprising contestants in a local quit and win contest, were on average younger, heavier smokers, better educated and more likely to be employed. the process of random telephoning to assemble a control group tended to identify people more likely to be at home (older, not working, lower socio-economic status), leading to “systematic differences” between smokers who enter quit smoking contests and smokers who don’t. the study found no baseline demographic features to be significantly predictive of cessation at one year. lando <UNK> found no significant differences between the three arms of the study. the quit and win group achieved a point prevalence quit rate of <UNK> <UNK> the quit for good group <UNK> <UNK> and the no-materials control group <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the equivalent intention-to-treat quit rates were <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> respectively. however, the authors point to several factors that affect interpretation of these results: follow up that was intended to evaluate at seven months was in fact conducted only three or four months after the distribution of the brochures, and may not have represented the stable long-term quit rates. more significantly, nearly half of the quitters at follow up <UNK> [sic]) had stopped smoking before thematerialswere sent out.quit rates for those who only stopped after the receipt of the self-help materials are reduced to <UNK> <UNK> for quit and win, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for quit for good, and <UNK> <UNK> for the control group. the equivalent intention-to-treat rates for these groups would be <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> respectively. the authors speculate that the baseline phone call may have prompted the spontaneous quit attempts, but it should also be remembered that the trial was conducted in a region already very committed and accustomed to the mhhp, among a group of people who had already signed up to that programme and been screened for it. this could well have contributed to the awareness and receptivity of all participants in the study, and is further reflected in the unusually high quit rate achieved by the control group, who received no self-help assistance at all. hawk <UNK> detected no significant differences between the quit rates of any of the three groups, whether on a per protocol or an intention-to-treat analysis. responders-only quit rates were <UNK> for the quit and win contestants, <UNK> thenrt users and <UNK> for the combination group. ethnic minority smokers were overrepresented across the groups, suggesting that targeted recruitment had been effective. the study demonstrated an unexpected interaction between intervention and age, with younger people in the combination group achieving higher abstinence rates than their counterparts in the single intervention <UNK> versusq&w <UNK> nrt <UNK> while older participants in the combination group achieved lower abstinence rates than those in the contest and nrt groups <UNK> versus q&w <UNK> and nrt <UNK> population impact a useful measure of the efficacy of quit and win initiatives within the community is the population impact of a given intervention. this is calculated by multiplying the achieved quit rate by the percentage of smokers who participated in the contest, and affords a comparator between different events in different communities. our tabulation of key quit and win studies (table <UNK> includes this measure where it was reported or could be calculated. bains <UNK> reports a population impact of <UNK> based on a participation rate of <UNK> of adult smokers. in practical terms, and assuming there is a causal link between entering the contest and quitting, this would mean that one in every <UNK> smokers within the community might be expected to achieve long-term abstinence because of the quit and win contest. a similar calculation for the mcalister <UNK> study gives a population impact of <UNK> based on the reported participation rate of about <UNK> of smokers in the pitkaranta contest; in other words, about one in every <UNK> smokers in the community might be expected to achieve abstinence through taking part in the contest. neitherhahn <UNK> nor hawk <UNK> reported the smoking prevalence rates in the target communities, so a population impactmeasure could not be estimated for these studies. it is not appropriate to attempt to derive a population impact figure from the lando study, partly because the experimental design precludes it, but also because in this trial the quit and win group were not offered the defining component of a quit and win contest, namely a tangible incentive for abstinence. the selective components and the distributive effects of randomization mean that a population impact cannot be estimated for this trial. d i s c u s s i o n it is difficult to draw firmconclusions fromthe few controlled quit and win studies that have been reported so far. the five included studies in this review reported on relatively small numbers of participants. they were all conducted within communities that had current or prior experience of quit and win contests. for the most part the control groups or communities were either not attuned to smoking as a public health priority (mcalister <UNK> or were probably too different to support ameaningful comparison (bains <UNK> the single randomized trial (lando <UNK> excluded the ’win’ component, and concentrated on the efficacy of the selfhelpmaterials. it is therefore not possible to drawmeaningful conclusions from this trial about the effectiveness of the fully functional contest. the new york state study (hawk <UNK> while demonstrating benefits for the three intervention groups, lacked a true control group, and warned against over-interpretation of its findings. probably the most promising results have emerged from hahn <UNK> in which biochemically validated outcomes and controlling for baseline differences still demonstrated a benefit of the quit and win contest. their finding that women and low-income smokers, both groups less likely to succeed in quitting, were as likely to achieve abstinence as men and higher-income registrants, shows particular promise. bains <UNK> in her review of <UNK> population-based incentives trials, estimates amean cessation rate of <UNK> all participants in at one year, and a <UNK> quit rate among all smokers in the target communities. such a measure, while interesting, makes no allowance for heterogeneity among populations and trial designs. an alternative measure of effect is the population impact (cessation rate x percentage of smokers enrolled), where this is reported or can be calculated. the results section of our review gives the population impact at longest follow up for bains <UNK> and mcalister <UNK> and table <UNK> gives this measure where it is reported or can be estimated for the landmark excluded studies. population impact approximates the number of smokers who quit because of participating in the intervention (in this case, a quit and win contest), assuming that there is a causal link between the two. in our review, population impact ranges from <UNK> at one year in heartbeatwales (roberts <UNK> which is roughly equal to one in every <UNK> smokers in the community, to <UNK> in bloomington at <UNK> <UNK> months (lando <UNK> or roughly one in <UNK> smokers. design and evaluation population-based interventions are less amenable to a randomized controlled trial (rct) design than worksite- or clinically-based ones. the organizers of the swedish <UNK> and <UNK> andwin competitions preferred amodified time-series design for their evaluation (tillgren <UNK> and bains <UNK> discusses the prohibitive logistics of setting up a community-based rct to avoid selection bias. in the same vein, chapman <UNK> has pointed out that in developed countries such as australia (and the same would hold true for many regions in the usa and europe) the ubiquity of tobacco control laws, regulations, taxes, mass-reach campaigns and a high level of media discussion have made controlled trials virtually impossible to conduct, since comparable communities can not be isolated from contaminating influences. the discussion of the included studies in this review illustrates those difficulties. participants and non-participants smokerswho enter a quit andwin contest are usually a self-selected group, and may share different characteristics from smokers who choose not to join the contest. from the included and excluded studies in this review, people who register for a contest tend to be predominantly female (altman <UNK> bains <UNK> cummings <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> korhonen <UNK> <UNK> roberts <UNK> <UNK> younger (altman <UNK> <UNK> cummings <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>

o’connor <UNK> in the contemplation or preparation stage of change (hahn <UNK> lando <UNK> resnicow <UNK> roberts <UNK> to have made more previous quit attempts than those smokers who do not enter the contest (korhonen <UNK> the picture for socio-economic status is less consistent, with bains <UNK> and hea <UNK> finding a preponderance of professional and semi-professional participants (socioeconomic class <UNK> signing up for the contest, while tillgren <UNK> and lando <UNK> report a higher proportion of manual or blue-collar workers. interestingly, the bluegrass trial found only a weak link between signing up for the contest and the desire to win the cash prize, with <UNK> of low-income participants (less than <UNK> a year) indicating that they would have entered the contest anyway (hahn <UNK> <UNK> reported that fewer than one-third of participants in the new york contests claimed to be financially motivated to enter, with the contest that offered more than twice the value in prize money achieving no greater reach or efficacy than the other ten contests. quitters and non-quitters there also appear to be clear differences among the participants between those who succeeded in quitting and those who didn’t. while several studies found no correlation between gender and quitting success, higher quit rates amongmen than among women were reported by korhonen <UNK> <UNK> versus <UNK> and tillgren <UNK> <UNK> versus <UNK> tillgren also found that male quitters tended to be younger <UNK> to <UNK> than female quitters <UNK> to <UNK> successful quitters tended to be older (hea <UNK> leinweber <UNK> roberts <UNK> of higher socio-economic status (lefebvre <UNK> tillgren <UNK> to smoke more heavily (chapman <UNK> roberts <UNK> and to have made no or fewer previous quit attempts than unsuccessful contestants (chapman <UNK> leinweber <UNK> roberts <UNK> tillgren <UNK> two factors emerged across several studies as consistent predictors of successful quitting: one was the assistance of supportive others, whether a spouse or cohabiting partner (hawk <UNK> lefebvre <UNK> tillgren <UNK> non-smokers living with the contestant (leinweber <UNK> family and friends

reported this as a limitation of its own analysis (hahn <UNK> the second mechanism predictive of success was abrupt or ’cold turkey’ cessation rather than tapering, reducing smoking or switching brands (hahn <UNK> king <UNK> lando <UNK> roberts <UNK> publicity and recruitment one reason for variation in the mix of smokers attracted to a contest may derive in part from the methods used to promote it. all the included quit and win contests used some form of mass media promotion, including newspapers, radio and television, either with paid or public service advertisements and articles.most of the campaigns used posters and fliers, distributed through pharmacies, hospitals, dentists’ and doctors’ offices. schools, churches, worksites, libraries, sports events and shopping centres were routinely leafleted. the quit and win/free nrt campaign (hawk <UNK> targeted those ethnic minority groups with higher rates of smoking, producing an eight-page newsletter featuring african american and latino testimonies, in english and spanish versions. some contest organizers recruited proactively at festivals and health fairs (hahn <UNK> hahn <UNK> several studies have suggested that the preponderance of younger, employed, better educated smokers in quit and win contests may reflect the channels through which entries are recruited. among the included studies, bains <UNK> has commented that the control group who did not enter the quit and win contest tended to be older, of lower socio-economic status, and unemployed or retired. this group is especially vulnerable to chronic illness andmortality, and to smoking-related diseases in particular. hahn <UNK> like bains, used quit and win contestants as the experimental group and assembled the control group by random digit dialling (but outside the intervention community), and found similar baseline differences, with the control subjects being significantly older <UNK> versus <UNK> and with fewer college graduates <UNK> versus <UNK> of the studies considered in this review, only one included and two excluded studies reported that they had reached significant numbers of blue-collar and lower-paid workers. hahn <UNK> reported separately on a cohort of low-income smokers (earning under <UNK> a year), long identified as at higher risk of smoking- related diseases and largely untouched by most tobacco cessation approaches (kiefe <UNK> despite the intervention group achieving significantly higher long-term quit rates than the control group, the authors caution against over-interpretation of the results. they point out that the quit and win contestants were younger, more educated, more likely to be in the preparation or action stage of change and more likely to be unmarried than the control group. deception although biochemical validation of claims of abstinence is the gold standard for controlled trials (benowitz <UNK> in practice most population-based contests, with limited resources and many participants, only test the prize winners to verify their smoking status. most study quit rates are therefore based on self-reported abstinence claims, and should be treated with some caution. the only study which attempted biochemical validation of all claims of abstinencewashahn <UNK> this study also contrasted self-reported quit rates with confirmed ones, demonstrating more than a threefold difference in twelve month quit rates for the intervention group between self-reported <UNK> and confirmed <UNK> rates of cessation. the control group disparity was more than thirteenfold <UNK> <UNK> blanket biochemical verification at entry would clearly be impractical and prohibitively expensive.whether some kind of affirmation procedure built into the contest protocol would reduce levels of deception is questionable. it continues to be a programme design issue that contest organizers have to live with, and need to take account of in their analyses. international quit and win we have not been able to identify any controlled trials of international quit and win contests, and it seems unlikely in practice that any such studies can be implemented. there are, however, several reports and population-based studies of six international contests run so far <UNK> to <UNK> which merit consideration in the discussion section of this review. we have no detailed information about the findings of the <UNK> contest. the history of international quit and win contests is discussed in the background section of this review, and descriptive features of the contests held to date are summarized in table <UNK> briefly, the contests have been run every two years within the who’s cindi framework (countrywide integrated noncommunicable diseases intervention) since <UNK> by the national public health institute (ktl) in finland, which supports national organizing committees within the participating countries. information and contest entry is increasingly accessible on the world wide web (www.quitandwin.org). participants must be aged <UNK> or over, and have been daily smokers for at least one year.winners’ smoking status is verified by a urine sample. <UNK> the contests have been supported jointly by the european union and the finnish centre for health promotion, and have also been sponsored by major pharmaceutical companies. the <UNK> contest, in which <UNK> people from <UNK> countries participated, recruited <UNK> promille <UNK> in <UNK> of all smokers worldwide. the first competition in <UNK> involved <UNK> european countries, and the event has grown steadily until <UNK>

seen whether or not the reach of the contest is beginning to plateau out. from <UNK> the main cessation contest has been augmented by a supporters’ contest and by a health professionals’ contest. although there are great differences in quit rates between participating countries, the organizers report that on average about <UNK> of contest participants are estimated to have remained continuously abstinent at one-year follow up (sandstrom <UNK> because of the considerable variation in participation and abstinence rates between participating countries, it was recognized early on that some global measure was needed to afford comparability. the population impact (korhonen <UNK> or public health impact (sandstrom <UNK> calculated as participation rate x conservative estimate of successful quitters, was proposed as the most useful measure. one significant finding of korhonen’s comparison of eight campaign sites in <UNK> is that, despite heterogeneous one-year quit rates ranging from <UNK> (finland) to <UNK> (pitkaranta), the population impact measures suggested that higher participation rates were not correlated with lower abstinence rates. in other words, more smokers did not mean less highly motivated smokers. given that across a number of contests the average cessation rate stayed relatively stable at between <UNK> and <UNK> (sandstrom <UNK> and given that the rates do not appear to be diluted by increased participation, the potential of quit and win contests would seem to depend primarily upon enhancing participation rates (lavack <UNK> the increasing heterogeneity of the participant countries makes comparisons and meaningful conclusions very problematic. a report of the <UNK> contests in regional china and in finland, for example, attributes the spectacularly higher chinese one-year quit rate <UNK> <UNK> to a number of cultural differences, including a higher prevalence of less addicted or ’easy’ quitters, radically different prevalence rates by gender, different sorts of prizes (money versus a trip to the olympics), and even pharmacologically different nicotine patches in the two countries (sun <UNK> similarly, a report of the <UNK> iranian contest (pourshams <UNK> speculated that the unusually high quit rate of <UNK> had been contaminated by a mixture of false claims of abstinence <UNK> of the biological samples indicating current smoking) and a high proportion of nonsmokers entering the contest.the cautious estimate (assuming non-responders to be smokers) of validated cessation was adjusted to <UNK> with the high level of success attributed to the relative lack of other quitting facilities, iran’s lower economic status compared with european countries, and the possibly higher participation rate of nonsmokers eager to win a prize. a recent conference summary of the subsequent quit andwin campaigns in iran has reported one-year quit rates of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> (sarrafzadegan <UNK> the official report for the <UNK> contest drew attention to the generally higher quit and win cessation rates in developing countries, compared with the developed world (sandstrom <UNK> not only are these contests considered to be cost-effective, with two-thirds of them costing less than <UNK> to run, but they have also raised awareness of tobacco control issues, often by linking with other smoking control programmes such as world no tobacco day (kenya), and by influencing anti-tobacco legislation (nigeria, brazil).this comes at a time of aggressivemarketing by the tobacco industry in the developing regions, and indeed british american tobacco (bat) ran a counter-campaign to coincide with quit and win in kenya, as did bat and philip morris in romanian schools. as with regional and national contests, the quitting aid that has consistently been cited in international quit andwin evaluations as the most important and effective is support from friends and family. the addition in <UNK> of the supporters’ contest to the basic structure of the quit and win campaign is a response to that finding, and an attempt to consolidate its effectiveness. cost effectiveness only one of the five included studies in this review reported any information about the cost effectiveness of their intervention. hawk <UNK> estimated that the cost per quitter for the quit and win <UNK> and for the <UNK> but pointed out that such comparisons may be misleading, since the two groups were self-selected and demographically different from each other. a u t h o r s ’ c o n c l u s i o n s implications for practice the conclusions and implications for practice and research are based only upon the included studies in this review. <UNK> no randomized controlled trials have shown that quit and win contests increase the number of people giving up smoking. however, controlled studies suggest that there is an increase in quit rates among participants compared to control populations. possible biases in these results include differences between control and intervention populations and accuracy of outcome ascertainment because of deception rates. <UNK> using estimates from controlled trials, calculations of population impact suggest that fewer than one in <UNK> smokers in com- munities targeted by quit and win contests quit as a result of the contest. <UNK> enhancing participation rates may be important for delivering improved absolute numbers of quitters through quit and win contests. <UNK> the two elements which appear to lead to success in a quit andwin contest are supportive others (family, friends,workmates), and abrupt quitting (’cold turkey’) rather than reducing or brand switching. <UNK> there are insufficient data to draw conclusions about cost effectiveness of quit and win contests implications for research there are considerable difficulties in designing controlled studies of quit and win contests.

the potential to detect isolated metastatic recurrence at an early and surgically treatable stage are computed tomography (ct) imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and regular blood carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) measurement. the facs (follow-up after colorectal surgery) trial was commissioned by the uk national institute for health research health technology assessment program to assess the effect of these <UNK> modes with the intention of providing a sound evidence base to inform clinical practice. the original intention was to conduct a trial of sufficient size to assess survival advantage but when this proved infeasible, detection of recurrence that was treatable surgically with curative intent was chosen as the main outcome measure. pretrial modeling suggested that unless follow-up increased the number of such recurrences detected, an important survival advantage of follow-up would not be achieved. methods trial design the facs trial was a factorial <UNK> pragmatic randomized clinical trial conducted in <UNK> centers in the united kingdom; participants were randomized independently to ct imaging every <UNK> to <UNK> months or minimum follow-up and to cea testing every <UNK> to <UNK> months or minimum follow-up. participants to enroll in the trial, all participants had to have undergone curative treatment for primary colorectal cancer with no residual disease, microscopically clear margins, and dukes stage a to c (tnm stage <UNK> patients were disease-free based on colonic imaging with no evidence of metastatic disease (confirmed by ct or magnetic resonance imaging liver scan and chest ct scan) and with a postoperative blood cea level of <UNK> µg/l or less following surgery or completion of adjuvant therapy as indicated. patients were excluded if they had concurrent serious illness or dominantly inherited colon cancer, were unable to provide written informed consent, or were involved in a primary treatment trial with conflicting follow-up requirements. potential participants younger than <UNK> years or more than <UNK> months from completion of primary or adjuvant treatment were included only if agreed on by the chief surgical investigator. all participants gave written informed consent to participate in the trial. ethical approval for the trial was granted by the national health service (nhs) south-west research ethics committee. study setting participants were recruited at <UNK> nhs hospitals in the united kingdom with access to high-volume regional services geared to offer surgical treatment for recurrence. interventions follow-up was scheduled to occur for <UNK> years after trial entry. the factorial design, with independent allocation to the cea and ct interventions, meant that patients received <UNK> of <UNK> types of follow-up: cea follow-up: measurement of blood cea every <UNK> months for <UNK> years, then every <UNK> months for <UNK> years, with a single chest, abdomen, and pelvis ct scan at <UNK> to <UNK> months if requested at study entry by hospital clinician ct follow-up: ct of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every <UNK> months for <UNK> years, then annually for <UNK> years cea and ct follow-up: both blood cea measurement and ct imaging as above minimum follow-up: no scheduled follow-up except a single ct scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at <UNK> to <UNK> months if requested at study entry by the hospital clinician all patients had undergone colonoscopy at trial entry to ensure there was no residual intraluminal disease and were offered an end-of-trial colonoscopy at <UNK> years; in the <UNK> ct groups, an additional colonoscopy was undertaken at <UNK> years. blood collection kits were sent directly to patients, who then attended their own general practice for phlebotomy. blood was sent to the biochemistry laboratory at the john radcliffe hospital, oxford; the cea analysis was performed using a siemens centaur xp analyzer. if a patient’s blood cea level was <UNK> µg/l or more above the level at trial entry, the test was repeated as soon as possible; if the second test result was also greater than this threshold, the patient’s general practice physician was asked to refer the patient urgently to the local hospital. outcomes the primary outcome was surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent after a minimum of <UNK> years of follow-up. secondary outcomes were mortality (total deaths and deaths due to colorectal cancer), time to detection of recurrence, and survival after treatment of recurrence with curative intent. information on participant deaths was collected at the office for national statistics central registry (all patients were registered to have the trials unit notified in the event of the patient’s death); cause of death was abstracted from death certificates. data on treatment of recurrence and treatment intent were recorded on case report forms by local national cancer research network staff who had access to the full clinical records. randomization and blinding randomization to <UNK> of <UNK> groups (figure <UNK> on a <UNK> ratio was performed centrally at the oxford clinical trials unit using a minimization algorithm to balance patient characteristics within each center based on <UNK> variables: adjuvant chemotherapy, sex, and age group. study nurses contacted the oxford clinical trials unit by telephone to enter a patient in the trial, reporting the relevant patient characteristics; they were then told the trial group to which the patient had been allocated. because this was a pragmatic open trial, it was not possible to conceal the allocation group from either participants or clinicians. however, the research staff who abstracted outcome data from clinical notes were employed by the local national cancer research network teams independent of the investigators. the analysis program was undertaken first using dummy variables for the allocation groups and the code was not broken until the precise procedures for analysis were agreed on. sample size from the run-in phase of the trial, it was predicted that <UNK> of patients in the minimal follow-up group would have undergone surgery for recurrence with curative intent by <UNK> years of follow-up. it was therefore estimated that a sample size of <UNK> participants would need to be allocated to each factorial group to achieve <UNK> power with a <UNK> <UNK> to detect a minimum <UNK> absolute effect of intensive monitoring with ct or cea. modeling suggested that a <UNK> difference in treatment with curative intent translated into overall survival was the smallest difference that would prove cost effective. to compare the minimum intervention group with each of the cea, ct, and cea+ct groups separately, this sample size would provide <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> power to detect absolute differences of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> respectively. we therefore decided to stop recruitment when the sample size reached a minimum of <UNK> participants. statistical analysis the primary analysis was an intention-to-treat comparison of the proportion of patients experiencing recurrence who were treated surgically with curative intent <UNK> comparing all patients randomized to the <UNK> intensive follow-up groups (cea only, ct only, and cea+ct) with the minimum follow-up group and <UNK> comparing all patients randomized to the <UNK> factorial groups (cea vs no cea and ct vs no ct). when feasible, crude data are presented with statistical comparison made between randomization groups based on <UNK> tests for binary or categorical data, the t test or analysis of variance as appropriate for comparing group means, and the kruskal-wallis test for comparing medians. time to recurrence was analyzed by the kaplan-meier method to take account of both time censoring and the difference in the number of recurrences detected in each group (ie, a crude comparison of time to recurrence may be misleading because this approach does not take into account recurrences not yet detected in less-effective follow-up groups). the plots of time to recurrence were compared by the log-rank mantel-cox statistic. adjusted odds ratios for the main outcome were calculated by binary logistic regression, entering all the baseline characteristics reported in table <UNK> into the model. for the comparison of factorial groups (cea vs minimum follow-up and ct vs minimum follow-up), an interaction term (cea factor × ct factor) was also entered. we set a statistical significance threshold of <UNK> based on <UNK> tests. the analyses were conducted using ibm spss version <UNK> protocol adherence and amendments adherence to protocol was ascertained through nhs hospital and laboratory records. a secondary per-protocol analysis was conducted excluding patients who received any unscheduled investigation or had missed more than <UNK> scheduled examination. there were <UNK> significant amendments to the original protocol during the trial. the initial protocol did not specify the single ct at <UNK> to <UNK> months in the minimum follow-up and cea groups; <UNK> patients had been randomized to the minimum follow-up group before this change took effect in may <UNK> surgical treatment with curative intent rather than overall survival was specified as the main outcome in <UNK> when it became clear that we could not recruit the number of participants necessary to estimate an effect on overall survival with adequate statistical power. results characteristics of participants allocation of the

colonoscopies), the protocol required investigation of any patients presenting with symptoms between scheduled follow-up tests. substantially more unscheduled tests were performed in patients not receiving regular ct scans, with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> receiving <UNK> or more unscheduled cea tests, <UNK> <UNK> vs <UNK> <UNK> receiving <UNK> or more unscheduled ct tests, and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> receiving <UNK> or more unscheduled colonoscopies. per-protocol analysis the results of a per-protocol analysis are shown in table <UNK> excluding the <UNK> patients <UNK> who missed more than <UNK> scheduled visit or underwent any unscheduled investigation. the results are consistent with the intention-to-treat analysis but effect estimates are higher: the absolute differences in rate of detection of treatable recurrence in the more intensive follow-up groups compared with the minimum follow-up group were <UNK> to <UNK> discussion the <UNK> follow-up tests assessed in this trial were cea and ct imaging. meta-analyses have suggested that these are the only modes with significant potential to detect curatively treatable metastatic recurrence in patients with colorectal <UNK> clinical and ultrasound examination lack sensitivity whereas magnetic resonance imaging can realistically be applied only to the liver and lacks strong evidence of effectiveness in detecting <UNK> computed tomography–positron emission tomography was not an available technology when this trial was initiated and, because of cost and logistics, would be preferred to standard ct for routine follow-up only if evidence suggested much superior performance. endoscopic imaging (colonoscopy) was provided to patients in all study groups because it is a standard evidence-based element of follow-up care that can detect metachronous polyps or cancer (and, rarely, intraluminal <UNK> our results show that intensive follow-up by either scheduled cea or ct increased the likelihood of detecting a recurrence that can be treated with curative intent. the absolute difference in the proportion of participants treated with curative intent was approximately <UNK> in the intention-to-treat analysis and <UNK> in the per-protocol analysis, suggesting that between <UNK> and <UNK> patients need to be followed up to identify <UNK> potentially curable recurrence. more than two-thirds of the patients treated surgically with curative intent were still alive at a median follow-up of just over <UNK> years postrecurrence, suggesting that <UNK> survival may be more than the <UNK> previously <UNK> although the proportion of recurrences treated with curative intent (and the success of such treatment) is higher compared with earlier reports, the absolute number of treatable recurrences detected is <UNK> this is not explicable by differences in stage-specific case-mix (detection of recurrences treatable with curative intent was similar irrespective of stage), nor is there any evidence that participants in the facs trial were at low risk of recurrence within stage <UNK> of stage c participants had received adjuvant chemotherapy). stage-specific overall survival of participants in this study (efigure <UNK> in the supplement) is comparable with that reported in trials of adjuvant chemotherapy, such as <UNK> a more likely explanation for the lower detection of treatable recurrence is the rigor of the investigative procedures undertaken to ensure that no residual cancer was present at trial entry. it suggests that the high rate of early recurrence reported from routine cancer statistics in england and <UNK> reflects residual disease that would have been detected with more thorough imaging. it probably also explains the greater benefit of intensive follow-up reported in previous trials—follow-up detected residual disease, not recurrence. a key finding of this study is therefore the need to fully stage colorectal cancer before embarking on follow-up. the comparison between intervention groups suggests that monitoring with cea combined with a single ct scan at <UNK> to <UNK> months is not significantly different from undertaking regular ct scanning. because cea testing can be done in primary care, it is likely to be more cost-effective than regular ct imaging. however, imaging is still necessary to confirm recurrence, and in the combined cea+ct group, two-thirds of recurrences were first detected by ct. the diagnostic performance of cea as a monitoring test depends on the frequency of testing and the algorithm used to interpret the result. the algorithm applied in the facs trial (refer for imaging if blood cea level is <UNK> µg/l above baseline) achieves good specificity but at the cost of modest <UNK> an ongoing study is investigating whether a higher sensitivity can be achieved at an acceptable level of specificity by applying a diagnostic algorithm that takes account of change over time and has been applied successfully in interpreting cancer antigen <UNK> levels when screening for ovarian <UNK> we had planned to report our results after all participants had completed <UNK> years of follow-up because early analysis increases the risk of lead-time bias. however, there have been no cases of recurrence treatable with curative intent after <UNK> years of follow-up in the minimum follow-up group, making lead-time bias unlikely in our main comparison. nevertheless, subject to continuing informed consent from those in the minimum follow-up group, we plan to continue follow-up as planned to increase the precision of our results, particularly in relation to disease-specific mortality and posttreatment survival. the decision on whether the absolute benefit of follow-up is sufficient to justify its opportunity cost will differ between health economies. the benefits of follow-up appear to be independent of diagnostic stage (because although there are fewer recurrences with better-stage tumors, they are more likely to be curable), suggesting that stage-specific follow-up strategies may not be necessary. however, thorough staging investigation at the end of primary treatment to detect residual disease is still important because a large number of “recurrences” reported in routine series are probably residual disease that should be detected and treated before embarking on follow-up. because of the detailed investigation performed before trial entry to exclude residual disease, our results also provide data on the timing of recurrence that can strengthen the evidence base for choosing the optimal frequency of testing. duplication of monitoring tests does not appear to add value; participants in the cea groups had a single ct at <UNK> to <UNK> months, when <UNK> recurrences were detected, but otherwise there was no suggestion of benefit from monitoring with both cea and ct. the size of the trial provides limited precision in estimating survival. with an observed <UNK> mortality rate in the minimum follow-up group, we had only <UNK> power (with <UNK> <UNK> to detect a <UNK> effect on survival. although the observed <UNK> aggregate survival advantage of the minimum follow-up group vs the more intensive follow-up groups is unlikely to be due to bias (central death registration in the united kingdom means there was no loss to follow-up), it could be due to chance. an observed absolute <UNK> increase in surgery with curative intent predicts a <UNK> to <UNK> survival advantage with intensive follow-up. the confidence intervals around both the total mortality and colorectal cancer–specific mortality rates indicate that our results are still consistent with this outcome. conclusions among patients who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, intensive imaging and cea screening each provided an improved rate of recurrence treated with curative intent compared with minimal follow-up; there was no advantage to combining both strategies. if there is a survival advantage to any strategy, it is likely to be small.

medical statisticians seldom directly make life and death decisions. though i wouldn't like to have direct responsibility for making the decision to give a penicillin injection to a child with a purpuric rash in the community, i am conscious of the effect that my work may have on clinical decisions for such children. i felt a heavy responsibility when i conducted the statistical analysis of this paper. in most datasets that i analyse, the main issue is to quantify if the effect observed is due to chance. the question is rarely about the direction of the main effect; instead it is more about the size of the effect and the precision with which it has been estimated. but on this occasion one key statistical decision determined whether the best estimate of the effect of parenteral penicillin given before admission to hospital was a modest benefit or substantial harm (table), and the statistician involved in the previous paper from the united kingdom (on which current clinical policy is based) had taken the opposite view. table <UNK> estimated increased odds of death in children with suspected meningococcal disease given penicillin before admission to hospital according to analysis chosen children included children excluded crude odds ratio analysis a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> analysis b <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> *excluded six children because we could not determine whether or not penicillin had been administered before admission. †none of excluded children received penicillin before admission so an odds ratio cannot be obtained for this group. as the table shows, analysis a included all children with meningococcal disease for whom data were available and estimated a small protective effect of penicillin. analysis b, which included only children in whom the general practitioner had suspected a diagnosis of meningococcal disease, estimated a substantial (six-fold) reduction in survival. simpson's paradox this rather frightening statistical effect—actually changing the direction of the estimated effect from benefit to harm—is related to simpson's paradox (or the yule-simpson effect), first described in <UNK> simpson reported the seemingly impossible situation where the success of several subgroups seems to be reversed when the groups are <UNK> the reason for the paradox is the combination of two factors: an imbalance in the proportion of each subgroup receiving each intervention and a different event rate in each subgroup. this was the case with the penicillin data. to have a chance of being given penicillin, children had to be seen by a general practitioner who suspected meningococcal disease, and children who were seen by a general practitioner had a lower mortality <UNK> than those that were not <UNK> analysis a was based on all the children with meningococcal disease in our study. it replicated previous work and was therefore reassuring. but on reflection and discussion with the clinicians, i realised it transgressed one basic statistical principle—it included in the analysis children who had no chance of receiving penicillin before admission. i therefore excluded the children who had not been seen by a general practitioner or in whom he or she had not diagnosed meningococcal disease (analysis b in the table). this analysis produced the evidence of substantially increased mortality. defining the population highlighted two important sources of confounding: the fast progression of the disease and the lack of specific signs and symptoms early in the <UNK> the analysis reported is based on a population composed only of children with a more slowly progressive disease (who had time to see their doctor) and in whom the signs and symptoms were specific enough for a diagnosis. the <UNK> children in whom the general practitioner diagnosed meningococcal disease were at a later stage of their illness than the <UNK> who also saw their general practitioner but were not so diagnosed (median time from onset of illness to consultation <UNK> v <UNK> hours). furthermore, if the critical decision to administer penicillin in the <UNK> children is associated with severity of disease at the time (for example, more ill, higher chance that penicillin will be given) then the effect would be biased in the direction of penicillin causing harm. i thought it essential to adjust for severity of disease at the point at which the decision to give penicillin had been made. unfortunately, the limited data available made this difficult. the only validated measure of severity collected, gmsps score, was assessed at admission to hospital—by which time penicillin is likely to have had an effect. though severity scores at the time of diagnosis from the general practitioner's notes were obtained, recording was incomplete. nevertheless i used this partial assessment of severity at diagnosis, together with other recorded variables that are believed to be associated with mortality (such as type of disease), to obtain an adjusted effect of penicillin on mortality. having adjusted with these variables i would have expected the association between penicillin and mortality to get weaker or disappear. the estimate adjusted for severity, however, showed a further increase in the association between penicillin and mortality (adjusted odds ratio <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> the question still in my mind is whether the variables used did truly adjust for severity of disease. i decided to write this commentary to highlight the major impact that simple statistical decisions can have on the results of clinical research; to increase awareness of the possibility of simpson's paradox, particularly in observational data of this nature; and to emphasise the importance of not assuming that strong associations are necessarily causal.

abstract objective to assess the effectiveness of self monitoring blood glucose levels in people with non-insulin treated type <UNK> diabetes compared with clinical management without self monitoring, and to explore the effects in specific patient groups. design meta-analysis based on individual participant data. data sources medline, embase, and a recent systematic review of trials on self monitoring of blood glucose. chief investigators of trials published since <UNK> were approached for additional information and individual patient data. inclusion criteria randomised controlled trials in patients with non-insulin treated type <UNK> diabetes comparing an intervention using self monitoring of blood glucose with clinical management not using self monitoring. trials published from <UNK> with at least <UNK> participants were included. data collection individual patient data were collected from electronic files and checked for integrity. analysis all randomised participants were analysed using the intention to treat principle. a random effects model of complete cases was used to assess efficacy, a sensitivity analysis comprised imputed data, and prespecified subgroup analyses were carried out for age, sex, previous use of self monitoring, duration of diabetes, and levels of glycated haemoglobin <UNK> at baseline. results <UNK> patients were randomised in the six included trials. a mean reduction in <UNK> level of <UNK> mmol/mol <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> was observed for those using self monitoring of blood glucose levels compared with no self monitoring at six months. the mean reduction in <UNK> level between groups was <UNK> mmol/mol <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> at three months (five trials) and <UNK> mmol/mol <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> months (three trials). these estimates were unchanged after imputing missing data, and estimates of effect in trials with higher loss to follow-up or a possibility of co-intervention compared with those with lower loss to follow-up and no co-intervention did not differ significantly <UNK> the difference in <UNK> levels between groups was consistent across age, baseline <UNK> level, sex, and duration of diabetes, although the numbers of older and younger people and those with <UNK> levels <UNK> mmol/mol <UNK> were insufficient for interpretation. no changes occurred in systolic blood pressure <UNK> mm hg, <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> diastolic blood pressure <UNK> mm hg, <UNK> to <UNK> or total cholesterol level <UNK> mol/l, <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> conclusions evidence from this meta-analysis of individual patient data was not convincing for a clinically meaningful effect of clinical management of non-insulin treated type <UNK> diabetes by self monitoring of blood glucose levels compared with management without self monitoring, although the difference in <UNK> level between groups was statistically significant. the difference in levels was consistent across subgroups defined by personal and clinical characteristics. introduction self monitoring of blood glucose is generally accepted as integral to the management of diabetes, particularly for people who require <UNK> typically, a meter device measures blood glucose levels in a fingertip sample of capillary blood and the data are used by patients and clinicians to determine the presence of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia and to inform decisions about adjustment of insulin dosage, use of other drugs, or aspects of lifestyle that may need to be changed, such as meals and physical activity. evidence on the effectiveness of self monitoring blood glucose in people with non-insulin treated type <UNK> diabetes is less clear cut <UNK> in a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, estimates for the effect of self monitoring blood glucose <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whether these findings were accounted for by differences in trial designs, recruited populations, or the methods used to pool the data are uncertain. it is also unclear whether particular groups of people may benefit more than others from a period of self monitoring. we pooled the data from a series of randomised controlled trials of self monitoring of blood glucose in people with non-insulin treated type <UNK> diabetes, excluding trials with a small sample size and limited <UNK> we also evaluated more recent trials examining the use of blood glucose measuring devices that incorporated electrochemical sensors and technology to minimise inaccurate measurements. methods we searched the bibliography of a recent high quality systematic review to identify trials that evaluated self monitoring of blood glucose levels in people with non-insulin treated type <UNK> diabetes reported between january <UNK> and april <UNK> we searched medline and embase from april <UNK> to june <UNK> with the same search terms as used in the review (see web extra on bmj.com). to identify further trials we also hand searched other systematic reviews of glucose self monitoring, conference proceedings and abstracts, and the current controlled trials register. no language restrictions were applied. selection criteria and validity assessment we selected randomised controlled clinical trials comparing an intervention of self monitoring of blood glucose in people with non-insulin treated type <UNK> diabetes with clinical management not using self monitoring and that assessed glycaemic control by using <UNK> as a primary outcome. secondary outcomes included blood pressure and serum cholesterol level. trials were required to include an active intervention arm intended to improve disease outcomes through incorporating self monitoring into self management, and a comparator arm not using self monitoring and with no additional modification of risk factors or behaviour intended. we determined the methodological quality of selected trials by assessing randomisation, allocation concealment, blinded outcome assessment, losses to follow-up, funding source, and follow-up <UNK> two additional quality criteria were also included: a minimum sample size of <UNK> patients and a minimum study duration of six months. specification of intervention and comparator groups from published reports we obtained the details of the trial designs, interventions, comparator groups, and conduct, which we then verified with the trialists. the details included use of concealed allocation, dropout rates, the intended frequency of self monitoring, training in the self management intervention, frequency and timing of self monitoring measurements, and delivery of co-interventions. to identify the extent to which educational interventions were matched with the intervention we examined the comparator groups. we also collected details of any factors used to stratify the sample. extraction of individual patient data we contacted the principal investigators for the original individual patient data. the following baseline data, where available, were provided: date of randomisation, age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, duration of diabetes, glucose lowering treatment, previous use of blood glucose testing, weight, height, blood pressure, and levels of total cholesterol, plasma glucose, and <UNK> in addition the allocated treatment, methods of <UNK> analysis, and trial outcomes were provided, including <UNK> level, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol level. all randomised patients with a database record were entered in the pooled database. we retrieved patients lost to follow-up or excluded in published per protocol analyses and included them in the database of individual patient data. quantitative data synthesis the protocol for the study has been <UNK> and a statistical plan was agreed before starting data analysis. codes for treatment allocation were not provided until the end of the analysis process. the main analysis, including primary, secondary, and other exploratory analyses, was based on intention to treat, in which we considered all randomised participants. where a trial included two intervention arms, we pooled these to obtain a single intervention group for the <UNK> we report analyses for <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> months after the intervention. if <UNK> outcome data were available at two and four months, we averaged the figures to provide an estimate of the outcome at three months. analyses were undertaken to estimate treatment effects by fitting a two level regression model, with patients corresponding to level one units and trials as level <UNK> we treated trial specific differences as random effects and assumed the treatment effect to be common across trials. all analyses were adjusted for baseline measures and where missing were imputed using the missing indicator <UNK> to assess potential confounding we further adjusted analyses for age, sex, and duration of diabetes. we present the results for all analyses with appropriate measures of effect, <UNK> confidence intervals, and p values where applicable. for those trials where relevant data were not available we investigated the potential for bias—in particular, in trials with high levels of attrition. we handled missing primary outcomes in the regression models by adopting a bayesian <UNK> which imputes the outcome variable directly from the model, and we used these estimates as part of extended sensitivity analyses. additional sensitivity analyses were carried out for trials with higher rates of loss to follow-up or with potential for an additional impact from a co-intervention with the use of self monitoring. analyses were carried out using r version <UNK> (r foundation for statistical computing, vienna) and stata version <UNK> results of the <UNK> studies retrieved from the database search, and the additional studies from the bibliography of the high quality systematic <UNK> <UNK> trials were identified. of these, three included self monitoring in both trial <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one included multiple co-interventions alongside self monitoring that were not available to the comparator <UNK> three included patients treated with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one was a trial of financial incentives to use self <UNK> and one included patients with type <UNK> <UNK> no trials identified to june <UNK> were excluded solely because of inclusion of fewer than <UNK> patients. the remaining six trials with <UNK> patients met the criteria for inclusion in the analysis, and data were available for each of them.

additional dietary intervention with the remainder of the trials. discussion our analysis suggests that clinical management of non-insulin treated diabetes using self monitoring of blood glucose levels compared with no self monitoring results in a reduction in <UNK> level of around <UNK> mmol/mol <UNK> in trials measuring outcomes the reduction in levels at six months was apparent at three months and <UNK> months. the mean pooled reduction in <UNK> levels across the trials was <UNK> mmol/mol <UNK> in the intervention group and <UNK> mmol/mol <UNK> in the comparator group. no change in <UNK> level was observed for older and younger people and those with a level above <UNK> mmol/mol <UNK> although confidence intervals were wide, but otherwise a consistent effect of a small reduction in <UNK> level was observed in other prespecified subgroups. the numbers of patients included in the analysis were too small to confidently exclude a difference in response between those who had previously used self monitoring compared with those who had not. the differences in the effect size observed between individual trials did not suggest that differences in the way self monitoring has been used to date or the characteristics of trial participants might contribute to important differences in the observed effect. strengths and limitations of the review this analysis reports, for the first time, the results of pooling individual data from recent trials comparing self monitoring of blood glucose with no self monitoring. the results of the individual trials can be compared by using a common analysis plan, and the impact of self monitoring can now be observed in prespecified subgroups. a statistical analysis plan, written before the data were examined, contributes to the rigour of this analysis. the participants included in this analysis were drawn from a wide range of settings but are representative of people with non-insulin treated type <UNK> diabetes and therefore the findings can be applied widely. no heterogeneity was observed in outcomes between trials and therefore we have not included further analysis of differences between populations, interventions, and trial design variables. in any case the limited number of trials would not have justified such an exploratory analysis. this collaboration forms the basis of a group that can facilitate continued meta-analysis of self monitoring trials, explore co-interventions designed to enhance the effective use of self monitoring, and investigate the potential for improved outcomes from occasional or intermittent use of self monitoring in addition to regular use. despite the insights that can be obtained from an individual patient data analysis, there are several limitations to the interpretation of data. in particular, the interventions used in each trial were intended to reflect best practice as seen at the time of the trial’s design, which may not reflect subsequent developments in the use of self monitoring in clinical practice. the design of the trials reflects their “real world” settings and the difficulty of identifying the additional impact of self monitoring beyond good clinical care. for simplicity in reporting we used a linear imputation to extrapolate the measurement of <UNK> at three months from these two measures and calculated the difference in levels between the intervention and comparator group. as this is a direct comparison between randomised groups, any difference between this linear approximation and alternative methods of extrapolation is likely to be negligible. the data that could be obtained and pooled across the trials did not extend to markers of safety—for example, incidence of hypoglycaemia, although individual trials did provide data reporting low rates of recorded <UNK> <UNK> in addition, data about socioeconomic groupings and changes to treatment were insufficient to explore their impact on the changes in <UNK> levels, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. other limitations noted for individual trials included inclusion of people with a blood glucose level potentially too low to benefit from the <UNK> interventions in people with newly diagnosed diabetes, with poor control likely to improve without self <UNK> <UNK> high rates of loss to <UNK> and the presence of concerns about the contribution of a dietary co-intervention with self monitoring of glucose to <UNK> all the trials excluded patients actively using self monitoring blood glucose levels; a recent survey indicated the type of benefits that many have gained from personalised use of the <UNK> and that they may be less willing to take part in randomised trials. our data provide an indication, although not statistically significant, that those who have used self monitoring in the past may benefit less than a group newly exposed to the technology. self monitoring of blood glucose is not simply a diagnostic tool but one component of a complex intervention aimed at improving overall glycaemic control and wellbeing. the future use of self monitoring depends on integrating the technology in clinical and behavioural management pathways. poor use of monitoring may mean wasted resources, an important consideration as the market for glucose self monitoring for all types of diabetes approached <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> worldwide in <UNK> with estimated annual uk costs of <UNK> in type <UNK> <UNK> of which up to <UNK> may be attributable to use in non-insulin treated type <UNK> <UNK> the pooled estimate of the benefit from using self monitoring from our analysis is in line with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but not all of the analyses carried out that previously used aggregated <UNK> our findings do not, however, support previous assertions that the overall reduction in <UNK> level may be greater when treating those with higher compared with lower <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> although intuitively it might seem that greater reductions in <UNK> levels are possible with a higher initial level, similar reductions were also observed in the control groups. clinical implications it is widely agreed that for further evaluation of self monitoring of blood glucose, the therapeutic interventions and efforts to promote behavioural change should be more tightly aligned to the results obtained from monitoring, and targeted at those likely to <UNK> early studies linking test results to specific drug and behavioural strategies have had promising <UNK> <UNK> although not achieving the <UNK> reduction in <UNK> that is generally accepted to be of clinical <UNK> smaller reductions of <UNK> level might be of importance from a public health perspective if achieved on a wide scale and at lower cost; however, costs of self monitoring remain high, even in low and middle income countries, with the costs of unsubsidised test strips varying from <UNK> in australia to <UNK> in <UNK> until further studies can establish potential target groups and promising interventions to improve glycaemic control with self monitoring, our meta-analysis using individual patient data does not provide convincing evidence to support its routine use for people with non-insulin treated type <UNK> diabetes using the range of interventions employed within the included trials. what is already known on this topic self monitoring of blood glucose level is essential for the management of type <UNK> diabetes and insulin treated type <UNK> diabetes the use of self monitoring for non-insulin treated people has been controversial because estimates of benefit in reducing levels of <UNK> vary between systematic reviews no single trial has been large enough to identify the characteristics of those who might benefit most from monitoring blood glucose what this study adds meta-analysis using individual patient data lacked convincing evidence to support the routine use of self monitoring of blood glucose in people with non-insulin treated type <UNK> diabetes evidence was also lacking of a greater effect from self monitoring in patients with a baseline <UNK> level above <UNK> better evidence that self monitoring can provide feedback on treatment and behaviour are needed before further large scale trials are carried out

background nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) aims to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. objectives to determine the effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (nrt), including gum, transdermal patch, intranasal spray and inhaled and oral preparations, for achieving long‐term smoking cessation, compared to placebo or 'no nrt' interventions. search methods we searched the cochrane tobacco addiction group trials register for papers mentioning 'nrt' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. date of most recent search is july <UNK> selection criteria randomized trials in people motivated to quit which compared nrt to placebo or to no treatment. we excluded trials that did not report cessation rates, and those with follow‐up of less than six months. we recorded adverse events from included and excluded studies that compared nrt with placebo. studies comparing different types, durations, and doses of nrt, and studies comparing nrt to other pharmacotherapies, are covered in separate reviews. data collection and analysis screening, data extraction and 'risk of bias' assessment followed standard cochrane methods. the main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow‐up. we used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. we calculated the risk ratio (rr) for each study. where appropriate, we performed meta‐analysis using a mantel‐haenszel fixed‐effect model. main results we identified <UNK> studies; <UNK> with <UNK> participants contributed to the primary

quitting by <UNK> to <UNK> regardless of setting, and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. the relative effectiveness of nrt appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of nrt. nrt often causes minor irritation of the site through which it is administered, and in rare cases can cause non‐ischaemic chest pain and palpitations. plain language summary available in english deutsch español français hrvatski bahasa malaysia polski русский 简体中文 can nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) help people quit smoking? background we reviewed the evidence about whether nrt helps people who want to quit smoking to stop smoking at six months or longer. nrt aims to reduce withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping smoking by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes. nrt is available as skin patches that deliver nicotine slowly, and chewing gum, nasal and oral sprays, inhalators, and lozenges/tablets, all of which deliver nicotine to the brain more quickly than skin patches, but less rapidly than from smoking cigarettes. study characteristics this review includes <UNK> trials of nrt, with <UNK> people in the main analysis. all studies were conducted in people who wanted to quit smoking. most studies were conducted in adults and had similar numbers of men and women. people enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least <UNK> cigarettes a day at the start of the studies. the evidence is current to july <UNK> trials lasted for at least six months. key results we found evidence that all forms of nrt made it more likely that a person's attempt to quit smoking would succeed. the chances of stopping smoking were increased by <UNK> to <UNK> nrt works with or without additional counselling, and does not need to be prescribed by a doctor. side effects from using nrt are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. there is no evidence that nrt increases the risk of heart attacks. quality of evidence the overall quality of the evidence is high, meaning that further research is very unlikely to change our conclusions. authors' conclusions implications for practice all of the commercially available forms of nicotine replacement therapy (nrt), i.e. gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhalator, oral spray, lozenge and sublingual tablet, are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. they increase the rate of long‐term quitting by approximately <UNK> to <UNK> regardless of setting. these conclusions apply to smokers who are motivated to quit. there is little evidence about the role of nrt for individuals smoking fewer than <UNK> to <UNK> cigarettes a day. the form of delivery of nrt is unrelated to effectiveness, so other considerations such as preferences, availability, or cost might determine the form of nrt chosen. the effectiveness of nrt, in terms of the risk ratio, appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided. intensive behavioural support is not essential for nrt to be effective. however, it should be noted that the absolute increase in success rates attributable to the use of nrt will be larger when the baseline chance of success is already raised by the provision of intensive behavioural support. nrt causes non‐ischaemic chest pain and palpitations in a minority of users but there is no evidence of an excess of serious cardiac problems, even in people with established cardiac disease. nrt commonly leads to minor adverse reactions which reflect irritation of the site of use of the form of nrt. these reactions are usually not severe enough to prompt discontinuation of treatment implications for research there is high‐quality evidence that nicotine replacement therapy increases quit rates at six months or longer in adults motivated to quit. we consider that further research is highly unlikely to change our confidence in the effect of nrt in this population. summary of findings open in table viewersummary of findings for the main comparison. nicotine replacement therapy nicotine replacement

and a funnel plot showed some evidence of asymmetry. however, given the large number of trials in the review, this does not suggest the results would be altered significantly were smaller studies with lower rrs included. background nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) aims to reduce motivation to smoke and the physiological and psychomotor withdrawal symptoms often experienced during an attempt to stop smoking, and therefore increase the likelihood of remaining abstinent (west <UNK> nicotine undergoes first‐pass metabolism in the liver, reducing the overall bioavailability of swallowed nicotine pills. a pill that could reliably produce high enough nicotine levels in the central nervous system would risk causing adverse gastrointestinal effects. to avoid this problem, nicotine replacement products are formulated for absorption through the oral or nasal mucosa (chewing gum, lozenges, sublingual tablets, inhalator, spray) or through the skin (transdermal patches). nicotine patches differ from the other products in that they deliver the nicotine dose slowly and passively. they do not replace any of the behavioural activities of smoking. in contrast the other types of nrt are faster‐acting, but require more effort on the part of the user. transdermal patches are available in several different doses, and deliver between <UNK> mg and <UNK> mg of nicotine over a <UNK> period, resulting in plasma levels similar to the trough levels seen in heavy smokers (fiore <UNK> some brands of patch are designed to be worn for <UNK> hours whilst others are to be worn for <UNK> hours each day. nicotine gum is available in both <UNK> mg and <UNK> mg strengths, and nicotine lozenges are available in <UNK> mg, <UNK> mg, <UNK> mg and <UNK> mg strengths. nicotine nasal sprays are available in either <UNK> mg or <UNK> mg per spray strengths, and nicotine inhalators are available in both <UNK> mg and <UNK> mg strengths. the amount of nicotine absorbed by the user is less than the original dose. none of the available products deliver such high doses of nicotine as quickly as cigarettes. an average cigarette delivers between <UNK> and <UNK> mg of nicotine and a person who smokes <UNK> cigarettes per day absorbs <UNK> to <UNK> mg of nicotine each day (henningfield <UNK> the availability of nrt products on prescription or for over‐the‐counter purchase varies from country

comparison to placebo for helping people stop smoking, but also looked at comparisons between different forms and doses of nrt, and between nrt and different pharmacotherapies. the evidence that nrt helps some people to stop smoking is now well accepted, and many clinical guidelines recommend nrt as a first‐line treatment for people seeking pharmacological help to stop smoking (fiore <UNK> italy iss <UNK> le foll <UNK> nice <UNK> nz moh <UNK> woolacott <UNK> zwar <UNK> we have therefore split the previous version of the review; this review now only looks at nrt versus placebo or no pharmacotherapy, with the intention that, given the stability of this comparison, this review will no longer require regular updates. studies which compare doses, delivery, forms, and schedules of nrt will now be covered in a companion review, which will continue to be regularly updated, and is in development at the time of writing. comparisons between nrt and other frontline pharmacotherapies are covered in separate cochrane reviews (cahill <UNK> hughes <UNK> where they meet our other inclusion criteria, studies of nrt in pregnancy are included in the main analysis of this review but are covered comprehensively in a separate cochrane review (coleman <UNK> which will continue to be updated. readers specifically interested in nrt in pregnancy should refer to coleman <UNK> objectives to determine the effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (nrt), including gum, transdermal patch, intranasal spray and inhaled and oral preparations, for achieving long‐term smoking cessation, compared to placebo or 'no nrt' interventions. methods criteria for considering studies for this review types of studies randomized controlled trials. we also include trials where allocation to treatment was by a quasi‐randomized method, but use appropriate sensitivity analysis to determine whether their inclusion alters the results. types of participants we include men or women who smoked and were motivated to quit, irrespective of the setting from which they were recruited or their initial level of nicotine dependence, or both. we included studies that randomized therapists, rather than smokers, to offer nrt or a control, provided that the specific aim of the study was to examine the effect of nrt on smoking cessation. we have not included trials that randomized physicians or other therapists to receive an educational intervention, which included encouraging their patients to use nrt, but have reviewed them separately (carson <UNK> types of interventions comparisons of nrt (including chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal and oral spray, inhalators and tablets or lozenges) versus placebo or no nrt control. the terms 'inhaler' and 'inhalator' (an oral device which delivers nicotine to the buccal mucosa by sucking) are used interchangeably in the literature. we have used the term 'inhalator' throughout the rest of this review. in some analyses we categorized the trials into groups depending on the level of additional support provided (low or high). the definition of the low‐intensity category was intended to identify a level of support that could be offered as part of the provision of routine medical care. if the duration of time spent with the smoker (including assessment for the trial) exceeded <UNK> minutes at the initial consultation or the number of further assessment and reinforcement visits exceeded two, we categorized the level of additional support as high. the high‐intensity category included trials where there were a large number of visits to the clinic or trial centre, but these were often brief, spread over an extended period during treatment and follow‐up, and did not include a specific counselling component. to provide a more fine‐grained analysis and to distinguish between high‐intensity group‐based support and other trials within the high‐intensity category, we have therefore specified where the support included multi‐session group‐based counselling with frequent sessions around the quit date. previously, this review had also included studies where all arms received nrt (e.g. testing different doses, types) and studies comparing nrt with bupropion. these comparisons are now covered elsewhere; comparisons between different nrt treatments are covered in a companion review, currently under development, and comparisons between nrt and bupropion are found in hughes <UNK> types of outcome measures the review evaluates the effects of nrt versus control on smoking cessation, rather than on withdrawal symptoms. we excluded trials that followed up participants for less than six months, except for trials amongst pregnant women, where the interval between enrolment and delivery may have been shorter (if less than six months, these were excluded from the main analysis). for each study we chose the strictest available criteria to define abstinence. for example, in studies where biochemical validation of cessation was available, we regard only those participants who met the criteria for biochemically‐confirmed abstinence as being abstinent. wherever possible we chose a measure of sustained cessation rather than point prevalence. we regard people who were lost to follow‐up as being continuing smokers. for the <UNK> update and for this current update we collected data on adverse events in both the included and excluded studies, where they were reported. we have not attempted to pool these findings, apart from one meta‐analysis of reports of palpitations, tachycardia or chest pains. we have not included trials that evaluated the effect of nrt for individuals who were attempting to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked rather than to quit in this review. they are covered by a separate review on harm reduction approaches (lindson‐hawley <UNK> search methods for identification of studies we searched the specialized register of the cochrane tobacco addiction group on <UNK> july <UNK> for any reports of trials making reference to the use of nicotine replacement therapy of any type, by searching for 'nrt', or 'nicotine' near to terms for nicotine replacement products in the title, abstract or keywords. the most recent issues of the databases included in the register as searched for the current update of this review were: cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), issue <UNK> <UNK> medline (via ovid) to update <UNK> embase (via ovid) to week <UNK> psycinfo (via ovid) to update <UNK> the search strategy for the register is given in appendix <UNK> for details of the searches used to create the specialized register see the tobacco addiction group module in the cochrane library. the trials register also includes trials identified by handsearching of abstract books from meetings of the society for research on nicotine and tobacco. for earlier versions of this review we performed searches of additional databases: cancerlit, health planning and administration, social scisearch, smoking & health, and dissertation abstracts. since the searches did not produce any additional trials we did not search these databases after december <UNK> during preparation of the first version of this review, we also sent letters to manufacturers of nrt preparations. since this did not result in additional data we have not repeated the exercise for subsequent updates. data collection and analysis selection of studies in previous versions of this review, one review author screened records retrieved by searches, to exclude papers that were not reports of potentially relevant studies. for the last two updates, two review authors independently screened references. reports that linked to potentially relevant studies but did not report the outcomes of interest are listed along with the main study report in the 'references to studies' section. the primary reference to the study is indicated, and for most studies the first author and year used as the study identifier corresponds to the primary reference. where we extracted data for a study from more than one report we have noted this in the characteristics of included studies table. data extraction and management two review authors independently extracted data from the published reports and abstracts. we resolved disagreements by discussion or by referral to a third party. we made no attempt to blind these review authors either to the results of the primary studies or to which treatment participants received. we examined reports published only in non‐english language journals with the assistance of translators. assessment of risk of bias in included studies we assessed included studies for risks of selection bias (methods of randomized sequence generation, and allocation concealment), performance and detection bias (the presence or absence of blinding), attrition bias (levels and reporting of loss to follow‐up), and any other threats to study validity, using the cochrane 'risk of bias' tool. measures of treatment effect we extracted smoking cessation rates in the intervention and control groups from the reports at six or <UNK> months. since not all studies reported cessation rates at exactly these intervals, we allowed a window period of six weeks at each follow‐up point. for trials which also reported follow‐up for more than a year we used <UNK> outcomes in most cases. (we note length of follow‐up for each study in the characteristics of included studies table). for trials of nrt in pregnant women, we extracted smoking cessation outcomes at the closest follow‐up to end of pregnancy, and also at longest follow‐up post‐partum if reported. we only included studies in pregnant women in the main analysis if they reported results at six months or longer. following the cochrane tobacco addiction group's recommended method of data analysis, we use the risk ratio (rr) for summarizing individual trial outcomes and for estimates of pooled effect. whilst there are circumstances in which odds ratios may be preferable, there is a danger that they will be interpreted as if they are risk ratios, making the treatment effect seem larger (deeks <UNK> dealing with missing data we treated participants who dropped out or who were lost to follow‐up after randomization as being continuing smokers. we noted in the 'risk of bias' table the proportion of participants for whom the outcome was imputed in this way, and whether there was either high or differential loss to follow‐up. the assumption that 'missing = smoking' will give conservative absolute quit rates, and will make little difference to the risk ratio unless dropout rates differ substantially between groups. assessment of heterogeneity to assess heterogeneity we use the <UNK> statistic, given by the formula [(q ‐ df)/q] x <UNK> where q is the <UNK> statistic and df is its degrees of freedom (higgins <UNK> this describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). a value greater than <UNK> may be considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity. when there are many trials, as in this review, the <UNK> test for heterogeneity will be unduly powerful and may identify statistically significant but clinically unimportant heterogeneity. data synthesis we estimated a pooled weighted average of risk ratios using a fixed‐effect mantel‐haenszel method, with <UNK> confidence intervals. subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity in comparing nrt to placebo or control, we performed subgroup analysis for each form of nrt. we did additional subgroup analyses within type of nrt (gum, patch, etc.) to investigate whether the relative treatment effect differed according to the way in which smoking cessation was defined, the intensity of behavioural support, and the recruitment/treatment setting. summary of findings table following standard cochrane methodology, we created a 'summary of findings' table. also following standard cochrane methodology, we used the five grade considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome, and to draw conclusions about the quality of evidence within the text of the review. the cochrane tobacco addiction group's glossary of

nrt‐versus‐control comparison. as described in the methods, studies which contribute to comparisons between multiple forms of nrt are now found in a separate cochrane review, in development at the time of publication. previously‐included studies that compare nrt with bupropion can be found in hughes <UNK> other studies that were potentially relevant but excluded are listed with reasons in the

these had as their primary outcome withdrawal symptoms rather than cessation. we exclude studies that provided nrt or placebo to people trying to cut down their smoking but not to make an immediate quit attempt, and we consider them in detail in a separate review of interventions for reduction (lindson‐hawley <UNK> we excluded two trials in which nrt was provided to encourage a quit attempt but participants did not need to be planning to quit: velicer <UNK> proactively recruited people by telephone, with those in one intervention group being mailed a six‐week course of nicotine patches if they were judged to be in the preparation stage or in contemplation and had more pros than cons for quitting; carpenter <UNK> encouraged all participants to make a practice quit attempt, and gave the

had access to and used free nrt and other stop‐smoking medication at high levels (ferguson <UNK> risk of bias in included studies six trials are included based only on data available from abstracts,

be at low risk of bias (low risk of bias across all domains), <UNK> at high risk of bias (high risk of bias in at least one domain), and the rest at unclear risk of bias. the main findings were not sensitive to the exclusion from the meta‐analysis of trials at unclear risk, or of trials at unclear and at high risk of bias. a summary illustration of the risk of bias profile across trials is shown

as being at low risk for their attempts to control selection bias, by using a system of treatment allocation which could not be known or predicted until a participant is enrolled and assigned to a study condition. twenty‐four of these low‐risk trials <UNK> also reported adequate sequence generation procedures. most studies either did not report how randomization was performed and allocation concealed, or reported them in insufficient detail to determine whether a satisfactory attempt to control selection bias had been made (rated as being at unclear risk). a small number of nicotine gum trials randomized to treatment according to day or week of clinic attendance (page <UNK> richmond <UNK> russell <UNK> or to birth date (fagerström <UNK> and were consequently rated as being at high risk of bias. in one study (gallagher <UNK> study staff oversaw allocation and hence we rated this at high risk of bias. one study randomized by physician and there was no information about avoidance

judged <UNK> <UNK> to be at high risk of bias in this domain, most commonly because they were not blinded (although we judged some studies which were not double‐blind to be at low risk in this domain due to other study factors). forty‐three trials did not have a matched placebo control <UNK> gum trials, nine patch trials, six choice of product trials, three combination trials, and one lozenge trial). a further two had both a placebo and a non‐placebo control which we combined for the meta‐analysis control group (buchkremer <UNK> russell <UNK> approximately one‐third of the trials reported some measure of blinding, but we did not assess whether the integrity of the procedure was tested, in line with the consort guidelines (consort <UNK> where they are done, assessments of blinding integrity should always be carried out before the clinical outcome has been determined, and the findings reported (altman <UNK> mooney <UNK> notes that few published trials report this information. while those that do provide some evidence that participants are likely to assess their treatment assignment correctly, it is insufficient to assess whether this is associated with differences in treatment effects. further, there may be an apparent breaking of the blinding in trials where the treatment effect is marked, for either an intended outcome or an adverse event, but participants who successfully decipher assignment may disguise their unblinding actions (altman <UNK> it is also possible that those who believe that they are receiving a placebo may be more likely to stop trying to quit. definitions of abstinence varied considerably. eighty‐nine trials <UNK> reported some measure of sustained abstinence, which included continuous abstinence with not even a slip since quit day, repeated point prevalence abstinence (with or without biochemical validation) at multiple follow‐ups, or self‐reported abstinence for a prolonged period. thirty‐nine <UNK> reported only point prevalence abstinence at the longest follow‐up. in six studies it was unclear exactly how abstinence was defined. in four trials, participants who smoked two or three cigarettes a week were still classified as abstinent (abelin <UNK> ehrsam <UNK> glavas <UNK> glavas <UNK> sensitivity analyses excluding these four trials made no difference to the overall findings. most studies reported follow‐up at least <UNK> months from start of treatment. fifteen gum trials, <UNK> patch trials, four combination trials, and one lozenge trial in the primary analysis had only six months follow‐up. we report the findings of a subgroup analysis by type of abstinence and length of follow‐up in the results section. one hundred and seventeen <UNK> of the trials used biochemical validation of self‐reported smoking cessation at longest follow‐up. the most common form of validation was measurement of carbon monoxide (co) in expired air. the 'cut‐off' level of co used to define abstinence varied from less than <UNK> to <UNK> parts per million. some of the <UNK> trials that did not validate all self‐report at longest follow‐up did use biochemical confirmation at earlier points, or validated some self‐reports. the main findings were not sensitive to the exclusion of <UNK> studies contributing to that analysis that did not attempt to validate all reported abstinence (ahluwalia

sensitivity to definition of abstinence for nicotine gum and patch we assessed whether trials that reported sustained abstinence at <UNK> months had different treatment effects from those that only reported a point prevalence outcome, or had shorter follow‐up (analysis <UNK> analysis <UNK> subgroup categories were sustained abstinence at <UNK> months or more, sustained abstinence at six months,

estimate was similar to that for all <UNK> studies: sustained <UNK> rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> participants), compared with rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> the highest estimate was for the subgroup of eight studies reporting sustained abstinence at six months, where confidence intervals did not overlap: rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> participants. this seems to be attributable to one study (shiffman <UNK> <UNK> mg); shiffman <UNK> <UNK> mg)), and is unlikely to be of methodological or clinical significance. for nicotine patch, <UNK> studies <UNK> reported sustained <UNK> abstinence, and the rr was also similar to that for all <UNK> studies: sustained <UNK> rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> participants), compared with rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> participants) overall). for patch studies there was no evidence that the rrs differed significantly between subgroups. sensitivity to intensity of behavioural support all trials provided the same behavioural support in terms of advice, counselling, and number of follow‐up visits to the active pharmacotherapy and control groups, but different trials provided different amounts of support. we conducted subgroup analyses by intensity of support for gum and patch trials separately (analysis <UNK> analysis <UNK> there was no evidence of a significantly different effect between groups. for nicotine gum the rr was similar across all three subgroups. the control group quit rates varied as expected, averaging <UNK> with low‐intensity support, <UNK> with high‐intensity individual support and <UNK> with group‐based support. nicotine patch trials showed the same pattern; the rrs were similar for each subgroup and the average control group quit rates were <UNK> with low‐intensity support, <UNK> with high‐intensity individual support and <UNK> with group‐based support. sensitivity to treatment settings we conducted further subgroup analyses for each type of setting in which smokers were recruited or treated (with type of nrt as a subgroup beneath setting). the pooled rr for trials in community volunteers where care was provided in a medical setting was

only setting in which results did not show a statistically significant effect of the intervention. in a meta‐regression we checked whether there was any evidence of interaction between the treatment setting and type of nrt used. the effect of nicotine gum was highest in the otc setting and this seems to be attributable to the same study that contributed heterogeneity in the abstinence subgroup analysis above (shiffman <UNK> <UNK> mg); shiffman <UNK> <UNK> mg)). control group quit rates varied by setting; the lowest rates were found in otc <UNK> and primary care <UNK> studies, and the highest rate in smoking clinics <UNK> falling within this range, control group rates were <UNK> in antenatal clinics, <UNK> in community volunteers where treatment was provided in a medical setting, and <UNK> in hospitals. sensitivity to risk of bias and study methods excluding those studies at high risk of bias did not significantly alter the point estimate for the main comparison: rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> analysis not shown. similarly, restricting the main analysis to only those <UNK> studies at low risk of bias across all domains led to results consistent with the main analysis: rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> analysis not shown. removing those studies without biochemical validation did not substantially influence the effect estimate: rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> analysis not shown, nor did restricting the analysis to only placebo‐controlled studies: rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> analysis not shown. relapsed smokers although many of the trials reported here did not specifically exclude people who had previously tried and failed to quit with nrt, one trial recruited people who had relapsed after patch and behavioural support in an earlier phase of the study but were motivated to make a second attempt (gourlay <UNK> this study did not detect an effect on continuous abstinence (rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> analysis not shown), although it did detect a significant increase in <UNK> point prevalence abstinence (rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> quit rates were low in both groups with either definition of abstinence. adverse events we have made no systematic attempt in this review to synthesize quantitatively the incidence of the various adverse events reported with the different nrt preparations. this was because of the extensive variation in reporting of the nature, timing and duration of symptoms. in the included studies, attrition rates in nrt groups were generally similar to or lower than in control groups. appendix <UNK> summarises the main adverse events reported in the included and excluded studies, where the data were available. the most common adverse events usually reported with nicotine gum include hiccoughs, gastrointestinal disturbances, jaw pain, and orodental problems (fiore <UNK> palmer <UNK> the only adverse event that appears to interfere with use of the patch is skin sensitivity and local skin irritation; this may affect up to <UNK> of patch users, but it is usually mild and rarely leads to withdrawal of patch use (fiore <UNK> the major adverse events reported with the nicotine inhalator and nasal and oral sprays are related to local irritation at the site of administration (mouth and nose respectively). for example, symptoms such as throat irritation, coughing, and oral burning were reported significantly more frequently with participants allocated to the nicotine inhalator than to placebo control (schneider <UNK> none of the experiences, however, were reported as severe. with the nasal spray, nasal irritation and runny nose are the most commonly reported adverse events. in the study of oral spray, hiccoughs and throat irritation were the most commonly reported adverse events (tønnesen <UNK> nicotine sublingual tablets have been reported to cause hiccoughs, burning and smarting sensation in the mouth, sore throat, coughing, dry lips and mouth ulcers (wallstrom <UNK> adolescents report similar adverse events to adults (bailey <UNK> a review of adverse events based on <UNK> trials with over <UNK> participants did not find evidence of excess adverse cardiovascular events amongst those assigned to nicotine patch, and the total number of such events was low (greenland <UNK> a meta‐analysis of adverse events associated with nrt included <UNK> rcts

extremely rare event, occurring at a rate of <UNK> in the nrt groups compared with <UNK> in the control groups in the <UNK> trials in which they were reported at all. a recent network meta‐analysis of cardiovascular events associated with smoking cessation pharmacotherapies (mills <UNK> including <UNK> rcts comparing nrt with placebo, found statistically significant evidence that the rate of cardiovascular events with nrt was higher (rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> however, when only serious adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death) were considered, the finding was not statistically significant (rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> a sensitivity analysis demonstrated that lower‐level events, predominantly tachycardia and arrhythmia, accounted for the observed increased risk of cardiovascular events. chest pains and palpitations are the only clinically significant adverse events to emerge from the trials, and no evidence of significant harm has been identified. when first licensed there was concern about the safety of nrt in smokers with cardiac disease (tnwg <UNK> a trial of nicotine patch that recruited smokers aged over <UNK> with at least one diagnosis of cardiovascular disease found no evidence that serious adverse events were more common in smokers in the nicotine patch group (joseph <UNK> events related to cardiovascular disease, such as an increase in angina severity, occurred in approximately <UNK> of participants, but did not differ according to whether or not they were receiving nrt. a review of safety in people with cardiovascular disease found no evidence of an increased risk of cardiac events (joseph <UNK> this included data from two randomized trials with short‐term follow‐up that we excluded from the present review (tzivoni <UNK> working group <UNK> and a case‐control study in a population‐based sample. an analysis of <UNK> smokers admitted to hospital with acute coronary syndromes who received nicotine patches showed no evidence of difference in short‐ or long‐term mortality compared to a propensity‐matched sample of smokers in the same database who did not receive nrt (meine <UNK> a subgroup analysis within a network meta‐analysis of cardiovascular events (mills <UNK> found no increased risk of cardiovascular events with nrt amongst individuals with predisposing conditions that placed them at an increased risk of having an event (rr <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> another recent network meta‐analysis in people with cardiovascular disease found a slightly higher number of cardiovascular events with nrt but was not able to draw quantitative conclusions due to the low number of trials reporting adverse events and the variation in adverse event definitions used (suissa <UNK> the six trials assessing nrt use in pregnant women did not detect significant increases in serious adverse events amongst the treatment groups (berlin <UNK> coleman <UNK> el‐mohandes <UNK> oncken <UNK> pollak <UNK> wisborg <UNK> the effects of nrt use on neonatal health are discussed further in a separate cochrane review, which found no statistically significant differences in rates of any serious adverse events between treatment and control groups (coleman <UNK> as mentioned previously, this separate review covers this topic comprehensively and will be regularly updated, so interested readers should refer to coleman <UNK> for more information on the adverse events profile of nrt in pregnancy. discussion this review provides high‐quality evidence from trials including over <UNK> participants that offering nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) to dependent smokers who are prepared to try to quit increases their chance of success over that achieved with the same level of support but without nrt. this applies to all forms of nrt and is independent of any variations in methodology or design characteristics of trials included in the meta‐analysis. in particular we did not find evidence that the relative effect of nrt was smaller in trials with longer follow‐up beyond our six‐month minimum for inclusion. we did not compare end‐of‐treatment risk ratios with post‐treatment follow‐up, and relapse rates may be higher in active treatment participants once they stop using nrt products, but later relapse is probably unrelated to nrt use (etter <UNK> the absolute effects of nrt use will depend on the baseline quit rate, which varies in different clinical settings. studies of people attempting to quit on their own suggest that success rates after six to <UNK> months are <UNK> to <UNK> (hughes <UNK> use of nrt might be expected to increase the rate by <UNK> to <UNK> giving a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (nntb) of <UNK> if, however, the quit rate without pharmacotherapy was estimated to be <UNK> either because the population had other predictors of successful quitting or received intensive behavioural support, then another <UNK> might be expected to quit, giving an nntb of <UNK> intensity of additional support and treatment setting we did not detect important differences in relative effect within patch or gum studies by our classification of level of support. a letter prior to the previous update of this review identified inconsistencies in the classification of low‐ and high‐intensity support in this review (walsh <UNK> in response, we changed the classification of a small number of trials. this did not alter the conclusion that intensity of support does not appear to be an important moderator of nrt effect. we also did not detect differences in relative effect according to the setting of recruitment and treatment. this subgroup analysis had considerable overlap with the support subgroup since, for example, people recruited in primary care settings typically had lower‐intensity support. there has been continuing debate about the amount of evidence for the efficacy of nrt when obtained otc without advice or support from a healthcare professional (hughes <UNK> walsh <UNK> walsh <UNK> the small number of placebo‐controlled trials in settings intended to replicate otc settings support the conclusion that the relative effect of nrt is similar to settings where more advice and behavioural support is provided, although quit rates in both control and intervention groups have been low. one other meta‐analysis supports the conclusion of efficacy, although it differs in its inclusion criteria (hughes <UNK> in addition to the same three trials comparing nicotine patch to placebo in an otc setting (davidson <UNK> hays <UNK> sønderskov <UNK> that review includes one study excluded here due to short follow‐up (shiffman <UNK> it also pools four trials comparing nrt provided otc to nrt provided under prescription. we exclude one trial that compared both gum and patch in these settings, but was not randomized (shiffman <UNK> and another that has not been published and for which we have been unable to obtain reliable data for inclusion (korberly <UNK> the abstract reported that there were no significant differences in quit rates between users of nicotine patch who purchased it through a non‐healthcare facility, and those receiving it on prescription. it has also been suggested that the 'real world' effectiveness of nrt declines or disappears once it becomes available to purchase without requiring contact with a health professional who can offer behavioural support and guidance on appropriate use (kotz <UNK> pierce <UNK> a comparison of two cross‐sectional surveys in california found that quit rates for self‐selected nrt users were higher than rates for non‐users prior to otc availability, but after the switch to otc this difference disappeared (pierce <UNK> in addition, a prospective cohort study found that the odds of cessation in people who had used otc nrt were lower than in people who had not used any cessation pharmacotherapy or accessed a national stop‐smoking service (or <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> (kotz <UNK> however, these observational studies are at risk of residual confounding from unmeasured confounders, such as psychological factors, as participants self‐selected their treatment. these studies are also at risk of bias, as unaided quit attempts are less likely to be recalled than those involving nrt. a report of a prospective cohort study questioned the effectiveness of nrt outside of the clinical trial setting after finding no difference in relapse rates between smokers trying to quit who used nrt and those who did not use nrt (alpert <UNK> however, the design of this study has been criticized for not addressing initial quit rates in the two groups (stapleton <UNK> furthermore, two multi‐country prospective cohort studies observed that nrt users had higher quit rates than non‐users (kasza <UNK> west <UNK> although in the former study this effect was limited to nrt patches, with no effect detected for oral nicotine products. again, these are observational studies and are at risk of confounding and bias. trials in special populations trials generally restricted recruitment to adults over the age of <UNK> in a small number of trials the age range was not specified. two relatively small studies in adolescents did not detect an effect of nrt on quitting at six months or longer (moolchan <UNK> scherphof <UNK> a separate cochrane review of tobacco cessation interventions for young people did not detect an effect of nrt, although confidence intervals were wide and did not preclude the possibility of a clinically important effect (fanshawe <UNK> this is likely to remain an active area of research. this review previously conducted a separate analysis on a subgroup of studies evaluating nrt in pregnant women. this is covered by a separate cochrane review (coleman <UNK> which provides more comprehensive analysis of these studies and will be regularly updated (whereas this review is now marked as stable and will no longer be updated). therefore, readers interested in this topic should refer to (coleman <UNK> evidence for differential treatment effects in different subgroups we made no attempt to conduct separate analyses for any subgroups of trial participants, because subgroup results are uncommon in trial reports, and where data cannot be obtained from all studies there is a risk of bias from using incomplete data. munafó <UNK> has reported the results of a meta‐analysis of nicotine patch by sex. the researchers were able to include data from <UNK> out of <UNK> eligible trials <UNK> and <UNK> of study participants. they found no evidence that the nicotine patch was more effective for men than for women, as has been hypothesized; although men showed a somewhat bigger benefit from nrt at <UNK> months, the difference was not significant. there was also no difference in average placebo quit rates between men and women, which has been reported in some studies. in a commentary some additional data were identified (perkins <UNK> but this did not alter the conclusions (munafó <UNK> a second meta‐analysis of any type of nrt reported that in women the odds ratio for cessation declined with increasing length of follow‐up, with a non‐significant difference at <UNK> months (cepeda‐benito <UNK> amongst men the odds ratio declined less over time and remained significant. based on a further subgroup analysis, they also reported that the decline in long‐term efficacy in women was greater in trials with low‐intensity support than with high‐intensity support, suggesting that the more intensive support helped prevent late relapse in women who had initially received nrt. although there was no evidence of bias, the review could only include a subset of published studies, so the finding should be regarded as hypothesis‐generating. all review authors agreed that trials are underpowered to identify any interaction between treatment and any type of individual characteristics, and recommended public archiving of data from studies, as well as new research specifically designed to test group‐by‐treatment interactions. at the moment there does not appear to be sufficient evidence of clinically important differences between men and women to guide treatment matching. re‐treating relapsed smokers whilst end‐of‐treatment success rates may be quite high, many people relapse after the end of therapy. there is suggestive evidence that repeated use of nrt in people who have relapsed after an initial course may produce further quitters, although the absolute effect is small (gourlay <UNK> a subgroup analysis in another trial indicated that the relative effect of treatment with nicotine patch compared to placebo was at least as high for people who had used nrt before (jorenby <UNK> reported in durcan <UNK> the authors noted that there was no way to distinguish between people who had completely failed to quit using nrt and those who had been initially successful but relapsed. limitations of the evidence base two possible limitations to this evidence base need to be borne in mind: risk of bias in individual studies and publication bias. for the former, although we judged most of our included studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain, restricting the analysis to only those studies at low risk of bias overall did not significantly alter the pooled effect. for the latter, we tried to partly address any shortcomings from having limited our analysis to reported data by approaching investigators, where necessary, to obtain additional unpublished data or to clarify areas of uncertainty. although we took steps to minimize publication bias by writing to the manufacturers of nrt products when this review was first prepared, the response was poor and we have not repeated this exercise, although we have searched clinical trials registries. it is therefore possible that there are some unpublished trials, with less favourable results, that we have not identified despite our efforts to do so. a funnel plot (figure <UNK> shows some evidence of asymmetry for trials in the main comparison; however, given the large number of trials in the review, the funnel plot does not suggest that results would be altered significantly were smaller studies with lower rrs included. a meta‐analysis has also demonstrated that nicotine gum and patch studies that received pharmaceutical industry funding have on average slightly higher effect sizes than other studies after controlling for some trial characteristics (etter <UNK> the practical effect of these considerations is that the magnitude of the effectiveness of nrt may be smaller than our estimates suggest. open in figure viewer figure <UNK> funnel plot of comparison: <UNK> any type of nrt versus placebo/no nrt control, outcome: <UNK> smoking cessation at <UNK> months follow up. funnel plot of comparison: <UNK> any type of nrt versus placebo/no nrt control, outcome: <UNK> smoking cessation at <UNK> months follow up. a possible further limitation relates to length of follow‐up. this review excludes studies with less than a six‐month follow‐up from the start of treatment; the outcome used reflects the effect of nrt after the end of active treatment. a comparison of abstinence rates during treatment and abstinence at one year suggests that the relative effect of nrt declines once active therapy stops (fagerström <UNK> i.e. people who quit with the help of nrt are a little more likely to relapse after they discontinue treatment than those on placebo. the relative effect of nrt could continue to decline even after a year of follow‐up. however, a meta‐analysis comparing one‐year and long‐term outcomes in <UNK> nrt trials with follow‐up beyond one year suggested that the relative efficacy did not change, with similar relapse rates in the active and placebo groups, but further relapse does reduce the absolute difference in quit rates (etter <UNK> stability of the evidence base this review was first published in <UNK> despite the number of included studies more than doubling over this time, the effect estimate has remained remarkably stable, and our intention is that this publication is the final time the cochrane tobacco addiction group will review the evidence comparing nrt to placebo or to no pharmacotherapy. this is not to say that all questions about nrt have been answered; evidence is still needed comparing different forms, doses, and durations of nrt, comparing nrt to other pharmacotherapies, and testing nrt in special populations where we may reasonably hypothesize that its effectiveness differs from that in the general population (e.g. pregnant women, adolescents). further studies are also needed of electronic cigarettes containing nicotine, which some consider a form of nrt (but which we have never included in this review). however, we will cover these in separate reviews which we will continue to update regularly (cahill <UNK> coleman <UNK> fanshawe <UNK> hartmann‐boyce <UNK> hughes <UNK> in summary, based on <UNK> years of research and <UNK> randomized controlled trials in over <UNK> participants, we believe the question of whether nrt helps people to quit smoking to be definitively answered. we consider that further research is highly unlikely to change our confidence in the effect of nrt, and funders and researchers should give careful thought before pursuing further studies comparing established forms of nrt with control.

abstract objective to evaluate the effect of different types of adjunctive support to stop smoking for individuals contacting telephone “quitlines,” including call‐back counselling, different counselling techniques and provision of self help materials. data sources this review includes quitline studies identified as part of cochrane reviews of telephone counselling and self help materials for smoking cessation. we updated the searches for this review. study selection we included studies that were randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of any quitline or related service with follow‐up of at least six months. data extraction data were extracted by one author and checked by a second. the cessation outcome was numbers quit at longest follow‐up taking the strictest definition of abstinence available, and assuming participants lost to follow‐up continued to smoke. data synthesis we identified <UNK> relevant studies. eight studies <UNK> <UNK> participants) comparing multiple

quitline contact (three trials). conclusions multiple call‐back counselling improves long term cessation for smokers who contact quitline services. offering more calls may improve success rates. we failed to detect an effect of the type of counselling or the type of self help materials supplied as adjuncts to quitline counselling. keywords: smoking cessation, quitlines, call‐back counselling, tailoring, self help telephone quitlines are an established means of providing support for smoking <UNK> we aim here to evaluate the effect of different interventions for smokers who call quitlines seeking help to quit smoking. the support offered by quitlines may include mailed materials, recorded messages, counselling at the time of the call, call‐back from a counsellor, access to pharmacotherapy and combinations of these elements. in this review we principally consider the effect of providing call‐back counselling after an initial call. we also consider the evidence that there is a difference by method of counselling and examine the effect of adjunctive self help materials (excluding evaluations of the effect of personally tailored materials). go to: methods data sources

register incorporates the results of systematic searches for trials on tobacco addiction in medline, embase, psycinfo and science citation index electronic databases and includes trials reported in conference abstracts including society for research on nicotine and tobacco meetings. we updated the search in november <UNK> and identified one new study that recruited quitline <UNK> we excluded this because it only compared different types of individually tailored materials. we contacted the principal investigators of previously identified unpublished trials to see if further data were available. some studies identified by this search strategy compare the effect of different types of self help materials for callers to quitlines. these are covered by the cochrane review of self help materials so the data are drawn from this <UNK> study selection we included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials that enrolled smokers or recent quitters who called a telephone service that offered quitting support. the intervention was one or more sessions of call‐back cessation counselling (also called proactive or counsellor initiated counselling); or comparison of a different counselling protocol or of different forms of self help materials at the initial call. control conditions included mailed self help materials; advice, counselling or recorded messages during the initial call. we excluded trials or arms of trials that only evaluated the use of individually tailored self help materials. the outcome was smoking status at least six months after the initial contact. data extraction for both the cochrane reviews one author (ls) identified potentially relevant studies and extracted data. a second author checked inclusion criteria and data. data synthesis the primary outcome was the proportion of quitters at the longest follow up, using the strictest measure of abstinence reported. we preferred sustained and biochemically validated abstinence to point prevalence and/or self reported quitting. we used as the denominator the number randomised, assuming participants lost to follow up continued to smoke. we grouped studies to address three central questions: call‐back counselling: does multiple contact intervention increase the proportion of quitters compared to a single telephone contact control? counselling method: is there a difference in proportion of quitters between different counselling protocols at a single contact? self help materials: is there a difference in proportion of quitters with different types including population targeted materials. we summarise the main characteristics and results of the studies in each of these three groups. for the first group, we assessed heterogeneity using the <UNK> <UNK> and estimated a

and a “cold turkey” sudden quit versus gradual reduction approach. all booklets covered preparation for quitting, making a commitment, coping with urges and maintenance. a shorter control booklet only covered the hazards of smoking and did not give instructions for quitting. no significant differences in quit rates were detected between any of the experimental booklets or the control. about <UNK> reported at least <UNK> months' abstinence at the <UNK> month follow‐up and <UNK> had been quit for at least a week. although reported use of the books was high, undertaking specific recommended activities was not a predictor of success. the best predictor was participants' initial assessment of their likelihood of success. another <UNK> compared three sets of materials for women smokers with young children who called the us cancer information service hotline. again there was no significant difference between the guides, with <UNK> of those followed up reporting at least a week of abstinence at <UNK> follow‐up. one trial evaluating call‐back counselling included a factorial test of different written <UNK> it detected no difference between a <UNK> page booklet, tailored for either men or women, compared to a single page pamphlet among a population receiving at least three counselling calls. overall, this evidence suggests that in the population of smokers seeking help from quitlines the choice between different standard self help materials is not of critical importance. go to: discussion in controlled trials in quitline settings call‐back counselling improved quit rates over mailed materials or brief counselling at the first contact. these were pragmatic trials with potential sources of bias. only one study attempted biochemical validation in a convenience sample and found a high refusal <UNK> it is claimed that the rate of misreport is low in population based studies, and unlikely to differentially affect intervention and control <UNK> while using self reported outcomes may overestimate quit rates, treating all non‐responders as failures probably leads to an <UNK> as does inclusion of people who did not receive the intervention. we conducted a sensitivity analysis for the meta‐analysis: excluding participants lost to follow‐up from the denominators did not greatly affect the relative effect because most studies had similar dropout rates across intervention and control groups. the choice of cessation outcome might also affect the meta‐analysis results. we used a sustained measure of quitting in all studies, but point prevalence rates where reported were substantially higher. in most cases the relative treatment effect was similar if a more lenient measure of quitting was chosen but in one case delayed quitting activity among controls reversed the relative <UNK> intervention implementation was often incomplete. in some trials participants refused call back counselling; some participants could not be contacted and people often did not receive all intended calls. trial reports typically noted a dose response with higher quit rates as the number of completed calls increased. higher quit rates in those receiving more support are not necessarily evidence of efficacy since these people may be more motivated and thus more successful, but if they are seeking more help they may be having more difficulty quitting: where number of calls was not restricted; receiving a very high number of calls tended to predict <UNK> borland noted that in two <UNK> quit rates in those not receiving any calls were similar to the control group, suggesting that they did not differ in their capacity to quit, and that therefore the real effect of counselling was underestimated by including participants who did not receive any intervention. identifying the optimum number of calls and the number of attempts to complete calls for a cost effective service remains a challenge. responding to client need is likely to be important, but proactive calls may help people who would not initiate further contact. zhu and colleagues elegantly demonstrated that it was possible to enhance quit rates through proactive calls to smokers who had been invited to make further contact but had not done <UNK> the counselling protocols showing clearest effects include at least one pre‐counselling session, and further calls scheduled close to the quit date, but with flexible schedules. although the california protocol showed a single call to have a measurable benefit, additional calls further increased rates. the meta‐analysis in the cochrane review suggested that a minimum of three calls was needed for an effect but this included studies in a range of settings where some counselling calls were to unmotivated smokers, or to smokers who had already been supported by face to face intervention and pharmacotherapy. there is almost no evidence about the best type of counselling when contact time and frequency are controlled. the california single call protocol focuses on promoting motivation to change, and preparing for combating urges to <UNK> the number of calls may be more important than their <UNK> some studies tried to assess whether the intervention affected the number of quit attempts or their likelihood of success. we did not formally evaluate these intermediate outcomes. even in these populations of help‐seeking smokers, on average only a half to two thirds recorded quit attempts, and the effect of the intervention on this intermediate outcome may not be large. zhu and colleagues noted an increase in quit attempts from <UNK> with self help to <UNK> with a single call, but no additional effect from multiple <UNK> there was a clearer dose‐response effect on maintenance; among those who quit, sustained abstinence increased from <UNK> to <UNK> with a single session and <UNK> with multiple sessions. in one study, where no effect on abstinence was detected, the number of quit attempts was lower in the intervention <UNK> another outcome reported in a few studies was the median length of abstinence. while sustained cessation has to be the ultimate goal, an extended quit attempt gives some indication of an intervention effect and may increase the likelihood of future success. <UNK> reported an increase in the median length of abstinence in those quitting for any period from <UNK> days with self help to <UNK> days with a single counselling session and <UNK> days with multiple sessions. longer duration of previous abstinence increases the probability of future success in <UNK> based on these findings a reasonable hypothesis would be that counselling helps maintain cessation in the early stages of a quit attempt. quitlines have become integral parts of national and statewide anti‐tobacco media <UNK> a survey of <UNK> north american state and province quitlines in <UNK> found that all but one could provide proactive multisession <UNK> quitlines also have a potential impact on public health beyond that of the services they provide to individuals. their promotion reinforces the importance of quitting and the availability of help should smokers choose to use them. this review does not directly address how much quitline services increase quitting compared to an “unassisted” attempt. it is no longer regarded as appropriate to deny support to smokers seeking this form of help and therefore no recent trials have had a no treatment control group. the multicounty trial by ossip‐klein and colleagues provides the best evidence for the overall effect of quitline type services. in the trial a hotline which included taped messages and access to counselling increased quit rates over a manual <UNK> the quit rates among control group participants in trials considered in this review, who received the basic quitline service, compare favourably with the success rates that might be expected for motivated but unassisted quitters. callers to a quitline are likely to be relatively highly motivated to quit and are actively seeking help, but may also have lower self <UNK> increasingly, telephone based services provide access to free or low cost pharmacotherapy where this is not available through national health services. the north american quitline <UNK> found that more than half the services provided free or low cost pharmacotherapy to callers meeting eligibility criteria. in the oregon trial, randomisation to the offer of free nicotine patches increased success rates in all three counselling intensity <UNK> evaluations of such initiatives have been reported from new york <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and south <UNK> these also report higher quit rates for smokers provided with nrt, although the non‐randomised nature of these comparisons means that they should be interpreted cautiously. the campaigns supporting these initiatives typically combine encouragement for cessation and publicity for quitline services and the incentive of free or subsidised medication. the increase in the number of calls to services during these campaigns indicates that they increase the level of quitting activity in the populations served. the <UNK> model of counselling advocated by the agency for health care policy and research (ahcopr) practice guidelines recommends that healthcare providers ask their patients about smoking, advise them to quit, assist them in quitting and arrange <UNK> studies suggest that the assist and arrange components are poorly <UNK> referring motivated smokers to quitline proactive counselling may increase delivery of these components, and it is important that the quitline intervention be as effective as possible. this review shows that call‐back counselling increases efficacy, but based on a limited number of trials failed to show that any particular method of counselling or adjunctive self help materials leads to higher success rates. what this paper adds systematic reviews of randomised trials have shown that telephone counselling is an effective intervention for assisting smokers to quit, while self help materials also offer a small benefit. this review singles out the evidence supporting the benefit of call‐back counselling to help smokers who are seeking support via quitlines, showing that such counselling improves quit rates. the paper also considers the effect of different types of counselling method and adjunctive self help materials, but failed to detect a difference between the different interventions studied.
