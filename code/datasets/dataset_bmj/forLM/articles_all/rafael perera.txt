background
this is an update of a cochrane review first published in the cochrane library in issue 4, 2006.
otitis media with effusion (ome) or ’glue ear’ is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or
infection. it is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of ’grommets’. potential
treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. autoinflation devices have been proposed as a
simple mechanical means of improving ’glue ear’.
objectives
to assess the effectiveness of autoinflation compared with no treatment in children and adults with otitis media with effusion.
search methods
we searched the cochrane ear, nose and throat disorders group trials register; the cochrane central register of controlled
trials (central); pubmed; embase; cinahl; web of science; biosis previews; cambridge scientific abstracts; ictrp and
additional sources for published and unpublished trials. the date of the most recent search was 12 april 2013.
selection criteria
we selected randomised controlled trials that compared any form of autoinflation to no autoinflation in individuals with ’glue ear’.
data collection and analysis
two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included studies.
main results
eight studies, with a total of 702 participants, met the inclusion criteria. overall, the studies were predominantly assessed as being at
low or unclear risk of bias; unclear risk was mainly due lack of information. there was no evidence of selective reporting.
pooled estimates favoured the intervention, but did not show a significant effect on tympanometry (type c2 and b) at less than
one month, nor at more than one month. similarly, there were no significant changes for discrete pure-tone audiometry and non-
discrete audiometry. pooled estimates favoured, but not significantly, the intervention for the composite measure of tympanogram or
audiometry at less than one month; at more than one month the result became significant (rri 1.74, 95% ci 1.22 to 2.50). subgroup
analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a politzer device under one month (rri 7.07, 95% ci 3.70
to 13.51) and over one month (rri 2.25, 95% ci 1.67 to 3.04).
none of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions.
authors’ conclusions
all of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow-up. however, because of the low cost and absence
of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. primary
care could prove a beneficial place to evaluate such interventions and there is ongoing research in this area. further research should
also consider the duration of treatment, the long-term impact on developmental outcomes in children and additional quality of life
outcome measures for children and families.

autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (glue ear)
otitis media with effusion (ome) or ’glue ear’ is very common in children and the hearing loss and discomfort, especially where
the effusion is bilateral and long-lasting, may lead to problems with language, development and behaviour. there are a number of
treatment options including steroids, antibiotics, decongestants, antihistamines and surgery (the insertion of grommets (ventilation
tubes)). grommet insertion is one of the commonest operations of childhood. the best treatment strategy remains controversial,
however, as glue ear often resolves spontaneously within a few months.
autoinflation is a technique whereby the eustachian tube (the tube that connects the middle ear and the back of the nose) is reopened
by raising pressure in the nose. this can be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose, blowing up a balloon through
each nostril or using an anaesthetic mask. the aim is to introduce air into the middle ear, via the eustachian tube, equalising the
pressures and allowing better drainage of the fluid.
this review included eight randomised controlled trials of autoinflation for glue ear. all of the studies were small, of limited treatment
duration and had short follow-up.
the reviewauthors used a combined outcomemeasurewhich included any outcome signifying improvement (as defined in the individual
studies) and measured outcomes at the time points ’up to one month’ and ’more than one month’. improvement was demonstrated
only in ’more than one month’ analyses. subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a politzer
device at both under one month and over one month. none of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of
side effects between interventions.
the authors conclude that the evidence for the use of autoinflation in the short term appears favourable. given the small number of
studies and the lack of long-term follow-up, the long-term effects associated with the use of these devices cannot be determined.
b a c k g r o u n d
this is an update of a cochrane review first published in the
cochrane library in issue 4, 2006.
otitismedia with effusion (ome) or ’glue ear’ is an accumulation
of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation
or infection. it is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in
childhood (rovers 1999). it is common in children between the
ages of one and three years and in seasons when there is a high incidence
of the common cold, with a prevalence of ome between
10% and 30%. the cumulative incidence to the age of four years
is 80% (zielhuis 1990) and at age seven the prevalence is still 3%
to 8% (fiellau 1977; fiellau 1983; lous 1981; teele 1989). the
aetiology of ’glue ear’ is uncertain, but low-grade infection, poor
eustachian tube function and adenoidal infection or hypertrophy
have all been implicated (bluestone 1988). otitis media with effusion
often resolves spontaneously within a few months (fiellau
1979).
otitismedia with effusion (ome)may be associated with ear ache
(otalgia), infection and/or hearing loss.hearing lossmay be significant
(20 db to 30 db), particularly when the disorder is bilateral
and has lasted for more than a month (fiellau 1983). however,
some children have nearly normal hearing despite the presence of
fluid within the middle ear. the hearing loss and discomfort may
have linguistic, developmental, behavioural and other social consequences,
particularly if the effusion is bilateral and of long duration
(lous 1995). some studies have shown that children with
unilateral or bilateral otitismedia with effusion have balance problems
(golz 1998; grace 1990).
for its diagnosis, tympanometry in combination with otomicroscopy
or pneumatic otoscopy is the recommended technique
(bluestone 1988). tympanometry is performed with a handheld
device inserted in the ear canal andmeasures the eardrumresponses
to the sound and different pressures. diagnostic tympanometry
results in a flat curve (relative gradient less than 0.1, type b) or in
a curve with amiddle ear pressure between -399 to -200 dapa (c2
curve) (jerger 1970; zielhuis 1989) or when mobility of the tympanic
membrane is absent or reduced, or fluid and/or air bubbles
are evident behind the eardrum (browning 2010). type a and c1
tympanograms are considered not to represent otitis media with
effusion. the presence of a significant (10 db) air-bone gap on
pure-tone audiometry correlates well with the presence of fluid in
the middle ear.
management options
ome usually resolves spontaneously (20% will resolve in one
month and 40% at three months (fiellau 1979)) and many childrenwill
require no specific treatment.themost commonmedical
treatment options include the use of decongestants (griffin 2011),
mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines (griffin 2011) and antibiotics
(van zon 2012). of these options, only steroids have been shown
effective and only for short-term resolution (simpson 2011). surgical
treatment is more widely used and better researched, with
options including grommet insertion (browning 2010), myringotomy
tympanocentesis (surgical incision of the eardrum, with or
without aspiration of fluid from the middle ear cavity) and adenoidectomy
(van den aardweg 2010). the optimal treatment
strategy remains controversial, with wide international variability
in clinical practice.
’autoinflation’ refers to the opening of, and forcing of air through,
the eustachian tube by the raising of intranasal pressure. this may
be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose,
blowing up a balloon through each nostril, use of an anaesthetic
mask or a politzer device. the aim of these procedures is to introduce
air into the middle ear, via the eustachian tube, to equilibrate
the pressures. this is most likely to help in ’eustachian tube
dysfunction’ and has been proposed as a treatment for otitis media
with effusion (hunt-williams 1968). this systematic review aims
to assess the effectiveness of autoinflation devices in children and
adults with otitis media with effusion.

m e t h o d s
criteria for considering studies for this review
types of studies
we included randomised controlled trials of an autoinflation device
- designed to force air into the middle ear - in children or
adults with clinically diagnosed serous otitis media.
types of participants
children and adults with unilateral or bilateral otitis media with
effusion and a clinical diagnosis by primary care physicians or
specialists using tympanometry (type b or c2), either alone or in
combination with simple or pneumatic otoscopy or audiometry.
the type of diagnosis used in each trial is presented in the table
characteristics of included studies.
types of interventions
we included trials that studied any form of autoinflation (a technique
to increase intranasal pressure repeatedly either through a
nasal balloon or by other methods) compared to no autoinflation
and which were unconfounded. by unconfounded, we mean
studies where the two groups were treated equally, except for the
provision of the intervention to one group. other treatments (e.g.
analgesia, decongestants or short courses of antibiotics) were permitted
provided these were provided equally. autoinflation interventions
were classified into similar groups by an ent surgeon,
based on the description of the intervention whilst blinded to the
outcomes of the study (see appendix 1 for a brief description of
the interventions).
types of outcome measures
primary outcomes
• improvement in tympanogram (to type c1 or a
tympanogram)
• differences in hearing level on pure-tone audiogram
(average 10 db improvement over the frequencies 250 hz to
2000 hz)
• improvement measured as a composite of change in
tympanogram and/or audiometry (post hoc)
secondary outcomes
• adverse effects of autoinflation
• presence or absence of fluid in middle ear cavity
time points of outcome assessment
• up to and including one month from commencement of
autoinflation
• more than one month from commencement of
autoinflation
we were unable to analyse the following secondary outcomes due
to a lack of trial data:
1. developmental test results
2. behavioural test results
3. language and speech development
4. quality of life
5. family function
search methods for identification of studies
we conducted systematic searches for randomised controlled trials.
there were no language, publication year or publication status
restrictions. the date of the last search was 12 april 2013.
electronic searches
we searched the following databases fromtheir inception for published,
unpublished and ongoing trials: the cochrane ear, nose
andthroatdisordersgrouptrialsregister; thecochranecentral
register of controlled trials (central, the cochrane library
2013, issue 3); pubmed; embase; cinahl; lilacs; koreamed;
indmed; pakmedinet; cab abstracts;web of science; isrctn;
clinicaltrials.gov; ictrp; google scholar and google.
we modelled subject strategies for databases on the search strategy
designed for central. where appropriate, we combined
subject strategies with adaptations of the highly sensitive search
strategy designed by the cochrane collaboration for identifying
randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials (as
described in the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions
version 5.1.0, box 6.4.b. (handbook 2011)). search
strategies for major databases including central are provided
in appendix 2.
searching other resources
we scanned the reference lists of identified publications for additional
trials and contacted trial authors where necessary. in addition,
we searched pubmed, tripdatabase, the cochrane library
and google to retrieve existing systematic reviews relevant to this
systematic review, so that we could scan their reference lists for
additional trials. we searched for conference abstracts using the
cochrane ear, nose and throat disorders group trials register.
data collection and analysis
selection of studies
the trials search co-ordinator of the cochrane ear, nose and
throat disorders group assessed abstracts of all studies identified
by the initial search and excluded clearly irrelevant studies. one
review author assessed abstracts for relevance and we obtained
full texts for these. two review authors independently assessed all
full-text articles. differences in opinion about inclusion of studies
were resolved by discussion with a third review author. the review
authors were not blind to the journal of origin, the authors, the
institutions or the magnitude of results.
data extraction and management
two reviewauthors independently extracted study data using standardised
forms. we entered data into revman 5 (revman 2012)
and a second review author checked the data. data extracted and
presented included: author, publication year, journal, participants
(numbers, duration of illness, demographics, characteristics of the
disease, etc.), intervention (type of intervention and duration) and
results (outcome measures, effect size, statistical significance, adverse
effects).we contacted trial authors formissing or incomplete
data.
assessment of risk of bias in included studies
two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in all
included trials.differenceswere resolved by discussionwith a third
review author. we assessed risk of bias using the cochrane ’risk
of bias’ tool where types of bias are rated as low, high or unclear.
1. randomisation/selection bias: selection generation
2. randomisation/selection bias: allocation concealment
3. detection bias: blinding of outcome assessment
4. attrition bias: incomplete outcome data, losses to follow-up
and whether analysis was intention-to-treat
5. blinding of outcome assessors
6. selective reporting
7. other bias: we also used this section to assess whether the
groups were comparable at the start of the study for prognostic
characteristics
we assessed the quality of the studies separately:
1. that the groups were equally provided of care, except for the
treatment; and
2. adherence to study procedure.
data synthesis
we carried out analysis on the basis of intention-to-treat. where
possible we combined data to give a summary measure of effect.
when outcome data obtained were binary - recovered or improved
glue ear or audiometry improvement - we used relative risks of
improvement to compare interventions. the data reported in the
trials mainly used ’ears’ as their analysis unit despite using individuals
as randomisation units. to correct for this and to give
adequate weight to the studies we adjusted the outcomes using
the ’design effect’, which takes into consideration the association
found in using both ears from the same individual (deeks 2005).
we estimated the ’design effects’ fromthe blanshard data (full data
set provided by author) at one month and three months for participants
with either types b or c2 tympanograms or only type
b tympanograms. minor differences in correlation between intervention
and control groups (smaller at three months) were found,
but an average was used, as differences could be due to sampling
variation. for participants with type b or c2 tympanograms the
design effect at one month was 1.25, while at three months it was
1.51. for participants with only type b tympanograms the design
effect was 1.3 for both one and three months follow-up.
we used the appropriate design effect (for less than one month or
more than one month by tympanogram type at entry) to obtain
adjusted risk ratios (rr) for all studies that provided data for
the outcome. we calculated and then entered the log(rr) and
the se(log(rr)) into revman 5 (revman 2012). as the focus of
the review is on recovery/improvement we emphasise the use of
a positive outcome and refer to the rr obtained as the ’relative
risk of improvement’ or rri; instead of using the term risk ratio
which is normally associated with a negative outcome (e.g. death).
when data were continuous, we used mean differences to compare
interventions. we used the giv (generic inverse variance)
method with a random-effects model to pool studies together and
examined heterogeneity using thechi2 test and i2 statistic. funnel
plots were not used as the number of studies found was too small
for these to provide relevant information. we carried out analyses
using revman 5.
subgroup analyses
subgroup analyses had been planned on the basis of the diagnosis
of otitis media with effusion and the extent of the hearing loss
measured on audiometry. however, insufficient studies were identified
to allow these analyses. we also planned subgroups according
to age (under three years, three to 12 years and over 12 years).
however, we could not identify any papers of sufficient quality
including children aged under three years and only one paper included
children over 12 years (lesinskas 2003).
r e s u l t s
description of studies
results of the search
from the 2013 update searches, we retrieved a total of 401 references.
following first-level screening (i.e. removal of duplicates
and clearly irrelevant references) by the cochrane ent group
trials search co-ordinator we were left with 127 references for
further consideration. following sifting by the authors two more
duplicates were removed and 105 discarded following screening
of titles and abstracts, leaving 20 reports for consideration. two
were studies which we have included in the updated review (de
nobili 2008; ercan 2005). sixteen further studies were excluded
from the review, with reasons (costantino 2010; dalchow 2011;
ducla-soares 2007; el hachem 2012; hidir 2011; jumah 2010;
karahatay 2008; kawase 2008; laina 2006; leach 2008; pau
2009; poe 2011; prabhakar 2007; shim 2010; talmon 2010;
toros 2010). two were identified as ongoing studies (tel-aviv
med center 2006; williamson 2011).
from the original searches (2006 publication of this review), 418
abstracts were obtained from the search, with 62 selected as possibly
relevant.these were screened for relevance and we obtained 24
full-text articles. of these full-text articles two review authors (jh
and rp) filtered out 16 as duplicates or rejected them for not fulfilling
the inclusion criteria. two further reports were awaiting assessment
in the original review and remain so (niebuhr-jorgensen
1996; scadding 2002) (see characteristics of studies awaiting
classification). limited available information has meant that these
studies cannot yet be excluded from meeting the review criteria.
there have been no published data following on from either of
the abstracts for these studies. contact with one of the authors has
indicated that one of the studies may be published in the future
(scadding 2002), whilst the other author has not been contactable
(niebuhr-jorgensen 1996). six studies were included in the original
(2006) version of the review.
it is hoped that the two ongoing studies will be able to contribute
their results to this review in the future. the tel-avivmed center
2006 study commenced in october 2006. the authors confirmed
in 2010 that their results would be released shortly; unfortunately
this has been delayed and a new date has not been announced.
the williamson 2011 study started in september 2011 and it is
hoped that results will be available during winter of 2013-14. (see
characteristics of ongoing studies).
a total of eight papers therefore met the eligibility criteria for
inclusion in the current 2012 update of the review (arick 2005;
blanshard 1993; brooker 1992; de nobili 2008; ercan 2005;
fraser 1977; lesinskas 2003; stangerup 1992).
included studies
see characteristics of included studies table.
participants
two trials included only participants with bilateral ome confirmed
by tympanometry (blanshard 1993; fraser 1977). six trials
(arick 2005; brooker 1992; de nobili 2008; ercan 2005;
lesinskas 2003; stangerup 1992) included participants with both
unilateral and bilateral ome. diagnosis of ome was confirmed
by tympanometry alone in two studies (denobili 2008; stangerup
1992), tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry in one study
(lesinskas 2003), tympanometry and otoscopy in one study
(ercan 2005), tympanometry, otoscopy and audiometry in one
study (brooker 1992) and audiometry and otoscopy in one study
(arick 2005). stangerup and blanshard only included participants
with a diagnosis of bilateral ome of at least three months duration.
the diagnosis of ome by tympanogram varied from study
to study, with some defining types b and c2 as ome (blanshard
1993; stangerup 1992)while others only included typeb(brooker
1992; ercan 2005).
seven of the eight trials studied children aged between three
and 16 years (arick 2005; blanshard 1993; brooker 1992; de
nobili 2008; ercan 2005; fraser 1977; stangerup 1992).one trial
included participants aged between 16 and 75 years (lesinskas
2003).
interventions
the included studies used a range of interventions and outcome
measures. of the eight studies included, three (blanshard
1993; ercan 2005; stangerup 1992) used a classic otovent®, two
(brooker 1992; fraser 1977) used a carnival blower + balloon and
three (arick 2005; de nobili 2008; lesinskas 2003) used politzer
devices. seven out of the eight studies used observation without
treatment as their control; the exception was ercan who maintained
nasal saline irrigation in the control. the duration of the
intervention was variable, with a minimum of 10 days (lesinskas
2003) to amaximum of seven weeks (arick 2005). the number of
times per day the autoinflation procedure was designed to be carried
out was relatively consistent: three times per day (blanshard
1993; brooker 1992; ercan 2005; stangerup 1992) or two times
per day (arick 2005; lesinskas 2003). duration and intensity
of intervention specific to each trial can be obtained from the
characteristics of included studies table. one study (fraser 1977)
used a three-factorial design to compare autoinflation, ephedrine
drops anddimotapp® elixir to treatome. in one study (lesinskas
2003) the intervention was carried out by a physician, not the
patient or a carer.
outcomes and follow-up
tympanometry was the most commonly used outcome and was
reported in four trials, as a dichotomous variable (improvement
yes/no) (blanshard 1993; de nobili 2008; stangerup 1992) and
as a continuous variable (difference in mean middle ear compliance)
(fraser 1977). three trials (brooker 1992; ercan 2005;
lesinskas 2003) reported dichotomous, composite measures obtained
fromtympanometry combinedwith other outcomes. lesinskas
reported a total score that combined pneumotoscopic appearance,
tympanometry, patient complaint and audiometry. brooker
reported improvement in both tympanometry and audiometry as
a single, combined outcome measure. audiometry was reported as
a separate outcome in three trials. one of these (blanshard 1993)
reported a dichotomous change in pure-tone audiometry threshold
at frequencies between 250 hz and 4000 hz, while the other
two trials reported it as a continuous outcome (mean change in
pure-tone audiometry thresholds at frequencies between 500 hz
to 4000 hz (arick 2005) or 500 hz to 2000 hz (fraser 1977)).
other outcomes reported were tympanic membrane mobility on
otoscopy (arick 2005) and clearance of fluid from the middle
ear (blanshard 1993). six studies recorded outcomes at the end
of treatment (blanshard 1993; brooker 1992; de nobili 2008;
fraser 1977; lesinskas 2003; stangerup 1992). one trial (arick
2005) recorded outcomes four weeks after the end of seven weeks
of treatment. three trials (ercan 2005; lesinskas 2003; stangerup
1992) reported longer follow-up times after treatment had finished.
excluded studies
see characteristics of excluded studies table.
a total of 30 studies were excluded for the following reasons:
• 18 were not randomised trials (alper 1999; arick 2000;
blanshard 1995; costantino 2010; gottschalk 1966; gottschalk
1991; havas 1995; kaneko 1997; karahatay 2008; kutácová
2005; laina 2006; leunig 1995; luntz 1991; ogawa 2003; poe
2011; prabhakar 2007; talmon 2010; yu 2003);
• six studies did not have participants with otitis media with
effusion (dalchow 2011; ducla-soares 2007; hidir 2011; jumah
2010; kawase 2008; pau 2009);
• four studies did not assess autoinflation as the intervention
(el hachem 2012; kouwen 2005; leach 2008; shim 2010;
toros 2010);
• one study did not assess hearing loss by either
tympanometry and/or audiometry (chan 1989); and
• one study considered two different autoinflation
techniques, but not against a control (hanner 1997).
risk of bias in included studies
we assessed studies for risk of bias in four areas: random sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment,
incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. we also
assessed the quality of the intervention in terms of equal provision
of care for all groups and treatment adherence. we deemed none
of the included studies to be of high quality (see individual entries
in the characteristics of included studies table, table 1 and figure
1).
figure 1. ’risk of bias’ summary: review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item for each included
study.
randomisation (sequence generation) was reported and deemed
low risk in three of the trials (arick 2005; blanshard 1993;
lesinskas 2003); the remaining trials were unclear risk.
only one study fully commented on allocation concealment and
we classed this as low risk (lesinskas 2003). the remaining studies
made no comment and so we classified them as unclear risk.
four studies presented data showing the different arms of the study
to be comparable on prognostic characteristics (arick 2005; de
nobili 2008; fraser 1977; stangerup 1992). one study described
distribution of age and sex as being similar between arms at baseline
(ercan 2005). one study (blanshard 1993) commented that
groups showed significance only in age distribution and exposure
to smoking, while two studies (brooker 1992; lesinskas 2003)
described as randomised controlled trials did not present data on
the baseline characteristics. confounding was not an issue in any
trial.
only one trial (arick 2005) reported that the participating doctors
and the outcome assessorswere blinded, althoughwith patients not
blinded it is likely the patient’s status could have become known
to the assessors.
follow-up was predominantly low risk: four studies had no attrition
(arick 2005; brooker 1992;denobili 2008; lesinskas 2003)
and three further studies had less than 15% attrition (blanshard
1993; ercan 2005; fraser 1977). we assessed only one study
(stangerup 1992) as high risk, with 42% attrition in the experimental
arm and 67% attrition in the control arm.
no trials showed any evidence of selective reporting.
reported adherence to the use of autoinflation was variable; one
trial reported 98% compliance (arick 2005) while another reported
45% of participants as having high compliance, 43% low
compliance and 12% being unable to use the autoinflation device
(blanshard 1993).
effects of interventions
eight studies met the inclusion criteria for this review and compared
autoinflation with control.
combining data proved difficult due to a lack of consistent reporting
of a common single outcome measure. hence, post hoc,
we also analysed a composite measure of any outcome signifying
improvement (as defined in the individual studies). we analysed
the data in two time frames: up to one month and more than one
month.
improvement in tympanogram (to type c1 or a
tympanogram)
of the five studies that included tympanometry as a discrete outcome
at less than onemonth, three favoured treatment (blanshard
1993; ercan 2005; stangerup 1992) and two favoured control
(brooker 1992; de nobili 2008). within these five studies, at
less than one month, autoinflation showed a non-significant improvement
in tympanometry as defined by type c2 and b tympanograms
(relative risk of improvement (rri) 1.47, 95% confidence
interval (ci) 0.69 to 3.13), with substantial heterogeneity
(i2 = 89%). see analysis 1.1.1. subgroup analyses suggested that
autoinflation is beneficial in children with either initial type b
tympanogram, relative to a type c1 or a tympanogram (rri 2.15,
95% ci 1.41 to 3.28, i2 = 0%), or type c2 tympanograms (rri
3.84, 95%ci 1.94 to 7.59, i2 = 0%) (analysis 1.1). this anomaly
was due to the fact that the brooker 1992 trial did not report the
baseline tympanometry level of the participants in the study, while
de nobili 2008 reported these as percentages at different stages
(not tracked by ear) and therefore neither could be included in
the subgroup analyses. as these are the two trials where the effect
of the intervention is negative, their exclusion from the subgroup
analyses changed the size of the estimated effect.
a sixth study (fraser 1977) used mean change in middle ear pressure
as the tympanometry outcome and was not included in the
pooled estimates. fraser found no significant difference between
control and intervention groups.
four studies followed participants for longer than a month
(blanshard 1993; de nobili 2008; ercan 2005; stangerup 1992).
in these studies autoinflation produced a non-significant change
in tympanometry compared to control (rri 1.22, 95% ci 1.00
to 1.49, i2 = 0%).
differences in hearing level on pure-tone audiogram
(average 10 db improvement over the frequencies
250 hz to 2000 hz)
two studies included an average improvement of 10 db ormore in
the threshold for pure-tone audiometry in a range of frequencies
from250hz to 2000hz as a discrete outcomemeasure (blanshard
1993; brooker 1992). the estimated recovery was worse in the
autoinflation group (rri 0.80, 95% ci 0.22 to 2.88, i2 = 63%)
(analysis 2.1). two studies reported audiometry improvement as
continuous (arick 2005; fraser 1977), with the pooled estimate
showing a non-significant improvement in the autoinflation group
(mean difference (md) 7.02 db, 95% ci -6.92 to 20.96, i2 =
95%) (analysis 2.2). in both cases significant heterogeneity was
found in the combined studies.
improvement measured as a composite of change in
tympanogram and/or audiometry (post hoc)
we combined seven studies using a dichotomous outcome of ’improvement’
in either tympanogram or audiometry (less than one
month: blanshard 1993; brooker 1992; de nobili 2008; ercan
2005; lesinskas 2003; stangerup 1992; and over onemonth:arick
2005; blanshard 1993; de nobili 2008; ercan 2005; lesinskas
2003; stangerup 1992).the relative risk of improvementwas 1.89
(95% ci 0.83 to 4.31, i2 = 93%, analysis 3.1) at less than one
month and 1.74 (95% ci 1.22 to 2.50, i2 = 69%, analysis 3.2) at
more than onemonth.the type of interventionwas categorised by
an independent rater and information on two types was obtained:
a) politzerisation and b) otovent® or carnival blower + balloon.
subgroup analysis: type of intervention
we carried out a subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention
judged by blinded assessment. five studies (blanshard 1993;
brooker 1992; de nobili 2008; ercan 2005; stangerup 1992)
provided information on type a interventions (classic otovent®
or carnival blower with balloon) and two (arick 2005; lesinskas
2003) provided information on type c interventions (politzer and
modified politzer). analyses showed a positive, statistically significant
effect using a politzer device under one month (rri 7.07,
95% ci 3.70 to 13.51) (analysis 3.3) and over one month (rri
2.25, 95%ci 1.67 to 3.04, i2 = 21.1%) (analysis 3.4). a non-significant
effect was found when using otovent®or carnival blower
+ balloon under one month (rri 1.47, 95% ci 0.69 to 3.13 i2
= 89%) (analysis 3.3) and over one month (rri 1.22, 95% ci
1.00 to 1.49, i2 = 0%) (analysis 3.4).
adverse effects of autoinflation and compliance
none of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence
of side effects between the control or intervention groups.
the side effects/complications studied included incidence of middle
ear infection, eardrum perforation, attacks of otitis media, upper
respiratory tract infections, tonsillitis, use of antibiotics, middle
ear effusion, insertion of grommets and enlarged adenoids.
one study (lesinskas 2003) reported that one patient stopped the
treatment due to the pain caused by the procedure.
six of the eight trials reported compliance. four studies assessed
the adherence to the intervention as ’high compliance’ (as defined
by the study authors) ranging from45%to 100%. two studies reported
’good’ or ’satisfactory’ compliance. one study commented
that “some children withome found doing the valsalvamanoeuvre
painful” (blanshard 1993), but other than lesinskas 2003 no
other study made any comment.
data on reported side effects and compliance for each individual
trial can be found in the table of ’side effects and compliance’
(table 1).
presence or absence of fluid in middle ear cavity
one study reported otoscopy findings (blanshard 1993) and
demonstrated significantly higher clearance of free fluid from the
middle ear at one and two, but not at three months, in the intervention
group compared to the control group (p < 0.05).
other outcomes
lesinskas 2003 presented outcomes as a pooled score of pneumotoscopy,
tympanometry, patient complaint and audiometry. at
day 10 and day 60 a significant overall improvement was demonstrated
in the autoinflation group compared to the control group
(p < 0.001). we were unable to obtain data on individual outcomes.
blanshard 1993 analysed low compliance and high compliance
subgroups within the intervention. arick 2005 reported
improvement in tympanometric peak pressure (tpp) and hearing
recovery (used as primary outcome of improvement in the pooled
estimate).
none of the studies reported developmental test results, behavioural
test results, language and speech development, quality
of life or family function.
d i s c u s s i o n
overall autoinflation appears to have a beneficial effect on the
resolution of glue ear, with a low incidence of adverse side effects
(table 1). six of the eight studies showed beneficial effects at least
in the short term(maximumduration of follow-up in the included
studies was three months), while one of the two that reported
a negative effect in the short term reported a positive effect in
the long term (two months). this is in keeping with a previous
systematic review on the use of autoinflation (reidpath 1999).
this reviewconcludes that the evidence for the use of autoinflation
in the treatment of glue ear in children is conflicting but suggests
that it may be of clinical benefit in the short term.
there are several limitations in the collection and interpretation
of the findings. the type of device used may be critical in determining
the benefits of autoinflation. pooled effect estimates suggest
politzerisation to be more effective than the classic otovent®
device or carnival blower with a balloon attached. however, both
papers that used politzerisation as themethod of autoinflation had
slightly different entry criteria to the rest. they were deemed suitable
for inclusion in this review as they both used multiple criteria
to make the diagnosis of otitis media with effusion (ome) (hearing
loss, tympanometry and, in one paper, otoscopy). information
in this area is sparse. a study (hanner 1997, not part of this review)
comparing two differentmethods of autoinflation (valsalva versus
otovent®) did not identify a difference between them, however
a reanalysis of their data showed a significant difference in favour
of otovent® (relative risk of improvement (rri) 1.70, 95% confidence
interval (ci) 1.08 to 2.69).
duration of treatment and follow-up also appear to be factors
in determining the effects of autoinflation. autoinflation seems
more beneficial in the short term (one month or less of treatment)
than in the longer term. paradoxically the meta-analysis of composite
outcomes shows the relative risk of improvement at one
month or less to be non-significant (rri 1.89, 95% ci 0.83 to
4.31) whilst the relative risk of improvement at more than one
month is significant (rri 1.74, 95% ci 1.22 to 2.50). the results
are affected by the two studies that found autoinflation to be
markedly worse than control at least in the short term (brooker
1992; de nobili 2008), leading to significant heterogeneity (i2 =
89%). the study by brooker 1992 did not continue follow-up for
longer than one month, therefore it was not included in the composite
outcomes at longer time frames. the study by de nobili
2008 reported percentage of ears at different tympanogram levels
(b, c2, c1 and a) at baseline, 12 days and two months. for our
calculations we have assumed that all ears in the category b and
c2 are included and ears in categories a and c1 will not revert
to worse tympanograms. de nobili 2008 reports a positive difference
(in favour of autoinflation) for the two-month follow-up.
a final important difference is that for this study most omes are
resolved within the two months of follow-up; five out of 60 ears
remain as c2 or b. several differences were noted in the duration
of the intervention (range 10 days to threemonths) and also in the
duration of follow-up, ranging from cessation of the intervention
to two months after the intervention. only three studies continued
to follow up participants after the intervention had ceased
(arick 2005; lesinskas 2003; stangerup 1992). for these reasons
it is difficult to determine whether the benefits of autoinflation are
sustained after treatment.
the combined effects show a mixed pattern of autoinflation, with
both statistical and clinical heterogeneity. considerable heterogeneity
may be due to the populations, the intervention or the
outcome definitions. one study (brooker 1992) found autoinflation
to be worse than control; another (denobili 2008) showed it
to be worse in the short term (12 days) but better in the long term
(two months). the children in brooker’s study are comparable to
those in other studies in terms of age, but there are few data with
which to compare the prognostic characteristics of the control and
intervention groups in this study with the other studies. for de
nobili 2008 it is difficult to assess if the assumption made about
the change in tympanogram for ears is potentially affecting the
results (no data on improvement at ear or individual level are provided).
brooker’s populations may be different to those of other studies
in that the proportion of controls recovering in this trial was
much higher than in any other studies. a possible reason for this
is the outcome reported, which is a composite of improvement
in pure-tone audiogram and tympanogram. another difference
is that it is suggested in the paper that only children with type
b tympanograms were included, but this was not clearly stated.
hence, heterogeneity could be explained if autoinflation is helpful
to children with type c2 but not type b tympanograms. subgroup
analyses of the blanshard 1993 and stangerup 1992 papers
suggest that this might be the case (although the effect size is not
statistically significant in either subgroup). finally, brooker did
not use a standardised otovent® device, instead using a carnival
blower and balloon. this may be a less effective or even harmful
method of autoinflation, however the independent rater classified
this intervention to be equivalent to otovent®.
the studies mainly gave information on tympanometry and composite
outcomes. autoinflation does not appear to improve puretone
audiometry thresholds. only one study reported otoscopy
findings so it is difficult to comment on this outcome. reduction
of hearing loss is an important outcome for children and parents,
but there was little evidence within the included studies to address
the impact of hearing loss. the development of a quality of
life questionnaire specifically for children with hearing loss means
that the impact of hearing loss could be assessed in future studies
(umansky 2011).
however, it appeared that autoinflation was beneficial at one and
twomonths. a large primary care study is in progress (williamson
2011) which will report on one and three-month outcomes.
adverse events do not appear to differ significantly between intervention
and control groups. data for compliance were variable.
there is some anecdotal evidence that some children, possibly in
selected groups, do get pain when undertaking autoinflation and
that continued enthusiasm for the procedure over time can wane.
blanshard 1993 comments that “significant improvementwas seen
only in those who used the treatment with a high compliance for
the duration of the study”. more details on adverse events and
compliance are needed from trials, along with evidence on how to
achieve good compliance.
limitations
the heterogeneity of trial designs, inclusion criteria, interventions,
outcome reporting and time scalesmakes it difficult to drawrobust
conclusions. another factor that affects validity is the variation in
the level of data analysis. most studies used ears as their data analysis
unit, but some used patients. to overcome this problem we
estimated thewithin-patient correlation. furthermore, some studies
reported their outcomes as continuous variables and some as
dichotomous variables. definitions of improvement varied in the
studies that reported dichotomous outcomes. the quality of the
trials was variable, in particular none of the studies used blinding
of participants or assessors and some studies used inferior methods
of randomisation.
one of the major concerns in children with glue ear is possible
developmental sequelae; none of the included papers looked
at this issue. currently there are no proven treatments that
affect speech and language development, including grommets
(browning 2010). therefore, it is not possible to say whether the
statistically significant improvements in tympanometry translate
into clinically significant benefits. this is an important consideration
when reviewing treatments for a self limiting condition
such as otitis media with effusion; there is a real possibility that
watchful waiting without interventionmay have similar long-term
outcomes to other interventions.
a u t h o r s ’ c o n c l u s i o n s
implications for practice
although this analysis does not enable us to make any firm conclusions,
the evidence appears favourable at least in the short term.
therefore, it may be reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst
awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion (ome).
one particular concern is the level of adherence: are the child and
parent willing to tolerate the inconvenience of the procedure? a
recent cochrane review has concluded that the benefits of grommets
for ome compared to watchful waiting are small and then
diminish over time (browning 2010). currently most autoinflation
interventions are instigated in secondary care.with increased
awareness and the ability to instruct and educate parents and children
in their use, this intervention would be well suited to primary
care and there is ongoing research in this area (williamson
2011). the use of a politzer device appears promising, however
due to the limited amount of information available it is difficult
to make any definitive recommendation. none of these trials provided
data on long-term sequelae such as language development.
however, the trials of ventilation tubes suggest there is little longterm
impact achieved through treatment of otitis media with effusion
(browning 2010).
implications for research
all of the studies we included were small and of limited duration
of treatment and follow-up. further studies with larger numbers
of participants and longer duration of intervention, completed in
primary care, are much needed. studies need to provided further
evidence on adverse events and treatment compliance. further
studies should also consider the impact of autoinflation on both
developmental and hearing loss outcomes in children with otitis
media with effusion. the heterogeneity suggests that the method
of autoinflation, including the device used, may be important and
thismerits further investigation. studies looking at factors predicting
which children may benefit from autoinflation would help in
identifying subgroups of children for whom autoinflation could
be recommended. future work could also include the possibility
of investigating whether autoinflation is effective in preventing
disease relapses in children prone to ome.

background
people with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk from cardiovascular disease. dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(pufas) are known to reduce triglyceride levels, but their impact on cholesterol levels, glycemic control and vascular outcomes are not
well known.
objectives
to determine the effects of omega-3 pufa supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes, cholesterol levels and glycemic control in
people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
search methods
we carried out a comprehensive search of the cochrane library,medline, embase, bibliographies of relevant papers and contacted
experts for identifying additional trials.
selection criteria
all randomised controlled trials were included where omega-3 pufa supplementation or dietary intake was randomly allocated and
unconfounded in people with type 2 diabetes. authors of large trials were contacted for missing information.
data collection and analysis
trialswere assessed for inclusion. authorswere contacted formissing information.datawas extracted and quality assessed independently
in duplicate. fixed-effect meta-analysis was carried out.
main results
twenty three randomised controlled trials (1075 participants) were included with a mean treatment duration of 8.9 weeks. the mean
dose of omega-3 pufa used in the trials was 3.5 g/d. no trials with vascular events or mortality endpoints were identified. among
those taking omega-3 pufa triglyceride levels were significantly lowered by 0.45 mmol/l (95% confidence interval (ci) -0.58 to -
0.32, p < 0.00001) and vldl cholesterol lowered by -0.07 mmol/l (95% ci -0.13 to 0.00, p = 0.04). ldl cholesterol levels were
raised by 0.11 mmol/l (95% ci 0.00 to 0.22, p = 0.05). no significant change in or total or hdl cholesterol, hba1c, fasting
glucose, fasting insulin or body weight was observed. the increase in vldl remained significant only in trials of longer duration and
in hypertriglyceridemic patients. the elevation in ldl cholesterol was non-significant in subgroup analyses. no adverse effects of the
intervention were reported.
authors’ conclusions
omega-3 pufa supplementation in type 2 diabetes lowers triglycerides and vldl cholesterol, butmay raise ldl cholesterol (although
results were non-significant in subgroups) and has no statistically significant effect on glycemic control or fasting insulin. trials with
vascular events or mortality defined endpoints are needed.

omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) for type 2 diabetes mellitus
people with type 2 diabetes are known to be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (such as heart attack or stroke). type 2 diabetes
mellitus is the fourth leading cause of death in developed countries with a two fold excess mortality and a two to four fold increased
risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. the typical dyslipidemia (abnormality in blood lipids) associated with type 2 diabetes is
a combination of hypertriglyceridemia (high levels of fats (triglycerides) in the blood), low levels of hdl (high density lipoprotein)
cholesterol and abnormal ldl (low density lipoprotein) composition. low levels ofhdl cholesterol and high levels of ldl cholesterol
are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, while the raised levels of triglycerides are less clearly linked to an increased
risk of cardiovascular disease. several pharmacologic approaches have been used to treat diabetic dyslipidemia and standard dietary
approaches focus on restriction of saturated fat and limitation of simple carbohydrate and alcohol intake. in the late 1980s, several
investigators reported on the use of dietary supplementation with fish oil as a means of treating diabetic dyslipidemia. dietary fats and
oils from different sources differ considerably in their fatty acid composition. animal fat is rich in saturated fatty acids, vegetable and
marine oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. most fish oils are of the so-called omega-3 variety (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (pufas)).
we identified 23 randomised trials (maximumduration of eightmonths) including 1075 people in which omega-3 pufa was compared
to a vegetable oil or placebo. none of the trials looked at cardiovascular endpoints in cardiovascular disease or death as an outcome
measure.
the review shows that although some types of fat in the blood are reduced through omega-3 supplementation, others including
ldl cholesterol (which may promote heart disease) were increased. control of blood sugar levels was not affected by the treatment.
there were no other adverse effects of the interventions noted. clinical outcome trials of sufficient duration are required to establish
conclusively the role of omega-3 pufa in type 2 diabetes but our results do not suggest a major harmful effect on the balance of blood
fats and confirm that it has no adverse affect on blood sugar control.

description of the condition
diabetes mellitus is ametabolic disorder resulting froma defect in
insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. a consequence of this is
chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose)
with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism.
long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy,
nephropathy and neuropathy. the risk of cardiovascular disease
is increased. for a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus,
please see under ’additional information’ in the information on
the metabolic and endocrine disorders group in the cochrane
library (see ’about the cochrane collaboration’, ’collaborative
review groups’). for an explanation of methodological terms, see
the main glossary in the cochrane library.
type 2 diabetes mellitus is the fourth leading cause of death in
developed countries with a two fold excess mortality and a two
to four fold increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.
the typical dyslipidemia (abnormality in blood lipids) associated
with type 2 diabetes is a combination of hypertriglyceridemia
(high levels of fats (triglycerides) in the blood), low levels of hdl
(high density lipoprotein) cholesterol and abnormal ldl (low
density lipoprotein) composition (howard 1987). low levels of
hdl cholesterol and high levels of ldl cholesterol are associated
with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd), while the
raised levels of triglycerides are less clearly linked to an increased
risk of cvd. several pharmacologic approaches have been used
to treat diabetic dyslipidemia (ada 1998). these include use of
3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a (hmg co-a) reductase
inhibitors (promoting the removal of ldl cholesterol from the
blood) (pyorala 1997), fibric acid derivatives (exact mechanism
of action unclear, but probably includes stimulating triglyceride
breakdown and ldl cholesterol removal fromthe blood) (elkeles
1998) and niacin (inhibits triglyceride production in the liver and
vldl (very lowdensity lipoprotein) secretion) (garg 1990). standard
dietary approaches focus on restriction of saturated fat and
limitation of simple carbohydrate and alcohol intake (ada 1998).
in the late 1980s, several investigators reported on the use of dietary
supplementation with fish oil as a means of treating diabetic
dyslipidemia (glauber 1988; friday 1989).
description of the intervention
a potential role formarine-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (pufa) in cvd risk reduction first came from observations
of the native inhabitants of greenland (inuits) (mouraoff 1967).
despite ingesting up to 40 percent of calories as fat (predominantly
of marine origin), this population had a lower incidence
of coronary heart disease compared to individuals with similar fat
intake on a more conventional diet (bang 1976). dietary fats and
oils from different sources differ considerably in their fatty acid
composition. animal fat is rich in saturated fatty acids. vegetable
and marine oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. polyunsaturated
fatty acids are characterised by the presence of more than
one double bond (allowing themto stay liquid at very low temperatures).
the designation using n-3 or the greek symbol omega-
3, or n-6 and omega-6, has been applied in the case of fatty acids
with the first double bond three or six carbon atoms from the end
of the chain. most fish oils are of the omega-3 variety and most
vegetable oils are of the omega-6 variety, although alpha-linoleic
acid is an omega-3 fatty acid found in canola oil. the omega-3
fatty acids found in fish oils are predominantly eicosapentaenoic
acid (epa) or docosahexaenoic acid (dha).
how the intervention might work
the beneficial effect of marine-derived omega-3 pufa on cardiac
risk markers and on lowering cardiovascular mortality and sudden
death in the general population have previously been reported in
the gissi-prevenzione (gissi 1999) and dart 1 trials (burr
1989) and in a subsequentmeta-analysis (bucher 2002).however,
the results of a later secondary prevention trial on coronary heart
disease (chd) and mortality (burr 2003) do not support the earlier
conclusions and a subsequent reviewhas also raised doubts that
omega-3 pufa reduce cardiovascular endpoints (hooper 2004).
the possibility of enhanced benefit fromomega-3 pufa in people
with diabetes has been shown in two previous reviews. in a previous
review of the role of omega-3 pufa in diabetes (friedberg
1998), benefit in reducing triglyceride levels was suggested. however,
the authors included non-randomized studies and studies including
people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. their review
included studies up to june 1995. concerns were also raised
about the possibility of harm from omega-3 pufa supplementation.
early non-randomised studies in patients with type 2 diabetes
suggested that omega-3 pufa might be associated with a
deterioration in glycemic control (friday 1989; glauber 1988).
this concern was addressed in the first publication of this systematic
review, which showed that omega-3 pufa supplementation
has no adverse effects on glycemic control (farmer 2001;montori
2000).
why it is important to do this review
the first publication of this cochrane review was limited to randomized
trials involving patientswith type 2 diabetes and included
searches for trials up to september 2000 (farmer 2001). the current
review includes randomised trials searched up to september
2006 and differs to our previous review in the following respects:
• title was changed from ’fish oil in people with type 2
diabetes mellitus’ to ’omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(pufa) for type 2 diabetes mellitus’;
• first author was changed to janine hartweg;
• change in outcomes from baseline to end-of-trial was used
to calculate the pooled effect sizes;
• a further five trials up to 2006 were identified and included
in the analysis;
• two further outcomes are included in addition to those
previously pooled.
we therefore set out to update our previous systematic review of
dietary supplementation using omega-3 pufa among peoplewith
type 2 diabetesmellitus. although our primary aimwas to identify
trials in whichmorbidity was studied, we also identified secondary
aims of establishing the extent to which changes in serum lipids
and deterioration in glucose control occurs following omega-3
pufa supplementation .
o b j e c t i v e s
to assess the effects of omega-3 pufa supplementation on death
and vascular events in peoplewith type 2 diabetesmellitus.we also
wished to establish changes in lipids and whether deterioration in
glucose control occurs.
m e t h o d s
criteria for considering studies for this review
types of studies
papers of any language were considered. trials were eligible if
they were randomized placebo or vegetable oil controlled trials
of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) (including crossover
trials) as the only intervention in participants with type 2
diabetes. as no phase-specific information was available for crossover
trials, data were used only from the first intervention period
to prevent measurements from the second period being affected
by effects carried over from the first intervention period. where
serial measurement of an outcome was given during the intervention
phase, data were obtained from the final measurement since
thatmeasurement was considered the conclusion of the study. the
effect of trial design was explored in a sensitivity analysis.
types of participants
adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
among the participants of trials included in the review was
established using the standard criteria valid at the time of the beginning
of the trial.
types of interventions
trials in which participants were randomised to any type of dietary
supplementation with omega-3 pufa were included. no
restrictions were imposed on dose or formulation, although trials
where the effect of omega-3 pufa could not be separated from
the effect of simultaneously applied interventions, such as exercise
or monounsaturated fatty acids, were not included.
no restrictions were placed on the range of compounds used as
controls in the study. some vegetable oils contain omega-3 pufa,
or complex fatty acids that might be metabolised to form omega-
3 pufa.
types of outcome measures
primary outcomes
• fatal myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death;
• proven non-fatal myocardial infarction;
• coronary or peripheral revascularization procedures.
secondary outcomes
• triglycerides
• total cholesterol
• hdl cholesterol
• ldl cholesterol
• vldl cholesterol
• hba1c
• fasting glucose
• fasting insulin
• body weight
• adverse effects
timing of outcome measurement
primary outcome measures will require studies of long duration
to yield meaningful results. we anticipated that changes in secondary
outcome measures would develop and remain stable over
a short period of time and so we included studies of any duration,
combining studies of short duration (three to eight weeks) and
medium duration (three to six months).
search methods for identification of studies
electronic searches
we searched the specialised register of the former cochrane diabetes
group and the cochrane central register of controlled
trials, as well as an electronic literature search of medline and
embase (from the beginning of each database until april 2007)
in two phases to identify trials involving omega-3.
our original search was conducted for publications from 1966 to
2000, and the second search was conducted up to 2006 using a
protocol that included the cochrane collaboration’s search strategy
for randomized controlled trials (dickersin 1994, adapted for
each database), using a similar search strategy for both phases (see
appendix 1).
we searched for records in all languages.
the bibliographic sections of all publications of included or excluded
trials were searched for additional trials.
searching other resources
dr cr sirtori (milan) and dr e ryan (edmonton, alberta), two
trialists, were consulted in an attempt to identify any other overlooked,
unpublished or ongoing studies. we did not attempt to
contact other authors where the size of the trials was small.
data collection and analysis
selection of studies
the titles, abstracts and keywords of every record were retrieved
to determine the relevant trials. full articles were retrieved for
further assessment if the information given suggested that the trial
(1) included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, (2) compared
fish oil with placebo or vegetable oil, (3) assessed one or more
clinically relevant outcome measures, (4) used random allocation
for the comparison groups. when there was any doubt regarding
these criteria from the information given in the title and abstract,
the full article was retrieved for clarification. when differences in
opinion existed, these were resolved by consensus referring back
to the original article.
the full articles retrievedwere examined independently by the two
investigators to identify relevant trials.discrepancieswere resolved
by consensus.
data extraction and management
two reviewers extracted data from the studies independently. disagreements
were resolved by consensus. the data extraction form
included the type of trial (randomised or cross-over), type of
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) and type of control
(including dose), length of intervention, trial setting, diabetes diagnosis,
baseline characteristics of intervention and control groups
(including age, gender, duration of diabetes, co-morbidity and
complications, and treatment), outcomes assessed and biochemical
outcome data in relation to study duration.
assessment of risk of bias in included studies
two investigators independently assigned quality scores to studies
with discrepancies resolved by consensus. a score developed from
the criteria of jadad and schulz (jadad 1996; schulz 1995) was
used to assess study quality, which had a possible range from zero
to five with a cutoff of two used to designate studies of high versus
low quality. the criteria used were:
• was the study randomised? was the method of
randomisation appropriate?
• was the study double-blinded? were the methods of
blinding appropriate?
• was compliance assessed?
• were there dropouts and withdrawals and were the
numbers and reasons for withdrawal stated? did more than 80
percent of those randomized complete the study?
kappa values were calculated for inter-rater agreement on quality.
data synthesis
extracted data were analyzed using the cochrane reviewmanager
software. quantitative analysis was based on changes in themeans
between baseline and endpoint measures. standard deviation of
the mean difference was calculated from the standard deviations
of the mean at the beginning and end of each trial by assuming
a degree of correlation of 0.5 (rice 1995). trials were included
in the pooled analysis where change data of the intervention and
control groups could be obtained from calculations of the mean
difference and standard deviation (sd).
a fixed-effect model was used for the pooled results. where heterogeneity
was indicated in the pooled analysis, a random-effects
model was applied. effect sizes are presented as weighted mean
differences with 95 percent confidence intervals. heterogeneity
was assessed using the chi-squared test with the significance set at
a p value of < 0.1. where serial measurement of an outcome was
given during the intervention phase, comparisons were made with
the final measurement. where a trial used two sets of doses, included
comparisons of epa and dha, or more than one control
group, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine which
comparison gave the smallest effect size (tramer 1997), which was
then included.
publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot method (egger
1997).
subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
subgroup analyses were planned a priori and undertaken for the
following variables:
• length of intervention (less than two months, longer than
two months);
• dose of omega-3 pufa (more than 2 g eicosapentaenoic
acid (epa), less than 2 g epa);
• type of omega-3 pufa (where epa or docosahexaenoic acid
(dha) was given separately, the result which had the smallest
effect size was included for statistical analysis to prevent sample
• duplication (tramer 1997);
• baseline triglyceride level (studies including only
hypertriglyceridemic patients, studies including not only
hypertriglyceridemic patients).
sensitivity analysis
sensitivity analyses were carried out on:
• quality (two points or less on quality scale (low quality),
more than two points on quality scale (high quality));
• blinding;
• trial design (cross-over versus parallel design studies);
• exclusion of any particularly large study (to see how much
they dominate the results).

results of the search
we identified 886 citations with their abstracts from electronic
searches carried out in 2006, of which 197 were deemed relevant.
one further trial was found from handsearching. these 197 abstracts
included 38 publications that described 23 trials which are
further detailed below. six of the trials were presented in more
than one publication, accounting for 17 of the published papers.
assessment of publication bias inter-rater agreement
the interrater reliability for the assignment of a quality score was
kappa = 0. 71.
included studies
twenty-three trialsmet inclusion criteria and were included in the
review. the effect of omega-3 pufa on glycemic control and lipid
levelswas the focus of twenty of the included trials. two trials were
designed to assess the effect of omega-3 pufa on vascular physiology;
however, these investigators also reported glycemic and lipid
endpoints (mcgrath 1996; woodman 2002). characteristics of
the included trials are tabulated. vegetable oil comparison groups
included olive oil, safflower oil and corn oil.
characteristics of included studies
the 23 trials included twelve parallel group design (alekseeva
2000; axelrod 1994; hendra 1990; jain 2002; morgan 1995;
mostad 2006; pelikanova 1992; petersen 2002; silvis 1990; sirtori
1997; westerveld 1993; woodman 2002) and eleven cross-over
trials (annuzzi 1991; boberg 1992; borkman 1989; connor
1993; goh 1997; luo 1998; mcgrath 1996; mcmanus 1996;
puhakainen 1995; schectman 1988; vessby 1990). the parallel
group trials ranged in duration from three weeks to eight months.
the cross-over trials had phases that ranged in duration from 2
to 24 weeks. none of the eleven cross-over trials reported phasespecific
data. four trials had a washout period (3 to 8 weeks in
duration) and one of these looked for but did not find a carryover
effect (borkman 1989).of the seven trials that did not have a
washout period, five looked for and two found a carry-over effect
(boberg 1992; mcmanus 1996). five new trials were identified
since the first review was conducted (alekseeva 2000; jain 2002;
mostad 2006; petersen 2002; woodman 2002).
interventions
the dose of omega-3 ranged from 1.08 to 5.2 grams of eicosapentaenoic
acid and 0.3 to 4.8 grams of docosahexaenoic acid. the
omega-3 was usually given in capsules except for one trial in which
a liquid form was used (pelikanova 1992). the dose of vegetable
oil or placebo wasmatched to the dose of omega-3. althoughmost
trials used vegetable oils (including olive oil, safflower oil, linseed
oil and corn oil) one used saline solution as a placebo (pelikanova
1992) and two used diet (alekseeva 2000; jain 2002). in all of
the trials omega-3 was added to the diet rather than being a replacement
for some component of the dietary fat intake, however
one trial reduced the high intake of omega-6 in the patients (jain
2002).
participants
a total of 1075 participants were included in the 23 trials. the
individual trial sample size ranged from 8 to 418. the majority
of participants were male and the ages ranged between 21 and
85 years. most participants had type 2 diabetes of 5 to 10 years
duration and were treated with diet or oral hypoglycemic agents.
few had diabetes-related complications. in three trials, all participants
were hypertriglyceridemic (connor 1993; morgan 1995;
vessby 1990).two other trials included a subset of hypertriglyceridemic
participants and these comprised 46% (schectman 1988)
and 10% (luo 1998) of all participants. individual study exclusion
criteria are outlined in the tables below.
outcomes
no trials were identified that included the primary outcome measures
of fatal myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death, myocardial
infarction or coronary revascularization procedures.
eighteen trials reported data on triglycerides, 17 trials reported
data on total cholesterol, 16 trials reported data on ldl cholesterol,
16 trials reported data on hdl cholesterol, seven trials reported
on vldl cholesterol that could be pooled for analysis.
eight of the 10 cross-over trials and eight of the 12 parallel trials
reported on glycated hemoglobin and five had a phase duration of
less than eight weeks (that is less than the time normally required
for hba1c to stabilize). of the 23 trials identified in this review,
only 18 reported their fasting glucose and six on fasting insulin
results in a way that permitted pooling of data. ten trials reported
on changes in body weight.
missing data
we contacted dr cr sirtori in order to clarify details of the italian
multicenter fish oil study. we were able to obtain unpublished
information about the inclusion of participants with type 2 diabetes,
data about disease duration, the use of oral hypoglycemic
agents and also clarify the issue of duplicate publication by one
of the centres in the multicentre study. we did not attempt to
contact other authors where the size of the trials was small.
details of missing data from each of the included trials are described
in the tables.one trial (silvis 1990) reported total glycated
hemoglobin. this measure was converted tohba1c using the formula
hba1c=0.61 x (reported glycated hb) + 2.1 (nutall 1998;
fairbanks, personal communication). four trials (connor 1993;
jain 2002; schectman 1988; sirtori 1997) reported lipidmeasures
in mg/dl, which were converted to mmol/l (kratz 1998) and two
trials (boberg 1992; vessby 1990) reported only the p value from
which the sd was obtained to calculate the sd of change (rice
1995).
excluded studies
one hundred and ninety-seven of 886 citationswith their abstracts
identified from the electronic and handsearches were deemed appropriate
for further consideration. one further trial was found
from handsearching. one hundred and sixty-four of the 197 abstracts
were excluded because they had multi-factorial interventions
from which the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (pufa) could not be separated, or did not use omega-
3 pufa derivatives (adler 1994; das 1994a; das 1994b; das
1995; dunstan 1997; holler 1996; howard 1987; lee 1994;
morris 1995; okuda 1992; okuda 1996; prince 1997; sirtori
1998; tonstad 1997; urano 1991; zambon 1992), were nonrandomised
studies (friedberg 1998; herrmann 1992; kasim
1988; malasanos 1991; schaap 1991; semplicini 1994; sheehan
1997; shunto 1992; silva 1996; stender 1990; zak 1996), included
patients without diabetes or patients with type 1 diabetes
(bonnema 1995; eritsland 1994; fasching 1991;hamazaki 1990;
lungershausen 1997; mackness 1994; rossing 1996; stacpoole
1989), did not include a placebo arm(fasching 1991; friday 1989;
glauber 1988; kasim 1988; mori 2000; shimizu 1993; shimizu
1995), did not include human participants (yamada 1995), lacked
data or did not report on outcomes that were relevant to this review.
the 12-month follow-up report of the italian multicenter
fish oil study (sirtori 1998) was excluded because it is a nonrandomised
non-placebo-controlled addition to the original trial
(sirtori 1997). the remaining 33 publications described 23 trials
that met the inclusion criteria of this review.
risk of bias in included studies
the trials could be classified by their quality scores into eleven
trials of equal or less than two points (alekseeva 2000; annuzzi
1991; borkman 1989; connor 1993; hendra 1990; jain 2002;
morgan 1995; pelikanova 1992; schectman 1988; silvis 1990;
woodman 2002) and twelve trials of greater than two points (
axelrod 1994; boberg 1992; goh 1997; hendra 1990; luo 1998;
mcgrath 1996; mcmanus 1996; mostad 2006; petersen 2002;
sirtori 1997; vessby 1990; westerveld 1993).
allocation
since randomisation was an inclusion criterion, all trials started
with a score of one. most of the articles of less than two scores
failed to describe the method of randomisation.
blinding
an additional point was assigned for the presence of blinding in
19 trials (axelrod 1994; boberg 1992; borkman 1989; connor
1993; goh 1997; hendra 1990; jain 2002; luo 1998; mcgrath
1996; mcmanus 1996; morgan 1995; mostad 2006; petersen
2002; puhakainen 1995; schectman 1988; sirtori 1997; vessby
1990; westerveld 1993; woodman 2002). most of the articles of
low scores failed to describe the method of blinding. some failed
to mask the odour of the fish oil supplement affecting blinding.
incomplete outcome data
six trials reported drop-outs or withdrawals (axelrod 1994; luo
1998;mostad 2006; petersen 2002; silvis 1990;woodman 2002).
effects of interventions
primary outcomes
no trials were identified that included the primary outcome measures
of fatal myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death, myocardial
infarction or coronary revascularization procedures.
secondary outcomes
as a guide, reference levels of triglycerides are 0.45-1.69 mmol/l
(serum), cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/l (serum),hdl cholesterol
greater than 0.91mmol/l (serum), ldl cholesterol less than
3.36 mmol/l (serum), vldl cholesterol 0.09 to 0.34 mmol/l
(serum), insulin 35 to 145 pmol/l, hba1c 3.8% to 6.4%, fasting
plasma glucose 3.9 to 6.1 mmol/l (kratz 1998).
eighteen of 23 trials reported data on triglycerides (comparison
01.01) including 969 participants.omega-3 supplementationwas
associated with a mean (pooled weighted mean difference) lowering
of plasma triglyceride concentration by 0.45 mmol/l (95%
confidence interval (ci) -0.58 to -0.32) compared to controls (including
a placebo of vegetable oils). this reduction was statistically
significant (p < 0.00001).
sixteen of 23 trials reported data on total cholesterol (comparison
01.02), inwhich 953 participants had a statistically non-significant
pooled weightedmean difference of -0.02 (95%ci -0.15 to 0.11).
omega-3 supplementation was not associated with a change in
plasma cholesterol concentration compared to controls (p = 0.72).
sixteen trials reported data on hdl cholesterol (comparison
01.03) in 882 participants. omega-3 supplementation was associated
with an increase in hdl concentration compared to controls,
with a change of 0.02 mmol/l (95% ci -0.01 to 0.06, p =
0.21).
of 22 trials, 16 reported data on ldl cholesterol (comparison
01.04) including 565 participants.omega-3 supplementationwas
associated with an increase in plasma ldl cholesterol concentration
of 0.11 mmol/l (95% ci 0.00 to 0.22, p = 0.05).
seven of eight trials reported data that could be pooled on
vldl cholesterol including 238 participants (comparison 01.05).
omega-3 supplementation was associated with a decrease in
vldl concentration compared to controls, a weighted mean difference
of -0.07 mmol/l (95% ci -0.13 to 0.00, p = 0.04).
of the 23 trials included in the review, 15 reported measurements
of glycated haemoglobin (comparison 01.06). the pooled
weighted mean difference for hba1c in 848 participants was -
0.01 % (95% ci -0.03 to 0.01). omega-3 supplementation was
not associated with a statistically significant mean change in glycated
haemoglobin compared with controls (p = 0.24).
twenty-one of the 23 trials reported fasting glucose results, of
which only sixteen with 930 participants reported their results in
such a way to enable pooled analysis (comparison 01.07). the
weighted mean difference was 0.16 mmol/l (95% ci -0.13 to
0.46, p = 0.27) showing that omega-3 supplementation did not
significantly change fasting glucose compared to controls.
fasting insulin was reported by eight trials of which only six reported
data that could be pooled with 529 participants (comparison
01.08). the pooled results showed a statistically non-significant
reduction, a weighted mean difference of -4.19 pmol/l (95
% ci -13.09 to 4.71, p = 0.36). compared to controls, omega-3
was not associated with a significant change in fasting insulin.
ten trials reporting data on weight were pooled (comparison
01.09). omega-3 pufa compared with controls was not associated
with a significant weight change, and the weighted mean
difference was 0.4 kg (95% ci -3.2 to 4.1, p = 0.82).
trials did not report the incidence of adverse effects of nausea,
vomiting, belching, diarrhoea, constipation, eczema, acne or arrhythmias.
heterogeneity
the results for the test of heterogeneity for the overall results
(omega-3 versus control in all participants, comparison 01) were
non-significant (p > 0.1) for all outcomes studied, except for the
subgroup analysis on low dose of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (pufa) for vldl cholesterol. these did not change when
different statistical models were applied.
subgroup analyses
subgroup analyses were carried out for outcomes that resulted in
significant results in the overall analysis, that is for triglyceride,
ldl and vldl cholesterol levels. results should be regarded as
hypothesis-generating:
hypertriglyceridemic patients
the pooled weighted mean difference for triglycerides in two trials
that recruited 72 hypertriglyceridemic participants was -2.24
mmol/l (95% ci -5.16 to 0.67, p = 0.13), and -0.44 mmol/l
(95% ci -0.58 to -0.32, p < 0.00001) for 16 trials with 897 nonhypertriglyceridemic
participants (comparison 02.01).
increases in ldl cholesterol levels were statistically non-significant
in two trials with 72 hypertriglyceridemic patients, with a
weightedmean difference of 0.40mmol/l (95%ci -0.26 to 1.06,
p = 0.24) using a fixed-effect model. the weighted mean difference
of 14 trials with 493 non-hypertriglyceridemic participants
was 0.11 mmol/l (95% ci 0.00 to 0.22, p = 0.05) (comparison
02.02).
vldl cholesterolwas significantly reduced by 0.53mmol/l (95%
ci -1.04 to -0.02, p = 0.04) in two trials with 72 hypertriglyceridemic
participants. the pooled weighted mean difference of
vldl cholesterol in five trials with 166 non-hypertriglyceridemic
participants was -0.06 mmol/l (95% ci -0.12 to 0.00, p = 0.06,
comparison 02.03).
dose of omega-3 pufa
comparison 03 shows data fromtrials with high doses of omega-3
pufa (more than 2 g eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic
acid). pooled results for triglycerides levels showed a decrease, a
weighted mean difference of -0.35 mmol/l (95% ci 0.53 to -
0.18, p < 0.0001) in the pooled analysis of 13 high dose trials with
457 participants, and -0.57 mmol/l (95 % ci -0.77 to -0.37, p
< 0.00001) in five low dose trials of 512 participants.
the increase in ldl cholesterol was 0.11 mmol/l (95%ci -0.01
to 0.23 mmol/l, p = 0.08) in 12 trials with 431 participants that
administered the high doses of omega-3 and also statistically nonsignificant
in four trials with 134 participants using lower doses, a
weighted mean difference of 0.14 mmol/l (95% ci -0.14 to 0.42
mmol/l, p = 0.34) (comparison 03.02).
for vldl cholesterol, the weighted mean difference was -0.07
mmol/l (95% ci -0.13 to 0.00, p = 0.04) for six high dose trials
including 222 participants, with only one trial using a low dose of
omega-3.
study duration
comparison 04 shows data for trials with long (more than two
months) and short (two months and less) trial duration. triglyceride
levels were reduced, a weighted mean difference of -0.58
mmol/l (95% ci -0.78 to -0.38, p < 0.00001) in six trials of
longer duration with 525 participants and by -0.36mmol/l (95%
ci -0.53 to -0.19 mmol/l, p < 0.0001) in 12 shorter trials with
444 participants (comparison 04.01).
ldl cholesterol levels increased non-significantly by 0.23 mmol/
l (95% ci -0.07 to 0.52, p = 0.13) in six trials lasting longer
than two months with 192 participants. in 10 trials less than two
months duration with 373 participants, the weightedmean difference
was 0.12 mmol/l (95% ci 0.00 to 0.23 mmol/l, p = 0.05)
after omega-3 supplementation compared to controls (comparison
04.02).
the weighted mean difference after omega-3 supplementation
compared to controls forvldl cholesterol levelswas -0.62mmol/
l (95% ci -1.11 to -0.13, p = 0.01) in three trials of longer duration
with 88 patients and was -0.06 mmol/l (95% ci -0.12 to
0.01, p = 0.07) in four trials shorter than two months including
150 patients (comparison 04.03).
sensitivity analyses
sensitivity analyses are shown in appendix 2. for most outcomes
(total cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, triglycerides, hba1c, fasting
plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin) the conclusions of themain
analysis were unchanged when
• only studies with a quality score of three or more were
included, or
• when only blinded studies were included, or
• when only parallel design studies were included, or
• when the only large study (sirtori 1997) was excluded;
• when the statistical model was adjusted.
however, conclusions regarding ldl and vldl cholesterol levels
were more sensitive to these factors, with increases in ldl becoming
non-significant when only blinded or parallel group trials
were included. pooled results for vldl cholesterol were nonsignificant
when blinded, and parallel designs were included. using
a random-effects model for vldl cholesterol changed the
pooled results to a non-significant weighted mean difference of
-0.13 mmol/l (95% ci -0.28 to 0.02, p = 0.08), but did not
change the conclusions with standardised mean differences, or
using weighted mean difference with a fixed-effect model. trials
measuring vldl cholesterol with low doses of omega-3 pufa
showed heterogeneity (p = 0.09) using both fixed-effect or random-
effects models -0.67 (95%ci -2.09 to 0.75), p = 0.35). the
weighted mean difference for both high and low dose trials were
statistically non-significant, using either a fixed-effect or randomeffects
model, however with standardized mean difference fixedeffect
or random-effects models the pooled reductions were significant
in trials only with high doses -0.36 mmol/l (95% ci -
0.66 to -0.06, p = 0.02). in hypertriglyceridaemic patients, using a
standardised mean difference fixed-effect or random effectsmodel
for vldl-cholesterol changed the results to -0.43 (95% ci -0.90
to 0.40, p = 0.07) and -0.36 (95% ci -0.67 to -0.06, p = 0.02)
in non-hypertriglyceridemic patients. for fasting plasma glucose,
the pooled results for trials of shorter duration were significant
with weighted mean difference and a fixed-effect or random-effects
model (0.55 mmol/l (95% ci 0.02 to 1.08, p = 0.04), but
were non-significant when using standardised mean differences
(0.17 mmol/l (95% ci -0.04 to 0.38, p = 0.10).

summary of main results
this systematic review pools 23 randomized controlled trials of
omega-3 supplementation studying a total of 1075 patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus. none of the trials examined hard clinical
endpoints (such as cardiovascular events or death). in the trials
reviewed, omega-3 supplementation had a statistically significant
triglyceride- and vldl cholesterol lowering effect. a statistically
significant increase in ldl cholesterol was noted after
omega-3 supplementation. ldl was not significantly increased in
subgroup analyses of hypertriglyceridemic patients, high or low
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) doses and in trials
lasting longer than two months. omega-3 supplementation did
not result in any statistically significant increase in fasting glucose,
hba1c, or fasting insulin. no other adverse effects were reported.
overall, the subgroup analyses are difficult to interpret as up to
50% of the trials included in the hypertriglyceridemia, high dose
and long duration subgroups were identical (that is including hypertriglyceridemic
patients on a high dose of fish oil in a long
trial) (connor 1993; morgan 1995), making it therefore difficult
to determine which of these factors really caused the differential
response. non-hypertriglyceridemia, long study duration and low
doses of omega-3 pufa may have contributed to a greater reduction
in triglyceride and levels, whereas hypertriglyceridemia and
trials of longer duration may have had a contribution to the larger
reductions in vldl levels. subgroup analyses did not indicate
variables that increased in ldl cholesterol levels.
overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
our data are relevant to clinicians managing patients with type
2 diabetes. they indicate that, in hypertriglyceridemic and normotriglyceridemic
patients, dietary supplementation with omega-
3 pufa leads to a modest lowering of triglycerides without any
statistically significant effect on glycemic control. the increases
in ldl are not significant in hypertriglyceridemic patients. it is
unlikely that omega-3 pufa will be prescribed in normotriglyceridemic
patients, but our results do not provide evidence to discourage
their use as over-the-counter preparations provided the
formulation has been manufactured to eliminate undesirable contaminants.
omega-3 pufa has been suggested to have beneficial effects in
other diseases including crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis and
breast, colon and prostate malignancies (connor 2000), and our
results show that omega-3 pufa represents a reasonable therapeutic
strategy in hypertriglyceridemic individuals. we are not aware
of any studies that have reported the combination of omega-3
pufa with other lipid lowering drugs, and few trials have compared
omega-3 pufa with fibric acid derivatives (fasching 1996).
the slight increase in ldl cholesterol seen with the use of omega-
3 pufa can occur with other triglyceride lowering agents, in patients
without diabetes (fisher 1998; ouguerram 2006; theobald
2004) and is consistent with physiological studies proposing the
mechanism of the ldl increase with omega-3 pufa (lindsey
1992; schectman 1996; surette 1992). in addition, large buoyant
ldl is known to be less atherogenic than small dense ldl and
this may be the type of ldl produced in response to omega-3
pufa (minihane 2000; mori 2000; suzukawa 1995). the impact
of omega-3 pufa on ldl levels in a larger trial included in
this systematic review of patients with diabetes have not yet been
published (sirtori 1997).
although the gissi-prevenzione trial has published its findings
on the administration of fish oil to 11,324 survivors of myocardial
infarction (gissi 1999), the analysis for the diabetes sub-group
(15% of participants) has not yet been reported. however, the
findings of reduced triglycerides and an overall beneficial effect on
survival on the patients surviving myocardial infarction (relative
risk reduction of 10% for the primary endpoint of death, nonfatal
myocardial infarction and stroke) are encouraging.
quality of the evidence
severalmethodological challenges were encountered in the course
of this review. eleven of 23 trials used a cross-over design and
phase-specific data were not available for any of these. for pooling
results from cross-over and parallel group design studies, ideally,
individual patient data or at least phase-specific data should be
available. in the absence of these data, three approaches are possible.
the first is not to analyse data from cross-over studies. the
second is to pool parallel group design and cross-over trials separately.
the third is to treat first phase data from cross-over studies
as coming from parallel group design studies, pool these with data
from parallel group design studies and look for heterogeneity in
the analysis. we adopted the latter approach and our sensitivity
analysis did not show any association between study design and
direction or magnitude of effect. use of the cross-over design to
study omega-3 pufa supplementation has other potential drawbacks.
omega-3 pufa is incorporated into biologic membranes
and presumably would require washout periods of appropriate duration
to minimize any carryover effect. in our review, only four
of the 11 cross-over studies had a washout period. despite these
limitations, the main findings of the review were similar if crossover
studies were included or excluded from the analysis.
another methodological problem is the use of hba1c as an outcome
measure in trials of short duration. glycated haemoglobin
or hba1c provide an integrated measure of glycemic control over
a period of approximately 12 weeks. the use of such measurements
in studies of short duration will underestimate any effects
on glycemic control. this may have occurred in several trials included
in this review (see tables).
the random-effects model was used where the studies were sufficiently
different to assume some level of heterogeneity that could
have been ignored in a fixed-effect model, but except for vldl
cholesterol, the conclusions did not change when the results were
analyzed with either model.
it is interesting to compare the current systematic review with
that of friedberg et al. (friedberg 1998). despite the differences
in design of that review to farmer et al (farmer 2001) and our
current review, the findings of the two reviews are similar and are
in keeping with the results of the largest trial performed in this
area (sirtori 1997).
potential biases in the review process
the subgroup and sensitivity analyses require elaboration to undertake
a more comprehensive comparison between groups with
different characteristics. this will be addressed in a further publication.
limitations of our systematic review include the limited number
of trials with emerging cardiovascular risk markers as outcomes,
and small trial sizes with a median of 23 participants. another
significant limitation of our study is the shorter duration of the
included trials. some trials did not describe methods of randomisation
or blinding so that the degree of rigor with which they were
conducted was not clear. it was not possible to pool all the identified
outcomes because of non-standardised measurement units,
and non-reporting of changes in outcomes. the findings from the
funnel plot analysis (figure 1) may indicate bias in reporting, selection
or methodology of the trials. however, we included trials
reported in any language to reduce selection and language bias,
and an assessment was made of the quality of the trials.

implications for practice
in hypertriglyceridemic patients, dietary supplementation with
omega-3 pufa leads to amodest lowering of triglycerides without
any clinically significant effect on glycemic control, and omega-
3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) may represent a reasonable
therapeutic strategy in these individuals.
implications for research
arecent reviewincluded patientswith diabetes as part of a high risk
group analysis, but also included non-randomised control trials
(balk 2004). three previous systematic reviews have evaluated
the effect of omega-3 pufa on cardiovascular events, lipid and
glycemicmarkers in type 2 diabetes (farmer 2001; friedberg 1998;
montori 2000). however, we considered lipid cardiovascular risk
factors beyond these markers, and used changes in the mean from
baseline to the end of the trial in the pooled analysis.we have also
identified more recent randomised trials.
the slight increase in ldl cholesterol seen with the use of fish
oil represents a cause for concern and long-term studies assessing
hard cardiovascular endpoints in patients with diabetes are
needed. in conclusion, our systematic review demonstrates the
difficulties of existing trial designs. rigorously designed and conducted
randomised controlled trials are required, using standardised
units measuring both established and emerging cardiovascular
risk markers in type 2 diabetes, to enable more conclusive
pooled analyses and improve the precision of the effect size estimates.
larger trials of longer duration would conclusively establish
the role and mechanisms of omega-3 pufa in cardiovascular
disease risk reduction in type 2 diabetes. one trial sub-group analysis
awaits reporting (gissi 1999), and four such end-point trials
are in progress (aforrd 2004; ascend 2005; galan 2003;
origin 2005).

abstract
importance  intensive follow-up after surgery for colorectal cancer is common practice but is based on limited evidence.

objective  to assess the effect of scheduled blood measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) and computed tomography (ct) as follow-up to detect recurrent colorectal cancer treatable with curative intent.

design, setting, and participants  randomized clinical trial in 39 national health service hospitals in the united kingdom; 1202 eligible participants were recruited between january 2003 and august 2009 who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, including adjuvant treatment if indicated, with no evidence of residual disease on investigation.

interventions  participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: cea only (n = 300), ct only (n = 299), cea+ct (n = 302), or minimum follow-up (n = 301). blood cea was measured every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years; ct scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years; and the minimum follow-up group received follow-up if symptoms occurred.

main outcomes and measures  the primary outcome was surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent; secondary outcomes were mortality (total and colorectal cancer), time to detection of recurrence, and survival after treatment of recurrence with curative intent.

results  after a mean 4.4 (sd, 0.8) years of observation, cancer recurrence was detected in 199 participants (16.6%; 95% ci, 14.5%-18.7%) overall; 71 of 1202 participants (5.9%; 95% ci, 4.6%-7.2%) were treated for recurrence with curative intent, with little difference according to dukes staging (stage a, 5.1% [13/254]; stage b, 6.1% [34/553]; stage c, 6.2% [22/354]). surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent was 2.3% (7/301) in the minimum follow-up group, 6.7% (20/300) in the cea group, 8% (24/299) in the ct group, and 6.6% (20/302) in the cea+ct group. compared with minimum follow-up, the absolute difference in the percentage of patients treated with curative intent in the cea group was 4.4% (95% ci, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted odds ratio [or], 3.00; 95% ci, 1.23-7.33), in the ct group was 5.7% (95% ci, 2.2%-9.5%; adjusted or, 3.63; 95% ci, 1.51-8.69), and in the cea+ct group was 4.3% (95% ci, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted or, 3.10; 95% ci, 1.10-8.71). the number of deaths was not significantly different in the combined intensive monitoring groups (cea, ct, and cea+ct; 18.2% [164/901]) vs the minimum follow-up group (15.9% [48/301]; difference, 2.3%; 95% ci, −2.6% to 7.1%).

conclusions and relevance  among patients who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, intensive imaging or cea screening each provided an increased rate of surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent compared with minimal follow-up; there was no advantage in combining cea and ct. if there is a survival advantage to any strategy, it is likely to be small.

trial registration  isrctn.org identifier: 41458548

colorectal cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. it is the third most common cancer worldwide, with 1.24 million cases reported to the international agency for research on cancer in 2008.1 traditionally, patients who have had curative treatment for colorectal cancer undergo regular hospital follow-up for at least 5 years to detect recurrence. although locoregional relapse is traditionally associated with poor prognosis, specialist centers are reporting improved cure rates for selected patients with combined-mode treatment.2 success in treating metastatic recurrence has also been increasing. approximately 40% of patients survive 5 years after complete resection of liver metastases3 and comparable results have been reported for lung metastases.4 the likelihood of survival is increased if metastatic disease is treated before it becomes symptomatic.5

seven published clinical trials have compared different follow-up regimens.6-12 two systematic reviews suggest an overall survival benefit associated with more intensive follow-up.13,14 however, trial quality was modest, the estimated effect on disease-specific survival was not statistically significant, and the mechanism by which the substantial survival benefits reported were achieved is unclear. two reviews13,14 concluded that the existing evidence base needed to be strengthened by high-quality trials addressing the effectiveness of the individual components of follow-up.

the 2 individual components of follow-up recognized to be widely available and affordable and to have the potential to detect isolated metastatic recurrence at an early and surgically treatable stage are computed tomography (ct) imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and regular blood carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) measurement. the facs (follow-up after colorectal surgery) trial was commissioned by the uk national institute for health research health technology assessment program to assess the effect of these 2 modes with the intention of providing a sound evidence base to inform clinical practice. the original intention was to conduct a trial of sufficient size to assess survival advantage but when this proved infeasible, detection of recurrence that was treatable surgically with curative intent was chosen as the main outcome measure. pretrial modeling suggested that unless follow-up increased the number of such recurrences detected, an important survival advantage of follow-up would not be achieved.

methods
trial design
the facs trial was a factorial 2×2 pragmatic randomized clinical trial conducted in 39 centers in the united kingdom; participants were randomized independently to ct imaging every 6 to 12 months or minimum follow-up and to cea testing every 3 to 6 months or minimum follow-up.

participants
to enroll in the trial, all participants had to have undergone curative treatment for primary colorectal cancer with no residual disease, microscopically clear margins, and dukes stage a to c (tnm stage 1-3). patients were disease-free based on colonic imaging with no evidence of metastatic disease (confirmed by ct or magnetic resonance imaging liver scan and chest ct scan) and with a postoperative blood cea level of 10 µg/l or less following surgery or completion of adjuvant therapy as indicated.

patients were excluded if they had concurrent serious illness or dominantly inherited colon cancer, were unable to provide written informed consent, or were involved in a primary treatment trial with conflicting follow-up requirements. potential participants younger than 50 years or more than 6 months from completion of primary or adjuvant treatment were included only if agreed on by the chief surgical investigator.

all participants gave written informed consent to participate in the trial. ethical approval for the trial was granted by the national health service (nhs) south-west research ethics committee.

study setting
participants were recruited at 39 nhs hospitals in the united kingdom with access to high-volume regional services geared to offer surgical treatment for recurrence.

interventions
follow-up was scheduled to occur for 5 years after trial entry. the factorial design, with independent allocation to the cea and ct interventions, meant that patients received 1 of 4 types of follow-up:

cea follow-up: measurement of blood cea every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, with a single chest, abdomen, and pelvis ct scan at 12 to 18 months if requested at study entry by hospital clinician

ct follow-up: ct of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years

cea and ct follow-up: both blood cea measurement and ct imaging as above

minimum follow-up: no scheduled follow-up except a single ct scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at 12 to 18 months if requested at study entry by the hospital clinician

all patients had undergone colonoscopy at trial entry to ensure there was no residual intraluminal disease and were offered an end-of-trial colonoscopy at 5 years; in the 2 ct groups, an additional colonoscopy was undertaken at 2 years.

blood collection kits were sent directly to patients, who then attended their own general practice for phlebotomy. blood was sent to the biochemistry laboratory at the john radcliffe hospital, oxford; the cea analysis was performed using a siemens centaur xp analyzer. if a patient’s blood cea level was 7 µg/l or more above the level at trial entry, the test was repeated as soon as possible; if the second test result was also greater than this threshold, the patient’s general practice physician was asked to refer the patient urgently to the local hospital.

outcomes
the primary outcome was surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent after a minimum of 3 years of follow-up. secondary outcomes were mortality (total deaths and deaths due to colorectal cancer), time to detection of recurrence, and survival after treatment of recurrence with curative intent.

information on participant deaths was collected at the office for national statistics central registry (all patients were registered to have the trials unit notified in the event of the patient’s death); cause of death was abstracted from death certificates. data on treatment of recurrence and treatment intent were recorded on case report forms by local national cancer research network staff who had access to the full clinical records.

randomization and blinding
randomization to 1 of 4 groups (figure 1) on a 1:1:1:1 ratio was performed centrally at the oxford clinical trials unit using a minimization algorithm to balance patient characteristics within each center based on 3 variables: adjuvant chemotherapy, sex, and age group. study nurses contacted the oxford clinical trials unit by telephone to enter a patient in the trial, reporting the relevant patient characteristics; they were then told the trial group to which the patient had been allocated.

because this was a pragmatic open trial, it was not possible to conceal the allocation group from either participants or clinicians. however, the research staff who abstracted outcome data from clinical notes were employed by the local national cancer research network teams independent of the investigators. the analysis program was undertaken first using dummy variables for the allocation groups and the code was not broken until the precise procedures for analysis were agreed on.

sample size
from the run-in phase of the trial, it was predicted that 2% of patients in the minimal follow-up group would have undergone surgery for recurrence with curative intent by 3 years of follow-up. it was therefore estimated that a sample size of 590 participants would need to be allocated to each factorial group to achieve 80% power with a 2-sided α=.05 to detect a minimum 3% absolute effect of intensive monitoring with ct or cea. modeling suggested that a 3% difference in treatment with curative intent translated into overall survival was the smallest difference that would prove cost effective. to compare the minimum intervention group with each of the cea, ct, and cea+ct groups separately, this sample size would provide 51%, 70%, and 84% power to detect absolute differences of 3%, 4%, and 5%, respectively. we therefore decided to stop recruitment when the sample size reached a minimum of 1180 participants.

statistical analysis
the primary analysis was an intention-to-treat comparison of the proportion of patients experiencing recurrence who were treated surgically with curative intent (1) comparing all patients randomized to the 3 intensive follow-up groups (cea only, ct only, and cea+ct) with the minimum follow-up group and (2) comparing all patients randomized to the 2 factorial groups (cea vs no cea and ct vs no ct). when feasible, crude data are presented with statistical comparison made between randomization groups based on χ2 tests for binary or categorical data, the t test or analysis of variance as appropriate for comparing group means, and the kruskal-wallis test for comparing medians.

time to recurrence was analyzed by the kaplan-meier method to take account of both time censoring and the difference in the number of recurrences detected in each group (ie, a crude comparison of time to recurrence may be misleading because this approach does not take into account recurrences not yet detected in less-effective follow-up groups). the plots of time to recurrence were compared by the log-rank mantel-cox statistic. adjusted odds ratios for the main outcome were calculated by binary logistic regression, entering all the baseline characteristics reported in table 1 into the model. for the comparison of factorial groups (cea vs minimum follow-up and ct vs minimum follow-up), an interaction term (cea factor × ct factor) was also entered. we set a statistical significance threshold of α=.05 based on 2-sided tests. the analyses were conducted using ibm spss version 20.

protocol adherence and amendments
adherence to protocol was ascertained through nhs hospital and laboratory records. a secondary per-protocol analysis was conducted excluding patients who received any unscheduled investigation or had missed more than 1 scheduled examination. there were 2 significant amendments to the original protocol during the trial. the initial protocol did not specify the single ct at 12 to 18 months in the minimum follow-up and cea groups; 66 patients had been randomized to the minimum follow-up group before this change took effect in may 2005. surgical treatment with curative intent rather than overall survival was specified as the main outcome in 2007 when it became clear that we could not recruit the number of participants necessary to estimate an effect on overall survival with adequate statistical power.

results
characteristics of participants
allocation of the 1202 eligible participants recruited between january 2003 and august 2009 to each randomization group is shown in figure 1. the follow-up intervention lasted 5 years or, for patients recruited after august 2007, until august 31, 2012. characteristics at trial entry are shown in table 1. the mean age of participants was 69 years, 736 (61.2%) were male, 350 (29.1%) had significant comorbidity; 487 (40.5%) had received adjuvant chemotherapy and 139 (11.6%) preoperative radiotherapy (for rectal cancer) before randomization. the randomization method was successful in achieving a good balance between randomization groups and factorial comparison groups. cumulative overall survival by stage and randomization group are shown in efigures 1 and 2, respectively, in the supplement.

detection of recurrence
during the period of observation for recurrence (mean, 4.4 [sd, 0.8] years), cancer recurrence was detected in 199 participants (16.6%; 95% ci, 14.5%-18.7%); 41 (3.4%) had locoregional recurrence only and 101 (8.4%) had metastatic disease limited to the lung and/or liver (table 2). the kaplan-meier plots in figure 2 show that the 3 intensive interventions tended to detect recurrence earlier, although these differences in earlier detection were not statistically significant. there were no recurrences treatable with curative intent detected in the minimum follow-up group after year 2. two-thirds of recurrences (n=130 [65.3%; 95% ci, 58.7%-71.9%]) were detected by a scheduled follow-up investigation; the remainder were interval cases, presenting symptomatically or incidentally during investigation of concurrent illness. three luminal recurrences were detected by the 2-year colonoscopy in the groups monitored by ct imaging. additionally, 3 cancers were detected by the 5-year colonoscopy but these were new cancers and not recurrent disease. the way in which the recurrences were treated is detailed in etable 1 in the supplement.

curative treatment and survival
the proportion of participants with recurrence surgically treated with curative intent was 5.9% (71/1202; 95% ci, 4.6%-7.2%) overall, with little difference between participants according to dukes staging (stage a, 5.1% [13/254]; stage b, 6.1% [34/553]; stage c, 6.2% [22/354]). table 3 shows that surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent was higher in each of the 3 more intensive follow-up groups compared with the minimum follow-up group (absolute difference ranged from 4.3% to 5.7%; overall p = .02). the adjusted odds ratios were 3.0 (95% ci, 1.2-7.3) for cea only and 3.6 (95% ci, 1.5-8.7) for ct only. the odds ratio for the combined cea+ct group was similar to that for ct or cea alone, providing no evidence that any additive effect is achieved by using both together. the factorial comparison showed an absolute difference between the intervention and comparison groups of 1.4% (95% ci, −1.2% to 4.1%) for cea and 2.8% (95% ci, 0.2%-5.5%) for ct.

of the 71 participants treated surgically with curative intent, 30 also received chemotherapy (7 with radiotherapy). of these patients, 47 (69%; 95% ci, 56.9%-79.5%) were still alive at the time of follow-up (median, 4.4 years after diagnosis of recurrence). the absolute difference in the proportion of patients treated and surviving compared with the minimum follow-up group was 3.3% (95% ci, 0.5%-6.2%) for cea, 2.0% (95% ci, −0.6% to 4.6%) for ct, and 3.6% (95% ci, 0.7%-6.5%) for cea+ct (overall p = .09). the differences in the factorial comparison were 2.4% (95% ci, 0.3%-4.7%) for cea and 1.2% (95% ci, 1.0%-3.4%) for ct.

the number of deaths was higher but not significantly different in the more intensive follow-up groups compared with the minimum follow-up group (18.2% [164/901] vs 15.9% [48/301]; difference, 2.3%; 95% ci, −2.6% to 7.1%), as was the number of disease-specific colorectal cancer deaths (10.4% [94/901] vs 9.3% [28/301]; difference, 1.1%; 95% ci, −2.7% to 5.0%). the kaplan-meier survival curves by randomization group and dukes stage are shown in efigures 1 and 2 in the supplement.

adherence to protocol
the extent of adherence to the follow-up protocol is shown in etable 2 in the supplement. patient adherence was very good, with only 5.8% (35/602) in the cea group missing more than 1 scheduled cea test and 5.0% (30/601) in the ct group missing more than 1 ct scan. although clinician adherence appears to be lower (10.6% of participants [127/1202] received unscheduled cea blood tests, 10.6% [127/1202] unscheduled ct scans, and 9.7% [117/1202] unscheduled colonoscopies), the protocol required investigation of any patients presenting with symptoms between scheduled follow-up tests. substantially more unscheduled tests were performed in patients not receiving regular ct scans, with 16.5% (99/601) vs4.7% (28/601) receiving 1 or more unscheduled cea tests, 17.6% (106/601) vs 3.5% (21/601) receiving 1 or more unscheduled ct tests, and 15.6% (94/601) vs3.8% (23/601) receiving 1 or more unscheduled colonoscopies.

per-protocol analysis
the results of a per-protocol analysis are shown in table 4, excluding the 308 patients (25.6%) who missed more than 1 scheduled visit or underwent any unscheduled investigation. the results are consistent with the intention-to-treat analysis but effect estimates are higher: the absolute differences in rate of detection of treatable recurrence in the more intensive follow-up groups compared with the minimum follow-up group were 5.8% to 8.0%.

discussion
the 2 follow-up tests assessed in this trial were cea and ct imaging. meta-analyses have suggested that these are the only modes with significant potential to detect curatively treatable metastatic recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer.13,14 clinical and ultrasound examination lack sensitivity whereas magnetic resonance imaging can realistically be applied only to the liver and lacks strong evidence of effectiveness in detecting recurrence.13,14 computed tomography–positron emission tomography was not an available technology when this trial was initiated and, because of cost and logistics, would be preferred to standard ct for routine follow-up only if evidence suggested much superior performance. endoscopic imaging (colonoscopy) was provided to patients in all study groups because it is a standard evidence-based element of follow-up care that can detect metachronous polyps or cancer (and, rarely, intraluminal recurrence).15

our results show that intensive follow-up by either scheduled cea or ct increased the likelihood of detecting a recurrence that can be treated with curative intent. the absolute difference in the proportion of participants treated with curative intent was approximately 5% in the intention-to-treat analysis and 8% in the per-protocol analysis, suggesting that between 12 and 20 patients need to be followed up to identify 1 potentially curable recurrence. more than two-thirds of the patients treated surgically with curative intent were still alive at a median follow-up of just over 4 years postrecurrence, suggesting that 5-year survival may be more than the 40% previously reported.3,4

although the proportion of recurrences treated with curative intent (and the success of such treatment) is higher compared with earlier reports, the absolute number of treatable recurrences detected is lower.14 this is not explicable by differences in stage-specific case-mix (detection of recurrences treatable with curative intent was similar irrespective of stage), nor is there any evidence that participants in the facs trial were at low risk of recurrence within stage (84.5% of stage c participants had received adjuvant chemotherapy). stage-specific overall survival of participants in this study (efigure 2 in the supplement) is comparable with that reported in trials of adjuvant chemotherapy, such as mosaic.16 a more likely explanation for the lower detection of treatable recurrence is the rigor of the investigative procedures undertaken to ensure that no residual cancer was present at trial entry. it suggests that the high rate of early recurrence reported from routine cancer statistics in england and scandinavia17 reflects residual disease that would have been detected with more thorough imaging. it probably also explains the greater benefit of intensive follow-up reported in previous trials—follow-up detected residual disease, not recurrence. a key finding of this study is therefore the need to fully stage colorectal cancer before embarking on follow-up.

the comparison between intervention groups suggests that monitoring with cea combined with a single ct scan at 12 to 18 months is not significantly different from undertaking regular ct scanning. because cea testing can be done in primary care, it is likely to be more cost-effective than regular ct imaging. however, imaging is still necessary to confirm recurrence, and in the combined cea+ct group, two-thirds of recurrences were first detected by ct. the diagnostic performance of cea as a monitoring test depends on the frequency of testing and the algorithm used to interpret the result. the algorithm applied in the facs trial (refer for imaging if blood cea level is 7 µg/l above baseline) achieves good specificity but at the cost of modest sensitivity.18 an ongoing study is investigating whether a higher sensitivity can be achieved at an acceptable level of specificity by applying a diagnostic algorithm that takes account of change over time and has been applied successfully in interpreting cancer antigen 125 levels when screening for ovarian cancer.19

we had planned to report our results after all participants had completed 5 years of follow-up because early analysis increases the risk of lead-time bias. however, there have been no cases of recurrence treatable with curative intent after 2 years of follow-up in the minimum follow-up group, making lead-time bias unlikely in our main comparison. nevertheless, subject to continuing informed consent from those in the minimum follow-up group, we plan to continue follow-up as planned to increase the precision of our results, particularly in relation to disease-specific mortality and posttreatment survival.

the decision on whether the absolute benefit of follow-up is sufficient to justify its opportunity cost will differ between health economies. the benefits of follow-up appear to be independent of diagnostic stage (because although there are fewer recurrences with better-stage tumors, they are more likely to be curable), suggesting that stage-specific follow-up strategies may not be necessary. however, thorough staging investigation at the end of primary treatment to detect residual disease is still important because a large number of “recurrences” reported in routine series are probably residual disease that should be detected and treated before embarking on follow-up. because of the detailed investigation performed before trial entry to exclude residual disease, our results also provide data on the timing of recurrence that can strengthen the evidence base for choosing the optimal frequency of testing. duplication of monitoring tests does not appear to add value; participants in the cea groups had a single ct at 12 to 18 months, when 3 recurrences were detected, but otherwise there was no suggestion of benefit from monitoring with both cea and ct.

the size of the trial provides limited precision in estimating survival. with an observed 15.9% mortality rate in the minimum follow-up group, we had only 31% power (with 2-sided α=.05) to detect a 5% effect on survival. although the observed 2% aggregate survival advantage of the minimum follow-up group vs the more intensive follow-up groups is unlikely to be due to bias (central death registration in the united kingdom means there was no loss to follow-up), it could be due to chance. an observed absolute 6% increase in surgery with curative intent predicts a 2% to 3% survival advantage with intensive follow-up. the confidence intervals around both the total mortality and colorectal cancer–specific mortality rates indicate that our results are still consistent with this outcome.

conclusions
among patients who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, intensive imaging and cea screening each provided an improved rate of recurrence treated with curative intent compared with minimal follow-up; there was no advantage to combining both strategies. if there is a survival advantage to any strategy, it is likely to be small.

abstract
background: the charlson comorbidity index is widely used in icd-9 administrative data, however, there is no
translation for read/oxmis coded data despite increasing use of the general practice research database (gprd).
our main objective was to translate the charlson index for use with read/oxmis coded data such as the gprd
and test its association with mortality. we also aimed to provide a version of the comorbidity index for other
researchers using similar datasets.
methods: two clinicians translated the charlson index into read/oxmis codes. we tested the association between
comorbidity score and increased mortality in 146 441 patients from the gprd using proportional hazards models.
results: this read/oxmis translation of the charlson index contains 3156 codes. our validation showed a strong
positive association between charlson score and age. cox proportional models show a positive increasing
association with mortality and charlson score. the discrimination of the logistic regression model for mortality was
good (auc = 0.853).
conclusion: we have translated a commonly used comorbidity index into read/oxmis for use in uk primary care
databases. the translated index showed a good discrimination in our study population. this is the first study to
develop a co-morbidity index for use with the read/oxmis coding system and the gprd. a copy of the comorbidity
index is provided for other researchers using similar databases.
background
studies of patient health should take into consideration
any independent predictors that will affect the outcome
of interest. individual disease status is an important predictor
of mortality and health care usage especially in
studies of older patients, and in many cases, subjects
may have more than one co-existing illness at the same
time. investigators may wish to conduct risk adjustment
for the additional health effects of these co-morbid
diseases.
previous research has led to the development of summary
comorbidity measures which classify patients
according to their disease burden [1-4]. the most widely
used and validated index of comorbidity was developed
by charlson and colleagues in the late 1980s [5,6]. the
charlson index includes 17 categories of comorbid disease
weighted based on their association with 1 year allcause
mortality. because the charlson index is weighted
and allows for additive scoring, it can take into account
both the number and the severity of comorbidity to provide
a summary of disease burden for each individual
patient [6]. the index has been validated in several different
populations, and has been widely used in studies
involving cancer patients and survivors [7-11].
recognizing the potential for its use in large database
studies that require risk adjustment for individual
patients, the charlson index has previously been adapted
for use with administrative data [12-15]. these adaptations
involve searching individual level hospital claims
data for codes corresponding to the charlson index
categories. however, these adaptations generally apply
only to icd-9-cm coded data, an international coding
system for classification of diseases, symptoms and
signs. there is no current translation of the charlson
index for read and oxmis coded data, two systems
which are based on icd-9-cm and are widely used in
british primary care. data using the read and oxmis
coding system has recently been made more readily
available from the general practice research database
(gprd), a uk-based database of clinical primary care
records. the gprd is the world’s largest source of
anonymised longitudinal data from primary care, and
currently contains information on 3.6 million active
patients from 450 general practices in the uk [16].
with increasing use of the gprd for academic and epidemiological
research, there is a need for a gprd-compatible
research tool that will allow categorization and
adjustment for patient comorbidity.
the main aim of this paper is to develop a comorbidity
index based on the charlson index for use with
read/oxmis coded data. we also describe the performance
of the new measure by testing whether comorbidity
is associated with increased mortality in a cohort
of patients from the gprd. it is our hope that the
newly developed and tested translation of the charlson
score can be used by other researchers working with
read/oxmis coded data and the gprd.
methods
development of read/oxmis codes lists
the original charlson index consists of 17 diagnostic
categories which provide the basis for assigning
weighted scores to each comorbid disease. deyo et al
[12] describe a validated translation of each diagnostic
category of the charlson index to icd-9-cm codes. we
used the icd-9-cm codes suggested by deyo et al to
guide development of the read/oxmis code lists used
in this comorbidity index. figure 1 summarizes our process
for translation of the index to read/oxmis codes
using one of the charlson diagnostic categories, myocardial
infarction, as an example.
using definitions provided by deyo et al for each
charlson diagnostic category, we searched the general
practice research database medical dictionary (version
0.3.7, copyright © 2004) for potentially relevant read/
oxmis codes. this dictionary includes the gprd medical
code for the type of event, the read/oxmis code for
the event and a description of the medical term. we
identified potential read/oxmis terms using two search
strategies. firstly, we used specific terms in the icd-9-
cm description of the event to search the gprd dictionary.
read codes have a hierarchical structure, with a
top level code for a disease category branching into
more precise and specific codes. therefore, our second
strategy involved identifying relevant top level read
codes and including all lower level codes. by using the
wild card (*), and hierarchies of read codes, we generated
a list of all potentially related codes. we conducted
these read/oxmis searches for 16 of the diagnostic
categories used in the charlson index. we treated the
cancer codes separately, and included all read codes
starting with ‘b’, but excluding all codes for benign cancer
(b7), cancer in situ (b8) and neoplasms of uncertain
behaviour (b9). we tried to be over-inclusive in the
searching and used broad search terms when possible.
two clinicians experienced in the use of read codes
(pwr and sh) independently reviewed the list of all
read/oxmis codes identified through searches of the
gprd medical dictionary. the clinicians selected relevant
read/oxmis codes and rejected codes not corresponding
to icd-9-cm codes used in the deyo
adaptation of the charlson index. a third clinician
resolved any disagreement on coding. we calculated the
degree of inter-rater agreement between the two clinicians
reviewing read/oxmis code lists using the kappa
score, which provides an estimate of the level of agreement
between the two raters above that occurring due
to chance. the final list of read/oxmis codes in this
adaptation of the charlson index is available in additional
file 1.
13 read/oxmis codes were used in more than one
diagnostic category. these overlaps only occurred
between diabetes and peripheral vascular disease (i.e.
‘gangrene diabetic’ was coded as both ‘diabetes’ and
‘peripheral vascular disease’), and between diabetes and
diabetes with complications. one clinician (pwr) determined
that the codes should be classified as diabetes
codes.
data source
the gprd is the world’s largest anonymised database of
primary care records [16]. practices participating in the
gprd record data on clinical diagnoses, test results, prescriptions
and referral data from primary care. clinical
data is coded using read/oxmis codes, along with the
date of original onset for chronic or recurrent conditions.
gprd recording guidelines direct practices to provide a
record of all significant morbidity events in the patient’s
medical history, including a summary of events that
occurred before the patient joined the practice [17]. the
data from practices undergoes quality control procedures
and several validation studies have shown a high level of
data completeness within the gprd [18].
validation dataset
as part of a study looking at the unmet needs of longterm
survivors of cancer, we received a dataset containing
primary care records between 01/01/1987 and 30/
06/2006 for all patients in the gprd with a diagnosis of
breast, colorectal or prostate cancer and more than five
years survival. we also received data on a control population
of patients with no record of breast, colorectal or
prostate cancer, matched to the cancer survivors by age,
gender and practice on a ratio of 1:4. the dataset
included data on 18707 breast cancer survivors, 5773
colorectal cancer survivors, 4856 prostate cancer survivors,
and 117105 control patients (total n = 146 441
patients). we used individual level clinical data in this
dataset to test the adapted charlson index.
assessing the comorbidity measure
following translation of the charlson index to read/
oxmis codes, we tested whether an increasing comorbidity
score was associated with increased patient mortality.
to achieve this, we applied the adapted weighted
charlson index to the patient cohort obtained from the
gprd. our adapted comorbidity score used the original
charlson score which does not include age, however,
charlson and colleagues have also developed a combined
age-comorbidity index [19].
cox proportional hazards models were fit with mortality
from july 1 2001 to 31 august 2006 as the dependent
variable. charlson score was coded as a continuous
ordinal indicator variable, and was included along with
age as explanatory variables. survival was measured in
days and associations are reported using hazard ratios
with charlson score of 0 as the referent group. all analyses
were conducted using stata mp (version 10, college
station, tx).
discriminatory power of the model
the area under a receiver operating characteristic
(roc) curve, or c-statistic, can be used to quantify how
well a predictor based on a number of variables discriminates
a dichotomous outcome [20]. we used a logistic
model to estimate the relationship between death
(dichotomous outcome coded 0/1) and the charlson
index, after adjusting for age, quintiles of the the index
of multiple deprivation (imd) and gender, before producing
the roc curve. model discrimination was
assessed by the area under the roc curve.
adjusting variables
we included age in 2001, gender and socioeconomic
status in the models for adjustment. age was categorized
in 5 groups of similar sizes (30-49, 50-59, 60-69,
70-79, 80+). the gprd dataset includes an index of
multiple deprivation (imd) score to estimate socioeconomic
status at practice level. the imd covers a range
of indicators including income, employment, health
deprivation and disability, education, skills and training,
housing, and geographical access to services for each
small area in the uk [21]. imd scores were grouped
into quintiles based on the spread of scores within each
country in the uk.
results
coding exercise
the inter-rater agreement between the two clinicians for
including read/oxmis codes in the charlson index was
84.6%, with a kappa of 0.45, indicating a moderate level
of agreement [22]. including the cancer codes, a total of
3156 read/oxmis codes were included in this adaptation
of the charlson index.
characteristics of the cohort
the mean age of the cohort was 73.7 (sd 12.5), and
73.5% of the patients were female. the high percentage
of female patients is due to the high proportion of
breast cancer survivors and gender matched controls in
the cohort. table 1 shows the frequency and percentages
of patients with each of the diagnoses included in
the comorbidity index.
the original charlson index weights each disease category
on the strength of its association with mortality.
using the original charlson weights for each disease
category, the breakdown by index score in our dataset is
shown in figure 2.
most of the patients in the validation dataset had no
comorbid disease (n = 60585). there were a few patients
with a very high charlson score above 5. there was a
strong positive association between increasing charlson
score and increasing age (p < 0.0001).
patient mortality
in total, 11,490 patients died during the five-year period
from july 1 2001 to august 31 2006. figure 3 shows the
survival curves for the population stratified according to
charlson score.
mortality was significantly associated with a charlson
score of 1 or more, with a positive increasing association
as charlson score increases (table 2). there was an
increased risk of death amongst older patients and
amongst males.
discrimination of the model
the discrimination of the logistic regression model was
good, with an area under the curve (auc) of 0.853 (figure
4). this indicates that the adaptation of the charlson
index is a good predictor of mortality in the
validation dataset.
discussion
we have translated a commonly used comorbidity index
into read/oxmis codes for use with uk primary care
databases. in a cohort of cancer survivors and matched
controls, a higher comorbidity score in this adaption of
the charlson index was associated with an increased
risk of mortality after adjusting for age, deprivation
scores and gender. the translated comorbidity index
showed a good discrimination our study population. to
our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a
comorbidity index for use with this disease coding
system.
although this adaptation of the charlson index can be
applied to any read/oxmis coded dataset, we hope
that our adapted version of the charlson index will be
especially useful to the increasing number of researchers
conducting work using the gprd. gprd data provides
an opportunity to conduct large scale epidemiological
research in primary health care use, health outcomes
and pharmacology. the medicines and healthcare products
regulatory agency (mrha), which manages the
gprd, has recently announced plans to link gprd data
with hospital episodes statistics (hes), cancer registrations
and office for national statistics databases. these
linkages will increase the value of conducting research
using the gprd, as researchers will be able to trace
patient pathways through primary and secondary care.
our adaptation of the charlson index is available in
additional file 1, and can be imported into statistical
software for use with other datasets. this index can be
used to quickly categorize patients into different comorbidity
levels, and will add explanatory power when conducting
analyses using read/oxmis coded datasets and
the gprd.
we tested the association between increasing charlson
score and mortality, which was the primary outcome
used in the development of the original score. our
results confirm the hypothesis that patients with a
greater burden of disease will die sooner. one unexpected
result was a large jump in the risk of mortality in
patients with a charlson score of 6 or above. this is
likely due to the number of patients in our cohort with
metastatic cancer, which generally has a very poor prognosis
in the small but high risk group of patients with a
score of 6 or more [23].
limitations
this comorbidity index performed well in our validation
exercise, however, there are several areas where the
model may be inadequate. firstly, it is possible that
some codes were not included when developing the
read/oxmis code lists for assessment. by using broad
search terms, hierarchical searches of read codes, and
two reviewers to independently assess records, fewer
potentially relevant read/oxmis codes were excluded
from the final adaptation of the charlson index. secondly,
we used the original disease weights developed by
the authors of the original charlson index almost twenty
years ago. one recent criticism of the charlson index is
that certain diseases have an improved prognosis since
the original score was developed. for instance, according
to the original charlson weighting, a positive aids disease
status carries an equivalent mortality risk to a diagnosis
of metastatic cancer. only eight patients in our
dataset were diagnosed with aids, therefore, this issue
is unlikely to affect our validation results. in studies
where a larger proportion of individuals are hiv/aids
positive, investigators may wish to use updated weights
for hiv/aids taking into account that the burden of
disease and mortality is lower now than in the 1980s
[24].
thirdly, recording of clinical outcomes in primary care
settings may be incomplete; a recent study demonstrated
that even major outcomes such as cancer may not be
recorded in patient electronic records [25]. although
the gprd data is subject to a number of quality checks,
it is possible that disease recording is incomplete. however,
many of the previous adaptations of the charlson
index have used administrative data, where patient history
and comorbid disease may not be as recorded as
accurately as the clinical data available in datasets such
as the gprd [26,27]. omissions of major comorbid diseases
can result in an incorrect final charlson score in
any study. these omissions are not an intrinsic
limitation in the tool that we have developed, but may
affect its functional ability in datasets such as the
gprd. future work should continue to validate the
accuracy of disease coding in administrative datasets
and the gprd.
our validation population of long-term cancer survivors
is unusual; these patients are older and sicker than
the general population. the cancer survivors have a
charlson score of at least 2 and a high proportion are
female owing to the high number of breast cancer survivors.
other patient cohorts using this adapted comorbidity
index will likely have different trends in mortality
and consultation behaviour. future studies should apply
this charlson adaptation to other study populations to
measure mortality and use of primary care services. we
were also unable to consider race or ethnicity in the
analysis as this information is not routinely collected in
the gprd. these limitations, however, do not affect the
development and translation of the charlson index to
read/oxmis codes, but may affect the results of the
validation exercise.
conclusions
in conclusion, we have developed an adaptation of the
charlson comorbidity index for use in read/oxmis
databases and the gprd which predicts 5-year mortality
in a cohort of patients. our adaptation is provided in a
downloadable format (additional file 1) for other
researchers using similar databases. with increasing use
of large datasets for epidemiological research, researchers
must consider how disease status will affect their
outcomes of interest. tools such as the charlson index
can provide a summary of comorbidity for use in large
studies, and this paper demonstrates the utility of an
adaptation of the charlson score in primary care coded
data.

abstract
objective to assess the effect of community prescribing of an antibiotic for acute respiratory infection on the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in an individual child.

study design observational cohort study with follow-up at two and 12 weeks.

setting general practices in oxfordshire.

participants 119 children with acute respiratory tract infection, of whom 71 received a β lactam antibiotic.

main outcome measures antibiotic resistance was assessed by the geometric mean minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for ampicillin and presence of the icehin1056 resistance element in up to four isolates of haemophilus species recovered from throat swabs at recruitment, two weeks, and 12 weeks.

results prescribing amoxicillin to a child in general practice more than triples the mean minimum inhibitory concentration for ampicillin (9.2 µg/ml v 2.7 µg/ml, p=0.005) and doubles the risk of isolation of haemophilus isolates possessing homologues of icehin1056 (67% v 36%; relative risk 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.9) two weeks later. although this increase is transient (by 12 weeks ampicillin resistance had fallen close to baseline), it is in the context of recovery of the element from 35% of children with haemophilus isolates at recruitment and from 83% (76% to 89%) at some point in the study.

conclusion the short term effect of amoxicillin prescribed in primary care is transitory in the individual child but sufficient to sustain a high level of antibiotic resistance in the population.

introduction
the correlation between community use of penicillin and penicillin resistance across 19 european countries has recently been reported as 0.84.1 the regression line rises steeply—for example, in france the rate of penicillin prescribing is 2.5 times that in the united kingdom but the proportion of non-susceptible streptoccus pneumoniae is 10 times higher (40% v 4%). this steep dose-effect relation contrasts starkly with the weak relation between antibiotic prescribing and resistance that we and others have previously reported from uk general practice.2 3

although a strong correlation between antibiotic prescribing and resistance might seem inevitable from a darwinian perspective, the relation is complex.4 actual resistance levels will depend on the pattern of antibiotic use, the specific interaction between bacterium and drug, the potential for transmission, and the stage the country is at in the evolution of resistance. for example, sweden and denmark have higher rates of penicillin prescribing than the uk but lower resistance, while finland has lower prescribing but higher resistance.1 similarly, community studies from iceland have shown that the association between a reduction in prescribing and resistance is not straightforward.5 6 to develop an effective strategy to manage antibiotic resistance in the community we need to understand what is happening at the level of the individual patient, not just to inform care of patients but also to provide firm estimates for the population models that should inform policy on antibiotic prescribing.

the highest rates of antibiotic prescribing in primary care are to children with respiratory illness but surprisingly there have been few prospective controlled studies of the impact of such prescribing on resistance in a community setting. in the 1980s brook reported isolation of β lactam producing bacteria in 46% of children one week after antibiotic treatment of otitis media or pharyngitis and 27% after three months compared with a constant 11% in controls.7 a paper from malawi in 2000 reported recovery of co-trimoxazole resistant pneumococci in 52% of children one week after malaria treatment with co-trimoxazole compared with 34% in controls but with no difference after four weeks.8 an australian study in 2002 reported a twofold increase in the odds of recovery of resistant pneumococci in children who had used β lactam antibiotics in the two months before swab collection.9 we report a prospective study in children from uk general practice with new methods for identifying a highly mobile integrative and conjugative element (ice) that encodes β lactamase and circulates among nasopharyngeal haemophilus species.10 11 12

methods
participants
general practitioners initially recruited 150 children aged 6 months to 12 years presenting with either otitis media or a suspected respiratory infection. thirty one were excluded from this analysis because they were prescribed a macrolide (n=7), co-amoxiclav (n=1), or received a further course of antibiotics at another consultation during the 12 week follow-up period (n=23). we therefore included 119 children, of whom 71 were prescribed a β lactam antibiotic (amoxicillin 70, cephradine 1) at presentation and 48 received no antibiotic.

data collection and follow-up
a research nurse collected information on sociodemographic details, type of infection, child's past antibiotic use, and treatment for current illness as well as obtaining ethical consent from the parent. information on antibiotic prescribing was confirmed from the medical records. children were followed up on two occasions, at two weeks and 12 weeks after recruitment.

microbiology
a trained research nurse took throat swabs. each cotton tipped wooden swab was transported in enriched tryptic soy broth. the samples were vortexed and the broth stored at −80°c for batch processing. at the time of processing, 50 µl samples were inoculated onto two haemophilus selective media: columbia agar (enriched with haemin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) plus bacitracin, and the same agar with the addition of 2 µg/ml ampicillin. plates were incubated at 37°c plus 5% co2 for 48 hours. up to four morphologically different colonies were picked from the bacitracin plate and two morphologically different colonies from the ampicillin plate. the colonies were purified by subculturing on to chocolate agar. assessment of ampicillin minimum inhibitory concentration level (etest, ab biodisk, solna, sweden) was performed in accordance with us national committee of clinical and laboratory standards guidelines. the presence of the integrative and conjugative element homologous to icehin1056 was performed following a method previously described13 with a multiplex assay targeting regions of the topoisomerase gene and orf 51 (as annotated in the complete sequence of icehin1056; accession number aj627386, table 1).​1).

we looked for the integrative and conjugative element in the haemophilus species isolated from the bacitracin agar plate (which selects for haemophilus species and against other bacterial genera). we estimated the minimum inhibitory concentration for ampicillin from isolates selected from the ampicillin agar plate. the extent of double counting of isolates based on morphological appearance was assessed by comparing the dna sequences of regions of the mdh and frdb housekeeping genes in 188 isolates (four isolates from 47 plates). identical mdh and frdb alleles would suggest that strains of haemophilus species were indistinguishable. results showed no double counting of indistinguishable strains in 21 plates, one isolate double counted in 19 plates, and two isolates double counted in seven plates. we have therefore presented the integrative and conjugative element data using the child rather than the isolate as a denominator.

analysis
analysis of data was performed with spss for windows (version 12.0). we used the χ2 test to compare categorical data between groups at each visit. as the minimum inhibitory concentration for ampicillin is highly skewed we applied a log transformation to this measurement and used geometric means to summarise this measure. we used t tests to compare the means between groups at each visit and paired t tests to compare the means within groups. where data are reported in relation to individual children rather than individual isolates, the denominator is limited to children in whom haemophilus species were isolated (because antibiotic resistance is a characteristic of the colonising bacterium, not of the child). as we recovered haemophilus species from nearly all children, however, the results would be similar if we included all children in the denominator.

go to:
results
completeness of follow-up and recovery of target bacterium
loss to follow-up was small: nine children (8%) at two weeks, 10 children (9%) at 12 weeks. recovery of haemophilus species was high and increased with each visit: 101/119 (85%) children at baseline, 101/110 (92%) at two weeks, and 106/109 (97%) at 12 weeks, with little difference between the antibiotic and no antibiotic groups.

initial differences between children
table 2 provides data on children according to whether they were prescribed an antibiotic.​antibiotic. mean age (both 5.4 years), mean number of children in household (1.16 v 1.13), and previous exposure to antibiotics (87% v 85%) were similar. day care or school attendance was more common in the children who received an antibiotic (66/69 (95%) v 40/47 (85%), p=0.05). the geometric mean of the minimum inhibitory concentration for ampicillin of the haemophilus species isolates was 2.4 µg/ml in the antibiotic group and 4.1 µg/ml in the no antibiotic group (p=0.24). the proportion of children with an isolate carrying an integrative and conjugative element was 32% and 38%, respectively (p=0.52). carriage of the element was common even in children who had never received an antibiotic (8/15, 53%).

effect of antibiotics on ampicillin minimum inhibitory concentration
the figure shows that in children who did not receive an antibiotic, the geometric mean minimum inhibitory concentration for ampicillin was the same (2.7 µg/ml) at both follow-up points, with no significant change from the initial level of 4.1 µg/ml. in contrast, in children who received an antibiotic, the minimum inhibitory concentration increased about fourfold to 9.2 µg/ml at the two week follow-up (ratio to no antibiotic group 3.5, p=0.005). at the 12 week follow-up, it fell back to 5.7 µg/ml (ratio to no antibiotic group 2.1, p=0.06). we were able to calculate a measure of change between the initial visit and 12 week follow-up in 86 children (54 in antibiotic group, 32 in no antibiotic group). the ratio of geometric mean minimum inhibitory concentration at 12 weeks compared with initial visit was 2.33 in children who received an antibiotic and 0.71 in those who did not (p=0.05).

effect of antibiotics on carriage of an integrative and conjugative element
table 3 shows the proportion of children from whom we recovered an integrative and conjugative element at each visit.​visit. as with the minimum inhibitory concentration for ampicillin, there was little change in recovery from children who did not receive an antibiotic at the two week (36%) and 12 week (37%) follow-up visits. in the antibiotic group, however, recovery doubled to 67% at two weeks (p=0.002) before falling back to 36% (close to the baseline level of 32%) at 12 weeks. table 3 also shows that the approximate doubling of risk of carriage at two weeks and the fall close to baseline by 12 weeks were consistent whether or not a resistant element had been recovered from the child at the initial visit.​visit. an integrative and conjugative element was recovered from most children from whom haemophilus species were isolated (83%, 95% confidence interval 76% to 89%) at some point in the study, irrespective of whether they received an antibiotic.

discussion
the short term effect of amoxicillin prescribed in primary care is transitory in the individual child but sufficient to sustain a high level of antibiotic resistance in the population. the inclusion of commensal as well as pathogenic haemophilus species and the focus on mobile resistance elements allowed us to avoid the bias inherent in previous studies (that is, the differential recovery of bacteria in intervention and treatment groups). it also allowed us to characterise the bacterial flora from more than a single isolate even when we sampled by throat swab. although the design was observational, the similarity of baseline characteristics and levels of initial resistance, plus the lack of any suggestion that the integrative and conjugative element is associated with disease virulence or a pathogenic factor,11 12 makes serious confounding unlikely.

the integrative and conjugative element can be isolated from both pathogenic h influenzae and commensal h parainfluenzae and like a plasmid moves freely between them by horizontal transfer.12 13 14 it is this global gene pool of transferable antibiotic resistance elements that maintains antibiotic resistance in the community. we recognise that other potential respiratory tract pathogens accrue resistance (including penicillin resistance in pneumococci and methicillin resistance in staphylococci) by mutation of chromosomal genes rather than conjugative mechanisms and therefore we cannot necessarily generalise our results to those species. our results, however, are consistent with the report by nasrin et al of a doubling of odds of isolation of penicillin resistant pneumococci from children who had received a β lactam antibiotic within two months but not six months.9

prescribing antibiotics to children remains common practice. a paper published in 1999 reported that 55% of children aged 0-5 years in the uk (the group of patients who receive most antibiotics in the community) receive an average of 2.2 prescriptions for a β lactam antibiotic from their general practitioner each year.15 although a reduction in prescribing (and the strategy of recommending a 24-48 hour delay before filling antibiotic prescriptions) has probably resulted in about a 40% fall in consumption since then,16 unpublished data reported to the paediatric subgroup of the standing advisory committee on antibiotic resistance suggest that community antibiotic prescribing is again rising.

using our results to estimate the effect of this prescribing on resistance is not straightforward. if our ability to recover an integrative and conjugative element mirrors the change in transmission potential, the marginal effect of community prescribing on the proportion of children in the uk who are able to transmit an integrative and conjugative element at any one time is perhaps 2-3%. however, this does not imply a marginal 2-3% impact on resistance because this is not a static system. for example, applying a transmission dynamics model to data from finland, austin et al showed that a paediatric prescribing rate of 14 days of antibiotics each year, and an estimated duration of carriage of a β lactamase producing strain of moraxella catarrhalis of just over one month, was consistent with an increase in community prevalence of these strains by about 10% a year to an equilibrium level of about 50%.17 these parameter estimates are not dissimilar in magnitude to the prescribing rates cited above and the duration of increased recovery of the integrative and conjugative element we observed.

clinical implications
in the few cases where it is appropriate to repeat the prescription of an antibiotic within under three months, it may be sensible to choose one (for example, co-amoxiclav) that has activity against β lactamase producing strains, rather than give a further course of amoxicillin. from a population perspective, the issue of concern is the high (about 35%) equilibrium level of recovery of resistant haemophilus species to which the children receiving antibiotics returned after 12 weeks and the endemic carriage of the integrative and conjugative element by nasopharyngeal haemophilus species. this may indicate that bacteria can adapt to carry the resistance element with minimal metabolic cost and therefore without much biological disadvantage in the absence of antibiotic selection. in this situation, the model proposed by austin et al further predicts that any reduction in community resistance is likely to need a substantial and sustained reduction in community prescribing.17 one option that deserves further investigation, and is supported by nasrin's data,9 is to reduce the duration of each course of antibiotics prescribed in the community. a more radical option is to advise stopping prescribing antibiotics to any child with respiratory infection in the community except in well defined and exceptional circumstances. although such a strategy may be easier to implement than a discretionary policy based on the difficult, and perhaps impossible, clinical discrimination between viral and bacterial infection, it does run the risk of some children with bacterial disease being treated later in the course of their illness.

what is already known on this topic
uk general practitioners are strongly encouraged to reduce antibiotic prescribing to minimise the risk of antibiotic resistance

epidemiological studies of the likely effect of reducing antibiotic prescribing outside hospital on antibiotic resistance have reported inconsistent results

what this study adds
prescribing amoxicillin to a child in general practice doubles the risk of recovering a β lactamase encoding resistance element from that child's throat two weeks later

this risk falls back to the level seen before treatment within 12 weeks, but a β lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic should probably be prescribed during this period

the icehin1056 resistance element is endemic in uk children, but reversal of this will require further substantial and sustained changes in antibiotic prescribing in the community
