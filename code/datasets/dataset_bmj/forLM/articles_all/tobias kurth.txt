abstract observational studies often provide the only available information about treatment effects. control of confounding, however, remains challenging. the authors compared five methods for evaluating the effect of tissue plasminogen activator on death among <UNK> ischemic stroke patients registered in a german stroke registry: multivariable logistic regression, propensity score–matched analysis, regression adjustment with the propensity score, and two propensity score–based weighted methods—one estimating the treatment effect in the entire study population (inverse-probability-of-treatment weights), another in the treated population (standardized-mortality-ratio weights). between <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> patients received tissue plasminogen activator. the crude odds ratio between tissue plasminogen activator and death was <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval: <UNK> <UNK> the adjusted odds ratio depended strongly on the adjustment method, ranging from <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval: <UNK> <UNK> for the standardized-mortality-ratio weighted to <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval: <UNK> <UNK> for the inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted analysis. for treated patients with a low propensity score, risks of dying were high. exclusion of patients with a propensity score of <UNK> yielded comparable odds ratios of approximately <UNK> for all methods. high levels of nonuniform treatment effect render summary estimates very sensitive to the weighting system explicit or implicit in an adjustment technique. researchers need to be clear about the population for which an overall treatment estimate is most suitable. causality, cerebrovascular accident, confounding factors (epidemiology), data interpretation, statistical, logistic models, models,

contributions nonexperimental observational studies are never considered the “gold standard” for causal inference. however, when randomized trial data are unavailable, observational studies provide the only information about treatment effects. even when randomized trial data are available, rigorous patient inclusion and exclusion criteria may limit the generalizability of their results. a major methodological problem in observational studies is that investigators have no control over the treatments used by participants. to account for differences in observed covariates in the treatment groups, investigators must frequently carry out analytic adjustments to control confounding when estimating treatment effects <UNK> <UNK> data on scores of potential confounders are often available for analysis, but the richness of this information does not always translate into a reliable analysis <UNK> in studies with a dichotomous outcome, the most common adjustment method is logistic regression of the outcome on treatment and a subset of the pretreatment covariates. in <UNK> alternative methods for control of confounding in observational studies based on the propensity score were proposed <UNK> the propensity score is the probability that an individual would have been treated based on that individual's observed pretreatment variables. adjustments using the estimated propensity score tend to balance observed covariates that were used to construct the score. several adjustment methods incorporating the estimated propensity score have been proposed, including matching <UNK> <UNK> regression adjustment <UNK> <UNK> and weighting <UNK> one difficulty faced with all methods of confounder control (i.e., logistic regression or propensity score–based methods) is that if key predictors or important interactions are not included in the outcome regression model or in the propensity score model, then residual confounding due to the excluded covariates and interactions may be substantial. on the other hand, by including all available covariates and their lower-order interactions, the estimate of the treatment effect can be very imprecise and, in nonlinear models such as the logistic, may even be biased <UNK> <UNK> thus, it is unclear which adjustment method is preferable in which situation. to assess the utility of different techniques to adjust for confounding, we used data from a regional german stroke registry to compare estimates of the effect of treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) on the in-hospital mortality of ischemic stroke patients. we chose this scenario because some observational studies have shown an increased risk of death associated with t-pa treatment <UNK> while randomized controlled trials demonstrated no causal association between t-pa treatment and death <UNK> materials and methods description of the data set the westphalian stroke registry is a regional data bank in northwestern germany and has been described in detail previously <UNK> <UNK> the registry included all patients treated for stroke symptoms who were admitted to the participating <UNK> hospitals. patient documentation was performed anonymously and included sociodemographic characteristics, cerebrovascular risk factors, comorbidities, stroke type and severity, and details regarding the treating institution, the mode of admission, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, complications, and discharge conditions. between <UNK> and <UNK> data for <UNK> patients with stroke symptoms were entered in the registry. of those patients, <UNK> were diagnosed with ischemic stroke, <UNK> with transient ischemic attacks, <UNK> with primary intracerebral hemorrhage, and <UNK> with stroke of unknown mechanism. for our analyses, all but the ischemic stroke cases were excluded. in addition, we excluded <UNK> patients from <UNK> centers that did not perform t-pa therapy during the time interval of investigation, <UNK> ischemic stroke cases with intraarterial lysis, and <UNK> ischemic stroke cases for whom no admission data were available, leaving <UNK> patients for this analysis. propensity score the propensity score is the probability that an individual would have been treated based on that individual's observed pretreatment variables. to describe the propensity score, let the dichotomous <UNK> variable z indicate treatment, and let x be the vector of available pretreatment covariates. the propensity score e(x) for an individual is defined as the conditional probability of being treated given his or her covariates x: e(x) = pr(z = <UNK> the propensity score is a one-dimensional variable that summarizes the multidimensional pretreatment covariates x. among persons with a given propensity score, the distribution of the covariates x is on average the same among the treated and untreated. propensity score model the estimated propensity score, (ê(x)), for t-pa treatment was obtained from the fit of a logistic regression model for which we considered the following pretreatment variables: age <UNK> increments), gender, rankin scale <UNK> at the time of admission <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> time from event to hospital admission <UNK> hour, <UNK> hours, <UNK> hours), paresis (monoplegia, hemiplegia, tetraplegia), state of consciousness (awake, somnolent, comatose), type of admitting ward (normal, stroke unit, intensive care unit), transportation to the hospital (emergency medical service, other qualified transport, private, other), aphasia, hypertension (defined as measured systolic blood pressure <UNK> mmhg or diastolic pressure <UNK> mmhg, or current treatment of hypertension regardless of admission blood pressure), diabetes mellitus (defined as pathologic glucose tolerance test, or two times serum glucose values of <UNK> mg/dl), atrial fibrillation, history of other cardiac illnesses, previous stroke, and the admitting clinical center. during the study period, the associations of age <UNK> years vs. <UNK> years), time from symptoms to admission to the hospital <UNK> hour, <UNK> hours, <UNK> hours), and rankin scale <UNK> <UNK> with t-pa treatment changed in the last three <UNK> periods compared with the first <UNK> we therefore added time-covariate interaction terms for these variables into the propensity score model. analytical approach all analyses were performed by using sas (version <UNK> software (sas institute, inc., cary, north carolina). we compared patient pretreatment characteristics with respect to t-pa treatment by using student's t test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. all p values are two sided. our goal was to estimate the effect of treatment with t-pa among ischemic stroke patients on in-hospital mortality by using different methods to control for confounding. specifically, we compared five methods: multivariable logistic regression adjustment and four propensity score methods (matching, regression adjustment, and two weighted regression adjustments). in the absence of unmeasured confounding, the first of the weighting methods estimates the treatment effect in a population whose distribution of risk factors is equal to that found in all study subjects. this method is also known as inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted (iptw) estimator <UNK> <UNK> the second weighting method estimates the treatment effect in a population whose distribution of risk factors is equal to that found in the treated study subjects only. this method is known as the standardized mortality ratio (smr)–weighted estimator <UNK> both weighting methods can be interpreted as multivariable standardization methods that use different standard populations. iptw uses as weights the inverse (estimated) propensity score, <UNK> for treated patients and the inverse of <UNK> minus the propensity score, <UNK> − ê(x)), for untreated patients. thus, iptw estimates a standardized effect measure with the total study group as the standard population <UNK> <UNK> smr-weighted analyses use as weights the value <UNK> for the treated and the propensity odds for the untreated, <UNK> − ê(x)), and estimates a standardized effect measure that considers the exposed group as the standard population <UNK> we compared the following five methods for control of confounding: multivariable-adjusted logistic regression model logistic regression analyses after matching on the propensity score in a range of <UNK> logistic regression model adjusted for the propensity score (as a linear term and as decile categories) iptw logistic regression model <UNK> <UNK> of response on treatment with the weights <UNK> for treated individuals and <UNK> − ê(x)) for untreated individuals smr-weighted logistic regression model <UNK> of the response on treatment with weights of <UNK> for treated and <UNK> − ê(x)) for untreated individuals matching procedure we matched participants who did not receive t-pa treatment to those treated with t-pa based on a range of <UNK> of the propensity score. we chose the matching range of <UNK> because it is commonly used, provides reasonable balance of the included covariates, and does not lose many treated individuals as unmatchable. we examined a closer matching range <UNK> and did not find results that were meaningfully different from those reported below. to match participants, we used an automated matching procedure in the sas software that randomly selected a treated individual and randomly selected an untreated individual (comparator) from the pool of potential comparators to determine whether he or she fulfilled the matching criterion. if the selected comparator was eligible, he or she was matched to the treated individual, and the pair was removed. this procedure was repeated until all treated patients were matched to one comparator or until no further comparators fulfilled the matching criteria. weighted models for both weighting methods, we used sas's genmod procedure with a logit link to weight participants and empirical (i.e., robust or sandwich) standard error estimation to calculate the <UNK> percent confidence intervals. since our logistic model is saturated, estimates and standard errors based on our weights will be identical to those based on stabilized weights <UNK> here, we additionally report the nonparametric <UNK> percent confidence interval for the iptw analysis based on <UNK> bootstrap samples drawn with replacement from the study population. for the unweighted multivariable-adjusted outcome models, we considered the same set of covariates as those considered in the logistic regression model to calculate the propensity score, including the interaction terms mentioned previously. we evaluated whether the odds ratio between t-pa and death was modified by the propensity score. to do so, we compared a logistic model containing indicator variables for t-pa treatment and propensity score quintiles with a model that also included indicator variables for the product of t-pa and propensity score quintiles with a <UNK> likelihood ratio test. results the <UNK> centers included in this analysis submitted usable data on

t-pa treatment were younger, more often had hemiplegia and aphasia, had more severe stroke symptoms as measured by the rankin scale, were more likely to report a history of atrial fibrillation, were

using data on t-pa treatment and mortality from a regional stroke registry, we found that five different methods to control for confounding yielded extremely different treatment effect estimates, ranging from estimated odds ratios of <UNK> <UNK> percent ci: <UNK> <UNK> for the smr-weighted estimator to <UNK> <UNK> percent ci: <UNK> <UNK> for the iptw estimator. randomized clinical trials showed no significant effect of t-pa treatment on death among patients with ischemic stroke <UNK> in a cumulative meta-analysis of several randomized trials, the pooled relative risk estimate for death due to t-pa treatment was <UNK> <UNK> percent ci: <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the smr-weighted estimate and the propensity-matched estimate did not differ significantly from the null value and were very close to the risk estimates obtained from the randomized trials. the effect estimates from outcome models that included the propensity score depended on incorporation of the score. when the score was included as a linear term, no statistically significant association was found. in contrast, all other methods suggested increased risk of in-hospital mortality. we now argue that the variation we observed in effect estimates cannot be ascribed to the small numbers of subjects in the low-propensity strata and the variability of the associated estimated odds ratios. furthermore, we argue that this variation does not prove or even suggest that any one of the five methods is superior for controlling confounding. the analyses reported in table <UNK> instead answer different questions implicit or explicit in the adjustment method. in the absence of unmeasured confounding, the smr-weighted method estimates the average treatment effect in a population whose distribution of risk factors is equal to that for the t-pa-treated patients only <UNK> as shown in table <UNK> most of the treated patients were in the propensity strata with a low associated risk of death and had an empirical odds ratio of less than <UNK> so it is not surprising that the smr-weighted odds ratio was <UNK> in contrast, iptw estimates the average effect of treatment in the entire study population, that is, for patients who were and were not treated with t-pa. given that <UNK> percent of the entire study population was in the three propensity strata associated with high empirical odds ratios (table <UNK> it is not surprising that the iptw estimate is <UNK> similarly, it is no surprise that the iptw estimate decreases to <UNK> when the patients in these three strata were excluded by restricting the analysis to the subpopulation of treated and untreated patients whose propensity scores were greater than or equal to <UNK> indeed, in the subpopulations dominated by patients whose propensity scores were high, the estimated treatment effect is approximately <UNK> thus, limiting our study population to patients whose propensity scores were greater than or equal to <UNK> produced roughly comparable estimates for all methods, none of which differed significantly from <UNK> and from the results of the randomized trials. when, as in the present example, the number of untreated subjects is many times larger than the number of treated subjects, propensity score matching will typically result in all or nearly all treated patients being successfully matched, while many untreated patients will remain unmatched and be excluded from the analysis (which may lead to slightly reduced efficiency). as a result, the distribution of covariates in the (successfully) matched subpopulation will be close to that in the treated study population. thus, it is no surprise that the propensity-matched estimate is very close to the smr-weighted estimate. although the smr-weighted and matched propensity analyses gave similar results in this particular data set, the smr-weighted analysis has the theoretical advantages that <UNK> data from all patients are used, and <UNK> it is not affected by further uncontrolled confounding attributable to the inability to find an exact match for each treated subject <UNK> in the present study, as in most studies of adverse drug effects, the death rate was low, and the ratio of untreated to treated subjects was large. here, there was also strong and statistically significant effect modification. under such circumstances, the estimated treatment effect from a logistic model that includes only the treatment indicator and the estimated propensity score (as decile indicators or continuous) is largely driven by the magnitude of the treatment effect in propensity strata with the greatest number of treated patients who died. the propensity stratum with the most treated deaths (n = <UNK> had an empirical odds ratio of <UNK> (table <UNK> furthermore, among patients treated with t-pa, the fraction <UNK> = <UNK> percent) of all deaths that occurred in the three propensity strata with large empirical odds ratios exceeded the fraction <UNK> = <UNK> percent) of all nondeaths that occurred in these strata. thus, it is no surprise that the estimate from the logistic model adjusted for the propensity score would somewhat exceed the smr-weighted estimate, as confirmed by our results. adjustment for covariates in addition to the propensity score made little difference. data sets in which a much larger untreated population has a strikingly different risk factor distribution than a small treated population are common in observational studies of drug effects. in such studies, the low-propensity strata are composed of those members of the population for whom most physicians regard treatment as inappropriate, and such patients would not meet the inclusion criteria of randomized clinical trials. the smr-weighted and the propensity-matched estimates most closely approached results observed in the clinical trials that evaluated the association of t-pa treatment in ischemic stroke patients <UNK> presumably, this finding reflects a focus in these analyses on individuals who would have been eligible to participate in clinical trials on the basis of their characteristics. restriction to persons whose propensity scores are greater than or equal to <UNK> focuses even more sharply on this target population. however, the similarity of the result obtained with the smr-weighted and propensity score–matched analyses to the results of the randomized trials should not be taken as evidence that, compared with other multivariable outcome models, these two methods are a better tool to adjust for covariates in observational research. indeed, once we restricted the analysis to subjects whose propensity score exceeded <UNK> all adjustment methods gave fairly similar results. in addition, in most studies in the literature, the effect estimates from multivariable regression models were quite close to the effect estimates derived from various implementations of the propensity score, as long as the number of outcome events was much larger than the number of potential confounders <UNK> <UNK> an apparent advantage in using the propensity score, however, may be that the strong effect modification in this clinical example is very obvious across propensity score strata, as shown in table <UNK> this effect modification may be difficult to unveil when evaluating individual risk factors. a caution with regard to the use of weighted methods is that they can perform poorly when the weights for a few subjects are very large. although some partial approximate fixes have been described <UNK> <UNK> there is no perfect solution for this problem. these few large weights imply that the population parameter estimated by the weighted method (e.g., the average effect of treatment in the entire population for the iptw method) cannot be accurately derived from the data in the absence of additional a priori assumptions. in this setting, the estimated standard-error-of-treatment effect, whether based on a robust variance estimator or the bootstrap, may underestimate the true difference between the weighted estimator and the population parameter it estimates. with respect to this particular clinical example, two possible explanations should be considered for the high odds ratios found for the three low-propensity strata. first, the time period covered in our study began when t-pa treatment for patients with ischemic stroke was officially approved in germany (august <UNK> and thus reflects first experiences with t-pa treatment. initiation of t-pa treatment for patients who had low propensities for this therapy may represent a last-ditch effort to salvage patients characterized by unrecorded situation-specific and individual risk factors. with this explanation, the high odds ratios in the low-propensity strata were due to unmeasured confounders (e.g., presence of extreme severity, physician or family attitudes) not recorded for data analysis. a second possibility is that patients who had a low propensity for treatment may have had contraindications to t-pa based on their recorded values for some covariates in the database. in that case, the high odds ratio for these patients would be solely attributable to effect modification by these covariates and not to confounding. seen in this light, the iptw analysis gives at best (i.e., when the effect-modification rather than the confounding explanation is the case) the “right” answer to the possibly “wrong” question: what would be the effect of giving t-pa to every patient with an acute ischemic stroke? that question would be wrong if prior knowledge had already ruled out administering t-pa to subjects with certain contraindications. on the other hand, to develop new indications for treatment or to conduct surveillance of the appropriateness of the current indications and protocol, the effect of t-pa treatment in patients whose propensity scores are low may be of importance. it remains to be specified which factors are associated with increased risk of death for patients with a low propensity for t-pa treatment. little clinical experience with t-pa may be one of these factors, as suggested by some studies <UNK> <UNK> in summary, in the setting of a nonuniform treatment effect across covariate or propensity-score levels, much of the difference between the adjustment strategies resulted from explicitly or implicitly incorporating low-propensity patients, who were uncommon in the treated group, common in the untreated group, and radically different from other patients with respect to treatment-associated risk of death. high levels of nonuniform treatment effect render summary estimates very sensitive to the weighting system explicit or implicit in an adjustment technique. the divergent results conceivably may all be correct but are answers to different questions. the researcher needs to be clear as to the population for which an overall treatment estimate is most

abstract background— there is clear evidence from numerous randomized trials and their meta-analyses that aspirin reduces risks of first myocardial infarction (mi). recent data also suggest that other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) may interfere with this benefit of aspirin. methods and results— we performed subgroup analysis from a <UNK> randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of <UNK> mg aspirin on alternate days among <UNK> <UNK> apparently healthy us male physicians with prospective observational data on use of nsaids. a total of <UNK> mis were confirmed, <UNK> in the aspirin group and <UNK> in the placebo group. aspirin conferred a statistical extreme <UNK> <UNK> reduction in risk of first mi. among participants randomized to aspirin, use of nsaids on <UNK> to <UNK> d/y was not associated with mi (multivariable adjusted relative risk [rr], <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval [ci], <UNK> to <UNK> whereas the use of nsaids on <UNK> d/y was associated with mi (rr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> compared with no use of nsaids. in the placebo group, the rrs for mi across the same categories of nsaid use were <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> conclusions— these data suggest that regular but not intermittent use of nsaids inhibits the clinical benefits of aspirin. chance, bias, and confounding remain plausible alternative explanations, despite the prospective design and adjustment for covariates. nonetheless, we believe the most plausible interpretation of the data to be that regular but not intermittent use of nsaids inhibits the clinical benefit of aspirin on first mi. the clinical benefits of aspirin in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and primary prevention of myocardial infarction (mi) have been shown in numerous <UNK> the most plausible mechanism by which aspirin prevents ischemic events is by irreversible inhibition of the isoenzyme <UNK> <UNK> in the united states, nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are commonly <UNK> for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects. these effects result primarily from inhibition of <UNK> and reduced prostaglandin production. nonselective nsaids also inhibit <UNK> unlike aspirin, nsaids bind reversibly at the active site of the isoenzyme, leading to impaired platelet function for only a portion of the dosing <UNK> aspirin and nsaids share a common docking site on <UNK> raising the potential for a competitive interaction between the two. a recent crossover study in healthy <UNK> and an observational study of concomitant administration of aspirin and ibuprofen on cardiovascular <UNK> in secondary prevention support this hypothesis. in this article, we investigate whether nsaids inhibit the clinical benefit of aspirin on first mi among <UNK> <UNK> apparently healthy male us physicians. methods study subjects were participants in the physicians’ health study (phs), a completed randomized trial of aspirin and β-carotene in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. the methods and results of the phs have been described in detail <UNK> in brief, <UNK> <UNK> apparently healthy male physicians, <UNK> to <UNK> years old at entry, without a previous history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other major illnesses were randomized to either aspirin <UNK> mg every other day as bufferin, supplied by bristol-myers products), β-carotene <UNK> mg every other day as lurotin, supplied by basf ag), both active agents, or both placebos. baseline information was collected by mailed questionnaires that asked about many demographic, medical history, and lifestyle variables. follow-up questionnaires were sent to participants at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> months after randomization asking about newly diagnosed medical conditions, including mi, study compliance, medication use, and health behaviors during the study period. this study includes randomized data on aspirin from the beginning of the trial in <UNK> to january <UNK> <UNK> the date the blinded aspirin component was terminated early, primarily because of the emergence of a statistically extreme <UNK> <UNK> reduction in risk of first <UNK> at that time, participants had been followed for an average of <UNK> months; <UNK> were still providing information on morbidity, and mortality follow-up was <UNK> complete. information on aspirin and nsaid use we classified participants into aspirin <UNK> mg every other day) and placebo users according to the original randomized aspirin treatment assignment. compliance with randomized treatment was identical for the aspirin and placebo <UNK> observational data on nsaids were collected on baseline and follow-up questionnaires. participants were asked, “on how many of the past <UNK> days did you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents other than aspirin?” from this information, we calculated the number of days per year on which nonaspirin nsaids were ingested. we categorized participants who reported use of nsaids into <UNK> groups: no use, intermittent use <UNK> to <UNK> d/y), and regular use <UNK> d/y) for each follow-up questionnaire. to reduce confounding by indication, information about nsaid use was obtained before mi occurrence. in a sensitivity analysis, we also evaluated nsaid intake categories of none, <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> d/y. if information on nsaid use on a follow-up questionnaire was missing, we used the most recent information. documentation of mi we included only first nonfatal or fatal mi, defined according to the criteria of the world health <UNK> when a participant or next of kin reported an mi, written consent for the review of his medical record was obtained. self-reported mi was confirmed only after review of the appropriate medical record by an end-points committee blinded to aspirin treatment assignment and unaware of the nsaid hypothesis. statistical analysis we used the general linear models procedure (sas version <UNK> sas institute) to compare continuous measurements adjusted for age. we compared categorical variables adjusted for age using direct standardization. we used time-varying cox proportional hazards <UNK> to analyze the association between aspirin, placebo, and nsaid use and mi. person-time was calculated from the return of the baseline questionnaire until the date of the mi, date of death, or the study’s end, whichever occurred first. we ran separate models in the aspirin and placebo groups. in addition, we evaluated the effect of aspirin, placebo, and nsaids in the entire phs cohort using indicator variables for use of aspirin or placebo according to nsaid categories. we calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios as a measure for the relative risk (rr) and the corresponding <UNK> confidence intervals (cis). we built <UNK> multivariable regression models. the first controlled for variables considered to be potential confounders of the association between nsaid use and mi. this model controlled for age (in <UNK> increments), history of arthritis at baseline, exercise <UNK> time/mo, <UNK> time/mo to <UNK> times/wk, <UNK> times/wk), body mass index (continuous), history of smoking (never, past, current), and randomized β-carotene assignment. the second multivariable model also controlled for other major risk factors for mi, including baseline information on history of hypertension (defined as self-reported systolic blood pressure <UNK> mm hg, diastolic blood pressure <UNK> mm hg, or antihypertensive medication regardless of blood pressure), history of diabetes, and parental history of mi before age <UNK> years. to evaluate whether nsaid use inhibited the clinical benefit of aspirin on first mi, we compared the likelihood of the regression model containing only the main effects of aspirin and nsaids with the likelihood of the regression model that also included the interaction of aspirin and nsaids using the likelihood-ratio test. results during a mean follow-up of <UNK> years, a total of <UNK> mis were confirmed: <UNK> in the aspirin group and <UNK> in the placebo group (rr, <UNK> <UNK>

included <UNK> additional confirmed mi cases that occurred before the randomized aspirin arm was terminated but that were not confirmed by the end-points committee before the data set was closed for the final report of the aspirin <UNK> six of these cases occurred in the aspirin arm and <UNK> in the placebo arm. the results were quite similar to the primary analysis. among participants randomized to aspirin, the multivariable-adjusted rrs of mi were <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for nsaid use on <UNK> to <UNK> d/y and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for nsaid use on <UNK> d/y compared with no

additional adjustment for risk factors for mi did not attenuate the rr associated with aspirin and regular nsaid use. discussion in subgroup analyses of data from a large randomized trial, we found a <UNK> increased risk of mi among participants randomized to aspirin who also took other nsaids on <UNK> d/y. participants randomized to placebo who used nsaids regularly had a nonsignificantly reduced risk of mi. these results are compatible with the possibility that nsaids inhibit the clinical benefits of aspirin on first mi. we found no association between intermittent use of nsaids (between <UNK> and <UNK> d/y) and subsequent development of mi among aspirin or placebo users. aspirin reduces the incidence of first and recurrent <UNK> by its ability to irreversibly block <UNK> this inhibits production of thromboxane <UNK> and thus increases platelet <UNK> this effect lasts for the lifetime of the platelet. nonselective nsaids also inhibit platelet activity of <UNK> but this effect does not persist throughout the dosing <UNK> aspirin and nsaids share a common docking site on <UNK> providing the possibility of competitive interaction. basic research <UNK> a crossover study in healthy <UNK> and <UNK> observational <UNK> support this hypothesis. in the crossover study by catella-lawson et <UNK> concomitant administration of <UNK> mg ibuprofen every morning antagonized the irreversible platelet inhibition of <UNK> induced by <UNK> mg aspirin. this inhibition could be bypassed, such as when aspirin was given before a single dose of ibuprofen. intake of enteric-coated ibuprofen <UNK> times/d inhibited the effect of aspirin on platelets, even when the aspirin was taken before the ibuprofen. no interaction was found between concomitant intake of aspirin and rofecoxib, acetaminophen, or diclofenac. a recent observational study of secondary prevention by macdonald and <UNK> identified <UNK> patients from scotland who were discharged after first admission for cardiovascular diseases and followed them up for <UNK> years. four discharge groups were compared: low-dose <UNK> mg) aspirin alone, aspirin plus ibuprofen, aspirin plus diclofenac, and aspirin plus another nsaid. compared with users of aspirin alone, those also using ibuprofen had a relative risk of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for cardiovascular mortality. combined use of aspirin and diclofenac or other nsaids did not increase the risk. although the authors could control for several potential confounding factors, the nature of their data did not allow them to control for lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise. the strengths of our study include the large number of endpoints and participants, randomized data on aspirin use, prospectively collected data on nsaid use, and confirmation of mi by medical record review. we incorporated change of nsaid use over time in our analyses, and we could differentiate between the effects of intermittent and regular nsaid use. we performed sensitivity analyses on a different nsaid use cutoff and included mi events that occurred before the end of the study but could not be included in the final report of the aspirin arm of the <UNK> both sensitivity analyses led to similar results. furthermore, the phs study population was relatively homogeneous, which reduces confounding by several variables, including access to medical care, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status. our study has several limitations. in contrast to the randomized data on aspirin, the data on nsaid use were observational. thus, bias and confounding are plausible alternative explanations for the findings, although this is limited by the prospective method of data collection and adjustment for a large number of covariates. in addition, all post hoc subgroup findings raise the possibility of chance as a plausible alternative explanation, a concern mitigated by the mechanistic plausibility of the hypothesis of competitive interaction between aspirin and nsaids. we had no information on the brand and dosage of the nsaids used and thus can give only average effects over all nsaids. during the study period, however, ibuprofen was a widely used nonaspirin nsaid in the us <UNK> because the study participants were apparently healthy at baseline, relatively few used nsaids regularly. in addition, few mis occurred in the exposed groups. this is reflected by the wide range of the cis around the relative risks. thus, these relative risks should be interpreted with caution. biological plausibility must also be taken into account. this is particularly true for the relative risks in the placebo and high nsaid-intake group, in which only <UNK> mi occurred. although some controversy exists regarding a possible cardioprotective effect of the nonselective nsaid <UNK> an overall cardioprotective effect of nsaids is not <UNK> another limitation to the generalizability of our findings involves the nature of the cohort, which included only male us physicians, <UNK> of whom were caucasian. we have no reason to believe, however, that the study population and the general population differ with respect to the mechanism by which aspirin and nsaids may interact. the data on all covariates were collected by self-administered questionnaires. although physicians are likely to provide health-related information <UNK> random misclassification is plausible. in summary, these randomized data on aspirin use and prospective observational subgroup data on nsaid use over a mean follow-up period of <UNK> years are compatible with the possibility that regular but not intermittent use of nsaids inhibits the clinical benefits of aspirin on first mi.

abstract background— obesity is an escalating pandemic in the united states, and its association with coronary heart disease is well understood. several studies have found positive associations between body mass index (bmi) and stroke in men, but the association with stroke and its subtypes is less clear in women. methods and results— this was a prospective cohort study among <UNK> <UNK> women participating in the women’s health study. bmi was measured as self-reported weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared. incident stroke was self-reported and confirmed by medical record review. we used the cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the association between bmi and stroke. after a mean follow-up of <UNK> years, a total of <UNK> strokes <UNK> ischemic, <UNK> hemorrhagic, and <UNK> undefined) occurred. we found a statistically significant trend for increased risk of total and ischemic stroke across <UNK> bmi categories. with world health organization criteria, women who were obese (bmi <UNK> <UNK> had hazard ratios of <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> for total stroke, <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> for ischemic stroke, and <UNK> <UNK> ci <UNK> to <UNK> for hemorrhagic stroke compared with women with bmi <UNK> <UNK> additional control for history of hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol substantially attenuated the hazard ratios for total and ischemic stroke. there was no effect modification for age, exercise, or smoking. conclusions— in this large prospective cohort study among women, bmi was a strong risk factor for total and ischemic stroke but not for hemorrhagic stroke. the association was highly mediated by hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol. overweight and obesity represent an emerging threat to public <UNK> affecting nearly <UNK> million adults in the united states <UNK> in addition, and perhaps more worrisome, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than doubled over the last

addition, the association between body mass index (bmi) and hemorrhagic stroke is less <UNK> stroke remains a leading cause of severe disability and premature death in the united states and other western countries. effective therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke only are used in a small number of <UNK> and do not help to completely reverse the impaired function of affected brain areas. thus, the identification of modifiable lifestyle factors remains critical for stroke prevention. we aimed to evaluate the association between bmi and total stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke in more than <UNK> <UNK> apparently healthy female health professionals participating in the women’s health study (whs). methods participants study individuals were all participants in the whs, a recently completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that tested the benefits and risks of low-dose aspirin and vitamin e in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among apparently healthy women. the design and methods of the whs have been described in detail <UNK> briefly, a total of <UNK> <UNK> us female health professionals aged <UNK> years or older at baseline in beginning of <UNK> and without a history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other major illnesses were randomly assigned to <UNK> of <UNK> treatment groups: active aspirin <UNK> mg on alternate days), active vitamin e <UNK> iu on alternate days), both active agents, or both placebos. baseline information was self-reported and was collected by a mailed questionnaire that asked about a large number of cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle variables. twice in the first year and annually thereafter, participants were sent follow-up questionnaires that asked about study compliance, study outcomes (including stroke), personal characteristics, medical history, and health habits during the study period. for the present analysis, we included follow-up information from the time of randomization through march <UNK> <UNK> as of this date, follow-up was <UNK> complete. the institutional review board of the brigham and women’s hospital approved the study. assessment of bmi participants reported their height and weight on the baseline questionnaire. on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> questionnaires, participants were asked again to report their weight, and on the <UNK> and <UNK> questionnaires, they were asked to report their height again. bmi was calculated as self-reported weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared <UNK> we used the baseline height information to calculate bmi for all but the <UNK> and <UNK> time points. we categorized bmi into a priori categories of <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> we further evaluated bmi on the basis of the world health organization (who) categories of <UNK> (normal weight), <UNK> to <UNK> (overweight), and <UNK> <UNK> (obese), as well as a continuous term. ascertainment of stroke participants who reported a stroke on a follow-up questionnaire were asked for permission to review their medical records. a diagnosis of stroke was confirmed only after review of the medical records by an end points committee of physicians that included a neurologist. a nonfatal stroke was defined as a focal neurological deficit of sudden onset and vascular mechanism that lasted <UNK> hours. cases of fatal stroke were documented by evidence of a cerebrovascular mechanism obtained from all available sources, including death certificates and hospital records. stroke was classified according to the criteria established by the national survey of <UNK> as ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and unknown subtype. the interobserver agreement of the classification of stroke and its major subtypes in the whs was <UNK> statistical analysis of the <UNK> <UNK> randomized participants, we excluded <UNK> women with missing information on weight or height on the baseline questionnaire. we additionally excluded <UNK> participants who reported a stroke before the receipt of the baseline questionnaire, which left a total of <UNK> <UNK> women for the present study. we compared the characteristics of participants with respect to baseline bmi categories using direct standardization to adjust categorical variables for age in <UNK> increments. we used the cox proportional hazards <UNK> to analyze the association between bmi and the incidence of stroke. we calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) and their <UNK> cis for total (including ischemic, hemorrhagic, and undefined stroke cases), ischemic, and hemorrhagic (including subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage) strokes. we made a distinction in the multivariable models between variables that were considered potential confounders and those considered potential biological intermediate variables in the association between bmi and stroke risk. in the first multivariable model (model <UNK> we controlled for age (quadratic term), alcohol consumption <UNK> drink per week, <UNK> to <UNK> drinks per week, <UNK> drink per day), smoking (never, past, current <UNK> cigarettes per day, current <UNK> cigarettes per day), physical activity <UNK> time per week, <UNK> to <UNK> times per week, <UNK> times per week), and postmenopausal hormone use. we considered other potential confounding variables including ethnicity, oral contraceptive use, and education, which did not lead to substantially different results. we then considered <UNK> potential biological mediators: history of hypertension (defined as self-reported systolic blood pressure of <UNK> mm hg or diastolic blood pressure <UNK> mm hg, or report of diagnosis of hypertension by a physician), history of diabetes, and history of elevated cholesterol <UNK> mg/dl). in the second multivariable model (model <UNK> we controlled for all variables in model <UNK> plus hypertension at baseline. in the third model, we then additionally controlled for history of diabetes and elevated cholesterol at baseline. we decided a priori not to control for randomized treatment assignment. because randomization in this large trial was <UNK> randomized treatment assignment is not associated with bmi. consequently, by definition, randomized treatment assignment cannot be a confounder of the association between bmi and stroke. our primary analysis was to evaluate the association between baseline bmi and risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. as a secondary approach, we updated the information on bmi by incorporating weight change over time. we evaluated effect modification by age <UNK> versus <UNK> years), exercise frequency <UNK> times per week versus <UNK> times per week), and smoking status (current versus never/past). we used the likelihood ratio test to test for statistical significance. all probability values were <UNK> tailed, and we considered <UNK> as statistically significant. results after a mean of <UNK> years of follow-up <UNK> <UNK> person-years), a total of <UNK> strokes occurred among the <UNK> <UNK>

<UNK> had a <UNK> increase in the risk of total stroke and an almost <UNK> increase in the risk of ischemic stroke compared with women with bmi <UNK> <UNK> when who criteria were used, women who were

total and ischemic stroke was strongly mediated by history of hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol. the association between bmi and stroke was not modified by age, smoking status, or

the nurses’ health study showed similar associations as in the present study and found a <UNK> increase in the risk of ischemic stroke and <UNK> increase in the risk for total stroke among women with bmi <UNK> <UNK> compared with women with bmi <UNK> <UNK> as in the present study, inclusion of hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol led to substantial attenuation of the risk estimates. there was also a suggestion of an inverse association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke that also did not reach statistical significance. similar to the present findings, the highest risk for hemorrhagic stroke was seen among women in the leanest bmi category. the study further evaluated weight change and found increased risk for total and ischemic stroke but not for hemorrhagic stroke among women who gained <UNK> <UNK> studies that found no association between obesity and stroke may have been limited by small <UNK> or may have controlled for the potential biological mediator of <UNK> in men, a number of studies support an association between bmi and increased risk of <UNK> a recent population-based study from göteborg, sweden, found a <UNK> increase in the risk for total, ischemic, and undetermined stroke for men with bmi <UNK> <UNK> compared with men with bmi of <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> no association was observed between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke. because that study showed a strong association between bmi and undetermined stroke, it is possible that some of these cases were in fact hemorrhagic strokes and that the association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke was thus underestimated. data from the physicians’ health study showed a significant increase in the risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke with increasing <UNK> men with bmi <UNK> <UNK> had a <UNK> risk increase for all stroke types. in both studies, the increased risk for total and ischemic stroke, although attenuated, remained statistically significant when additionally controlled for hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol. the association between obesity and hemorrhagic stroke remains unclear. the present study is consistent with findings of others that showed an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke among the <UNK> other studies, however, found no <UNK> or an increased risk with increasing <UNK> the fact that the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke is higher in asian populations has led to the hypothesis that low cholesterol, in addition to lean body weight, may be associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic <UNK> the low numbers of hemorrhagic strokes in most of the studies may explain in part the uncertainty with regard to the association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke. future studies are needed to determine whether lean bmi and/or low cholesterol or other factors are important contributors to hemorrhagic stroke. there is an ongoing discussion about the best measure of obesity for stroke <UNK> a report from the northern manhattan stroke study suggested that abdominal obesity, as measured by the waist-to-hip ratio, was a stronger predictor than bmi and had a greater effect among younger <UNK> in that study, however, obesity was evaluated at the time of the stroke, which may indicate that abdominal obesity may be a better short-term predictor than bmi. nevertheless, obesity is a strong risk factor for total and ischemic stroke regardless of the measure used. whether more detailed information on body fat distribution will lead to better prediction of stroke currently remains unclear. obesity is a strong risk factor for the development of <UNK> <UNK> and elevated <UNK> in virtually all studies that have evaluated the association between obesity and ischemic stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol were biological <UNK> this, however, should not downplay the importance of obesity as a primary risk factor for stroke. to the contrary, because obesity has such a strong influence on hypertension and diabetes, obesity may be the biggest overall contributor to stroke occurrence. in some studies, a statistically significant excess risk for stroke remained even after controlling for hypertension, diabetes, and elevated <UNK> in a recent large, population-based study from malmö, sweden among normotensive men and women, bmi was a statistically significant and independent predictor for <UNK> furthermore, the risks of excessive body fat for stroke can be obscured by a history of cigarette smoking and thinness associated with deteriorating <UNK> in addition to the established mechanisms by which bmi affects stroke risk such as hypertension and diabetes, other mechanisms may be associated with the increased risk. some investigators have proposed that an increase in prothrombotic factors observed among overweight and obese individuals may contribute to their increased risk for ischemic <UNK> increased levels of c-reactive protein in overweight and obese <UNK> may also play a role in their increased risk of <UNK> because an association between increased levels of inflammatory markers and risk of ischemic stroke has been <UNK> however, the biological interrelationship between obesity, inflammatory markers, and ischemic stroke risk has yet to be determined. the present study has several strengths, including the prospective method of data collection, the large size of the study population, the large number of incident strokes, the high rate and length of follow-up, and the homogeneous nature of whs participants, which reduces potential confounding by access to medical care and other socioeconomic factors. on each of the follow-up questionnaires, whs participants were asked specifically about stroke and transient ischemic attacks. because stroke was a major end point of the whs trial, all efforts were made to obtain the relevant medical records, and an experienced end points committee confirmed stroke cases only after review of these records. in addition, the interobserver agreement in the classification of stroke was <UNK> we further ran several different models, including time-varying models, to update the most recent exposure information, used different cutpoints of bmi, and evaluated potential biological mediators and effect modifiers. several limitations should be considered when evaluating the present results. first, information on body weight and height, as well as on all potential confounders, was self-reported, and thus nondifferential misclassification is possible. participants of the whs, however, were all health professionals, who are known to accurately report information regarding lifestyle factors and health status. specifically, self-reported and directed measured weight were highly correlated <UNK> in another comparable cohort of female health <UNK> in addition, nondifferential misclassification in a prospective study most likely would lead to an underestimation of the association between bmi and stroke. we have no reason to believe that a significant number of participants did not report a stroke event and particularly no reasoning that such potential underreporting would be differential with regard to bmi status. second, because participants in the whs were all health professionals who participated in a randomized trial, and the vast majority <UNK> of them were white, the present results may not necessarily be extrapolated to other populations; however, we have no a priori basis for believing that the biological mechanisms by which bmi may lead to stroke differ in the whs cohort compared with other populations. in addition, the relative measures of effect for a wide variety of cardiovascular risk factors have been similar to those seen in other studies. because women participating in the whs were somewhat leaner than the general population, we may have underestimated the risk of heavier populations. finally, as with all observational studies, residual and unmeasured confounding remains an alternative explanation for our findings, despite adjustment for many potential confounders. in conclusion, our study indicates that obesity is associated with increased risk of total and ischemic stroke. this was not modified by age, smoking, or exercise and was strongly mediated by hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol, which may be biological intermediates of the obesity–stroke association. the association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke remains less clear. preventing obesity may lead to a substantial reduction of total and ischemic stroke occurrence.

abstract background and purpose— smoking is an established risk factor for ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah), but the impact of smoking on intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) is less clear. methods— prospective cohort study among <UNK> <UNK> us male physicians participating in the physicians’ health study. incidence of stroke was measured by self-report and confirmed by medical record review. we used cox proportional-hazards models to evaluate the association of smoking with risk of total hemorrhagic stroke, ich, and sah. we categorized smoking into <UNK> groups: never, past, or current smokers of <UNK> or of <UNK> cigarettes per day. results— during <UNK> years of follow-up, <UNK> ichs and <UNK> sahs occurred. never smokers and past smokers had equal rates of ich and sah. current smokers of <UNK> cigarettes per day had multivariable-adjusted relative risks of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for total hemorrhagic stroke, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for ich, and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for sah when compared with never smokers. current smokers of <UNK> cigarettes had relative risks of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for total hemorrhagic stroke, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for ich, and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for sah when compared with never smokers. conclusions— this prospective study suggests an increased risk of total hemorrhagic stroke, ich, and sah in current cigarette smokers with a graded increase in risk that depended on how many cigarettes were smoked. the effect of smoking on ich is of about the same magnitude as the effect of smoking on ischemic stroke. our results add to the multiple health benefits that can be accrued by abstaining from cigarette smoking. hemorrhagic stroke accounts for <UNK> of all stroke cases, and the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) is at least twice that of <UNK> despite attempts to improve its prognosis by medical or neurosurgical treatments, hemorrhagic stroke has high long-term disability and a mortality of <UNK> to <UNK> hence, identification and prevention of modifiable risk factors such as smoking remain of great importance. cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for ischemic <UNK> and subarachnoid hemorrhage <UNK> however, the association between smoking and ich remains <UNK> one study found a positive <UNK> another found an inverse <UNK> and most of the remaining studies showed no significant association between cigarette smoking and <UNK> the physicians’ health study <UNK> provided the opportunity to assess prospectively the association between smoking and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke and its subtypes among <UNK> <UNK> us male physicians <UNK> to <UNK> years of age at entry over a time period of <UNK> years of follow-up. methods study subjects were all participants of the phs, a completed randomized trial of aspirin and beta carotene in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and <UNK> briefly, the entire study population consisted of <UNK> <UNK> apparently healthy male physicians with no history of cardiovascular disease, cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), or other major illnesses who began participation in <UNK> after the scheduled end of the phs in <UNK> participants were followed up until march <UNK> which is the date of inclusion of data used for our analyses. morbidity and mortality data were available for <UNK> of the study participants. baseline information was self-reported and collected by a mailed questionnaire that asked about many demographic, medical history, and lifestyle variables, including information about usual alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and exercise. every <UNK> months for the first year and annually thereafter, participants were sent follow-up questionnaires asking about study compliance, medical history (including stroke), and health behaviors during the study period. evaluation of smoking status in the baseline and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> questionnaires, participants were asked about their smoking habits, including information about the amount of cigarettes smoked. with this information, we categorized smoking into never, past, or current. current smoking was further categorized into <UNK> and <UNK> cigarettes per day. this categorization was used for each of the <UNK> assessments. the <UNK> participants for whom information on smoking status was missing were not included in the analyses. baseline information on the amount of cigarettes smoked was missing for <UNK> of the current smokers. however, because this information became available at follow-up, they were included in the analyses. evaluation of stroke cases all incident nonfatal and fatal stroke cases that occurred during the study period were considered for this analysis. participants who reported stroke on a questionnaire were asked permission to review their medical records. the end points committee confirmed a diagnosis of stroke only after review of the medical records and results of laboratory tests. a stroke was defined as a focal neurological deficit of sudden onset and vascular mechanism lasting <UNK> hours. stroke was classified according to the criteria established by the national survey of <UNK> into ischemic, hemorrhagic, and unknown subtype. hemorrhagic stroke was further classified into ich or sah. stroke classification was performed on the basis of medical records, reports of brain imaging, and the judgment of the neurologist on the end points committee. hemorrhagic strokes that directly followed an intervention or procedure <UNK> or occurred under anticoagulant treatment <UNK> were not considered primary hemorrhagic stroke cases and were excluded from analysis. cases of fatal stroke were documented by evidence of a cerebrovascular mechanism obtained from all available sources, including hospital records and death certificates. the interrater agreement in the classification of major stroke types and hemorrhagic subtypes was excellent over the entire study <UNK> at follow-up, <UNK> participants reported stroke events before randomization. these participants, as well as the <UNK> for whom information on smoking status was not available at baseline, were excluded, leaving a total sample of <UNK> <UNK> subjects for this analysis. statistical analysis we compared the characteristics of participants with respect to their smoking status using direct standardization to adjust categorical variables for age in <UNK> age groups and the general linear models procedure (sas version <UNK> sas institute) to adjust continuous baseline measurements for age. we used cox’s proportional-hazards <UNK> to evaluate the association of smoking status and incident stroke. separate models were developed for hemorrhagic stroke, ich, and sah. we additionally evaluated the association between smoking and ischemic stroke. smoking status was treated as a time-varying variable in the regression models. this approach incorporated changes in smoking habits over time. on the basis of known pathophysiological mechanisms and published findings, potential confounders were identified for inclusion in the multivariable models. a distinction was made between variables considered potential confounders and those considered intermediate steps—ie, variables suspected to be in the biological pathway between smoking and hemorrhagic stroke (body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes). however, because we wanted to measure the contribution of smoking to hemorrhagic stroke separately from the intermediate variables, analyses were performed separately with and without controlling for these variables. we calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios as a measure for the relative risk (rr) for total hemorrhagic strokes, ich, sah, and ischemic stroke. the first multivariable regression model controlled for age (continuous), alcohol consumption <UNK> drink per week, <UNK> to <UNK> drinks per week, <UNK> drink per day), exercise <UNK> or <UNK> times per week), parental history of myocardial infarction before <UNK> years of age, and randomized treatment assignment. the second multivariable regression model controlled for all factors in model <UNK> plus body mass index (continuous), hypertension (defined as self-reported systolic blood pressure of <UNK> mm hg, diastolic blood pressure <UNK> mm hg, or current treatment of hypertension regardless of blood pressure), history of diabetes, and history of elevated cholesterol <UNK> mg/dl). because only <UNK> total sah cases occurred and thus the number of variables for inclusion in the models was <UNK> we adjusted only for the most important confounders. in the first multivariable model, we adjusted only for age, exercise, and randomized treatment assignment; in the second model, we also adjusted for hypertension. we evaluated effect measure modification of smoking status by hypertension (yes, no), alcohol consumption <UNK> drink per week, <UNK> to <UNK> drinks per week, <UNK> drink per day), and age <UNK> or <UNK> years). we tested the proportionality assumption of the models and found no violation. results during a

<UNK> increase in the risk of total hemorrhagic stroke (rr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> and ich (rr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> increase in sah (rr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> compared with never smokers. the magnitude of the effect of smoking on ich is about the same as the effect of smoking on ischemic stroke (rr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> additional adjustment for potential biological mediators (body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol) did not change the observed association between smoking and any of the stroke subtypes. studies published in the <UNK> and <UNK> established smoking as a strong risk factor for ischemic <UNK> and <UNK> in contrast, the association between smoking and ich is less clear. a case-control study by gill et <UNK> showed an <UNK> increased risk of ich among male smokers compared with nonsmokers and a <UNK> increased risk for female smokers. this result, however, did not reach statistical significance, and the <UNK> cis were wide. in contrast, a study from korea by park et <UNK> showed a significant inverse association between cigarette smoking and ich. current or past smokers had a <UNK> risk reduction of ich compared with never smokers. this observation may be explained in part by the fact that the current and past smokers (and not past and never smokers) were collapsed into <UNK> group, and past smokers may have had a healthier lifestyle after they quit smoking than the average never smoker. <UNK> reported that smoking is less prevalent in ich patients compared with sah patients. because this was a case series, no effect estimate of the risk of ich among smokers could be calculated. other studies, most of them case-control studies, did not find a significantly increased risk of ich among <UNK> a recent population-based case-control study by woo et <UNK> suggested an association between smoking and specific locations of ich. in their univariate analysis, they showed that current smoking was associated with lobar ich (but not with nonlobar ich) compared with never smokers. in their multivariable models, however, this effect of smoking on lobar ich was not significant. because we did not have data on the location of ich in our cohort, we were unable to evaluate this potential association. there are several proposed mechanisms by which smoking could cause stroke. one mechanism that links smoking to ischemic stroke is structural artery wall damage and carotid <UNK> leading to thrombosis or embolic <UNK> the mechanism of thrombogenesis is a short-term effect of smoking, which includes increased fibrinogen levels and platelet <UNK> elevated hematocrit values, and reduced cerebral blood flow as a result of arterial <UNK> the role of these factors in promoting stroke in smokers is supported by the observed reduction in risk of ischemic stroke after smoking <UNK> structural damage to the arterial wall may also play a role in the development of ich and sah. for sah, there is strong evidence for an association of smoking with aneurysm <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> juvela et <UNK> showed that current smoking and recent heavy alcohol use were strong risk factors for aneurysmal sah in men and women. in addition, other factors related to the biology of cerebral aneurysms have been linked to smoking: the presence of multiple cerebral aneurysms in subjects <UNK> and <UNK> sah was highly correlated with smoking status and female sex, and the risk of formation of new aneurysms and growth of known aneurysms was strongly associated with smoking and female sex for growth of <UNK> mm and only with smoking for growth of <UNK> mm over a mean follow-up period of <UNK> years. these data provide further support for the notion that smoking relates to sah and aneurysm biology via a direct effect on the cerebral vasculature. for ich, the observed increased risk in smokers has less biological support than for sah, and the possible mechanisms for the association are at this time speculative. among potential mediators of the association between current smoking and ich, the known increase in blood <UNK> and evidence for arterial wall <UNK> in smokers may play a role in causing the rupture of small intraparenchymal arteries that cause ich. the strength of this study is that, given the large number of incident stroke cases, we had sufficient power to prospectively evaluate the association of smoking and hemorrhagic stroke subtypes. all stroke cases were confirmed by detailed medical record review, and interrater agreement in the classification of stroke was excellent over the entire study <UNK> furthermore, <UNK> of the hemorrhagic stroke cases had confirmatory imaging data, and the remaining cases were diagnosed from positive evidence from lumbar puncture and/or autopsy reports. none of the hemorrhagic cases were only self-reported with no further diagnostic evidence of ich or sah. information about smoking status and the amount of cigarettes smoked was updated during the follow-up period; thus, changes in smoking status or in the amount of cigarettes smoked could be incorporated into the analysis. there are several limitations to this study. one stems from the use of data that relate only to mostly <UNK> white male physicians. thus, extrapolation of the results to women or minority populations is only speculative. in addition, the low prevalence of current smokers in the phs may have resulted in an underestimate of the true effect of smoking on stroke. also, participants in the phs who suffered a fatal smoking-related outcome (eg, myocardial infarction) add to the underestimation of the effect of smoking on stroke. the information on all covariates, like all data in the phs, was collected by self-administered questionnaires. although physicians are likely to provide health-related information appropriately, some of the information may not be accurate. in several validation studies of other cohorts, however, self-reports of <UNK> and other cardiovascular risk factors were <UNK> because we had very few cases of sah, the effect estimate of smoking on sah is imprecise despite the fact that it was statistically significant. we had <UNK> subjects with missing information on smoking status at baseline, <UNK> of whom had a subsequent stroke; because all <UNK> stroke events were nonhemorrhagic, the missing data had no impact on the conclusions we reached on the association between smoking and hemorrhagic stroke. in summary, this prospective study with <UNK> years of follow-up and updated smoking information establishes smoking as a risk factor for ich. the effect of smoking on ich is of about the same magnitude as smoking on ischemic stroke but less powerful than smoking on sah. our results add to the multiple health benefits that can be accrued by abstaining from cigarette smoking.

abstract objectives to evaluate whether the association between migraine with aura and increased risk of cardiovascular disease is modified by vascular risk groups as measured by the framingham risk score for coronary heart disease. design prospective cohort study. setting women’s health study, united states. participants <UNK> <UNK> women who were free from cardiovascular disease at baseline with available information on the framingham risk score and migraine status. main outcome measures time to major cardiovascular disease event (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal ischaemic stroke, death from ischaemic cardiovascular disease), myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke. results at baseline, <UNK> <UNK> women reported active migraine, of whom <UNK> <UNK> reported migraine with aura. during <UNK> years of follow-up, there were <UNK> cardiovascular disease events. we stratified participants based on <UNK> year risk of coronary heart disease estimated from the framingham risk score <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> compared with women without migraine, the age adjusted hazard ratios in women with active migraine with aura were <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval <UNK> to <UNK> for major cardiovascular disease, <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> for ischaemic stroke, and <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> for myocardial infarction. when stratified by framingham risk score, the association between migraine with aura and major cardiovascular disease was strongest in the lowest risk score group. there was a diametric association pattern for ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction. compared with women without migraine, the age adjusted hazard ratios in women who reported migraine with aura in the lowest framingham risk score group were <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> for ischaemic stroke and <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> for myocardial infarction. hazard ratios in women with migraine with aura in the highest framingham risk score group were <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> for ischaemic stroke and <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> for myocardial infarction. women with migraine without aura were not at increased risk of ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction in any of the framingham risk score groups. conclusion the association between migraine with aura and cardiovascular disease varies by vascular risk status. information on history of migraine and vascular risk status might help to identify women at increased risk for specific future cardiovascular disease events. trial registration clinical trials <UNK> introduction migraine is a common primary headache disorder characterised by severe, pulsating, mostly unilateral headaches accompanied by vomiting, nausea, and autonomic dysfunctions. in the united states alone, about <UNK> of the female population and <UNK> of the male population have migraine <UNK> some people experience transient neurological symptoms before or during the headache that are most often visual, such as seeing zigzag lines or flash spots, but might also include sensory or motor symptoms. these symptoms are known as migraine aura. the pathophysiology of migraine involves the neuronal system as well as the cranial vascular <UNK> peripheral arteries can also be affected in patients with <UNK> <UNK> migraine with aura is associated with an increased risk of ischaemic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and other ischaemic vascular events, including myocardial <UNK> <UNK> it remains unclear which mechanisms link migraine with vascular events and whether the biological mechanisms leading to ischaemic stroke differ from the mechanisms leading to myocardial infarction. migraine with aura has also been associated with an unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile and increased <UNK> year predicted risk of coronary heart disease based on the framingham risk <UNK> this has led to speculation about whether the increased risk of ischaemic vascular events among patients with migraine with aura is partly caused by this increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. several observations question this hypothesis. firstly, the association between migraine and ischaemic vascular events is independent of many cardiovascular risk <UNK> <UNK> secondly, the increased risk of ischaemic stroke is more apparent among individuals without cardiovascular risk <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> or use of oral <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> a potential association between migraine and cardiovascular disease that depends on the underlying vascular risk status is important for clinicians as it might help to identify individuals at increased risk of future cardiovascular disease events. we evaluated whether the association between migraine with aura and overall and specific cardiovascular disease events differed according to vascular risk status, as measured by the framingham risk <UNK> methods study population we carried out a prospective cohort study among participants in the women’s health study, a completed trial designed to test the benefits and risks of low dose aspirin and vitamin e in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among apparently healthy women. the design and results have been described in detail <UNK> <UNK> briefly, <UNK> <UNK> us female health professionals aged <UNK> at study entry <UNK> and without a history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other major illnesses, were randomly assigned to aspirin <UNK> mg on alternate days), vitamin e <UNK> iu on alternate days), both active agents, or both placebos. baseline information was self reported and was collected by a mailed questionnaire that asked about many cerebrovascular risk factors and lifestyle variables. twice in the first year and yearly thereafter, participants were sent follow-up questionnaires asking about study outcomes, personal characteristics, medical history, and health habits. for this analysis, we included follow-up information from study entry to <UNK> march <UNK> as of this date, follow-up was <UNK> complete. before randomisation, blood samples were collected in tubes containing edta from <UNK> <UNK> participating women and stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen <UNK> samples were analysed for lipids and inflammatory biomarkers. total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and directly obtained low density lipoprotein cholesterol were assayed with reagents from roche diagnostics (basel, switzerland) and genzyme (cambridge, ma). cholesterol analyses could be performed on <UNK> <UNK> of the blood samples. assessment of migraine on the baseline questionnaire participants were asked: “have you ever had migraine headaches?” and “in the past year, have you had migraine headaches?” from this information, we categorised women into “no history of migraine” and “any history of migraine.” we also distinguished between “active migraine,” which included women with self reported migraine in the year before they completed the baseline questionnaire, and “prior migraine,” which included women who reported ever having had a migraine but none in the year before they completed the questionnaire. those participants who reported active migraine were asked about migraine specific features. in the women’s health <UNK> <UNK> we have previously shown good agreement with <UNK> international headache society (ihs) criteria for <UNK> specifically, we showed that among those who provided a blood sample and reported active migraine, over <UNK> fulfilled all but one ihs criterion (code <UNK> migrainous disorder) and over <UNK> fulfilled all ihs criteria for migraine (code <UNK> migraine without <UNK> participants who reported active migraine were further asked whether they had an “aura or any indication a migraine is coming.” responses were used to classify women who reported active migraine into active migraine with aura and active migraine without aura. framingham risk score we used the framingham risk score, which predicts the <UNK> year risk of coronary heart disease, as defined by the national cholesterol education <UNK> to classify participating women into vascular risk classes. this score assigns points for age, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, and systolic blood pressure stratified by treatment for hypertension. the points for each individual component are summed and categorised into groups of <UNK> year risk of coronary heart disease of <UNK> <UNK> points), <UNK> <UNK> points), <UNK> <UNK> points), and <UNK> <UNK> points), as in a previous report of the women’s health <UNK> outcome ascertainment all participants were followed up for the occurrence of a major ischaemic vascular event, a combined end point defined as the first of any of non-fatal ischaemic stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or ischaemic cardiovascular death. in addition, we evaluated any first myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, coronary revascularisation procedure, and angina. there were too few cases of cardiovascular death to perform meaningful stratified analyses. medical records were obtained for all reported cardiovascular end points except angina and reviewed by an end points committee of physicians. stroke was confirmed if the participant had a new focal neurological deficit of sudden onset that persisted for more than <UNK> hours and was then classified as ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or undefined, with excellent agreement between <UNK> for this report, we included only cases of ischaemic stroke and censored participants with other subtypes of stroke at the time of event. the occurrence of myocardial infarction was confirmed if symptoms met world health organization criteria and if the event was associated with abnormal levels of cardiac enzymes or abnormal results on electrocardiography. cardiovascular deaths were confirmed by autopsy reports, death certificates, medical records, and information obtained from next of kin or family members. statistical analyses of the <UNK> <UNK> women with completed blood assays, we excluded <UNK> with missing information on migraine status, <UNK> with missing information on framingham risk score, and <UNK> who reported angina before they received the baseline questionnaire, leaving <UNK> <UNK> women free from cardiovascular disease or angina at study entry for this analysis. we compared the baseline characteristics of participants, with respect to their migraine status, using analysis of covariance for continuous measurements adjusted for age. we used direct standardisation to adjust categorical variables for age in <UNK> year increments. we used multinominal logistic regression models to calculate prevalence odds ratios and <UNK> confidence intervals of the association between migraine and migraine aura status with framingham risk score categories, adjusting for age. we used age adjusted cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between migraine and migraine aura status with risks of incident cardiovascular disease or angina. we ran stratified analyses on categories of predicted <UNK> year risk of coronary heart disease based on framingham risk score <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in addition, we ran stratified analyses of the association between migraine and the various outcomes for individual components of the framingham risk score (age, systolic blood pressure, smoking, total cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol). all analyses were performed with sas version <UNK> (sas, cary, nc); p values were two tailed and <UNK> was considered significant. results of the <UNK> <UNK> participants, <UNK> <UNK> women reported any history of migraine, and <UNK> <UNK> reported active migraine (migraine in the year before the baseline questionnaire), of whom <UNK> <UNK> reported migraine aura. table <UNK> summarises the association between baseline characteristics according to migraine status. compared with women without a history of migraine, women with active migraine with aura were younger, less likely to consume alcohol, less likely to exercise regularly, and more likely to currently use hormone therapy after the menopause. women with prior migraine tended to have raised total cholesterol concentration and were more likely to currently smoke cigarettes, have higher systolic blood pressure, and to have a history of hypertension compared with the other migraine groups. mean concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol was higher among women without a history of migraine. family history of myocardial infarction was equally distributed among the migraine groups. table <UNK> age adjusted baseline characteristics in <UNK> <UNK> women according to migraine status in women’s health study.

health study view popupview inline discussion summary of findings in this large prospective cohort of women, the association between active migraine with aura and specific ischaemic vascular events differed with vascular risk status according to framingham risk score groups. the association between active migraine with aura and ischaemic stroke was apparent only among women in the lowest framingham risk score group, while the association with myocardial infarction was apparent only among women in the highest group. with regard to the individual components of the framingham risk score, this diametric pattern of association was driven by particularly increased risk of ischaemic stroke among women with active migraine with aura who were young (aged <UNK> and who had low total cholesterol concentrations. in contrast, women with active migraine with aura who had high total cholesterol concentrations had an increased risk of myocardial infarction. the association between migraine with aura and coronary revascularisation procedures was similar to the myocardial infarction finding, while our data suggest a u shaped association between migraine with aura and angina according to the framingham risk score. we have previously shown that the association between migraine with aura and cardiovascular disease in the women’s health study remains significant even after adjustment for major cardiovascular risk <UNK> the data presented here suggest that among women with migraine with aura, information on the underlying vascular risk status can help to identify women who are at particular increased risk for specific cardiovascular disease events. our data add to the growing evidence that migraine is associated with increased risk of vascular <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and that the risk of specific cardiovascular disease outcomes might depend on the presence or absence of vascular risk <UNK> <UNK> our results are of interest for general practitioners as a history of migraine in combination with information on vascular risk status, as measured by the framingham risk score, could indicate future cardiovascular disease events. this is analogous to recent work indicating that a history of pre-eclampsia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in later <UNK> our data imply that among patients with migraine, cardiovascular risk factors should be more carefully sought and controlled. results of the genetic epidemiology of migraine study suggest that migraine, particularly migraine with aura, is associated with increased likelihood of an unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile and a high framingham risk <UNK> compared with participants without migraine and predicted risk (according to the framingham risk score) for coronary heart disease of <UNK> migraineurs with aura had age and sex adjusted odds ratios of <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> for predicted risk of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> for predicted risk of <UNK> while in our study any history of migraine was also associated with increased predicted <UNK> year risk of coronary heart disease (according to the framingham risk score), this association did not differ with regard to migraine aura status. we had too few participants with very high framingham risk scores, however, to allow us to evaluate the association between migraine and <UNK> year risk prediction for coronary heart disease of <UNK> potential biological mechanisms recent studies on the pathophysiology of migraine suggest that migraine can also be viewed in part as a systemic disorder that is affecting the vasculature, and migraineurs might have reduced number and function of endothelial progenitor cells, a surrogate for marker for impaired vascular <UNK> even in the absence of vascular risk factors, people with migraine have decreased <UNK> and peripheral vascular <UNK> and increased likelihood of retinal microvascular <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> moreover, the altered vascular reactivity is already present among young patients with a recent onset of migraine (mean age <UNK> findings from previous studies have suggested that the association between migraine with aura and ischaemic stroke is more apparent for individuals without vascular risk <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the exception of smoking and use of oral contraceptives in <UNK> <UNK> in particular, people with migraine and no history of hypertension or diabetes had increased risk of ischaemic <UNK> <UNK> people with migraine also have a higher likelihood of retinal microvascular <UNK> furthermore, the proportion of ischaemic strokes among patients with migraine is less likely to be of atherosclerotic <UNK> <UNK> and, specifically, ischaemic strokes in the posterior circulation of migraineurs are probably caused by microembolism and <UNK> the increased risk of ischaemic stroke for migraineurs with aura in the lowest framingham risk score group seen in our study supports these findings. because the score is composed of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, it can be interpreted as a proxy for vascular health. thus, it is plausible that the biological mechanisms by which migraine with aura results in ischaemic vascular events in the brain require a vasculature not altered by atherosclerosis but might involve microvascular changes. several studies have found an association between migraine with aura and angina but not myocardial <UNK> <UNK> in addition, patients with active migraine with chest symptoms or suspected coronary ischaemia had lower angiographic coronary severity scores than patients with similar symptoms but no <UNK> in our data, the association between migraine with aura and angina was increased for patients in the low and high risk score groups. furthermore, our data indicate that the association between migraine with aura and myocardial infarction is apparent only among patients with a high framingham risk score. thus, the effect of migraine with aura on the coronary arteries might involve two mechanisms, one involving a vasculature not altered by atherosclerosis leading to angina and one involving a vasculature impaired by atherosclerosis leading to angina and myocardial infarction. moreover, as women who reported a history of migraine but not active migraine at baseline (that is, the migraine had stopped or the frequency of migraine attacks was less than one attack a year) had a stronger association with high framingham risk score and are also more likely to have increased levels of biomarkers of cardiovascular <UNK> we suggest that an impaired vasculature is involved in the declining one year prevalence of migraine in older age <UNK> as our data do not allow us to directly test this hypothesis, however, future research is warranted to further evaluate potential biological mechanisms of the association between migraine with aura and ischaemic vascular events. of particular interest is whether continuing attacks of migraine with aura lead to changes in the peripheral vasculature, which increase the susceptibility to atherosclerotic changes. strengths and weaknesses of study our study has several strengths, including the prospective design, large number of participants and outcome events, long follow-up and participation rate, standardised evaluation of migraine and cardiovascular disease risk factors, confirmed cardiovascular disease events by an end points committee of physicians, and the homogeneous nature of the cohort, which could reduce confounding. several limitations should be also considered when interpreting our results. firstly, migraine and migraine aura status were self reported leading to potential misclassification. because of the prospective design, however, any misclassification would probably result in underestimation of relative risks and would be unlikely to explain the observed association pattern. furthermore, we have previously reported that our migraine classification had good agreement with <UNK> ihs <UNK> and our prevalence of migraine and migraine aura is close to that reported in other population based <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> secondly, we had no detailed information on use of specific drugs for migraine that might be associated with ischaemic events. such drugs, however, tend to be used by all migraineurs, not just those with migraine aura. furthermore, the different pattern of association between migraine with aura and ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction according to vascular risk status can hardly be explained by drug use. thirdly, despite the overall high number of outcome events, this number was small when we stratified by migraine and framingham risk score categories. fourthly, our stratified analyses are adjusted only for age and not other major cardiovascular disease risk factors. we have previously shown, however, that the association between migraine with aura and cardiovascular disease in this cohort is independent of major risk factors for cardiovascular <UNK> in addition, inclusion of major risk factors for cardiovascular disease as well as randomised treatment assignments in the stratified models showed similar associations (data not shown). residual confounding remains a potential alternative explanation as our data are observational. finally, participants in the women’s health study were all health professionals aged <UNK> and mostly white, thus generalisability might be limited. we have no reason to believe that that the biological mechanisms by which migraine with aura might be associated with vascular events would be different in other populations of women. conclusions results from this large prospective study of women indicate that information on vascular risk status might help to identify women with migraine with aura who are at a particularly increased risk for specific future cardiovascular disease events with a diametric pattern of association for ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction. physicians should consider evaluating vascular risk factors in patients with migraine with aura. what is already known on this topic migraine with aura is associated with increased risk of ischaemic stroke and other ischaemic vascular events migraine with aura is also associated with an unfavourable vascular risk profile as measured by the framingham risk score for coronary heart disease what this study adds migraine with aura is associated with increased risk of ischaemic stroke only among women with low vascular risk scores, while migraine with aura is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction only among women with high vascular risk scores information on history of migraine and vascular risk status might help to identify women at increased risk for specific future cardiovascular disease events

abstract background although obesity is an established risk factor for coronary heart disease, its role as a risk factor for stroke remains controversial. methods prospective cohort study among <UNK> <UNK> us male physicians participating in the physicians' health study. incidence of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke was measured by self-report and confirmed by medical record review. we used cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association of body mass index (bmi), calculated as self-reported weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters, with risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. results during <UNK> years of follow-up, <UNK> strokes <UNK> ischemic, <UNK> hemorrhagic, and <UNK> undefined) occurred. compared with participants with bmis less than <UNK> those with bmis of <UNK> or greater had an adjusted relative risk of <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval [ci], <UNK> for total stroke, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for ischemic stroke, and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for hemorrhagic stroke. when bmi was evaluated as a continuous variable, each unit increase of bmi was associated with a significant <UNK> increase in the adjusted relative risks of total

<UNK> major subtypes with each unit increase of bmi that is independent of the effects of hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol. because bmi is a modifiable risk factor, the prevention of stroke may be another benefit associated with preventing obesity in adults. excess weight is a well-documented risk factor for coronary heart <UNK> in addition, it is associated with increased risk of several factors that may lead to stroke, including <UNK> and diabetes <UNK> however, data on the overall association of obesity and stroke as well as stroke subtypes are limited and <UNK> several studies have suggested that a high body mass index (bmi) may increase the risk of total <UNK> particularly ischemic <UNK> others have found an association with waist-hip <UNK> and abdominal <UNK> (but not with

relationship of bmi with stroke severity has, to our knowledge, never been prospectively evaluated. as a result, excess weight is not included in the framingham stroke risk prediction <UNK> nor is it listed as a primary risk factor for stroke by the national institutes of <UNK> or the american stroke <UNK> obesity, however, is listed as a potential modifiable risk factor for stroke in the recent guidelines of the american heart <UNK> but its effect is stated to be mainly mediated through hypertension, diabetes, and increased blood lipid levels. because stroke, the leading cause of long-term disability and morbidity and the third leading cause of death in the united <UNK> has few effective therapies, identifying and managing potential risk factors such as elevated bmi remain of great importance. the physicians' health study (phs) provided the opportunity to assess prospectively the association between bmi and the incidence of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke, as well as stroke severity, among more than <UNK> <UNK> us male physicians. methods participants were part of the phs, a completed randomized trial of low-dose aspirin and beta carotene in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. the participants, methods, and results have been described in detail <UNK> the study population consisted of <UNK> <UNK> us male physicians aged <UNK> to <UNK> years in <UNK> with no history of myocardial infarction, stroke, transient cerebral ischemia, or cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), who were followed for <UNK> years. morbidity and mortality data were available for more than <UNK> baseline information was self-reported and collected by a mailed questionnaire that asked about many demographic, medical history, and lifestyle variables. every <UNK> months for the first year and annually thereafter, participants received follow-up questionnaires asking about compliance with randomized treatment assignments and newly diagnosed conditions, including stroke. at baseline, <UNK> <UNK> participants <UNK> reported weight and height. of these, <UNK> were excluded because of missing information on potential confounders, resulting in a study population of <UNK> <UNK> men. body mass index was calculated as self-reported weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. evaluation of stroke participants who self-reported stroke on a follow-up questionnaire were asked for permission to obtain their medical records. an end points committee confirmed a diagnosis of stroke after review of medical records and reports of brain imaging. stroke was defined as a focal neurological deficit of vascular mechanism lasting more than <UNK> hours and was classified according to criteria established by the national survey of <UNK> into ischemic, hemorrhagic (including intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage), and unknown subtypes. fatal stroke was documented by evidence of a cerebrovascular mechanism obtained from all available sources, including death certificates and hospital records. stroke severity was measured using the modified rankin scale <UNK> based on information from the hospital discharge summary. the mrs classifies stroke cases from <UNK> (no residual symptoms) to <UNK> (fatal stroke). we categorized stroke severity as mild (mrs score of <UNK> severe (mrs score of <UNK> or fatal (mrs score of <UNK> an independent review by <UNK> neurologists of the diagnostic coding of stroke from the start of randomization of the phs until <UNK> yielded excellent interobserver <UNK> a similar analysis of data from <UNK> until the trial's end also yielded strong interrater reliability, with agreement for ischemic stroke of <UNK> (κ = <UNK> and for hemorrhagic stroke of <UNK> (κ = <UNK> the overall agreement for stroke severity, calculated with quadratic weighted κ <UNK> was excellent, with concordance of <UNK> (κ = <UNK> for the period until <UNK> and <UNK> (κ = <UNK> for the remainder of the study. statistical analyses we used cox proportional hazards <UNK> to analyze the association between bmi and stroke. person-time was calculated from return of the baseline questionnaire until the date of stroke, death, or the study's end, whichever occurred first. body mass index was evaluated in the following <UNK> ways: <UNK> in <UNK> categories <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> world health organization (who) weight categories (normal weight, <UNK> overweight, <UNK> and obese, <UNK> and <UNK> as continuous term. we tested both the proportional hazards and linearity assumptions of the association between bmi and total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke and found no violations. we calculated age-adjusted and multiple-adjusted hazard ratios as a measure of the relative risk for total (including ischemic, hemorrhagic, and undefined stroke cases), ischemic, and hemorrhagic (including intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage) stroke. we used an ordinal variable to test for trend in risk across bmi categories. the multiple regression models controlled for age (continuous); smoking (never, past, or current); alcohol consumption <UNK> drinks per day, <UNK> drinks per week, <UNK> drink per week); exercise <UNK> week or <UNK> week); history of angina (yes or no); parental history of myocardial infarction prior to <UNK> years (yes or no); and randomized treatment assignment. the use of finer categories of both alcohol consumption and exercise did not appreciably change the estimates of the association between bmi and stroke. we considered hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels as possible biological mediators of the effect of bmi on stroke and therefore did not control for these factors in the primary analysis. however, hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure <UNK> mm hg or diastolic blood pressure <UNK> mm hg or taking antihypertensive medication regardless of blood pressure), history of self-reported diabetes, and history of self-reported high cholesterol levels were added sequentially to multiple regression models in a secondary analysis. the use of different categorization of blood pressure did not appreciably change the estimates of the association between bmi and stroke. we evaluated effect modification of bmi by smoking, hypertension, alcohol consumption, and age. we calculated the proportion of total stroke and stroke types directly standardized for age to evaluate the association of bmi and stroke severity. we used the mantel-haenzsel extension test to test for trend in risk across bmi categories. to compare bmi measurements over the study period, we calculated a spearman correlation coefficient comparing baseline bmi to bmis from the <UNK> follow-up and study-end questionnaires after excluding subjects with severe illnesses. results during <UNK> years <UNK> <UNK> person-years) of follow-up, <UNK> incident strokes occurred, including <UNK> ischemic, <UNK> hemorrhagic <UNK> intraparenchymal and <UNK> subarachnoid hemorrhages), and <UNK> undefined strokes. the mean bmi was <UNK> ranging from <UNK> to <UNK> based on who criteria, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> men were in the normal weight category, <UNK> <UNK> were overweight, and <UNK> <UNK> were obese. table <UNK> gives the age-adjusted baseline characteristics of the participants according to bmi categories. mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as prevalence of hypertension increased with increasing bmi. the percentage of men who had never smoked decreased with increasing bmi, whereas the percentage of men who reported current smoking was highest in the obese category. the proportion of men who reported exercising regularly decreased with increasing bmi. the leanest men were more likely to have reported alcohol consumption of <UNK> drink or more per day and less likely to have reported consumption of less than <UNK> drinks per week compared with obese men. the age- and multiple-adjusted relative risks of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke according to bmi categories are summarized in table <UNK> the age-adjusted relative risks of total stroke as well as stroke types increased steadily across bmi categories compared with the referent (bmi <UNK> multiple adjustments for various risk factors attenuated the relative risks only slightly. using the who categories, overweight men had multiple-adjusted relative risks for total stroke of <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval [ci], <UNK> for ischemic stroke of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> and for hemorrhagic stroke of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> compared with men with bmis less than <UNK> obese men had multiple-adjusted relative risks of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for total stroke, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for ischemic stroke, and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for hemorrhagic stroke compared with men with bmis less than <UNK> when bmi was examined as a continuous variable, each <UNK> increase in bmi was associated with a multiple-adjusted increase of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> in the risk of total and ischemic stroke and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for hemorrhagic stroke. the influence of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia on the association between bmi and stroke risk was evaluated in a stepwise fashion using the continuous measurement of bmi. for both total and ischemic stroke, the increased risk was reduced to <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> per unit increase in bmi when hypertension was included in the model. additional adjustment for diabetes did not further reduce the relative risks. hemorrhagic stroke was only marginally mediated by hypertension and diabetes, and the effect estimate of <UNK> was unchanged. after controlling for hypertension and diabetes, the inclusion of cholesterol levels of <UNK> mg/dl or greater <UNK> mmol/l) did not further attenuate the association between bmi and any stroke types. smoking, alcohol consumption, and age did not substantially modify the effect for total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. the risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke was highest among individuals with hypertension, but no substantial effect modification was observed between hypertension status and bmi (figure <UNK> and figure <UNK> although the overall stroke <UNK> fatality was <UNK> large differences were seen between the fatality among stroke types. among the hemorrhagic stroke cases, <UNK> were fatal <UNK> of intraparenchymal hemorrhages and <UNK> of subarachnoid hemorrhages) compared with only <UNK> of ischemic strokes. table <UNK> summarizes the age-adjusted proportion of stroke severity in each bmi category. stroke severity for total and ischemic stroke was not associated with bmi. for hemorrhagic stroke, mild strokes occurred more often in men with bmis of <UNK> or greater, while fatal strokes occurred more often in men with bmis lower than <UNK> further analysis of hemorrhagic stroke subtypes showed that the age-adjusted inverse association between fatal hemorrhagic stroke and bmi was primarily owing to an increased incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. of the <UNK> fatal hemorrhagic stroke cases, <UNK> had subarachnoid hemorrhages, of which <UNK> (age-adjusted percentage, <UNK> occurred in men with bmis lower than <UNK> and <UNK> (age-adjusted percentage, <UNK> with bmis between <UNK> and <UNK> while only <UNK> (age-adjusted percentage, <UNK> occurred in those with bmis between <UNK> and <UNK> with no cases in the heavier categories. however, the age-adjusted percentage of fatal intraparenchymal hemorrhages among obese men <UNK> was also lower than that among men in bmi categories of less than <UNK> or <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> each). these findings were not changed with additional adjusted-for-hypertension. the correlation between baseline bmi, bmi at <UNK> years of follow-up (r = <UNK> and bmi at the study's end (r = <UNK> was high. body mass index was relatively stable throughout the study, with <UNK> of participants with baseline bmis less than <UNK> remaining in that category and <UNK> remaining in the <UNK> to <UNK> bmi category. of the participants, <UNK> increased from normal weight to overweight or from overweight to obese and less than <UNK> shifted from normal weight to obese. comment in this prospective cohort, increasing bmi was associated with a steady increase in the risks of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. although concomitant hypertension and diabetes accounted for much of the increase in total and ischemic stroke, a significant increase remained after adjustment for these potential biological mediators. although the risk of ischemic stroke was highest among smokers and individuals with hypertension, these factors did not substantially modify the relationship between bmi and stroke. body mass index was not associated with the severity of total and ischemic stroke, but the data suggest that it might be inversely associated with severity of fatal hemorrhagic stroke, particularly subarachnoid hemorrhage. the association between excess weight and stroke risk has been controversial. among men, few prospective studies have investigated this relationship. some of these had small sample <UNK> and others did not classify stroke <UNK> to our knowledge, the association between bmi and stroke severity has not been examined prospectively before. in the honolulu heart program, nonsmoking men in the highest tertile of bmi at age <UNK> years had a <UNK> increased risk of ischemic stroke over <UNK> years of <UNK> in the whitehall study, a <UNK> increase in risk of stroke mortality was observed among men with bmis of <UNK> or greater compared with those with bmis less than <UNK> obesity was also a risk factor for nonfatal stroke in a long-term follow-up study of male college <UNK> the modest to small associations observed in some studies, such as among <UNK> elderly men and women in chicago, <UNK> may be a result of controlling for hypertension and diabetes, which may directly mediate the association between excess weight and stroke. other studies, however, failed to find a strong association between obesity and stroke in <UNK> among women, the data are also inconsistent, with some studies showing a positive <UNK> and others showing no <UNK> in the nurses' health study, a nonsignificant inverse association was observed between bmi and hemorrhagic <UNK> in contrast, we found a <UNK> increase in risk of hemorrhagic stroke per unit increase of bmi. on examination by subtype, a direct association was observed between bmi and intraparenchymal hemorrhage, while an inverse association was observed for subarachnoid hemorrhage. a similar inverse association was observed in a community-based finnish cohort of <UNK> subjects with subarachnoid hemorrhage. low bmi <UNK> was associated with a markedly increased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage among current smokers and those with <UNK> if the same divergent associations between bmi and subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhage observed in our cohort of men are also present in women, this could explain the nonsignificant inverse association between bmi and total hemorrhagic stroke observed among <UNK> since subarachnoid hemorrhage is more frequent in women than <UNK> the severity of ischemic and total stroke did not appear to be influenced by bmi in our study, while fatal hemorrhagic stroke occurred more often in lean men than in overweight or obese men. these findings were mainly owing to subarachnoid hemorrhage, which has a higher <UNK> case fatality rate than intraparenchymal <UNK> however, because few fatal hemorrhagic strokes occurred in our study, we were unable to estimate more precisely the association between hemorrhagic subtypes and categories of bmi. the mechanism by which bmi affects stroke risk independent of established risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes is not fully understood. some investigators have proposed that an increase in prothrombic factors observed among overweight and obese individuals may contribute to their increased risk for ischemic <UNK> higher levels of prothrombic factors, such as plasminogen activator <UNK> <UNK> antigen and activity, fibrinogen, von willebrand factor, and factor vii, have been found in obese women compared with normal-weight <UNK> adipose tissue seems to play a role in determining elevated plasma levels of <UNK> which are also linked to the development of <UNK> increased levels of c-reactive protein in overweight and obese <UNK> may also play a role in their increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular <UNK> since an association between increased levels of inflammatory markers and risk of cardiovascular <UNK> including ischemic <UNK> has been documented. our study has several strengths, including its large size, prospective design, and the relatively homogeneous nature of the cohort, which reduces confounding by several variables, including access to medical care, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status. misclassification of stroke was reduced by detailed review of medical records, and interobserver agreement in classifying stroke, stroke subtypes, and stroke severity was high. the study also has several potential limitations. body mass index was calculated using self-reported data, which can lead to misclassification. in several validation studies of other cohorts of health professionals, however, self-reports of height, weight, and other cardiovascular risk factors were <UNK> in the health professionals follow-up study, the correlation coefficient for self-reported and measured weight in men was r = <UNK> body mass index is not a perfect measurement of <UNK> and abnormal regional adiposity may further increase risk for <UNK> to the extent that our single measure of bmi imperfectly reflects adiposity, our results would tend to underestimate the deleterious effects of obesity. moreover, because our study population contains solely physicians who were mostly white and somewhat leaner than the average us <UNK> the results may not be generalizable to a less-selective population. however, since the pathomechanism that leads to stroke is likely to be similar across populations, our results may underrepresent the contribution of obesity to stroke risk. in conclusion, this study demonstrates that overweight and obese men are at increased risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. these risks appeared to be independent of the potential biological mediators of hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol level. these results suggest that individuals and their physicians should consider increased risk of stroke another hazard of obesity. prevention of obesity should help prevent risk of stroke in men.

abstract context migraine with aura has been associated with an adverse cardiovascular risk profile and prothrombotic factors that, along with migraine-specific physiology, may increase the risk of vascular events. although migraine with aura has been associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, an association with cardiovascular disease (cvd) and, specifically, coronary events remains unclear. objective to evaluate the association between migraine with and without aura and subsequent risk of overall and specific cvd. design, setting, and participants prospective cohort study of <UNK> <UNK> us women aged <UNK> years or older who were participating in the women's health study, were free of cvd and angina at study entry <UNK> and who had information on self-reported migraine and aura status, and lipid measurements. this report is based on follow-up data through march <UNK> <UNK> main outcome measures the primary outcome measure was the combined end point of major cvd (first instance of nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or death due to ischemic cvd); other measures were first ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, angina, and death due to ischemic cvd. results at baseline, <UNK> women <UNK> reported any history of migraine; of the <UNK> with active migraine (migraine in the prior year), <UNK> <UNK> indicated aura symptoms. during a mean of <UNK> years of follow-up, <UNK> major cvd events occurred. compared with women with no migraine history, women who reported active migraine with aura had multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of <UNK> <UNK> confidence interval [ci], <UNK> <UNK> for major cvd, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for ischemic stroke, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for myocardial infarction, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for coronary revascularization, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for angina, and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for ischemic cvd death. after adjusting for age, there were <UNK> additional major cvd events attributable to migraine with aura per <UNK> <UNK> women per year. women who reported active migraine without aura did not have increased risk of any vascular events or angina. conclusions in this large, prospective cohort of women, active migraine with aura was associated with increased risk of major cvd, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and death due to ischemic cvd, as well as with coronary revascularization and angina. active migraine without aura was not associated with increased risk of any cvd event. migraine is a common, primary, chronic-intermittent neurovascular headache disorder characterized by episodic severe headache accompanied by autonomic nervous system dysfunction and, in some patients, transient neurologic symptoms known as migraine <UNK> in the united states, the <UNK> prevalence of migraine is approximately <UNK> in women and <UNK> in men; an estimated <UNK> million americans have severe and disabling <UNK> migraine-specific neurovascular <UNK> and the elevated frequency of ischemic stroke among young women with <UNK> have led to speculation that migraine may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke. indeed, several studies have found associations between migraine, especially migraine with aura, and increased risk of ischemic <UNK> since some studies have suggested that migraine, particularly migraine with aura, is associated with an unfavorable cardiovascular risk <UNK> and prothrombotic or vasoactive <UNK> and since the vascular dysfunction of migraine may also extend to coronary <UNK> it is plausible that migraine, and especially migraine with aura, may be associated with other vascular events, not just ischemic stroke. although an association between migraine and chest pain has been <UNK> an association between migraine and coronary events has not been firmly <UNK> in a previous report from the women's health study (whs), migraine was not associated with coronary heart disease after a mean of <UNK> years of <UNK> however, the number of outcome events was too small to conclusively assess the association between migraine with aura and coronary heart disease. we thus evaluated the association between migraine with or without aura and subsequent risk of overall and specific ischemic vascular events in the whs, a large, prospective cohort of apparently healthy women, during a mean of <UNK> years of follow-up. methods study population the whs was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to test the benefits and risks of low-dose aspirin and vitamin e in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (cvd) and cancer among apparently healthy women. the design, methods, and results have been described in detail <UNK> briefly, a total of <UNK> <UNK> us female health care professionals aged <UNK> years or older at study entry <UNK> without a history of cvd, cancer, or other major illnesses were randomly assigned to receive active aspirin <UNK> mg on alternate days), active vitamin e <UNK> iu on alternate days), both active agents, or both placebos. all participants provided written informed consent, and the institutional review board of brigham and women's hospital, boston, mass, approved the whs. baseline information was self-reported and collected by a mailed questionnaire that asked about many cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle variables. twice in the first year and yearly thereafter, participants were sent follow-up questionnaires asking about study outcomes and other information during the study period. for this analysis, we included follow-up information from the time of randomization through march <UNK> <UNK> as of this date, morbidity follow-up was <UNK> complete and mortality follow-up was <UNK> complete. blood samples were collected in tubes containing edta from <UNK> <UNK> participating women prior to randomization. a total of <UNK> <UNK> samples could be assayed for total, high-density lipoprotein, and directly obtained low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with the use of reagents from roche diagnostics (basel, switzerland) and genzyme (cambridge, mass). of these, we excluded <UNK> women with missing migraine information and <UNK> who reported angina prior to study entry, leaving <UNK> <UNK> women free of cvd or angina at baseline for this study. assessment of migraine the baseline questionnaire elicited detailed information about migraine. participants were asked, “have you ever had a migraine headache?” and “in the past year, have you had a migraine headache?” we defined <UNK> main categories: <UNK> no migraine history; <UNK> active migraine, which includes women with self-reported migraine in the year prior to completing the baseline questionnaire; and <UNK> prior migraine, which includes women who reported ever having had a migraine but none in the year prior to completing the questionnaire. participants who reported active migraine were asked details about their migraine attacks, including attack duration of <UNK> to <UNK> hours, unilateral location of pain, pulsating quality, inhibition of daily activities, aggravation by routine physical activity, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, and nausea or vomiting. this information allowed us to classify women based on modified <UNK> international headache society (ihs) criteria for <UNK> of the women who reported active migraine, <UNK> fulfilled all modified ihs criteria for migraine (code <UNK> and <UNK> fulfilled all but <UNK> modified ihs criteria (code <UNK> migrainous disorder). participants who reported active migraine were further asked whether they had an “aura or any indication a migraine is coming.” responses were used to classify women who reported active migraine into active migraine with aura and active migraine without aura, similar to previous <UNK> however, we did not have further details to classify migraine aura based on ihs definitions. to more directly compare our results with those of other studies, we also created a fourth category, “any history of migraine,” that included women who reported active migraine and prior migraine. outcome ascertainment during follow-up, participants self-reported cardiovascular events, coronary revascularization, and angina. medical records were obtained for all cardiovascular events and coronary revascularizations, but not angina, and reviewed by an end points committee of physicians. nonfatal stroke was confirmed if the participant had a new focal-neurologic deficit of sudden onset that persisted for more than <UNK> hours and classified into its major subtypes based on available clinical and diagnostic information with excellent interrater <UNK> the occurrence of myocardial infarction was confirmed if symptoms met world health organization criteria and if the event was associated with abnormal levels of cardiac enzymes or diagnostic electrocardiogram results. cardiovascular deaths were confirmed by review of autopsy reports, death certificates, medical records, or information obtained from next of kin or family members. the primary outcome was major cvd, a combined end point defined as the first of any of these events: nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or death due to ischemic cvd. we also evaluated the association between migraine and any first ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, angina, and death due to ischemic cvd. statistical analyses we compared the baseline characteristics of participants with respect to their migraine status using the general linear models procedure (sas statistical software, version <UNK> sas institute inc, cary, nc) for continuous measurements, adjusting for age. we used direct standardization to adjust categorical variables and incidence rates of cvd for age in <UNK> increments. we used cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between migraine status and the various outcomes. we calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) and their <UNK> confidence intervals (cis). the multivariable model controlled for age (continuous), systolic blood pressure categories <UNK> hg increments), antihypertensive medication use (yes or no), history of diabetes (yes or no), body mass index <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), smoking (never, past, current <UNK> cigarettes/d], or current <UNK> cigarettes/d]), alcohol consumption (rarely/never, <UNK> drinks/mo, <UNK> drinks/wk, or <UNK> drinks/d), exercise (rarely/never, less than once a week, <UNK> times a week, or <UNK> times a week), postmenopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use (never, past, or current), history of oral contraceptive use (yes or no), family history of myocardial infarction prior to age <UNK> years (yes or no), low- and high-density lipoprotein plasma levels (quartiles), cholesterol-lowering medication use (yes or no), as well as randomized treatment assignments. we incorporated a missing value indicator in the outcome models if the number of women with missing information was <UNK> or more and imputed a value otherwise. we tested the proportionality assumption of the cox proportional hazards models by including an interaction term for migraine status with the logarithm of time and found no statistically significant violation. we evaluated effect modification by age <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> years), history of hypertension (yes or no), smoking status (never, past, or current), total cholesterol level <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> mg/dl <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> mmol/l]), history of oral contraceptive use (yes or no), and current postmenopausal hormone use (yes or no). we assessed statistical significance of effect modification by adding a multiplicative term for dichotomous variables to the models, and used a trend test across the mean values of categorical variables. all p values were <UNK> and <UNK> was considered statistically significant. results of the <UNK> <UNK> participants, <UNK> <UNK> reported any history of migraine. of the <UNK> women with active migraine, <UNK> <UNK> reported aura. table <UNK> summarizes the women's age-adjusted baseline characteristics according to migraine status. compared with women with no migraine history, women with active migraine with aura had a more unfavorable cholesterol profile and were less likely to currently smoke cigarettes, to regularly consume alcohol, and to regularly exercise. they were less likely to be premenopausal but more likely to currently use postmenopausal hormones or to have a history of oral contraceptive use and were more likely to report a family history of myocardial infarction prior to age <UNK> years. the most adverse cardiovascular risk profile, however, was recorded for women who indicated prior migraine—they were older, had unfavorable cholesterol levels, and were more likely to be hypertensive or obese or to currently smoke cigarettes. during a mean of <UNK> years of follow-up <UNK> <UNK> person-years), we confirmed <UNK> first major cvd events, <UNK> ischemic strokes, <UNK> myocardial infarctions, and <UNK> ischemic cvd deaths. in addition, <UNK> coronary revascularizations and <UNK> cases of angina occurred. in table <UNK> we report the age-adjusted incidence rates of the outcome events per <UNK> <UNK> women per year according to migraine status. compared with women with no migraine history, the incidence rates of all outcome events were increased among women who reported active migraine with aura. after adjusting for age, there were <UNK> additional major cvd events attributable to migraine with aura per <UNK> <UNK> women per year. women with prior migraine had increased incidence rates specifically for coronary revascularization and angina. in contrast, women with active migraine without aura had incidence rates similar to women with no migraine history. table <UNK> summarizes the age- and multivariable-adjusted associations between migraine status and the various vascular events. compared with women with no migraine history, women who reported any history of migraine were at increased risk of all evaluated ischemic vascular outcomes, with the exception of ischemic stroke. the increased risk of cvd was strikingly different according to migraine aura status. compared with women with no migraine history, women who reported active migraine with aura had multivariable-adjusted hrs of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> <UNK> for major cvd, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for ischemic stroke, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for myocardial infarction, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for coronary revascularization, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for angina, and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for ischemic cvd death. women who reported prior migraine had significantly increased risk of coronary revascularization and angina. women who reported active migraine without aura did not have significantly increased risks of any cvd event or angina compared with women without migraine history. figure <UNK> shows the age-adjusted cumulative incidence of major cvd and figure <UNK> shows the age-adjusted cumulative incidence of specific cvd for women with no migraine, active migraine with aura, and active migraine without aura. the curves diverge after a mean follow-up of approximately <UNK> years, showing increased risks of all evaluated outcomes for women who reported active migraine with aura. the incidence rates of cvd death showed a similar pattern (data not shown). the association between active migraine with aura and major cvd was not significantly modified by age or total cholesterol levels. the association between active migraine with aura and ischemic stroke was significantly modified by age (p = <UNK> and marginally significantly modified by total cholesterol levels (p = <UNK> with the highest association among women younger than <UNK> years (hr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> and women with total cholesterol levels of less than <UNK> mg/dl <UNK> mmol/l) (hr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> in contrast, the association between active migraine with aura and myocardial infarction was not significantly modified by age or cholesterol levels and remained elevated among women aged <UNK> years or older (hr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> and those with cholesterol levels of <UNK> mg/dl or higher <UNK> mmol/l) (hr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> the association between active migraine with aura and major cvd, ischemic stroke, or myocardial infarction was not statistically significantly modified by smoking status, history of hypertension, or use of oral contraceptives or postmenopausal hormone therapy. the association between active migraine without aura and any outcome event was not statistically significantly modified by any of the evaluated factors. comment in this large, prospective study of initially apparently healthy women aged <UNK> years or older, any history of migraine was associated with increased risk of major cvd. this increased risk was strikingly different according to aura status. compared with no migraine history, active migraine with aura was associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent major cardiovascular events, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, angina, and death due to ischemic cvd after a mean follow-up of <UNK> years. these increased risks, which remained after adjusting for a large number of cardiovascular risk factors, ranged from a <UNK> increase for coronary revascularization to a <UNK> increase for cardiovascular death. women with prior migraine had increased risk of coronary revascularization and angina. in contrast, women who reported active migraine without aura did not have significantly increased risk for any ischemic vascular event. while the increased risk of ischemic stroke among persons with migraine with aura has been well <UNK> the association between migraine with aura and overall cvd, particularly coronary heart disease, is less <UNK> a large cohort study of more than <UNK> <UNK> individuals participating in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study found significant associations between migraine and angina compared with those without a headache history; the association was consistently stronger for participants who reported aura <UNK> in contrast, there was no significant association between migraine or aura classification and coronary heart disease. several methodological differences may explain this discrepancy with our findings. these include the headache status ascertainment, which was performed after at least <UNK> years of follow-up and, thus, was conditional on survival, and the categorization of participants into “other headache with aura,” which most likely were also migraine headaches. interestingly, women in this category had a <UNK> increased risk of coronary heart disease, which, however, was not statistically <UNK> two studies found associations between migraine and existing vascular <UNK> and <UNK> other large studies found associations between migraine and coronary events only in subgroups—one among women with a family history of myocardial <UNK> and the other among persons with migraine who did not have prescriptions for <UNK> another <UNK> and a previous report of the <UNK> did not demonstrate associations between overall migraine and major coronary events. in the previous report from the whs, any migraine history was not associated with increased risk of subsequent major coronary heart disease after a mean follow-up of <UNK> years. however, there was a suggestion of increased risk of major coronary events for women with migraine with aura (hr, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> compared with women without migraine. given the findings reported here, the trend was likely not significant due to the shorter follow-up and smaller number of outcome events. with regard to mortality, a cohort study suggested a reduced risk of death among women who reported at least <UNK> migraine feature compared with all other <UNK> in this study, however, no aura information was available. the biological links by which migraine may be associated with ischemic vascular events are likely to be complex; their precise mechanisms are currently unknown. migraine has been associated with increases in prothrombotic or vasoactive factors, including prothrombin factor <UNK> factor v <UNK> <UNK> von willebrand <UNK> and <UNK> the release of vasoactive neuropeptides during migraine attacks that may stimulate inflammatory responses has also been <UNK> some of these have been specifically associated with migraine with <UNK> furthermore, migraine, particularly migraine with aura, has been associated with the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase <UNK> <UNK> which is associated with increased homocysteine levels, a risk factor for vascular events. thus, a synergistic effect between the vascular and endothelial dysfunction of migraine and factors that increase the risk of thrombotic events can be envisioned. migraine with aura has also been associated with a more detrimental cardiovascular risk profile, including elevated cholesterol levels, higher blood pressure, higher likelihood of hypertension, and increased framingham risk score for coronary heart <UNK> thus, it is possible that migraine with aura may be a characteristic that identifies women at increased risk of progressive atherosclerosis and subsequent vascular events. since coronary stenoses and angina are not caused by thromboembolic events, the association between active migraine with aura and these events in our study may indirectly support this hypothesis. however, the increased risk of any evaluated vascular event remained after controlling for a large number of cardiovascular risk factors. since migraine with aura has been linked with silent brain <UNK> and has been described as a consequence of a genetically determined <UNK> a genetic component with endothelial damage may also be a plausible explanation for the increased risk of vascular events. with regard to ischemic stroke, an association between migraine with aura and congenital heart defects, particularly patent foramen ovale, has been proposed as another potential <UNK> this, however, is unlikely to explain the association between migraine with aura and coronary vascular events. the shapes of the cumulative incidence curves for all outcome events show a striking increased risk after a mean of approximately <UNK> years of follow-up. potential explanations for this, however, are currently speculative and would have to involve a differential effect for migraine with aura. aside from chance, such explanations may include the design of the whs, underlying biological mechanisms that increase the risk of cvd only after some time period, or a change in environmental factors during follow-up. our study has several strengths, including a large number of participants and outcome events, high participation rate, long follow-up, prospective design, use of standardized questionnaires, and the homogenous nature of the cohort, which may reduce confounding. furthermore, an end points committee of physicians confirmed all outcome events, with the exception of angina, after medical record review. several limitations of our study should be considered. first, migraine and aura status were self-reported and were not classified according to strict ihs <UNK> thus, potential nondifferential misclassification is possible; it would, however, likely yield an underestimation of the migraine-cvd association. our migraine ascertainment allowed us to classify migraine according to modified ihs <UNK> in our study population, as well as in a substudy of the <UNK> there was consistent agreement with modified <UNK> ihs criteria of migraine. in addition, we did not find significant effect modification of the association between active migraine and major cvd or individual outcomes by modified ihs classification status, nor did we find a significant association between nonmigraine headache and any cvd events (data not shown). second, our aura definition was broad and we had no further details to classify participants according to the ihs criteria for migraine aura. however, the aura prevalence in our study is in the range of that observed in other large population-based <UNK> particularly to the <UNK> among women with migraine in the american migraine study <UNK> furthermore, potential misclassification of self-reported aura status would likely yield an underestimation of the association between active migraine with aura and cvd events. third, since some aura features are difficult to distinguish from symptoms of transient ischemic attack, and since the latter is a risk factor for subsequent vascular events, particularly stroke, the association between active migraine with aura and cvd may be confounded by this mechanism. however, we believe this is an unlikely explanation, since the association between active migraine with aura and ischemic stroke is strongly apparent in younger women who have very low rates of prevalent transient ischemic <UNK> fourth, we had no detailed information regarding the use of migraine-specific drugs (ie, triptans and ergot alkaloids) during the study. because of their vasoconstrictive ability, these drugs may be associated with increased risk of vascular events. the cardiovascular safety profiles of migraine-specific drugs, however, do not support a strong association with cvd <UNK> in addition, since migraine-specific drugs are used by all migraine patients, not only those with aura, it seems an unlikely explanation of our findings. in the whs, women were asked on the <UNK> questionnaire to provide information regarding medication use during the previous <UNK> weeks. the frequency of migraine-specific drug use among women who reported active migraine at baseline was <UNK> and was not significantly different according to aura status (p = <UNK> fifth, although we adjusted for a large number of potential confounders, residual confounding is possible since our study design is observational. however, the striking specificity of our findings for active migraine with aura and the biological plausibility makes such an explanation unlikely. sixth, we had no information regarding the duration of migraine prior to study entry or migraine frequency during follow-up. however, when we updated information on active migraine during follow-up, the association between active migraine and cvd was essentially unchanged (data not shown). finally, participants of the whs were all health care professionals aged <UNK> years or older and mostly white; thus, generalizability may be limited. we have no reason, however, to believe that that the biological mechanisms by which migraine with aura may be associated with increased risk of vascular events may be different in other female populations. in conclusion, in this large, prospective cohort of women, active migraine with aura was associated with an increased risk of subsequent overall and specific ischemic vascular events including coronary heart disease. women who reported active migraine without aura did not have significantly increased risks for any ischemic vascular event. since migraine without aura is far more common than migraine with aura, our data demonstrate no increased risk of cvd for the majority of migraine patients. future research should focus on a better understanding of the relationship between migraine, aura status, and cardiovascular events.

abstract background healthy lifestyle has been associated with decreased risk of coronary heart disease. in contrast, little is known about its association with stroke risk. methods this is a prospective cohort study among <UNK> <UNK> women <UNK> years or older participating in the women's health study. stroke was self-reported and confirmed by means of medical record review. we considered the following self-reported lifestyle factors: smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, body mass index, and diet. the health index was calculated from these variables by assigning scores from <UNK> to <UNK> to the respective variable categories, with a higher score indicating healthier behavior. healthy behavior was defined as never smoking, alcohol consumption between <UNK> and <UNK> drinks per week, exercise <UNK> or more times per week, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) less than <UNK> and a diet high in cereal fiber, folate, and <UNK> fatty acids, with a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat, and low in trans fat and glycemic load. results during <UNK> years of follow-up, <UNK> strokes <UNK> ischemic, <UNK> hemorrhagic, and <UNK> undefined) were confirmed. compared with participants with <UNK> to <UNK> health index points <UNK> women with <UNK> to <UNK> health index points <UNK> had multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios <UNK> confidence interval) of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for trend) for total stroke, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for trend) for ischemic stroke, and <UNK> <UNK> p = <UNK> for trend) for hemorrhagic stroke. conclusions in this large prospective cohort of apparently healthy women, a healthy lifestyle consisting of abstinence from smoking, low body mass index, moderate alcohol consumption, regular exercise, and healthy diet was associated with a significantly reduced risk of total and ischemic stroke but not of hemorrhagic stroke. our findings underscore the importance of healthy behaviors in the prevention of stroke. stroke remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. in the united states alone, approximately <UNK> <UNK> strokes occur each year, of which approximately <UNK> are fatal; an equal number of people are left permanently disabled and in need of assistance with activities of daily <UNK> effective therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke are used <UNK> and often do not completely reverse the impaired brain functions. thus, identification of modifiable lifestyle factors remains critical for stroke prevention, particularly for women who, in the united states, have relatively more strokes than myocardial infarctions when compared with <UNK> the association between many individual behavioral risk factors (including <UNK> alcohol <UNK> <UNK> body mass index <UNK> and some dietary <UNK> and stroke incidence has been studied. in contrast to findings for coronary heart <UNK> and diabetes <UNK> however, the combined effects of health-related behaviors on the risk of stroke and stroke subtypes have not been studied. we thus aimed to evaluate whether a composite of healthy lifestyle factors reduces the risk of stroke and stroke subtypes in more than <UNK> <UNK> apparently healthy women. methods participants study subjects were all participants in the women's health study (whs), a completed randomized trial of low-dose aspirin and vitamin e in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. the methods and results of the whs have been described in detail <UNK> briefly, <UNK> <UNK> female health professionals in the united states who were <UNK> years or older at the beginning of <UNK> and who did not have a history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other major illnesses were randomly assigned to receive aspirin <UNK> mg on alternate days), vitamin e <UNK> iu on alternate days), both active agents, or both placebos. baseline information on many lifestyle variables was collected by means of a mailed questionnaire. twice in the first year and yearly thereafter, participants were sent follow-up questionnaires asking about study outcomes and other information during the study period. for this analysis, we included follow-up information from the time of randomization through march <UNK> <UNK> as of this date, follow-up was <UNK> complete for morbidity and <UNK> for mortality. health index to create a health index with components that have been previously <UNK> we considered self-reported lifestyle information from the baseline questionnaires, incorporating information about smoking, exercise, bmi, alcohol consumption, and dietary factors. smoking is a strong risk factor for <UNK> and <UNK> stroke in women, and the risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked. we categorized participants as never smokers, past smokers who smoked less than <UNK> pack-years, past smokers who smoked <UNK> or more pack-years, current smokers who smoke fewer than <UNK> cigarettes per day, and current smokers who smoke <UNK> or more cigarettes per day. physical activity has been associated inconsistently with risk of stroke. findings from a recent <UNK> of observational studies showed that moderately intense physical activity compared with inactivity was protective for total stroke as well as for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. we categorized exercise on the basis of self-reported frequency of weekly strenuous exercise as rarely or never, less than once per week, once per week, <UNK> to <UNK> times per week, or <UNK> or more times per week. body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters, has been associated consistently with a steady increase in risk of total and ischemic <UNK> although the association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke is less <UNK> we decided to use the lowest category as the healthiest group, which is similar to previous <UNK> we categorized bmi as lower than <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> or more. the association between alcohol consumption and risk of stroke has been described as j-shaped, with the most benefit for light to moderate consumption of <UNK> study participants reported alcohol consumption as drinks per week or day. we categorized alcohol intake as never, less than <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to less than <UNK> and <UNK> or more drinks per week. we assigned the health index points for alcohol consumption favoring moderate drinking habits and assigned a low health index score for women who rarely or never drank alcohol. reassigning the low health index score to the highest alcohol consumption category did not substantially change the association between the health index and risk of stroke. women reported dietary intake on a <UNK> standardized food frequency <UNK> nutrient intake was calculated by multiplying the reported frequency by the nutritional content of the indicated portion sizes. we calculated glycemic load in a manner similar to previous <UNK> we adjusted each nutrient for total energy intake by using the residual <UNK> to incorporate diet into the health index, we considered <UNK> dietary factors as proposed by <UNK> and the association of each with vascular <UNK> cereal fiber, folate (including from supplement intake), the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat, <UNK> fatty acids, trans fats, and glycemic load. consumption of these dietary components was grouped into deciles and scored from <UNK> to <UNK> (inverse for trans fat and glycemic load), with <UNK> being least healthy consumption. the individual scores were then summed to a total diet score, which we categorized into quintiles. the overall health index was calculated by assigning scores of <UNK> to <UNK> to each individual variable category, for which a higher point value indicates a healthier behavior. the health index ranged from <UNK> to <UNK> healthiest behavior was defined as never smoking, consumption of between <UNK> and less than <UNK> alcoholic drinks per week, exercise <UNK> or more times weekly, a bmi lower than <UNK> and a healthy diet (ie, high in cereal fiber, folate, and <UNK> fatty acids, with a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat, and low in trans fat and glycemic load). the assigned point scheme per individual health behavior is summarized in table <UNK> we a priori divided the health index into categories of <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> to <UNK> points, reflecting the <UNK> scheme that was used to create the index. we also evaluated the association between the health index as a continuous term and stroke risk. ascertainment of stroke participants who reported a stroke on a follow-up questionnaire were asked for permission to review their medical records. a diagnosis of stroke was confirmed only after review of the medical records by an end-points committee of physicians. a nonfatal stroke was defined as a focal-neurological deficit of sudden onset and vascular mechanism that lasted more than <UNK> hours. cases of fatal stroke were documented if they had evidence of cerebrovascular mechanism using information obtained from all available sources, including death certificates and hospital records. clinical information and results from brain imaging were used to distinguish among ischemic, hemorrhagic, and unknown subtype. the interobserver agreement of the classification of stroke and its major subtypes in the whs was <UNK> statistical analyses of the <UNK> <UNK> participants, we excluded <UNK> women with information missing on lifestyle factors and <UNK> women who reported a stroke before the baseline questionnaire, leaving <UNK> <UNK> for this analysis. we used cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between the health index and the risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. we calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) and their corresponding <UNK> confidence intervals (cis), using the category conventionally believed to be least healthy as the reference group. we distinguished <UNK> multivariable models. model <UNK> controlled for age (quadratic term), postmenopausal hormone use (never, past, or current), past and present use of oral contraceptives, family history of myocardial infarction before age <UNK> years, annual household income <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> highest level of education (less than a bachelor's degree, bachelor's degree, or master's degree or doctorate), location of residence (northeast, southeast, midwest, or west), marital status (single, married, or other), ethnicity (white, black, or other), and randomized treatment assignments. model <UNK> additionally controlled for the potential consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle—history of hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure of at least <UNK> mm hg, diastolic blood pressure of at least <UNK> mm hg, or self-reported physician-diagnosed hypertension), antihypertensive treatment, history of diabetes mellitus, and history of cholesterol of <UNK> mg/dl <UNK> mmol/l) or higher. we evaluated whether the association between the health index and stroke was modified by age <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> years) and history of hypertension (defined as before). we tested age-adjusted effect modification by using the likelihood ratio test. we calculated p for trend across the mean values of health index categories. all analyses were performed with sas version <UNK> (sas institute inc, cary, nc); p values are <UNK> and we considered <UNK> statistically significant. results after a mean of <UNK> years of follow-up <UNK> <UNK> person-years), <UNK> strokes <UNK> ischemic, <UNK> hemorrhagic, and <UNK> unknown) were confirmed among the <UNK> <UNK> participating women. table <UNK> summarizes the association between health index categories and the individual components of the index. in addition, we provide the association between individual components and risk of total stroke. as expected, women with <UNK> or more health index points <UNK> of the study population) were less likely to be current smokers, exercised more regularly, drank alcohol in moderation, had a lean bmi, and had a high diet score. we found strong associations between smoking, as well as bmi, and risk of stroke, whereas there was no apparent association between alcohol consumption and exercise with stroke risk. the diet score was inversely associated with stroke risk. in table <UNK> we summarize the association between various baseline characteristics and health index categories. as expected, the proportion of participants who reported history of hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes mellitus, or history of elevated cholesterol was higher in the lower health index categories. current use of postmenopausal hormones was higher in the high health index categories, whereas the proportion of women with a family history of premature myocardial infarction was lower. black women were more likely to be in the low health index category. women in the low health index category reported lower annual household income, had lower levels of education, were less likely to be married, and were more likely to live in the southeast or midwest. the overall health index showed strong associations between total and ischemic stroke but not hemorrhagic stroke (table <UNK> compared with women with <UNK> to <UNK> health index points, women with <UNK> to <UNK> points had multivariable-adjusted (model <UNK> hrs of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for total, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for ischemic, and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for hemorrhagic stroke. there was a significant trend across the mean values of health index categories for total and ischemic stroke <UNK> for both) but not for hemorrhagic stroke (p = <UNK> additional adjustment for the potential consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle—indicators of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and elevated cholesterol—attenuated these associations; however, there remained a statistically significant reduction of risk for total and ischemic stroke. when we evaluated the association between health index as a continuous term and stroke, a <UNK> increase was associated with a <UNK> reduction <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for total stroke, a <UNK> reduction <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for ischemic stroke, and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> to <UNK> for hemorrhagic stroke. we found no statistically significant deviation from linearity <UNK> for total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke). the beneficial effect of healthy lifestyle was apparent in all age groups, although the trend was not statistically significant among women <UNK> years or older. overall, however, the association between healthy lifestyle and risk of total stroke was not statistically significantly modified by age (p = <UNK> healthy lifestyle consistently reduced the risk of total stroke among women with hypertension (p = <UNK> for trend) and among women with no history of hypertension (p = <UNK> for trend); hypertensive state was not a statistically significant effect modifier (p = <UNK> for interaction). furthermore, there was no effect modification according to randomized aspirin (p = <UNK> for interaction) or vitamin e (p = <UNK> for interaction) assignment. because some may consider an increased relative body weight (ie, bmi) to be a consequence rather than a component of an unhealthy lifestyle, we also created another health index incorporating all lifestyle variables except bmi. this score ranged from <UNK> to <UNK> points. the association between this health index and stroke showed similar but weaker associations compared with the health index including bmi. compared with women with <UNK> to <UNK> points, women with <UNK> to <UNK> points (healthiest category) had multivariable-adjusted hrs of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for trend) for total, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for trend) for ischemic, and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> p = <UNK> for trend) for hemorrhagic stroke. additional adjustments for bmi categories reduced the effect estimates and led to nonsignificant trends across health index categories for all outcomes. the association between the health index that excluded bmi and total stroke was not statistically significantly modified by bmi categories. comment in this large prospective cohort of women, a composite healthy lifestyle involving abstinence from smoking, low bmi, moderate alcohol consumption, regular exercise, and a healthy diet was associated with a substantial reduction in risk of total and ischemic stroke. these associations were apparent even after controlling for the potential biological mediators hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and elevated cholesterol. the association was not significantly modified by age or history of hypertension. the association between healthy lifestyle and hemorrhagic stroke was less clear, and the results suggested a u-shaped association. however, the number of hemorrhagic stroke cases was small, so the effect estimates were imprecise. with regard to the individual components of the health index, we found substantial reduction of stroke risk for women who never smoked or were past smokers and for women who had lower bmi. alcohol consumption and physical activity were only weakly associated with risk of total stroke. surprisingly, the diet index was inversely related to stroke risk. the increased risk of stroke among those with the healthier diet was apparent for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (data not shown). excluding diet from the health index did not change the association between the remaining health index with total and ischemic stroke <UNK> for trend) and showed no significant beneficial association with hemorrhagic stroke (p = <UNK> for trend). our finding for smoking is in agreement with results from previous studies that established smoking as an independent risk factor for <UNK> and <UNK> stroke. the risk of stroke from smoking is dose related, and there is good evidence that smoking cessation can reduce the risk of <UNK> which is supported by our results. overweight and obesity have been associated consistently with increased risk of total and ischemic <UNK> however, the association between bmi and hemorrhagic stroke is less clear, with a generally positive association in <UNK> but inconsistent associations in <UNK> which may explain in part the lack of association between our health index and risk of hemorrhagic stroke. when we evaluated a healthy lifestyle excluding bmi, we found similar but weaker associations with stroke risk compared with the health index incorporating bmi. with regard to physical activity and alcohol consumption, meta-analyses of observational studies indicate a protective effect of moderately intense physical activity on total <UNK> a j-shaped association between alcohol consumption and the risks of total and ischemic <UNK> and a linear association between alcohol consumption and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. heavy alcohol consumption was associated with an increased relative risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic <UNK> in our data, moderate alcohol consumption and vigorous physical activity were not strongly associated with stroke risk. compared with the association between diet and coronary heart disease, the association between dietary factors and stroke risk is less well studied. in this study, we considered the main components of a previously proposed diet index that mostly related to coronary heart <UNK> although results from previous studies did not indicate strong associations with components of the diet index and risk of stroke, such as consumption of polyunsaturated fatty <UNK> glycemic load among obese <UNK> or even inverse associations with hemorrhagic <UNK> our diet results were still unexpected. future study should address the association between dietary factors and risk of stroke and stroke subtypes. a western dietary pattern may increase stroke risk, but a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish may protect against <UNK> despite the numerous studies on individual lifestyle factors and risk of stroke, evaluations of combined effects of these factors are sparse. for coronary heart disease, analyses from the nurses' health study showed a substantial reduction in risk of coronary heart disease for women who lived healthy <UNK> women who never smoked, had low bmi, exercised regularly, consumed alcohol moderately, and ate a healthy diet had an adjusted relative risk of coronary heart disease of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> compared with the other women in the study. in secondary analyses, the authors also included total stroke in the outcome, yielding a relative risk of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for the healthy lifestyle group compared with the other women. the number of stroke cases was too small, however, to provide separate estimates for stroke. strengths of our study include the large number of outcome events and participants, long follow-up and high participation rate, detailed standardized information on many lifestyle factors, confirmed stroke cases with high interobserver <UNK> and the homogeneity of the cohort, which reduces confounding by access to medical care. several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. first, information on all lifestyle factors was self-reported, so misclassification is possible. however, in a prospective study, misclassification is typically considered nondifferential and therefore is expected to lead to an underestimation of risk. in addition, health professionals are known to report their health status and lifestyle factors with reasonable <UNK> second, women who participated in the whs were health professionals and mostly white. thus, generalizability to other populations may be limited; blacks and hispanics have a higher incidence of <UNK> and lifestyle factors may be part of the reason for this observation. our data support the contention that blacks and those with lower socioeconomic status have less healthy lifestyles. third, despite adjustments for potential confounding factors, residual confounding remains plausible because our study design is observational. fourth, we did not update information on lifestyle factors during follow-up because such updated information was not ascertained for all factors that were included in the health index. fifth, the relationship between the health index and stroke is influenced by the weight given to each component of the index. because we did not aim to maximize the likelihood of observing a significant effect, we chose to give equal weight to each health-behavior component. however, because the use of equal weight is an imperfect approximation of the underlying biological relationships between the different health behaviors and stroke, future analyses should examine the issue of weighting. in conclusion, in this large prospective cohort of apparently healthy women, a healthy lifestyle was associated with a substantial and statistically significant reduction in the risk of total and ischemic stroke with no apparent benefit in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. our findings show the importance of healthy behaviors in the prevention of total and ischemic stroke.

abstract background the vascular component of the migraine-specific physiologic profile and the observed adverse cardiovascular risk profile in migraineurs suggest an association between migraine and cardiovascular disease (cvd). in women, migraine has been associated with increased risk of cvd, including coronary events. compatible data in men are lacking. methods prospective cohort study of <UNK> <UNK> men aged <UNK> to <UNK> years participating in the physicians' health study. in yearly questionnaires, men were asked for information on migraine, risk factors, and the occurrence of study end points. we classified men as having migraine if they indicated migraine during the first <UNK> years, after which time follow-up began. information on aura was not available. all the men were free of cvd at the start of follow-up. during a mean of <UNK> years, we followed up participants for the occurrence of a first major cvd event (nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or death from ischemic cvd). we also evaluated the individual end points, coronary revascularization, and angina. results a total of <UNK> men <UNK> reported migraine, and during follow-up, <UNK> major cvd events occurred. compared with nonmigraineurs, men who reported migraine had multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios <UNK> confidence intervals) of <UNK> <UNK> p = <UNK> for major cvd, <UNK> <UNK> p = <UNK> for ischemic stroke, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for myocardial infarction, <UNK> <UNK> p = <UNK> for coronary revascularization, <UNK> <UNK> p = <UNK> for angina, and <UNK> <UNK> p = <UNK> for ischemic cardiovascular death. conclusion in this large prospective cohort of apparently healthy men, migraine was associated with increased risk of major cvd, which was driven by increased risk of myocardial infarction. migraine is a primary chronic intermittent headache disorder characterized by pulsating unilateral severe pain attacks with associated autonomic and gastrointestinal <UNK> in some patients, transient neurologic symptoms—mostly visual disturbances—can occur that are known as “migraine aura.” the prevalence of migraine peaks in midlife, and in the united states alone, more than <UNK> million people, approximately <UNK> and <UNK> of the female and male populations, respectively, have <UNK> the physiologic profile of migraine involves the neurovascular <UNK> and population-based studies have linked migraine with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as elevated blood pressure, an unfavorable cholesterol profile, and an elevated framingham risk score for coronary heart disease <UNK> as well as a higher prevalence of prothrombotic factors, including von willebrand <UNK> factor v <UNK> prothrombin factor <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> moreover, the genetic polymorphism <UNK> methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase has been associated with <UNK> which also is associated with increased levels of homocysteine, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (cvd). thus, it seems plausible that migraine may be associated with increased risk of ischemic vascular events. several epidemiologic <UNK> have linked migraine with increased risk of ischemic stroke, but a firm association between migraine and coronary events has not been <UNK> recently, however, data from the women's health study (whs) indicated an association between migraine, specifically migraine with aura, and major ischemic cvd, including chd, after a mean of <UNK> years of <UNK> that was not apparent with shorter <UNK> in a previous report from the physicians' health study (phs), no association between migraine and chd was observed after a mean of <UNK> years of <UNK> because the prevalence of migraine is lower in men than in <UNK> it is plausible that long-term follow-up is needed to associate migraine with subsequent risk of cvd, specifically, chd. we aim to evaluate the association between migraine and risks of overall and specific ischemic vascular events in the phs, a large prospective cohort of apparently healthy men, during a mean of almost <UNK> years of follow-up. methods study population this prospective cohort study consisted of participants from the phs, a completed randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to test the benefits and risks of low-dose aspirin and beta carotene in the primary prevention of cvd and cancer in apparently healthy men. the design, methods, and results have been described in detail <UNK> briefly, <UNK> <UNK> us male physicians aged <UNK> to <UNK> years at study entry <UNK> and without a history of cvd, cancer, or other major illnesses were randomly assigned to receive active aspirin <UNK> mg on alternate days), active beta carotene <UNK> mg every other day), both active agents, or both placebos. all the participants provided written informed consent, and the institutional review board of brigham and women's hospital approved the phs. baseline information was self-reported and was collected by means of a mailed questionnaire that asked about many cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle variables. twice in the first year and yearly thereafter, participants were sent follow-up questionnaires asking about study outcomes and other information during the study period. posttrial follow-up is <UNK> for this analysis, we included information through february <UNK> <UNK> as of this date, follow-up was more than <UNK> complete. assessment of migraine on the <UNK> and subsequent annual questionnaires, participants were asked whether they had experienced a migraine since they last filled out the questionnaire. because we did not ask participants about any history of migraine and to make the migraine ascertainment more comparable with other <UNK> we classified men as having migraine if they indicated migraine during the first <UNK> years of follow-up. we furthermore classified participants as having “frequent migraine” if they reported migraine <UNK> or more times during this exposure window. we also ascertained reports of nonmigraine headache (indication of headache but not migraine) in a similar manner. we had no further details about the migraine headache that would have allowed us to classify migraine according to the <UNK> international headache society <UNK> however, results from the whs, a prospective cohort study similar in design and data ascertainment as the phs, showed good agreement with these criteria, indicating that <UNK> fulfilled all but <UNK> modified international headache society criteria (code <UNK> migrainous disorder) and <UNK> fulfilled all modified international headache society criteria for migraine (code <UNK> information on migraine aura was not recorded in the phs. outcome ascertainment all the participants were followed up after the <UNK> questionnaire for the first occurrence of major cvd—a combined end point composed of nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction (mi), or death from ischemic cvd. coronary revascularization (bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary angioplasty) and angina were also recorded. medical records were obtained for all cardiovascular events, but not for coronary revascularization and angina, and were reviewed by an end points committee of physicians. the occurrence of mi was confirmed if symptoms met the world health organization criteria and if the event was associated with abnormal levels of cardiac enzymes or diagnostic electrocardiograms. nonfatal stroke was confirmed if the participant had a new focal neurologic deficit of sudden onset and vascular origin that persisted for more than <UNK> hours. stroke was classified into its major subtypes based on available clinical and diagnostic test information, including brain scans with excellent interrater <UNK> cardiovascular deaths were confirmed by review of autopsy reports, death certificates, medical records, and information obtained from next of kin or other family members. for this analysis, we included only ischemic events. statistical analyses of the <UNK> <UNK> participants, we excluded <UNK> who died, <UNK> with missing migraine information, <UNK> who reported cvd or coronary revascularization, and <UNK> who reported angina during the <UNK> exposure window, leaving <UNK> <UNK> men free of cvd or angina at <UNK> follow-up for this analyses. we compared the characteristics of participants with respect to their migraine status at <UNK> months using analyses of covariance for continuous measurements, adjusting for age. we used direct standardization to adjust categorical variables and incidence rates for cvd for age in <UNK> increments. we used cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between migraine and the various outcomes. we calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) and their <UNK> confidence intervals (cis). in the multivariable models, we adjusted for age (continuous), history of hypertension (systolic blood pressure <UNK> mm hg, diastolic blood pressure <UNK> mm hg, or antihypertensive drug treatment), history of diabetes mellitus, smoking status (never, past, or current), exercise (rarely or never, <UNK> time per week, <UNK> times per week, or <UNK> times per week), body mass index (continuous) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), alcohol consumption (rarely or never, <UNK> times per month, <UNK> times per week, or <UNK> time per day), history of a cholesterol level of <UNK> mg/dl or greater <UNK> mmol/l), parental history of mi before age <UNK> years, and randomized treatment assignments. in further analysis, we also evaluated the association between frequent migraine and nonmigraine headaches and the various outcome events. we tested the proportionality assumption by including an interaction term for migraine status with the logarithm of time to the proportional hazards models and found no significant violation. we evaluated effect modification by age <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> years), smoking status (never, past, or current), history of hypertension (yes or no), and randomized aspirin assignment. we assessed statistically significant effect modification by contrasting models with and without an interaction term indicator variable(s) using the likelihood ratio test. we performed all analyses using statistical software (sas version <UNK> sas institute inc, cary, nc). all tests were <UNK> and <UNK> was considered statistically significant. results of the <UNK> <UNK> participants, <UNK> <UNK> reported migraine until the <UNK> questionnaire, and <UNK> reported migraine <UNK> or more times (“frequent migraine”) during this period. table <UNK> summarizes the age-adjusted characteristics of the participants according to migraine status. compared with men who did not report migraine, migraineurs were younger, more often reported hypertension, were less likely to currently smoke cigarettes and consume alcohol regularly, and were more likely to report a history of an elevated cholesterol level of <UNK> mg/dl or greater <UNK> mmol/l). during a mean of <UNK> years of follow-up <UNK> <UNK> person-years), <UNK> major ischemic cvd events, <UNK> ischemic strokes, <UNK> mis, and <UNK> ischemic cvd deaths were confirmed. in addition, <UNK> coronary revascularizations and <UNK> cases of angina were reported. table <UNK> summarizes the age- and multivariable-adjusted associations between migraine and frequent migraine and the various outcome events. compared with men who did not report migraine, those who reported migraine were at significantly increased risk of major cvd and mi. the multivariable-adjusted hrs <UNK> cis) were <UNK> <UNK> p = <UNK> for major cardiovascular events, <UNK> <UNK> p = <UNK> for ischemic stroke, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for mi, and <UNK> <UNK> p = <UNK> for ischemic cardiovascular death. in addition, men who reported migraine had multivariable-adjusted hrs <UNK> cis) of <UNK> <UNK> p = <UNK> for coronary revascularization and <UNK> <UNK> p = <UNK> for angina. the magnitude of association was similar for the <UNK> men classified as having frequent migraines compared with men without migraines. the age-adjusted incidence of major cvd per <UNK> <UNK> men per year was <UNK> for those who did not report migraine and <UNK> for those with migraine. regarding mi, the age-adjusted incidence per <UNK> <UNK> men per year was <UNK> for those without migraine and <UNK> for those with migraine. figure <UNK> shows the multivariable-adjusted cumulative incidence of major cardiovascular events, and figure <UNK> shows the multivariable-adjusted cumulative incidences of ischemic stroke, mi, coronary revascularization, and angina according to migraine status. the incidence curves diverge for major cvd, mi, and angina. when we evaluated the association between nonmigraine headache and the various outcome events, we found no significant associations. the multivariable-adjusted hrs ranged from <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for death from ischemic cvd to <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for ischemic stroke. the associations between migraine and major cvd, ischemic stroke, and mi were not significantly modified by smoking and hypertension status or by randomized aspirin assignment. the association between migraine and ischemic stroke was significantly modified by age (p = <UNK> compared with men who did not report migraine, the age-adjusted hr of ischemic stroke was <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for migraineurs younger than <UNK> years, whereas there was no significant association in the older age groups. age did not significantly modify the association between migraine and major cvd and mi. comment in this large prospective cohort study of initially healthy middle-aged men who were free of cvd or angina at study entry and during the <UNK> migraine ascertainment period, migraine was associated with a significantly increased risk of major cardiovascular events, which was driven by an increased risk of mi. compared with men who did not indicate migraine by the <UNK> questionnaire and after adjustment for a variety of cardiovascular risk factors, men who reported migraine had a <UNK> increased risk of major cvd and a <UNK> increased risk of mi. migraine was not statistically significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, death from ischemic cvd, or coronary revascularization and was marginally associated with angina. the association between migraine and ischemic stroke, however, was significantly modified by age, indicating an increased risk of ischemic stroke for men with migraine who were <UNK> to <UNK> years of age but not for older age groups. men who indicated migraine <UNK> or more times during the <UNK> exposure window did not have further increased risk of cvd. the associations between migraine and major cvd, mi, and ischemic stroke are compatible with findings from the <UNK> in this prospective cohort of <UNK> <UNK> apparently healthy women, any history of migraine was associated with a multivariable-adjusted hr of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for major cvd, <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for mi, and <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> for ischemic stroke compared with women with no history of migraine. in contrast, however, the study in women found significantly increased risk of coronary revascularization, angina, and cvd death for women with overall migraine compared with women who did not report migraine. more specifically, the results of the whs indicate that the increased risk of any ischemic vascular events is only apparent for women with migraine with aura. migraineurs without aura do not have increased risk of any ischemic vascular <UNK> in the phs, there was no information on migraine aura recorded. in a previous report from the <UNK> migraine was not associated with increased risk of chd during a mean of <UNK> years of follow-up. because migraine is less prevalent in <UNK> the association between migraine and chd may not have been apparent because of the shorter follow-up. in addition, we used a different migraine definition than the previous study, which may indicate that different migraine patterns have different associations with cvd risk. this should be explored in future research studies. regarding ischemic stroke, the present finding is in contrast to a previous report from the <UNK> that showed a <UNK> increased risk of ischemic stroke in men who reported migraine during mean follow-up of <UNK> years. the present data, however, are compatible with the findings from the whs, <UNK> did not show significant associations between overall migraine and ischemic stroke. because in stratified analyses of the phs data there was an apparent association between migraine and ischemic stroke in men younger than <UNK> years, these data support previous studies showing that the association between migraine and ischemic stroke is particularly apparent in younger <UNK> but not in the <UNK> thus, it may be that the association between migraine and ischemic stroke diminishes with increasing age and, thus, with increasing follow-up duration, which may explain the pattern of the cumulative incidence curve (figure <UNK> regarding chd, <UNK> population-based <UNK> found an association between migraine and prevalent cvd, and <UNK> <UNK> found increased risk of non-mi ischemic heart disease. in contrast, several prospective <UNK> did not find associations between migraine and major coronary events. results from the atherosclerosis risk in communities <UNK> show an increased prevalence of angina in migraineurs but do not indicate an association between migraine and chd in the <UNK> <UNK> participants. a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> migraineurs and an equal number of matched nonmigraineurs from a us health plan insurance database showed an association between migraine and ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attacks, and angina but not mi. however, in that study the mean follow-up time was only <UNK> years. in a <UNK> of <UNK> women with chest pain or symptoms suggestive of mi, women with migraine did not have increased risk of subsequent cvd or all-cause mortality during mean follow-up of <UNK> years. several mechanisms have been proposed supporting a biological link between migraine and vascular events. however, the precise mechanisms are currently unknown and are likely to be complex. for example, migraine has been associated with an unfavorable cardiovascular risk <UNK> and migraine frequency and severity have been associated with increased body mass <UNK> thus, it is possible that migraine is a marker of progressive atherosclerosis. however, the increased risk of vascular events remained after controlling for major cardiovascular risk factors in the present data and other <UNK> however, it has recently been shown that in women with indications for coronary angiography, those with migraine had less severe angiographic coronary artery disease than those without <UNK> it is also plausible that compared with individuals with the same degree of atherosclerosis, migraineurs have more vascular symptoms and events due to the migraine-specific vascular <UNK> or that a synergistic effect exists between the vascular and endothelial dysfunction of migraine and factors that increase the risk of thrombotic vascular events. migraine has also been associated with biomarkers that have been linked with increased risk of <UNK> and the release of vasoactive neuropeptides that may stimulate inflammatory <UNK> furthermore, genetic polymorphisms may predispose to migraine and cvd. a polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene <UNK> has been associated with <UNK> that has also been associated with increased levels of homocysteine, a risk factor for cvd. a previously described association between migraine and patent foramen <UNK> may partly explain the association between migraine and ischemic stroke but unlikely explains the association between migraine and mi. this study has several strengths, including the prospective design, large number of participants and outcome events, long follow-up, and homogeneous nature of the cohort, which may reduce confounding. furthermore, except for coronary revascularization and angina, all of the outcome events were confirmed after medical record review. several limitations should be considered when interpreting these results. first, because information on aura was not recorded, we could not further evaluate whether, specifically, migraine with aura increases the risk of cvd in men, as suggested by findings from the <UNK> second, migraine was self-reported by the participating physicians, and we had no further details to classify migraine based on the criteria established by the international headache <UNK> however, results from the whs showed good agreement with these <UNK> furthermore, we found no association between reports of nonmigraine headache and risk of any vascular events, indicating that potential misclassification of migraine would most likely lead to an underestimation of the association between migraine and cvd. third, we had no information about the use of migraine-specific drugs (ie, triptans and ergot alkaloids), which owing to their vasoconstrictive ability may be associated with increased risk of ischemic vascular events. the current cardiovascular safety and postmarketing <UNK> for migraine-specific drugs do not support a strong association with cvd. a recent <UNK> however, indicated that individuals with migraine who overuse ergotamines may have an increased risk of ischemic complications, in particular those who concomitantly use cardiovascular drugs. fourth, despite controlling for a variety of potential confounders, residual and unmeasurable confounding is possible in this observational study. fifth, the phs was composed of middle-aged and mostly white physicians; thus, generalizability may be limited. however, based on current knowledge, we have no reason to believe that the biological mechanisms by which migraine may lead to cvd differs in other male populations. in conclusion, in this large prospective cohort of apparently healthy middle-aged men, migraine was associated with increased risk of subsequent major cvd, which was driven by increased risk of mi.

abstract objective to evaluate the association between total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), total cholesterol to hdl-c ratio,

hazards models to evaluate the association between lipids and risk of ischemic stroke. results during <UNK> years of follow-up, <UNK> ischemic strokes occurred. all lipid levels were strongly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in age-adjusted models. the association attenuated particularly for hdl-c after adjustment for potential confounders. for the comparison of the

apparently healthy women, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke. results from large trials of cholesterol-lowering statins have shown that these agents decrease the incidence of ischemic stroke among patients with existing strokes or <UNK> or at high risk for <UNK> however, in contrast to the well-established association between various lipid measures and coronary heart <UNK> the epidemiologic

<UNK> apparently healthy women aged <UNK> years and above with measured lipid profiles at baseline and a follow-up information during a mean of <UNK> years. go to: methods participants study subjects were all participants in the whs, a completed randomized clinical trial of low-dose aspirin and vitamin e in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among apparently healthy women. the design, methods, and results of the whs have been described in detail <UNK> <UNK> briefly, a total of <UNK> women who were all registered health professionals throughout the united states and the commonwealth of puerto rico, aged <UNK> years or older at study entry <UNK> and without a history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other major illnesses, were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: active aspirin <UNK> mg on alternate days), active vitamin e <UNK> iu on alternate days), both active agents, or both placebos. all participants gave written informed consent and the institutional review board of the brigham and women's hospital approved the study design and procedures. baseline information was self-reported and was collected by a mailed questionnaire that asked about a large number of cardiovascular risk factors and life-style variables. twice in the first year and yearly thereafter, participants were sent follow-up questionnaires asking about study outcomes (including stroke), personal characteristics, medical history, and health habits during the study period. for this analysis, we included follow-up information from the time of randomization through march <UNK> <UNK> prior to randomization, women were asked whether they would be willing to provide a fasting venous blood sample. women who answered affirmatively were mailed a blood collection kit containing edta tubes. blood samples were received from <UNK> of which <UNK> of these samples could be assayed for a full lipid panel. levels of total cholesterol and hdl-c were measured enzymatically on a hitachi <UNK> autoanalyzer (roche diagnostics, basel, switzerland) while ldl-c was determined directly (genzyme, cambridge, mass.). non-hdl-c was calculated by subtracting hdl-c from total cholesterol. we categorized all lipid values into quintiles. we further evaluated the association between total cholesterol, ldl-c, and hdl-c based on the expert panel on detection, evaluation, and treatment of high cholesterol in adults (atp <UNK> categories and as continuous terms (in mmol/l). ascertainment of stroke participants who reported a stroke on a follow-up questionnaire were asked for permission to review their medical records. a diagnosis of stroke was confirmed only after review of the medical records by an endpoints committee of physicians, including a board certified vascular neurologist. a nonfatal stroke was defined as a new focal-neurological deficit of sudden onset and vascular mechanism that lasted <UNK> hours. cases of fatal stroke were documented by evidence of a cerebrovascular mechanism obtained from all available sources, including death certificates, autopsy reports, hospital records, family members, or next of kin. clinical information and results from diagnostic tests including brain imaging were used to distinguish between ischemic, hemorrhagic, and unknown stroke subtype. furthermore, ischemic stroke were subcategorized into its potential etiologic cause. the inter-observer agreement of the classification of stroke and its major subtypes in the whs was <UNK> statistical analyses we compared baseline characteristics of participants according to total cholesterol categories. to compare mean response among total cholesterol quintiles, we used analyses of covariance (ancova) adjusting for age. we compared categorical variables adjusting for age using direct standardization. we used cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between the various lipid measures and the risk of ischemic stroke. we calculated age- and multiple-adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) and their corresponding <UNK> cis. we made a distinction between two multivariable models: model <UNK> controlled for the potential confounding factors age (quadratic term), alcohol consumption (rarely/never, <UNK> drinks/month, <UNK> drinks/week, <UNK> drinks/day), exercise (rarely/never, <UNK> times/week, <UNK> times/week, <UNK>

hormone use, history of diabetes, migraine status, and, in addition, for cholesterol lowering medication use and randomized treatment assignments. because lipid levels have been associated with risk of subsequent risk of <UNK> and thus, hypertension may be a potential biological mediator of the lipid-ischemic stroke association, we additionally controlled for systolic blood pressure categories

smoking status <UNK> body mass index <UNK> history of hypertension <UNK> or randomized aspirin assignment <UNK> we found effect modification by current postmenopausal hormone use <UNK> suggesting that women who used postmenopausal hormones did not have increased risk of ischemic stroke with increasing total cholesterol categories. go to: discussion in this prospective cohort of more than <UNK> women free of cardiovascular disease at baseline, all lipid levels were strongly associated with subsequent risk of ischemic stroke after adjusting for age. after additional adjustment for a large number of potential confounders, total cholesterol, ldl-c, the total cholesterol to hdl-c ratio, and non-hdl-c remained significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke. hdl-c was not significantly associated with risk of ischemic stroke after multivariable adjustment, although the point estimate suggested a protective association. we did not find significant effect modification by age, smoking status, history of hypertension, body mass index, or randomized aspirin assignment. on the other hand, the association between total cholesterol and ischemic stroke was modified by postmenopausal hormone use, indicating that the association between total cholesterol and ischemic stroke was only apparent among non-postmenopausal hormone users. the association between all lipid levels and risk of stroke were attenuated after adjustment for factors that affect lipid levels such as <UNK> alcohol <UNK> smoking <UNK> and body mass <UNK> since these behavioral factors are also risk factors for ischemic <UNK> our data may indicate that lipid levels are part of the mechanism by which these factors may increase the risk of stroke. the strong influence of these behavioral factors on hdl-c <UNK> may be part of the reason why hdl-c was not strongly associated with the risk of ischemic stroke after multivariable adjustment. indeed, after excluding these behavioral factors from the multivariable model, hdl-c was significantly associated wit risk of ischemic stroke (data not shown). in addition, postmenopausal hormone use is increasing hdl-c <UNK> and since women who use postmenopausal hormones tend to live a healthier <UNK> this confounding effect may have been further aggravated. while, with the exception of hdl-c, all lipid measures were associated with risk of ischemic stroke, non-hdl-c was the strongest statistical predictor of ischemic stroke followed by total cholesterol. this is in agreement with two recent studies that have identified non-hdl-c as a strong predictor for coronary heart <UNK> and overall cardiovascular <UNK> it has been previously shown in the whs that non-hdl-c is highly correlated <UNK> with apolipoprotein <UNK> and both are of equally strength in prediction vascular <UNK> however, with regard to risk detection, non-hdl-c may be preferred since it can be easily calculated by subtracting hdl-c from total cholesterol. strengths of our study include the large number of participants and outcome events, long follow-up period and high participation rate, detailed standardized information on many lifestyle factors, validated stroke cases with high interobserver <UNK> the reliability of our laboratory assays, as well as the homogenous nature of the cohort which reduces confounding. furthermore, our analyses were controlled for a large number of confounding factors including migraine that has recently been associated with unfavorable lipid <UNK> and is a risk factor for ischemic <UNK> several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. first, all lipid levels were only measured once and thus intra-individual variability of lipid levels is possible. however, such non-differential misclassification would likely yield to an underestimation of the lipid-ischemic stroke association in this prospective study. second, although we controlled for cholesterol lowering medication use at baseline, we did not incorporate subsequent use of such medications during follow-up. third, women who participated in the whs were all health professionals and mostly white. thus, generalizability to other populations may be limited. however, we have no reason to believe that the biological mechanisms by which unfavorable lipid profiles may affect ischemic stroke risk differs in other populations. fourth, despite adjustment for a large number of potential confounding factors, residual and unmeasured confounding remains an alternative explanation because our study is observational. the association between total cholesterol and risk of ischemic stroke has been investigated in several prior observational studies, of which some found increased risk with increasing cholesterol <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and some no clear <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a prospective study of over <UNK> korean civil servants, total cholesterol was strongly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke. for a <UNK> mmol <UNK> mg/dl) increase of total cholesterol, the relative risk of ischemic stroke was <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> and total cholesterol levels of <UNK> mmol <UNK> mg/dl) were significantly associated with stroke <UNK> the asia pacific cohort studies collaboration pooled data from <UNK> cohorts from the asia-pacific region and found a <UNK> increase in the risk of ischemic stroke for every <UNK> mmol/l <UNK> mg/dl) increase in total <UNK> the women's pooling project pooled data from <UNK> cohort studies and found a <UNK> increase in the relative risk of ischemic stroke for every <UNK> mmol/l <UNK> mg/dl) increase in total cholesterol among women aged <UNK> <UNK> in older age groups, however, there was no apparent association between total cholesterol and ischemic stroke. other studies did not find an association between total cholesterol and ischemic stroke <UNK> <UNK> this lack of association may be partly explained by evaluating only stroke <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and by controlling for markers of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a potential biological mediator by which cholesterol increase ischemic stroke <UNK> the association between ldl-c and risk of ischemic stroke has only been evaluated in few studies. a large study of over <UNK> patients with coronary heart disease showed a <UNK> increase in the relative risk of verified ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack per <UNK> mg/dl <UNK> mmol/l) increase in <UNK> in contrast, a large cohort study of over <UNK> middle-aged men and women found no consistent association between ldl-c and ischemic stroke during <UNK> years of <UNK> with regard to hdl-c, several studies found a significant association between hdl-c and ischemic stroke after adjustment for potential <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a large prospective cohort of <UNK> men, men in the top fifth percentile of hdl-c <UNK> mmol/l) had a significant <UNK> reduction in risk of nonfatal stroke when compared to the lowest fifth <UNK> a multiethnic case-control study of elderly individuals showed significant associations between hdl-c and risk of ischemic stroke after confounder <UNK> compared to participants with hdl-c values of <UNK> mg/dl <UNK> mmol/l), participants with <UNK> mg/dl <UNK> mmol/l) had odds ratio of <UNK> <UNK> ci, <UNK> the association was not modified by gender or ethnicity. overall, the published data strongly suggest that lower hdl-c levels are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke. some studies have suggested that the association between lipid levels and ischemic stroke differs within the ischemic stroke <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a health insurance-based case-control study, total cholesterol was stronger associated with ischemic strokes of the atherosclerotic and lacunar <UNK> furthermore, in that <UNK> and the previously mentioned case-control <UNK> high hdl-c levels were more strongly associated with the atherosclerotic subtype. in the whs, total cholesterol appeared also to be more strongly associated with the atherosclerotic and lacunar ischemic stroke subtype (data not shown). however, since the number of outcome events in the ischemic stroke subtype categories was small and the interrater agreement for ischemic stroke subtypes was only <UNK> our ability to assess this issue is limited. several large randomized trials among individuals with existing or at high risk for cardiovascular disease have shown that lipid lowering therapy with statins results in reduced risk of ischemic <UNK> the data of the randomized trials, the data of others, and our data strongly support the notion that lipids are a biological risk factor for ischemic stroke and that avoiding unfavorable cholesterol levels may help to prevent ischemic stroke as recommended the primary prevention guidelines of the american heart association/american stroke <UNK> our results further underscore the importance of unfavorable lipid levels as risk factor for first ischemic stroke among apparently healthy individuals without prior vascular disease.
