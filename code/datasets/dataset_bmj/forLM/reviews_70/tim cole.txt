this is a large and statistically complex analysis of the impact of the feed the future
program on the nutritional status of children from 33 countries in sub-saharan africa. i
have comments on the study design, analysis, presentation and interpretation.
1. the presentation involves two alternative formulae describing the regression models
fitted, followed by the numerical results of many such models. the reader may or may not
be comfortable with formulae, but no attempt is made to demonstrate the models visually.
the nearest the paper comes to illustrating the model is efigure 1, which shows the
regression lines for ftf and control up to 2011, i.e. before the intervention. but no
corresponding lines are shown for post-2011. so the reader has to imagine the pattern of
regression lines pre- and post-ftf to understand the model.
it is important to show both the data and the superimposed regression lines for one or
more of the regression models, to visualise the analysis and test the face validity of the fit.
the raw mean country-year data are usefully shown as a series of country facets in
efigures 2-4, but the figures are hidden away and i missed them on first reading - they
need to be in the main paper. but in addition they need to be seen in a way that allows the
model to be tested. this could be done by combining the data in each of efigures 2-4 as
two plots, superimposing the ftf countries in one plot and the controls in another. this
would allow the reader to look for an inflection in the ftf countries plot around 2011.
the fitted regression lines for each country need to be shown superimposed on the country
facets, to test the fit. in addition they could be shown combined in a single figure (without
the data), providing a visual summary of the fitted model. it would also be plausible to
provide more than one such combined figure, e.g. to contrast the impact of different
assumptions on the fitted lines.
2. the model in equations 1 and 2 assumes a step change in malnutrition following the
intervention, i.e. parallel regression lines with different intercepts before and after. but it is
unrealistic to think that the impact of the intervention will be visible on day 1, and a more
realistic model would allow the effect to build over time. this model is tested in etable 8,
but it needs to be introduced earlier on as a realistic alternative to the simpler model.
3. the study design is multilevel, actually four levels, with data from country, year within
country, household within year and child within household, yet the data are analysed with
robust standard errors at a single level. it would be useful to explain why separate errors
at the different levels are not estimated, with the intervention effect tested using the
appropriate level error. in addition the cluster level at which the standard error is

estimated varies from model to model, when surely the study design defines which level is
appropriate.
4. the data are weighted by survey design and by country population, but it’s important to
recognise that weighting may not be relevant if the study aim is purely to show the
statistical impact of the intervention. using weightings ensures that the estimated effect
sizes apply to the underlying population, but it inevitably affects the significance of the
findings. the key issue is how to interpret the study aim “to evaluate the impact of the
feed the future program”. is the impact to be measured in the effect size or the
significance of the effect size? for me the significance is what counts, and in this case
weighting is not appropriate. so the impact of weighting on the significance levels needs to
be demonstrated for one or more of the models.
5. some more minor comments. implausible observations were excluded based on who
criteria (page 7), but more detail should be given.
6. the statistical approaches section (page 8) refers to the probability of stunting, waisting
and underweight, but “probability” would be better replaced by “proportion”.
7. in equation 2 the main effect terms for ftf and post are deliberately omitted due to
collinearity. it is a fundamental principle when fitting interactions to include the main
effects as well, so this is unconvincing. a better and simpler solution would be to centre
(i.e. subtract the mean) of the ftf and post variables prior to analysis, which would
obviate the need to include the main effects.
8. the results at the top of page 13 speak of a “decrease” in prevalence associated with
ftf, implying that ftf caused it. but as an observational study this assumption is not
warranted, and the wording should be more nuanced. the next paragraph estimates the
numbers of children “prevented” from being stunted due to ftf, and here the causal
assumption needs to be explicitly stated.
9. table 3 gives results for eight different models, showing how the ftf effect size varies
according to the degree of covariate adjustment. however the models are not directly
comparable, with fewer data for models 5-8. it would be better to use the smaller sample
sizes for all eight models, allowing direct comparisons between them, and the loss of power
would be small. also the lines in the table giving n could be omitted.
a focus on levels of significance is now depracated, and the standard errors and asterisks
in table 3 would be better replaced by confidence intervals. it would work better giving the
values to one decimal place rather than two, as the extra precision is unwarranted (see
https://adc.bmj.com/content/100/7/608). the standard errors are typically 0.8 or greater,
so the confidence interval widths exceed 3. on this basis the second decimal place is
uninformative, and the same applies to the etables.
that said, the appendix includes results for 59 models (excluding the
leave-one-country-out models), and it is hard to judge them against each other. presenting
them all graphically (including those of table 3) in something like a forest plot would be
useful, and this would emphasise the message of the paper that the conclusions are
broadly robust to model perturbations.
10. the final paragraph of the results explores to what extent the ftf and control
countries were similar at baseline, as the did analysis assumes. it would make better
sense to start with this, discussing it in the context of table 2, rather than coming to it as
an afterthought. this might also be a better way to present the underlying model, by first
describing it pre-ftf and then expanding it to include the intervention.

11. i had difficulty matching the before-after effect sizes in figure 1 with those of model 8
in table 3. in fact the histograms show differences corresponding to model 1, though this
is not explained. the top lines in the figure, describing the model 8 differences, are
confusing and unhelpful.

the authors have responded positively to most of my comments, but there remain some issues that need addressing.
1 (previous point 1). the process of estimating somatotype at age 50 from bmi has been clarified, but the clarification
itself raises some points.
the paper fails to say why the age 50 somatotype needed to be estimated. the somatotypes from age 5 to 40 represent
an impressive summary of body shape tracking for the first half of life. my guess is that a value at age 50 was felt to be
needed to justify the phrase "early and middle life" in the title and elsewhere. however this is not stated, and it needs to
be.
the modelling process based on a mixed effects model is a clear improvement on the previous methodology. however it
is the wrong way round, as they authors acknowledge. the aim is to predict somatotype at age 50 from bmi and
previous somatotypes, so modelling bmi and inverting the regression equation to give somatotype is incorrect. a better
approach would be to use polytomous regression with somatotype as the dependent variable. this would avoid having to
invert the regression equation, and would also correctly predict a somatotype category at age 50 without the need to
truncate the scale.
the description of the process, although improved, still relies on the supplementary information to be clear. the second
paragraph under body shape assessment on page 8 still does not mention bmi at age 40, and it does not explain why
bmi is relevant when the main focus is on somatotype. i suggest this paragraph be completely rewritten, linking
somatotype and bmi more obviously and summarising the ages when the data were available.
2 (previous point 3). i suggested that excluding subjects with bmi < 18.5 was illogical, but the authors are keen to
remove them. i find their argument unconvincing, that such bmi's are below the normal range and hence should be
excluded. but how many bmi's were excluded as being above the normal range, and is not the conclusion of the study
that high bmi increases mortality? this is inconsistent.
the interest is in the natural history of bmi and its link to later mortality, so there is no good reason to arbitrarily omit
subjects at the extremes of the bmi range. the authors cite reverse causation to justify the exclusion, yet their design
has a built-in ten-year mortality delay (from age 50 to 60) to minimise the effects of reverse causation. i insist that
there be no exclusions based solely on low (or high) bmi.
3 (new). reviewer 2 asked for reference 24 (now 21) to include the journal name. this has been added, but the
reference is still incomplete.

<|EndOfText|>

this rewrite of 49180 is much clearer than the original, but the authors still make it hard
for the reader by their over-technical and unclear presentation. in addition they have by

mistake omitted the genotype analysis of table 5 from the results, referring to it only in
the discussion.
1. the many acronyms are unhelpful, particularly where undefined, as they make the
paper harder to read for non-specialists. just in the abstract there are tb (undefined),
hhc, dst (undefined), mdr, inh (undefined), and ds (undefined). later there are dm
(undefined), tst, pza (undefined), ipt (undefined) and drp (undefined). they should all
be defined, even tb, and many (most?) could be avoided entirely, e.g. hhc would be far
simpler and clearer as 'contacts'.
2. the paper is about drug resistance, so it is important to be clear how it is categorised.
individuals can be drug sensitive or susceptible (which? - both appear in different places)
(ds), or drug resistant (dr) or multi-drug resistant (mdr). but tables 1 and s1 also have
the categories pan-susceptible, mono-resistant, poly-resistant and multidrug-resistant. the
latter two obviously involve resistance to more than one drug, and the distinction between
them is apparently important, but it is nowhere explained. the footnote simply says that
poly-resistance is resistant to more than one drug, but not mdr. this begs the question what is mdr?
i encourage the authors to trawl through the paper identifying all the different drug
resistance categories, collect them in one section, harmonise the notation, and explain
what they all are. if this could be done without acronyms, so much the better.
3. these categories relate to the first paragraph of the results, where 1274 patients with
dsts were resistant to at least one drug; 538 to only one and 478 to both isoniazid and
rifampicin. but this leaves a further 1274 - 538 - 478 = 258 who are not mentioned at all.
this obviously relates to the categories in table 1, but because they are not explained it is
impossible to make sense of the numbers. (incidentally the acronym dts here should be
dst.)
4. page 10. "... those exposed to inh mono-resistant tb had a 15% (95% ci: 5%-16%)
higher risk of infection ...". these numbers do not appear in table 2, the relevant cell being
1.17 (1.09-1.25).
5. the terms univariate and multivariate in table 2 and elsewhere are used incorrectly.
they describe the number of dependent variables in the analysis, in this case one, i.e.
univariate. the number of independent variables is indicated by univariable/multivariable,
which should be used instead. in addition pr should be expanded to prevalence ratio, and
the abbreviated drug names need giving in full. the footnotes give percentages of missing
data in models 2 and 3, which presumably means that the number column in the table
applies only to the univariable analysis and hence is misleading. better to give the total
numbers for each analysis in the column header.
6. table 4 has tiny numbers, and looks underpowered to draw any useful conclusions.
what is the denominator for the number column, and where do the n = 10099 and 10109
come from? they are much larger than any previous numbers.
7. i was surprised to see the discussion say that "patients with dr-tb were also more
likely than those with ds-tb to be part of a cluster as defined by genotype", as up to this
point i had not seen the word "genotype". doing a formal search for it threw up table 5 on
page 58 of the submission, which is not referred to anywhere else. yet the discussion (foot
of page 8) talks about the genotype findings. clearly table 5 and its commentary have
been omitted from the results.
8. phrases relating to "statistical significance" appear in the abstract and elsewhere. there
is a global movement against such terminology, and they would be better expressed in
terms of "importance" or similar, based on the confidence interval.

9. "contacts were defined as secondary cases if diagnosed between days 15 and 455" page 7. where does the 455 days come from, as they were followed up to 12 months?
10. miru is another undefined acronym that could be explained if there was a section
describing the genotype analysis.
11. what are the reference numbers for the ethical approvals?
12. tables 1 and s1 look unnecessarily large to me. are all the covariates of interest? in
addition the formatting could be improved by presenting the numbers and percentages in
the format % (n), using whole percentages. i recommend whole percentages throughout
(see https://adc.bmj.com/content/100/7/608), as they are easier to read; the decimal
place is uninformative, and if people are desperate to know it they can calculate it from the
numbers.

the authors have responded very positively to the reviewer comments. i have just two
minor points.
1. in response to a comment about the number of decimal places for the optimal
bandwidth, the authors say "we have now rounded all bp values in the paper to the first
integer, because it is indeed measured in whole mmhg." i'm not clear what is meant by
"the first integer", do they mean that bp is rounded to one decimal place?
2. in the discussion they speculate about factors that might explain the reduction in bp,
listing weight loss, smoking, alcohol and exercise as having large effects. in each case the
coefficient is far from one but the confidence interval brackets one, so i think they mean
the confidence interval includes values that indicate a large effect (either positive or
negative). this needs to be clearer.

the authors have responded very positively to the reviewer comments. i just have three
very minor points of detail.
1. the abstract states that children not first born were excluded. this is not quite correct,
in that a few fathers will have had a child before the cohort started in january 1994. the
wording in the methods makes this clear - "the birth record of the first child born within
the cohort interval was paired to the father".
2. table 1 summarises the three groups of fathers, and in particular it shows that on
average the ivf and icsi fathers had more years of formal education. this is of course
adjusted for in the analyses, but it might still be worth pointing out.
3. and a very tiny point - on page 10 line 183 it should be "sensitivity analyses _were_
conducted".

the paper is considerably improved on revision, with a much clearer message. i have a few
minor comments.
1. the dataset consisted of people receiving oat between 01/01/1996 and 30/11/2017.
given that the paper's main message relates to recent changes in the patterns of opioid use
and mortality due to fentanyl, would it be worthwhile extending the dataset to include more
recent data, if they are available?
2. mortality risk is calculated in groups of time since starting treatment, with the latest group
>12 weeks. it seems odd that this group is open-ended - is there an upper limit for the time
since starting treatment?
3. section 3.4 of the results has a focus on the statistical significance of differences between
rates which is now deprecated by the bmj. please rephrase this section in terms of clinically
important differences, and avoid reference to significance where possible.

4. table 1 refers to "mental health" as oud-related comorbidity. this should surely be
"mental ill health". also the acronym oud has survived the revision, as it has in a couple of
places in the supplementary material.
5. the smr scale in figure 1 is nonlinear but not the expected log scale. the gap between 10
and 20 is much greater than between 90 and 100, but if it were logged the distance from 1
to 10 should match that from 10 to 100, which it clearly does not. it looks like a square root
scale instead. i recommend the use of a log scale, perhaps a log2 scale with numbers in
powers of 2 in the sequence:, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 etc.
6. similarly in figure 2 it is entirely unclear whether and how the smr scale is transformed,
as it only has two numbers. please improve it in line with figure 1, and ensure the scale
includes 1.
7. figure 3 would be better in colour (at least in the pdf).
8, the first line of section a2.1: word missing?
9. section a2.3.1: the word 'identity" should be "identify".

the revision is considerably improved, with a clear structure and message. i have a couple
of minor observations.
1. the many acronyms complicate the story. it may be that they are familiar to the target
audience, but i personally would be happier with fewer of them.
2. the figures now are much clearer. i suggest in figure 1 omitting the all columns, to
match figures 4-6, and reversing the legend to reflect the graph.

the authors have responded fully and very positively to all the reviewer comments made. with
one exception they have addressed all my concerns.
1. i pointed out that the plethora of confidence intervals and percentages to two decimal places
made the results much less readable. in response the authors have removed some of the cis,
but the percentages all still have two decimal places. i have argued that generally speaking
percentages are best with no decimal places except when comparing very similar percentages
(see http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/archdischild-2014-307149). to justify two decimal
places the percentages would need to be equal to the first decimal place, which is never the
case. i encourage the authors to reduce the numbers of decimal places, either to 0 or 1
depending on the context.
incidentally, the statement that cis for aucs allow the models to be compared ignores the fact
that cis for the difference between aucs would be more appropriate. also, note that table 2
refers to auc 95% cis which are no longer there.
2. the authors have added in table 3 a net reclassification analysis. however i find both the
layout and the numbers in the table hard to follow. it refers to 10% high risk and low risk
groups, so the low risk group should be labelled as 90% of the total and the high risk group as
10%, with corresponding totals of 949333 and 105482. the denominator of 1054815 should
also appear in the title. having decoded these numbers i have failed to calculate the nris labelling the cells of the 2x2 table as a-b-c-d in the usual way, what is the formula for the nri?
the description refers to rates of events correctly and incorrectly reclassified, but does not
make clear which denominators apply. also the rows within the low risk and high risk categories
are reversed, presumably corresponding to non-events and events for low risk, but the reverse
for high risk. they need to be labelled, and consistently. the table layout would be improved
with the nri-ne row immediately below the low risk table.

<|EndOfText|>

the systematic review shows clearly that current risk prediction models for hospital
readmission have a long way to go before they become practically useful. the quality and
quantity of relevant data are uneven, and the c-statistics currently achieved are mostly
below 0.8 and hence reflect poor performance.
1. i wonder if the authors might discuss the c-statistic, what it means in practice and how
large it would need to be before the models would be useful. i note they responded to
reviewers "we would hypothesize that the inclusion of these features in some of the

predictive models that we have identified in our systematic review could potentially raise the
c-statistic over the 0.8 threshold to be considered a strong predictive model." this implies
that they view a c-statistic of above 0.8 as useful, but is that really true? i acknowledge the
crude c-statistic classification that says >0.8 is a good model, but this may still reflect a
sensitivity or specificity that is too low to be clinically useful.
2. related to this, i am unclear how the outputs of these models are to be used. if a patient
is thought to be at high risk of readmission, what exactly is the hospital to do about it? this
also relates to the actionability of the models, i.e. whereabouts in the patient's hospital stay
the information becomes available. of course the authors may not have much to say about
this, but if they do it would be helpful to hear.
3. the acronym sdoh is introduced and used in the abstract and main text, but it is entirely
unmemorable and would be better avoided.
4. a tiny point - it should be cox regression not cox regression.

the authors have responded positively to all my comments, and table 3 in particular is now
much clearer.
i have a few further minor comments, which are more copy editing than statistical.
1. table 2 contains small numbers labelled std following the auc values. they are said to be
standard deviations, but are far too small for that. i suggest omitting them, as in supplements
5 and 6.
2. data are generally plural, and such phrases as "data contains", "data ... is", "data does",
"data was" etc need attention.
3. start of discussion. the main findings are principal not principle findings.
4. page 42 line 9. i think it should be humerus not humerous.

the authors have addressed many of my points, but there remain some matters of concern.
1. table 1 summarises the cities in the analysis, giving mean daily pm10 and mortality. an important
but unaddressed question is to what extent the mean pm10 scores in the different cities explain
variation in mean mortality. i recognise that this is different from the main focus of the paper, the
association between short-term changes in pm10 and mortality, but it is nevertheless fundamental to
the research question - are mortality and pm10 linked?
the mean daily deaths by city in table 1 are unhelpful as they reflect population size more than
anything else. i would like to see a plot of age-sex-standardised mortality vs mean pm10 by city, i.e.
making use of the information in table sm2.
2. the fixed effects model (1) is described in great detail, whereas the random effects model (foot of
page 9) is poorly described. does it contain just the pm10 term in equation (1) omitting the other
terms, or are the other terms included but applied to all cities? this needs to be made clear. also it's
not clear whether the fixed or random effects coefficients are being used in later analyses.
3. there is no need to apply a chi-square test to figure 2, as the i2 value summarises heterogeneity.
also using p = 0 or p = 0.000 is wrong, it should be p < 0.001 - this applies throughout.
4. the discussion of the different lags in figures 2 and sm1 to sm6 does not state whether using lagged
pm10 in addition to concurrent pm10 added significantly. i'm not convinced that figures sm1 to sm7
add usefully to the paper, as they are hard to compare with each other. a table summarising the results
for each lag or combination of lags should be provided.
5. figures 3 and 4 rank the cities in the same order, but differently from figure 2. better to use the
figure 2 order for figures 3 and 4 as well. the i2 value for figure 3 is virtually the same as for figure 2
(59%), whereas that for figure 4 is appreciably smaller (38%). this is worth commenting on, as it
shows that the cities are more homogeneous for non-crd than for crd mortality.
6. putting the various summary regression coefficients on pages 7-9 into a table rather than the text
would make them easier to see and compare. the comparisons for sex and age group give the separate
coefficients with cis, but for comparison purposes the difference (i.e. the interaction with pm10) and its
ci should be provided - to say that the separate cis overlap is not sufficient. also, to say that the pm10
effect was (just) significant for those over 60 and not for those under 60 does not make the age groups
significantly different - again the interaction term should be fitted with its ci. (the authors' response
letter says that this age interaction is significant at p < 0.1, i.e. not significant).
7. using subgroups by sex and age group strikes me as both inefficient and potentially biased. if say the
sexes are analysed separately then all the coefficients in equation (1) will differ by sex, and those that
are correlated with pm10 (say weather conditions) will impact on the pm10 coefficient. far better to
include the sex and age terms in equation (1), which will also allow their interaction to be tested. this
relates to point 2 above.
8. the paper still focuses unnecessarily on statistical significance. on page 9 lines 48-50 the phrase "...
and statistically significant at the 5-percent level" is both redundant and wrong - it is considerably more
significant than that.
9. the notes with figures sm9 and sm10 refer to "total mortality for cardiorespiratory and noncardiorespiratory deaths separately" which look incorrect.
10. the comments above also apply to the city analyses for mean pm10, north vs south, gdp and %
construction workers. the results need to be to presented as coefficients with confidence intervals, and
when comparing groups (e.g. figure sm 12) the interactions with ci should also be given. several of the
figures demonstrate the existence of one or more high outliers, which will bias the regression
coefficient. urumqi in figure 1 is also a notable western outlier that needs to be acknowledged.
11. to say that air pollution effects were smaller in more polluted cities (figure sm11) is not correct the p value of 0.07 is not significant. it should be made clear here that the "air pollution effect" is the
city pm10 regression coefficient. again i don't know if this is the fixed or random city effect.
12. table 3 needs some attention. the constant terms are of no interest and should be omitted. why
are there only 18 cities for model 2 but 38 for all the others? confidence intervals should be given for

each coefficient, not p values. the numbers should be given to 2 or 3 significant digits, not 3 decimal
places. the north vs south analysis should be given as the main effect (say north) and the difference
between north and south. is there any reason why sex and age are not included in the table?
presenting the results of six distinct models is excessive - better to focus on model (6) including mean
pm10, north, south vs north, gdp, % construction, and perhaps sex and age group as well.
13. the discussion repeats several erroneous statements from the results. there is not a significant
age effect (at least it has not been shown), there is no sex effect (it is not significant), the air pollution
effects were not smaller in more polluted cities (p = 0.07), also they were not more homogenous in
northern cities than in southern cities (again the interaction is not shown to be significant), and the
association with gdp was far from significant. there are also statements about significance at the 5%
level that should be omitted. the only convincing association in table 3 is that for the percentage of
construction workers.

the authors use two large cohorts to construct five shape trajectory groups from age 5 to 50, and then
compare mortality in the diffferent groups. i have some comments on the study design, analysis and
presentation.
1. the key exposure here is the recalled somatotype at ages 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40, and the corresponding
rating at age 50 is inferred from the age 40 rating. the way this is done strikes me as clunky, based on
just the previous rating and ignoring the earlier ones. it also requires the age 40 rating to be present to
estimate the age 50 rating. since the purpose is to represent shape over the life course it would surely be
better to use all the available shape ratings and bmi at 40 to impute the age 50 rating.
the description on page 39 implies, though does not state, that bmi was measured at ages 40 and 50:
“…we assessed the average bmi from age 47 to 53 as the bmi for age 50. we then divided bmi at these
two ages into 9 categories”. which two ages?
“the cutoff points for each category were calculated as the median bmi of this category at age 40 plus a
constant to account for weight gain from age 40 to 50”. but why use the median as the upper cut-off,
which will misclassify half those in the group? surely one needs cutoffs midway between the group
medians?
also, using a single value of 1.5 kg/m2 for 10-year bmi gain ignores the fact that bmi is increasing over
time in some groups but not in others. the calculation needs to take into account all the available
information on individual trajectories.
2. related to this, figure 1 shows that 28% of individuals were excluded as they had “missing somatotype
data for more than two different age points”, or put more simply, fewer than 4 somatotypes. this serious
data loss strikes me as unnecessary – figure 1 shows that the group trajectories are essentially linear
(despite the cubic fit), which means that anyone with 2 or more somatotypes could reasonably be
analysed. even requiring a minimum of 3 ought to reduce the dropout appreciably.
3. a second data exclusion is for bmi < 18.5 kg/m2. i can see that this is meant to reduce reverse
causation, but since the whole purpose is to model bmi, it seems illogical to omit individuals whose bmi is
arbitrarily low. in any case the numbers involved are tiny and will make no difference to the results.
4. related to point 6 above, the essential linearity of the group trajectories indicates that a simple randomslope-random-intercept model would lead to broadly the same conclusions, and the relative size of the
slope and intercept random effects in predicting mortality would quantify the importance of mean bmi
versus bmi gain.
5. is there a way to superimpose on the group trajectories of figure 1 the mean bmi values appearing in
table 1? it would provide some validation of the group allocation.
6. the hazard ratios in tables 2 and subsequently are adjusted for a string of covariates including lifestyle
factors such as physical activity, alcohol consumption and dietary score. are these factors not on the causal
pathway, and hence should not be adjusted for? the research question involves the shape trajectories
versus mortality, which must be due at least in part to lifestyle differences – so why adjust for them if the
interest is in the trajectories themselves?
7. table 2 shows that for deaths due to stroke in women smokers (though not in men), groups 3 and 4 are

significantly protected relative to the lean-stable group. this is surely worth a mention.
8. the interaction in figure 2b is said to be insignificant (p = 0.46), yet the two trends look strikingly
different, and much more so than in figures 2a and 2c. is it correct? it’s not entirely clear what sort of
interaction has been fitted – i assume it's comparing the linear trends across shape groups in the two
diabetes groups.

the authors have addressed all the reviewer points to my satisfaction. i have two extremely minor
further observations.
1. page 15 line 435 includes three citations with full names that can be omitted.
2. the last line of table 4 gives the range of observed/expected ratios. including the median as well
would be useful.

the authors have responded very positively to the reviewer comments, in particular
shifting the time of matching to the time of receiving fenofibrate, and restricting the ps
analysis to data at the same time. however there remain a few points that need
addressing.
1. it's useful to understand why the fenofibrate group mortality appeared to be zero in the
first three months. i'm not sure though that starting the mortality clock at 3 months, i.e.
moving the km curve back 3 months solves the problem. would it not be better to start the
fenofibrate clock when treatment started, and the benefit of fenofibrate would then
gradually appear during the 3 months? the statistical methods do not mention excluding
outcome events in the first 3 months.

2. the results show a significant effect of fenofibrate on the composite coronary events
outcome. in figure 3 this difference is tested in no fewer than 12 subgroup analyses, which
are not described in the statistical methods so it is unclear if the analyses were
prespecified. the conclusion is that high tg and/or low hdl-c patients particularly benefit
from fenofibrate. however figure 3 also includes p-values for interaction, and none of them
are significant, particularly for the constructed tg/hdl-c comparison where p = 0.2. so
there are no grounds for claiming that fenofibrate benefits one patient group over another
(the discussion acknowledges the non-significant interaction p-value). these claims in the
abstract and results cannot be justified and should be removed.
3. previously i said "the hr axis in figure 3 should be on a log scale, so that for example
0.5 and 2 are equally distant from 1." unfortunately the authors have taken this to mean
presenting the log hr, which few readers will understand. please give the hr in hr units
(not log), but use a log scale for the axis so that 0.5 and 2 are equally distant from 1.
4. some smaller points of presentation. the abstract states that patients were "matched
up to 1:5". this is unclear, and i suggest instead something like "patients on combined
therapy were matched with up to 5 patients on monotherapy".
5. it's not clear why the abstract quotes the non-significant hazard ratios for chd and is,
as they are not the primary outcome. and as already stated, the last sentence of the
abstract results should be omitted. the same applies to the second item under what this
study adds.
6. the results section of risk of major cardiovascular events could be rearranged to
advantage. the first paragraph could cite table 2 instead of repeating the relevant
numbers in the text, and then point out that none of the three components of the
composite score are significant. then the second paragraph can say the composite score is
significant, without needing to mention the separate components. line 9 on page 12 can
also be omitted, abut the insignificance and small numbers.
7. the last sentence of the results describes a slight but not significant difference in the
proportion of patients with high creatinine. if it's not significant i'm unclear why it is worth
highlighting.
8. the discussion first sentence suggests that the benefit of fenofibrate was achieved
mainly by preventing chd. this is true in the sense that the numbers of events in the two
groups were most different for chd. however the hr for chd was larger than for is or
mortality, so actually its impact was less. i suggest omitting that phrase.
9. the p-values would be better presented to one significant digit, see
https://adc.bmj.com/content/100/7/608. and the percentages in the tables would be
easier to read given in the format % (n) with the percentage as a whole number.

the systematic review looks to be well done, and makes a good case for working with
incidence rather than prevalence, but the results are poorly presented.
1. the research question relates to the mean time trend in diabetes incidence, but nowhere
is this shown - it is all described in the text as numbers of papers showing rising and falling
trends in different epochs. the attached graph summarises table 3 by coding papers with
rising incidence as +1, falling incidence as -1 and level as 0, and it gives the mean score
for each epoch with the symbol reflecting the number of papers it's based on. the authors
argue that table 3 shows falling incidence, but for the most recent time period it is flat (12
papers falling, 12 rising, 9 level). in addition there is little evidence of a long-term trend
from the regression line, with higher trends from 1990 to 2005 but lower trends before
1990.
2. i encourage the authors to rethink their conclusions based on the figure, as it weakens
their case that "the incidence of diagnosed diabetes has been stable or falling in the
majority of populations studied since 2006". their complicated treatment of grouping that
contrasts rising with stable/falling means that the value of zero trend for 2006/14 does not
emerge clearly.

3. the plots for individual countries by age group in figures 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d show very
erratic values for us_cdc from year to year, which are hard to understand given the large
sample sizes.
4. it strikes me as very optimistic to think that the falling incidence (if true) is due to
treatment.
5. the incidence data should be plotted on log scales to include all the data in one plot.
6. the authors need to explain the joinpoint analyses.
7. table 2 could be traffic-light-colour-coded to distinguish between rising, level and falling
trends.
8. table 4 would be better without the p-values as they obscure the trend values.
alternatively do present the p-values to one significant digit - see
https://adc.bmj.com/content/100/7/608.
