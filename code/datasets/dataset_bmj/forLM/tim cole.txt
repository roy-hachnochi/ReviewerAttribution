after the rct: who comes to a family-based intervention for childhood overweight or obesity when it is implemented at scale in the community? methods the mend <UNK> (mind, exercise, nutrition…do it!) programme is a family-based weight management intervention for childhood overweight and obesity implemented at scale in the community. we compare the characteristics of children referred to the mend programme <UNK> <UNK> referred to <UNK> programmes) with those of the population eligible for the intervention, and assess what predicts completion of the intervention. results compared to the mend-eligible population, proportionally more children who started mend were: obese rather than overweight excluding obese; girls; asian; from families with a lone parent; living in less favourable socioeconomic circumstances; and living in urban rather than rural or suburban areas. having started the programme, children were relatively less likely to complete it if they: reported ‘abnormal’ compared to ‘normal’ levels of psychological distress; were boys; were from lone parent families; lived in less favourable socioeconomic circumstances; and had participated in a relatively large mend programme group; or where managers had run more programmes. conclusions the provision and/or uptake of mend did not appear to compromise and, if anything, promoted participation of those from disadvantaged circumstances and ethnic minority groups. however, this tendency was diminished because programme completion was less likely for those living in less favourable socioeconomic circumstances. further research should explore how completion rates of this intervention could be improved for particular groups. introduction overweight and obesity has been described as the primary childhood health problem in developed <UNK> in <UNK> estimates from uk data showed that a third of children aged between <UNK> and <UNK> were overweight or obese, with prevalence among those living in the most deprived circumstances double that of those living in the least <UNK> while prevalence may be <UNK> <UNK> the costs for children and families, health services and society remain <UNK> research on weight management programmes for children who are already overweight or obese has tended to focus on the effectiveness of interventions under research conditions. these studies suggest that family-based interventions may result in moderate reductions in body mass index <UNK> however the population impact on health and health inequalities of such interventions, when implemented at scale, depends not only on how effective the intervention itself is, but also on who receives <UNK> <UNK> for example, families living in more favourable socioeconomic circumstances may be more likely to access and adhere to services which support behaviour <UNK> <UNK> to understand whether implementation is successful, evidence is needed about who is referred to, who starts and who completes potentially effective interventions delivered at scale in the community in relation to the population in <UNK> <UNK> recent work mapping weight management interventions for overweight or obese <UNK> identified approximately <UNK> schemes operational around <UNK> in england. in this paper we examine the largest of these schemes, mend <UNK> (mend—mind, exercise, nutrition do it!) in order to achieve two objectives: first, to explore whether the sociodemographic characteristics of mend participants match those of the population eligible for the intervention; and second, to estimate what characteristics of children, their families and neighbourhoods are associated with completion of a mend programme. further <UNK> on the differential <UNK> and economic costs of attending mend, and its salience and acceptability to families and <UNK> are reported elsewhere. methods mend intervention mend is a multicomponent family-based community intervention which aims to support families of overweight or obese children (hereafter referred to as overweight, defined as exceeding the <UNK> centile of bmi <UNK> of the uk <UNK> growth <UNK> to adopt and sustain healthier lifestyles. the intervention was demonstrated to be effective in reducing bmi of obese children after <UNK> and <UNK> months in a randomised controlled <UNK> the intervention addresses diet and physical activity through education, skills training and motivational enhancement. owing to the importance of family involvement for behaviour change, the intervention requires a parent or carer to attend all <UNK> sessions and the mend intervention was developed to be delivered in community settings such as schools or leisure <UNK> children are eligible if they are aged between <UNK> and <UNK> years old and overweight although those aged <UNK> <UNK> when they were referred were included in the analyses. mend had two operating arms in the uk: mend central, a limited company, and mend places, a not-for-profit company originally set up to provide a route for donations to subsidise places for families on the mend programme. when the data for our study were collected, mend central described itself as a social enterprise—an ethical business which aims to benefit society in general. all those commissioning mend between <UNK> and <UNK> placed funding through mend central. families did not pay to attend the programme, places were funded by a variety of organisations including: the uk big lottery fund <UNK> nhs primary care trusts <UNK> non-governmental organisations <UNK> and other non-profit making organisations and a private company <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> the mend intervention was implemented on a large scale, with programmes rolled out across all regions of england (see figure <UNK> for more details). families referred to the programme contacted mend (‘referrals’)—whereupon mend logged the child's age and sex, and the family postcode, collecting no other data. families who went on to attend one or more sessions (‘starters’) also had sociodemographic and other data collected. the intervention was delivered in local programmes by ‘delivery partner’ organisations. intervention content and training was provided to delivery partners by mend central. the height, weight and psychological distress of participants were measured at the first and penultimate sessions of each mend programme. delivery partners were trained to measure height and weight (which was used to calculate bmi) and also recorded individual attendance of each participant at each session. psychological distress was reported by parents using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire <UNK> parents also reported the participant's ethnicity (white, asian, black and other) and family socioeconomic circumstances including: family structure (lone parent/carer, couple parents/carers); housing tenure (owner occupied, social rented, private rented); and employment status of the ‘primary earner’ (employed, unemployed). delivery partners recorded data in an online database collated by mend central. for this study, a copy of this database for the period january <UNK> to december <UNK> was transferred to university college london (ucl) institute of child health for analysis. the full unit postcode of each mend participant's residential address was used to assign each address to its respective lower super output area (lsoa). each lsoa was then linked to a measure of neighbourhood deprivation (deciles of the income deprivation affecting children index (idaci) <UNK> idaci measures the percentage of income-deprived households (those in receipt of means-tested benefits such as jobseekers allowance or child tax credits) with children aged <UNK> in the lsoa. deciles of the index were calculated relative to the deprivation ranking of all english lsoas; participants in decile <UNK> live in the <UNK> most deprived areas in england. we also linked a national urban/rural status (urban, suburban, rural) <UNK> to each lsoa. mend data were used to derive how many children attended each mend programme (hereafter referred to as ‘programme group size’) and the number of programmes which a local programme manager had managed. in the absence of an agreed definition of completion for family-based interventions for childhood <UNK> children were considered to have completed the programme (‘completers’) if they had attended more than <UNK> (more than <UNK> out of <UNK> of sessions. data were complete for bmi, postcode (and so all variables related to residence in lsoas) and programme level variables. starters and completers were missing data for the following variables (percentages reported for starters): baseline sdq <UNK> ethnicity <UNK> family structure <UNK> housing tenure <UNK> employment status <UNK> and percentage of sessions attended <UNK> we followed the guidelines of sterne et <UNK> for the analysis and reporting of missing data. full details are given in the supplement and summarised here. first, those with complete and incomplete data were statistically different, although differences were small. second, missingness varied between mend programmes. third, excluding all those with any missing data from the mend data would have reduced the sample (and therefore the statistical power to estimate proportions) from <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> to minimise bias, adjust for multilevel missingness, and maximise power, we used a multilevel multiple imputation model. the model assumed that data were missing at random; the rationale for this is described in the supplement along with the variables included in the model and the reasons for their inclusion. ten imputed data sets were produced, analysed separately and results combined using rubin's <UNK> to test whether our findings were influenced by using imputed data we also conducted sensitivity analyses, including analysis using complete case data with and without the variable describing parental employment status, where missingness was particularly high. statistical analysis we described the population eligible for mend (‘the mend-eligible population’) using the health survey for england (hse), an annual, nationally representative cross-sectional survey of english children and <UNK> we did this by pooling the data from the <UNK> to <UNK> surveys for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who were overweight <UNK> after exclusion of those where valid bmi data was missing <UNK> all analyses accounted for the hse complex survey design and sample weights. the sociodemographic characteristics of children participating in mend were compared with those in the mend-eligible population. differences in percentages, and their statistical significance levels were calculated (mend-eligible subtracted from mend). the social gradient of residence by idaci was compared graphically and tested using linear regression with an interaction term included to test the statistical significance of differences between slopes. we estimated multilevel (participants clustered within programmes) poisson regression <UNK> to assess whether completion was associated with baseline (ie, at the first session) age, sex, ethnicity, psychological distress, bmi, family structure, housing tenure, parental employment status, idaci and urban/rural status. unadjusted relative risks (urr) of completion were first estimated in a set of single variable models. where urrs were significant at the <UNK> level, these variables were retained in a multivariable model to allow estimation of adjusted relative risks (arr). the following software was used: <UNK> (multilevel multiple imputation model), <UNK> and <UNK> (multilevel poisson regression models), and stata <UNK> (all other analyses). parents gave informed written consent for their child to participate in the mend programme and for their data to be used after anonymisation. approval for the transfer of the anonymised data from mend to researchers at the ucl institute of child health, and for the secondary analysis of these data was granted by the ucl ethics committee in october <UNK> (ref <UNK> results between january <UNK> and december <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> referrals contacted mend, <UNK> <UNK> of whom had complete data (see figure <UNK> a total of <UNK> <UNK> of these were starters (attended at least one session) and of these <UNK> were completers (attended more than <UNK> of sessions). compared to the mend-eligible population, proportionally more mend referrals were girls and from urban areas while fewer were from suburban or rural areas (table <UNK> as would be expected, given the social gradient in childhood overweight, proportionally more of both mend-eligible children and mend referrals lived in more deprived compared to less deprived areas but this social gradient was significantly more pronounced for mend referrals (test for interaction <UNK> figure <UNK> social gradients of those referred to mind, exercise, nutrition do it!

that, having started a mend programme, completion was significantly associated with psychological distress at baseline, sex, family structure, housing tenure, employment status, idaci <UNK> programme

reported by parents as having ‘abnormal’ rather than ‘normal’ levels of psychological distress; were boys; were from lone parent rather than couple parent families; lived in social or private rented rather than owner occupied accommodation; lived in a family where the primary earner was unemployed rather than employed; were resident in lsoas in more deprived idaci <UNK> deciles rather than less deprived; participated in a relatively large mend programme group; or participated in a programme led by a manager who had run a relatively high number of programmes. in the absence of an agreed definition of completion we re-estimated the multivariable model with completion defined as attending more than <UNK> of sessions. findings were similar to those observed for completion defined as attendance at more than <UNK> of sessions (data not shown). we repeated all analyses with complete case data to test sensitivity of findings to imputation and specifically to the high proportion of missing data on employment status. findings were similar to those using imputed data (see online supplementary section <UNK> discussion our results showed that in comparison to the mend-eligible population, proportionally more children who started or completed mend lived in less favourable socioeconomic circumstances (indicated by employment of primary earner, family structure and housing tenure). relative to the mend-eligible population, proportionally more of those who started or completed a mend programme were girls, asian and urban dwelling and proportionally fewer were of white or ‘other’ ethnicity. finally, relative to the mend-eligible population, proportionally more mend participants were obese rather than overweight but not obese. these differences may have arisen from differential uptake or differential provision of mend but we did not have data to investigate this further. in contrast, for those who started a mend programme, those living in less favourable socioeconomic circumstances were less likely to complete it, as were boys and those reporting ‘abnormal’ levels of psychological distress at baseline. completion of a mend programme was also less likely if the programme group size was relatively high and if the programme manager was more experienced. completion was not associated with baseline bmi, age or ethnic group. however, these relative differences in completion rates were not sufficient to remove the tendency for starters and completers overall to be less advantaged than the mend-eligible population. strengths and limitations we used data from a family-based intervention for childhood overweight which had been implemented at scale in the community. this was an unusual opportunity to assess how an intervention which has been found to be effective in a research setting is provided and accessed in the ‘real world’. in addition, the large scale implementation meant that the data set was sufficiently large to precisely estimate proportions for each sociodemographic group and factors associated with predictors of completion of the programme. the mend data were collected for service rather than research purposes and, as is common in service data, data quality was variable, with considerable missing data. we carried out extensive data cleaning procedures to maximise the quality of the data that we analysed. we also used imputed data obtained from a multilevel multiple imputation model to mitigate systematic bias and increase the precision of estimates. we also ran analyses with both complete case and imputed analyses to show that the overall conclusions we drew were the same. we used a robust, nationally representative survey (hse) to estimate the population of children in england who would theoretically be eligible for the mend intervention, and compare the characteristics of this population ‘in need’ with those who were referred to, started or completed a mend programme. the lone parent and employment status variables were not coded identically in mend and the hse. however, our results using the lone parent and employment variables were consistent with those using the idaci <UNK> measure which was standard in both mend and hse data sets. we repeated our hse-mend comparison, substituting two other contemporaneous nationally representative data sets in turn in the place of the hse. the millennium cohort study sweep <UNK> was nationally representative for overweight children in england aged <UNK> years old in <UNK> and, when compared to mend participants of the same age, findings were similar to the hse-mend comparison (eg, proportionally more children living in less favourable circumstances among the mend participants than in the millennium cohort). the national child measurement <UNK> was nationally representative for overweight children in england in school year <UNK> <UNK> years old) in the years <UNK> and, when compared to mend children of the same age, findings were again similar to the hse-mend comparison. these sensitivity analyses (data not shown) showed that our findings were robust to how we assessed the population who would be eligible for mend. comparison with other studies differential provision or uptake of interventions both have the potential to generate, maintain, widen or decrease health <UNK> <UNK> we found no research which compared the sociodemographic characteristics of participants in a family-based community intervention for childhood overweight with the population in need, although a similar analysis has been outlined in an evaluation framework for an australian weight management scheme for <UNK> our findings that the sociodemographic characteristics of mend participants marginally over-represent families living in more deprived areas are consistent with previous work on smoking <UNK> and coronary heart disease <UNK> however, we are not aware of similar work in services for children's health. relatively few published studies have considered who ‘drops out’ or completes children's weight management interventions, and a review of this work suggests that study designs (including intervention type) and findings are heterogeneous and typically based in research or clinical <UNK> this study adds to this evidence base because it was based on a large data set who received a family-based community intervention for childhood overweight following implementation at scale in the community (as opposed to in a research setting). consistent with smaller scale studies of attrition in paediatric weight management interventions delivered predominantly in clinical settings, we found that completion was less likely among participants living in less favourable socioeconomic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> no families had to pay for the mend programme and so direct financial costs of participation would not explain differential completion by socioeconomic status. however, indirect costs of participation to families and the amount of time available to parents to take children to programmes may have explained some of these <UNK> this reinforces concerns that the acceptability of, or adherence to, services is worse for those from less advantaged circumstances and may indicate that services still need to develop and adapt to meet the needs of these families. conclusions the provision and/or uptake of mend did not appear to compromise and, if anything, promoted participation of those from more disadvantaged circumstances and from ethnic minority groups. this suggests that participation in mend, when it was implemented at scale across england, had the potential to make a contribution to tackling health inequalities. however, this potential was diminished to some extent because; having started a programme, completion was relatively less likely for those participants living in less favourable socioeconomic circumstances. it was also less likely for boys. further research should explore why this occurs, and investigate how completion rates could be improved for these groups. approaches to this may include using survival analysis to examine critical points where exit from the programme is more likely. mend programmes have been implemented across a number of income rich countries beyond england, including wales, denmark, australia, new zealand, usa and canada and so the results from this study may be generalisable to these countries. we do not know to what extent our findings are generalisable to other weight management or community interventions. assessment of the reach of interventions (of any kind) when implemented at scale is likely to be based on service or routine data, and such data are likely to have higher levels of missingness than research data. we hope that the publication of these findings will stimulate further exploration of such data to determine what happens when research is put into practice in community settings. what is already known on this subject differential referral to, participation in and completion of interventions have the potential to generate, maintain, decrease or widen inequalities in health. childhood overweight and obesity are already socially patterned so the potential for interventions to widen inequalities is of particular concern. the sociodemographic characteristics of participants in weight management randomised controlled trials may not reflect those of the population who would be eligible for the intervention if it was implemented at scale. what this study adds compared to those eligible for the intervention, proportionally more girls, children who lived in less favourable socioeconomic circumstances and asian children started and completed mind, exercise, nutrition do it! (mend). in contrast, having started a mend programme, children were relatively less likely to complete it if they lived in less favourable socioeconomic circumstances and were boys. there were no differences in completion by ethnic group. participation in mend, when it was implemented at scale across england, had the potential to make a contribution to tackling health inequalities. however, this potential was diminished to some extent because, having started a programme, completion was relatively less likely for participants living in less favourable socioeconomic circumstances.

randomised crossover trial of rate feedback and force during chest compressions for paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation outcome measures primary: compression rate. secondary: compression and residual forces. results rate of chest compressions (compressions per minute (compressions per minute; cpm)) varied widely (mean (sd) <UNK> <UNK> range <UNK> with a fourfold difference in variation during session <UNK> between those receiving and not receiving feedback <UNK> <UNK> vs <UNK> <UNK> the interaction of session by feedback order was highly significant, indicating that this difference

the forces required may differ with growth, but such variation treating one manikin is alarming. feedback technologies additionally measuring force (effort) could help to standardise and define effective treatments throughout childhood. what this study adds? this form of visual feedback reduced excessive rates and brought performance into the prescribed range. the study revealed more than a fourfold variation in compression forces used by professionals to treat one manikin, independent of the rate of chest compression. in the clinical scenario, the highest compression <UNK> n) and

prevent full chest recoil in anaesthetised children, decrease coronary perfusion pressure, and elevate intrathoracic and right atrial <UNK> the authors of that study reported that these clinically important haemodynamic effects warranted further study. we are aware of no subsequent paediatric publications on chest compression force. we therefore devised a technique to measure dynamic force and provide feedback on the rate of chest compressions for paediatric cpr. we conducted a randomised, crossover trial to examine the impact of visual feedback on the rate of chest compressions and to explore any secondary effects of rate feedback on the load profile (compression and residual forces). we hypothesised that visual feedback would bring performance closer to international guidelines, secondarily reducing any variation in force. methods creation of appropriate technology the researchers defined the specifications of a sensor-mat system to measure and provide visual feedback on the rate of chest compressions for cpr in children. the commissioned device measured dynamic pressure and force using <UNK> individually calibrated capacitive sensors, each sensor measuring <UNK> <UNK> mm (pliance <UNK> analyzer, novel gmbh, munich, germany) (figure <UNK> the lightweight mat was <UNK> mm thick, conforming fully to the convexity of the chest, sampled at a frequency of <UNK> hz over a

resuscitation training (conducted by dw). consort diagram summarising the randomised rescuers' protocol progression. equipment a paediatric manikin (laerdal medical, new york, usa) with an estimated age of <UNK> years was secured supine on an akron hi-low plinth (hne akron, ipswich, uk, figure <UNK> chest compressions were applied directly through the sensor-mat which was taped in a standardised position to the lower half of the manikin's sternum. the measurement system included the sensor-mat, an electronic interface and a laptop computer for data acquisition and feedback display. protocol rescuers applied compressions to the paediatric manikin for two sessions. they were informed that this was a compressions-only resuscitation simulation, requiring no airway management and that the researcher would prompt each phase using ‘start’ and ‘stop’ voice cues. using a computer-generated code list, each rescuer was randomised to receive visual feedback during either the first or the second of the two sessions (rkg). henceforth, those receiving feedback in the first session will be called the ‘feedback first’ group and those receiving feedback in the second session the ‘control first’ group. the rescuers were given two sets of information. first, they were to continue chest compressions without interruption during each of the three <UNK> min phases per session, resting for <UNK> min between phases and for <UNK> min between sessions. they were reminded of the recommended rate <UNK> cpm), and advised to offload fully between compressions. rescuers practised five chest compressions on the manikin and were encouraged to adjust the plinth to suit their height. separately, immediately before each rescuer's feedback session, they were instructed in the visual feedback system. a beat-on-beat, colour-coded three-dimensional <UNK> dynamic pressure profile was also demonstrated. it was emphasised that, since no recommendations exist on the most effective forces to be applied to children, they should deliver what they considered appropriate for a <UNK> child to depress the chest according to the <UNK> outcome measures the primary outcome measure was the rate of compressions, expressed as cpm. secondary outcomes were the compression and residual forces. statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted with spss, <UNK> data were collected in the three phases per session <UNK> recordings); the phases were then averaged by session, resulting in <UNK> measures, two per rescuer. the effect of providing feedback on rate was estimated using univariable and multivariable linear mixed-effects models, with fixed effects for session number and randomisation order (and their interaction) plus a random effect for rescuer. secondary analysis estimated the

rate use of visual feedback ensured cpr performance within the prescribed rate range. without feedback, many rescuers exceeded the guidelines, which could result in poorer outcome. this is shown by the wide sd of the control first group in session <UNK> (table <UNK> their median rate was above <UNK> cpm (figure <UNK> demonstrating that more than half of these rescuers exceeded the upper prescribed limit. the control first group in session <UNK> were the only rescuers behaving ‘naturally’, as in the other three sessions, rescuers were, or had just been, exposed to feedback. since all rescuers were reminded of the guidelines before ‘treating’ the manikin, this finding suggests that judging compression rate is difficult and rescuers ‘over-try’ to meet the recommendations. when external chest compressions were first promoted in the <UNK> it was suggested that ‘anyone, anywhere’ with ‘two hands’ could perform effective chest compressions for <UNK> however, our research suggests that, without real-time feedback, it is difficult to deliver appropriate chest compressions for children. force strikingly, the forces delivered to a single manikin showed unexpectedly large variation. in the control first group, as their rate slowed with feedback in the second session, so the residual force maintained between compressions decreased. while the most clinically effective range of forces in children has yet to be determined, both extreme loading and incomplete offloading of force may adversely impact <UNK> <UNK> as chest compliance varies greatly with age, lower

fifty years of child height and weight in japan and south korea: contrasting secular trend patterns analyzed by sitar abstract objectives japanese and south koreans have traditionally been shorter than europeans, but have recently become appreciably taller. the aim was to quantify the secular trend patterns in height and weight growth in the two countries over <UNK> years using the sitar growth curve model. methods data on mean height and weight by sex in <UNK> age groups from <UNK> to <UNK> years were obtained by decade in south korea <UNK> and japan <UNK> the data were analyzed using sitar (superimposition by translation and rotation), which estimates a mean curve and three adjustments–size, timing and intensity–reflecting how the individual surveys differ from the mean. a sensitivity analysis compared results for the japanese data based on cohort as well as period. results growth patterns in the two countries changed dramatically over the study period, affecting not only height and weight but also developmental age, in that the growth period advanced in timing and shrank in duration. sitar fitted the data well. the trends were larger in south korea than japan, and puberty timing in japan stabilized by <UNK> most of the height increment seen in adults had already accrued by age <UNK> years, whereas the adult weight increment accrued throughout childhood. conclusions the secular height trend in these countries represents increased growth in the long bones during infancy, so it can be viewed as the inverse of stunting. there are striking country differences in growth pattern, but they are not easily explained by differences in national income, diet or lifestyle. <UNK> | introduction the japanese have traditionally been much shorter in height than their european counterparts, particularly scandinavians, though they have experienced a dramatic secular increase in height since world war ii (matsumoto, <UNK> tanner, hayashi, preece, and cameron <UNK> showed this to be due primarily to an increase in leg length, possibly arising from the shift from rice to a dairy-based diet during the <UNK> south korea is another east asian country whose inhabitants are materially shorter than in the west—indeed in <UNK> south korean children were shorter even than the japanese (y. s. kim, <UNK> however they, like the japanese, have experienced a steep increase in height in recent decades, and they are now taller than the japanese (j. y. kim et al., <UNK> mori, <UNK> furthermore, south koreans are among the tallest peoples in the asian continent (schwekendiek & jun, <UNK> and south korean women are <UNK> cm taller now than they were a century ago, a larger increase over the period than any other group (ncd risk factor collaboration, <UNK> it is of interest that these two neighboring countries have, over a similar period of time, experienced remarkable secular increases in height, and yet in detail the patterns of change have been very different, with the south koreans “leapfrogging” over the japanese, by starting out shorter and ending up taller. the secular trend in height as seen in children combines two distinct processes: not only does height itself increase, but the age at peak height velocity in puberty gets earlier, due to accelerated maturation. thus, over a period of time, the curve of mean height plotted against age shifts upwards, and at the same time it shifts to the left. the recently developed sitar growth curve model provides a way to examine these components of the secular trend in more detail (cole, donaldson, & ben-shlomo, <UNK> it does this by explicitly modeling the two separate components of the growth curve: increasing size and accelerating maturation. it can also be applied to “growth curves” based on mean height by age in representative cross-sectional samples, where “individuals” correspond to particular surveys. the way sitar works is to summarize the pattern of growth in individuals as a mean growth curve plus a set of adjustments for individuals that transform the mean curve to match their individual curve. the three transforming adjustments reflect differences between individuals in size (mean height), timing (or tempo, similar to age at peak height velocity), and intensity (similar to peak height velocity). when modeling the secular trend, the adjustment of size represents the change in adult height, while the adjustments of timing and intensity reflect the change in rate of maturation. thus, the secular trend can be decomposed into three separate components. the technique represents an extension of the approach by ali, lestrel, and ohtsuka <UNK> who analyzed growth curves of japanese height over eight decades using kernel regression, and identified turning points on the curves reflecting age at take-off and age at peak velocity. this article aims to decompose the secular trends in height and weight among japanese and south korean children and young people over long periods of time <UNK> years in south korea, <UNK> and <UNK> years in japan, <UNK> and to show how the trends can be explained in terms of countryspecific changes in sitar size, timing, and intensity. <UNK> | methods <UNK> | data mean values of height (cm) and weight (kg) for boys and girls, tabulated in <UNK> age groups from <UNK> to <UNK> completed years, were obtained from national samples of child anthropometry. half a year was added to each year group age to reflect mean age. the data represent periods, i.e., children measured in particular years, not cohorts of children born in the same year. south korean data were available only for the years <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> (j. y. kim et al., <UNK> while the japanese data came from annual national nutrition surveys carried out between <UNK> and <UNK> by the japanese ministry of health and welfare (latterly ministry of health, labor and welfare)—see funatogawa, funatogawa, nakao, karita, and yano <UNK> for details. the south korean surveys were very large, with each age group mean based on <UNK> to <UNK> children, while the japanese samples were much smaller, ranging in size from <UNK> to <UNK> for all ages <UNK> years. to make the two datasets more similar, the japanese data were merged in <UNK> groups at <UNK> year intervals as follows: <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> supporting information tables <UNK> give the mean values by age group, sex, country and year of measurement, and figure <UNK> shows the corresponding period growth curves for height and weight (discussed in more detail later). <UNK> | sitar growth curve model sitar (superimposition by translation and rotation) is a shape-invariant mixed effects growth model (cole et al., <UNK> it fits a mean curve to the data as a natural cubic bspline, on the assumption that the growth curves of individuals (i.e., individual surveys here) differ from this mean curve shape in just three ways, corresponding to three subjectspecific transformations. the three transformations are size, i.e., how tall individuals are relative to the mean; timing, i.e., their relative timing of the pubertal growth spurt based on the age at peak velocity, and intensity, the relative rate at which they pass through childhood and puberty. intensity is effectively a measure of accelerated developmental age, in that biological time passes faster when development is advanced and slower when it is delayed. the geometric impact of the three sitar transformations on individual growth curves, reflecting how they differ from the mean curve, is as follows: they are shifted up/down (size, reflecting the curve being above or below average size) or left/right (timing, corresponding to early or late timing), and the age scale is stretched/shrunk (intensity, this transformation having the effect of making the curve respectively shallower or steeper, a positive value indicating advanced growth). the transformations are in units of cm or kg (for size), years (timing) and percentage (intensity). so for example a height curve with size <UNK> cm, timing <UNK> years and intensity <UNK> indicates that the individual is <UNK> cm taller as an adult, peaks in velocity <UNK> months earlier and completes growth <UNK> faster than the mean curve. using their fitted transformations, individual curves can be back-transformed to match the mean curve; if the model fits well the adjusted curves will all be superimposed (hence the name sitar). the sitar model was fitted in the statistical language r version <UNK> (r core team, <UNK> using the sitar package version <UNK> (cole, <UNK> four separate models were fitted, for height and weight in boys and girls, with the seven surveys by decade for japan and five for south korea treated as <UNK> individual growth curves. the sexes were analyzed separately due to their differing mean curve shapes. the transformations size, timing and intensity were estimated as random effects, with zero mean, included in the model along with corresponding fixed effects. for presentation intensity was multiplied by <UNK> to convert it to a percentage. the goodness of fit was measured as the percentage of variance explained by adding the random effects to a simpler model fitting just the mean curve (cole, pan, & butler, <UNK> <UNK> | optimizing the sitar model the sitar models were optimized by choosing the degrees of freedom for the cubic b-spline curve to minimize the bayesian information criterion or bic (schwarz, <UNK> the fitted curves had either <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> degrees of freedom, with knots placed at the corresponding age quantiles. other models were explored, optimized by transforming the age and/or size scales. the main model summarizes the differences between surveys on the age and size scales in absolute terms, e.g., shifting the height growth curve upwards by say <UNK> cm, or shifting it left by say <UNK> years; these adjustments are the same at all ages. if instead age and/ or size are logarithmically transformed, then the predicted effects at each age are proportional rather than absolute, e.g., shifting the curve up or shifting it left by say <UNK> in absolute terms these adjustments are smaller at younger ages. the square root transformation is intermediate between linear and log, and hence is midway between absolute and proportional effects. all three transformations were explored in sensitivity analyses, with the fitted curves back-transformed for presentation purposes. <UNK> | velocity curves the first derivative of the (back-transformed if necessary) growth curve shows the difference in size by year of age, a measure of growth, which for convenience is here termed the “velocity” curve (although based on cross-sectional rather figure <UNK> growth curves for height (left) and weight (right) by country and year of measurement, boys (above) and girls (below) than longitudinal data). the area under the velocity curve corresponds to the total increment in size, and so the curve is useful to illustrate how the sitar effects of timing and intensity impact on size at each age. sensitivity analyses explored which transformations of the measurement and age scales best captured the secular changes in the velocity curve. <UNK> | cohort versus period height and weight in the two countries were tabulated by age and year of measurement. analysing the data in this form assumes that the growth pattern depends only on the period, the time when the measurement was made. however, the time when the children were born—their birth cohort— could also be relevant, so that both year of birth and year of measurement may affect the growth curve’s shape. the japanese data being available annually allowed growth curves to be constructed both by cohort (i.e., successive years of age for a given year of birth cohort correspond to successive years of measurement)—see funatogawa, funatogawa, nakao, karita, and yano <UNK> well as by period. (note though that this was not possible for the korean data, which were available only by decade of measurement, so the primary country comparison here is necessarily based on period.) if one assumes that the secular trend in growth is monotonic (i.e., that it does not change direction at any point), then the cohort and period approaches will lead to broadly similar results—children of later-born cohorts and later measurement years will be taller and heavier than for earlier cohorts and measurement years. however, it is not clear how the trends in the corresponding sitar parameters might differ when viewed the two ways. as a sensitivity analysis the japanese growth curves were analyzed both by period and by cohort, to see how the sitar growth parameters were affected; to do this the “period” curve for a given measurement date was compared with the “cohort” curve for the birth cohort born <UNK> years earlier (e.g., those born in <UNK> were compared with those measured in <UNK> this ensured that in <UNK> the mean age of the cohort was <UNK> matching that for the period dataset). the cohort data were inevitably incomplete for the early and late years. <UNK> | results <UNK> | height and weight in japan and south korea figure <UNK> shows the growth curves for height (left) and weight (right) in boys (above) and girls (below). each quadrant contains <UNK> curves, i.e., the seven surveys in japan (solid lines) and five in south korea (dashed lines). there was a clear secular trend to increasing height and weight over time, with japan shortest and lightest in <UNK> and south korea tallest and heaviest in <UNK> there was also an obvious secular trend to earlier maturation, with the curves shifting to the left over time. to express these differences in terms of size, timing and intensity, separate sitar models were fitted to each quadrant of figure <UNK> figure <UNK> illustrates the model fit for height in boys and girls, where the <UNK> boys’ curves are shown in black and the <UNK> girls’ curves in red, and the two countries are indexed by line type. the individual curves by sex are all superimposed, with <UNK> of the variance in figure <UNK> explained, indicating that the models fit well. the mean curve shapes for the two sexes, with the girls (red) spurting earlier but ending up shorter than the boys (black), are clearly visible. the other three quadrants in figure <UNK> illustrate the random effect estimates of sitar size, timing and intensity for each of the <UNK> surveys, indicated by the year label and country color (japan black, south korea red), and joined by lines to indicate the temporal trend. the values for boys and girls are plotted against each other, and the diagonal line of equality demonstrates that the values for the two sexes are very similar. mean height size (figure <UNK> increased by about <UNK> cm in japan and <UNK> cm in south korea (for both sexes) over the period of study. note that this is after adjusting for concurrent trends in timing and intensity, so it reflects the increase in adult height. however, the bulk of the increase occurred before <UNK> in japan and after <UNK> in south korea (in <UNK> the two countries were similar in height). in addition japan showed no change from <UNK> to <UNK> an indication that the secular trend had stopped, whereas in south korea mean height increased slightly from <UNK> to <UNK> figure <UNK> compares the timing of puberty in the different surveys, where again the two sexes were in close agreement. however, there was a dramatic difference between the two countries in that japan showed virtually no change in timing after <UNK> whereas in south korea puberty occurred <UNK> months earlier in <UNK> than in <UNK> ali et al. <UNK> also found that in japan, age at peak height velocity plateaued after <UNK> finally figure <UNK> compares growth intensity in the two countries, where the sexes are again almost identical. intensity increased by <UNK> over the period, this indicating by how much the duration of growth had shrunk. however, the increase was more rapid in south korea, occurring over a <UNK> year period as against <UNK> years in japan. the results for weight are shown in figure <UNK> again the sitar models fitted well (figure <UNK> with <UNK> of variance explained. there was more sexual dimorphism than for height, with the size, timing and intensity effects in figures <UNK> less close to the line of equality. boys increased in size over the period by twice as much as girls <UNK> vs. <UNK> kg in japan, <UNK> vs. <UNK> kg in south korea). for timing (figure <UNK> the results again showed a greater effect in south korea than japan, an advance of <UNK> years, and within japan the effect was greater in girls than boys. weight intensity (figure <UNK> showed a similar pattern to size, increasing more in south korea than in japan, and in boys more than girls. <UNK> | height and weight increment by age figure <UNK> explores the increments in height and weight by age and sex in the two countries over the period of study, i.e., <UNK> years for japan and <UNK> years for south korea. the increments are strongly age-dependent, depending as they do on the underlying changes in size, timing and intensity; thus, the maximum increments occurred in puberty, at around <UNK> years in boys and <UNK> years in girls. figure <UNK> shows both the observed increments and those predicted by the sitar models, and the two agree well. the increments at age <UNK> indicate the adult secular trends, and the adult height increments were appreciably greater for japan than south korea, reflecting how short the japanese were in <UNK> conversely the weight increments were greater in south korea. there is a particular interest in the size of the height increment in early life, as it has been suggested that the size increment as seen in adults is accrued as early as age <UNK> (cole, <UNK> the youngest infants (mean age <UNK> years) were <UNK> cm taller at the end of the period than at the start (figure <UNK> this is the same as the adult increments in south korea, but slightly less than in japan <UNK> cm in boys and <UNK> cm in girls). so in south korea the <UNK> cm increment in adult height had already been accrued by <UNK> years, whereas in japan an extra <UNK> cm in height was gained during childhood after infancy. figure <UNK> sitar summary of height growth by sex, country and year of measurement: (a) sitar-adjusted height curves (boys black, girls red); (b) changes in size (cm) for boys plotted against girls (japan black, korea red); (c) changes in timing (years) similarly; and (d) changes in intensity (%) similarly. see text for details with weight, the adult increments were much smaller for girls than boys in both countries. the early life increments were all considerably smaller for weight than for height. for japanese girls the adult weight increment matched that in early life, while for south korean girls, and boys in both countries, it was greater. <UNK> | secular trends in height velocity figures <UNK> confirm the good fit of the model to changes in size over time. a more subtle aspect of model fit is the shape of the predicted velocity curve and how it changes over time. this is explored in figure <UNK> for height velocity in south korea, and in figure <UNK> for weight velocity in japan. figure <UNK> contrasts two alternative sitar height models (left and right) for boys (above) and girls (below). the models on the left are those for height versus age as already discussed, while on the right are better fitting models with age on the square root scale, where the bic is <UNK> units smaller (and hence better fitting). the figures contrast the predicted height velocity curves in <UNK> and <UNK> showing how puberty advanced over time. the simpler models (left) imply that before age <UNK> velocity was greater in <UNK> whereas the optimal models (right) show it was unchanged from <UNK> this reinforces the impression from figure <UNK> that height velocity after infancy did not change over the period. the corresponding figure for japan (not shown) indicated that height velocity up to age <UNK> was slightly greater in <UNK> than in <UNK> which accords with the observed secular increase in height in japan beyond <UNK> years. figure <UNK> looks at weight velocity in japan similarly. it is clear in all four quadrants that weight velocity before age <UNK> was considerably greater in <UNK> than in <UNK> thus explaining the observed secular trend in weight. however, the better fitting models (log weight and square root age, bic <UNK> units less, on the right) show that this applied much less to figure <UNK> sitar summary of weight growth by sex, country and year of measurement: (a) sitar-adjusted weight curves (boys black, girls red); (b) changes in size (kg) for boys plotted against girls (japan black, korea red); (c) changes in timing (years) similarly; and (d) changes in intensity (%) similarly. see text for details peak weight velocity in puberty, which did not change materially. <UNK> | cohort versus period as a sensitivity analysis, figure <UNK> compares the japanese boys height growth curves as defined by cohort and by period. figure <UNK> contrasts the two mean curves, where the cohort curve (solid red line) is lower than the period curve (solid black line) at younger ages but higher at older ages. this is because within each cohort, the younger and older ages correspond to earlier and later measurement dates, whereas the corresponding period data are all measured at the same time. the net effect is to make the mean cohort curve steeper, so the peak height velocity for cohort in figure <UNK> (dashed red line) is greater than for period (dashed black line). this is equivalent to increased intensity for the cohort curve, i.e., the age scale is foreshortened. figures <UNK> compare the corresponding trends over time in the sitar effects for size, timing and intensity by cohort and period. although there are differences, the size and timing effects are broadly similar the two ways, lying close to the dotted line of equality. however, the intensity trend is much steeper for period, the range of values being twice that for cohort <UNK> vs. <UNK> a similar though less extreme pattern was seen for girls height and boys and girls weight (data not shown). this confirms that the main difference between cohort and period curves lies in the sitar intensity parameter, the secular trend in intensity for the cohort curves being as little as half that for the period curves. <UNK> | discussion the results demonstrate the dramatic secular trends in child height and weight that have taken place in japan and south figure <UNK> increments by age for height (left) and weight (right) in japan <UNK> to <UNK> black) and south korea <UNK> to <UNK> red), boys (above) and girls (below). the increments are shown observed (solid lines) and predicted by sitar (dashed lines) korea during the past <UNK> years. the trend has been appreciably greater in south korea, where the children were shorter and lighter than in japan in <UNK> but taller and heavier in <UNK> the results also show how well sitar summarizes the secular changes in growth pattern, with over <UNK> of the variance between surveys being explained by differences in mean size, growth timing and intensity. this emphasizes that the secular changes over time that occurred in height and weight, which one might think were simply a reflection of increasing body size, were also driven by similar changes on the developmental age scale—earlier puberty and faster passage. the results demonstrate in three distinct ways how well sitar represents the changing growth patterns in the two countries. in figures <UNK> and <UNK> the individual survey growth curves are all superimposed after sitar adjustment, with the curves for the two sexes clearly distinct. in figure <UNK> the increments over <UNK> or <UNK> years are well characterized by the sitar models, and in figures <UNK> and <UNK> the changes in velocity curve shape over time are convincingly captured. the sitar analysis adjusts mean height and weight for differences in the timing and intensity of growth. for this reason the mean size results in figures <UNK> and <UNK> directly reflect the corresponding secular trends in adult size, i.e., after growth has stopped. for height, they show that in japan the growth pattern did not change after <UNK> whereas in south korea it continued changing up until <UNK> a similar picture emerges for weight, with much larger secular changes in growth pattern among south koreans than japanese. however weight, unlike height, is still increasing in japan. there is also sexual dimorphism in the weight growth patterns, with girls changing less than boys in terms both of size and intensity. this confirms the figure <UNK> changes in height velocity curve shape for korean boys (above) and girls (below), from <UNK> (red dashed lines) to <UNK> (black solid lines). the curves are predictions from sitar models of height on age (left) and height on age (right), where the latter models have lower bic and fit better observation by maruyama and nakamura <UNK> that the japanese gender difference in bmi secular trend was due to a difference in the weight trend not the height trend. tanner et al. <UNK> pointed out that the japanese secular height trend from <UNK> to <UNK> was driven almost entirely by an increase in leg length. ali et al. <UNK> studied secular changes in japanese leg length for birth cohorts from <UNK> to <UNK> showing a steep rise in leg length as a percentage of height from <UNK> to <UNK> but a plateau thereafter. in addition they showed that this percentage increased with age until puberty, i.e., <UNK> years in boys and <UNK> years in girls, and then either stabilized (girls) or fell slightly (boys). thus, in terms of length (cm) the trend in leg length was greater than the trend in height (and even greater than the trend in sitting height) up to puberty (though not thereafter). so the height trend was until puberty primarily a leg length trend. the secular increment in adult height (i.e., at age <UNK> amounted to <UNK> cm in japan and <UNK> cm in south korea (figure <UNK> figure <UNK> shows how this increment developed through childhood, and the pattern is striking; <UNK> cm of it, i.e., the majority, was already apparent at age <UNK> years, the mean age for the youngest age group. the increment appeared to be greater at later ages, but this reflected only more advanced maturation. in south korea the peak increment was at age <UNK> and exceeded <UNK> cm, but by adulthood it had shrunk to <UNK> cm, the same as at age <UNK> so there was no net increase in height after infancy. by contrast in japan the adult increment of <UNK> cm was greater than the <UNK> cm increment at age <UNK> showing some growth in childhood after infancy, so the two countries differed in this respect. the secular increment in length at birth is known to be very small; in shanghai for example mean birth length increased from <UNK> to <UNK> by just <UNK> cm (zhang & li, <UNK> so, it is reasonable to state that in south korea the secular increase in adult height occurred during the first <UNK> months of postnatal life, driven primarily by extra growth in the long bones of the leg, which confirms and refines the previously suggested <UNK> years (cole, <UNK> figure <UNK> changes in weight velocity curve shape for japanese boys (above) and girls (below), from <UNK> (red dashed lines) to <UNK> (black solid lines). the curves are predictions from sitar models of weight on age (left) and log weight on age (right), where the latter models have lower bic and fit better this, it should be noted, is the exact opposite of the malnutrition state of stunting, where infants in the first <UNK> days of prenatal and postnatal life fall behind in terms of linear growth (dewey, <UNK> it is tantalizing to think that the beneficial changes over time that have driven the secular trend to increased stature may well be the inverse of the factors that are driving linear growth retardation in millions of poor infants. the secular increase in adult weight was also substantial, but rather greater in boys than girls and in south korea more than japan (figures <UNK> and <UNK> in addition the increase accrued throughout childhood and puberty rather than being restricted to infancy (figure <UNK> it is for this reason that the best data transformation for size (as seen in figures <UNK> and <UNK> was linear for height and log for weight; the absolute increment in height was the same in early and adult life (figure <UNK> whereas for weight the proportional increment was closer to constant—this corresponds to the log transformation (cole, <UNK> the best data transformation for age was the square root (figures <UNK> and <UNK> in principle one would expect differences in developmental age to be multiplicative, corresponding to the age scale being stretched or shrunk, and this in turn corresponds to the log age scale, as seen in the original sitar publication (cole et al., <UNK> conversely the linear age scale would imply the whole growth curve being shifted left or right, which could fit poorly in infancy with age becoming negative. the square root scale is a compromise between figure <UNK> sitar summary of japanese boys height by year of measurement, with growth curves constructed by period and by cohort: (a) mean curves (period black, cohort red; height solid, velocity dashed); (b) changes in size (cm) for period plotted against cohort; (c) changes in timing (years) similarly; and (d) changes in intensity (%) similarly. see text for details linear and log, implying that differences on the developmental age scale are somewhere between multiplicative and additive. the sensitivity analysis showed that secular trends in the sitar size and timing parameters were broadly the same whether based on cohort or period curves. however, the cohort-based intensity parameter changed over time only half as fast as the period-based intensity. this can be explained by reference to figure <UNK> where the mean cohort curve (solid red line) is slightly steeper than the mean period curve (black). this is because within each cohort, the younger and older ages correspond to earlier and later measurement dates, whereas the corresponding period data are all measured at the same time. expressed the other way round, the period curves include some cohort information as their data are spread across <UNK> birth years, with the younger children born later and the older earlier. the net effect is that the secular trend in intensity based on the period data is up to twice that for the cohort data, and hence provides a biased estimate of the cohort-based trend. however, it is important to emphasize that the sitar analysis, in summarizing the secular trend, does not claim to provide any extra insight as to whether the trend is driven by cohort or period differences. probably both apply, in that children’s individual growth patterns are inherited in early life (i.e., a cohort effect) but are subsequently influenced by the changing environment (a period effect). the two effects can be distinguished in figure <UNK> which shows the agespecific increments in height and weight over the period of study. thus, it contrasts growth in children born <UNK> years apart. in south korea, the height increment for boys and girls was <UNK> cm both in infancy and in adulthood, which means that the growth pattern did not change during childhood. this corresponds to a cohort effect, not a period effect. however, the weight increment for south korean boys was much greater in adulthood than in infancy <UNK> vs. <UNK> kg), indicating a strong period effect in addition to the cohort effect. note that these inferences could have been based either on the observed increments in figure <UNK> (solid lines) or the sitar modeled increments (dashed lines), so the sitar analysis is useful here but not essential. as noted at the outset, europeans have historically been much taller than asians. the dutch are recognized as the tallest nation, and their secular increase in height has recently stopped (sch€onbeck et al., <UNK> figure <UNK> of sch€onbeck et al. <UNK> shows how height in the netherlands has increased since <UNK> equivalent to figure <UNK> of the current article. the adult increment amounted to <UNK> cm in both sexes, but the pattern by age was quite different from figure <UNK> the increment increased linearly from birth to <UNK> years in boys and <UNK> years in girls, when the increments were respectively <UNK> and <UNK> cm, after which they fell back to <UNK> cm at age <UNK> so there was no infant increment at all. however, the dutch in <UNK> were already taller <UNK> and <UNK> cm by sex) than the south koreans were in <UNK> (sch€onbeck et al., <UNK> so both the nature of the secular trend and the factors driving it were clearly different in the two countries. what factors might have caused japanese and south korean children to grow so differently from each other? there are several possibilities: genetics (e.g., different height potential), economic status (e.g., per capita gross domestic product or gdp) and diet (e.g., per capita national food supply). grasgruber, sebera, hrazdira, cacek, and kalina <UNK> explored many factors that might explain the differences in male height in <UNK> countries. they found that gdp was a strong predictor but national health expenditure was stronger, as was the mortality rate for children under <UNK> years. this obviously relates directly to living conditions in infancy, when long bone growth is important. among the strongest predictors was the human developmental index (hdi), which had a correlation of <UNK> with adult height based on <UNK> countries. several dietary factors were predictive, notably animal protein in the form of dairy, eggs, meat and fish, while a rice diet was generally associated with shorter stature (grasgruber et al., <UNK> the strongest single positive influence was dairy protein (r <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> countries), while rice had a strongly negative effect (r <UNK> <UNK> so how do japan and south korea compare in terms of these predictive factors? gdp was considerably higher in japan than south korea, as was the hdi, while child mortality was slightly lower in japan. (however, the reviewer points out the very different development paths taken by the two countries—japan achieved a miracle of economic development but then stagnated after <UNK> whereas korea was initially poorer but developed and maintained strong growth, its gdp now matching that for japan. this may well be relevant.) in terms of diet, south koreans ate appreciably less animal protein than japanese <UNK> versus <UNK> g/person/day protein from dairy, eggs, pork and beef). so in all these respects japan looks healthier than south korea, and the japanese ought to be the taller, as predicted by grasgruber et al. <UNK> (their figure <UNK> schwekendiek and jun <UNK> emphasized the impact of primary school feeding programs set up by the south korean government after the korean war, which have continued until now. however, mori compares in detail the national income and dietary intake in the two countries over time, and shows that as recently as <UNK> both per capita gross national income and milk intake were three times higher in japan than in south korea (mori, <UNK> mori <UNK> also highlights the recent striking increase in south korean intake of fruit and vegetables, at a time when japanese intake has fallen, particularly among the young, and this may explain the recent increase in south korean height. in conclusion, child height and weight have increased dramatically over the past <UNK> years in japan and south korea. the changes have affected both size (i.e., cm and kg) and developmental age, in that the growth period has advanced in timing and shrunk in duration. most of the height increment seen in adults has already accrued by age <UNK> years, indicating that the secular height trend in these countries (though not in the netherlands) represents increased growth in the long bones during infancy. the trends have been larger in south korea than japan, but there are no convincing differences in national income, diet or lifestyle to explain them.

developmental origins of variability in pelvic dimensions: evidence from nulliparous south asian women in the united kingdom abstract objectives pelvic growth may be sensitive to early‐life nutrition, with implications for maternal risk of obstructed labor. however, the “developmental origins” of adult pelvic variability require further investigation. we tested whether adult pelvic dimensions are associated with two components of height, indexing different periods of linear growth: tibia length, a proxy for early postnatal growth, and height‐residual (height regressed on tibia length), a proxy for later growth. we also tested whether adult pelvic dimensions are associated with birth weight, a marker of nutritional investment in utero. methods in this cross‐sectional study, data were obtained on <UNK> nulliparous young women of south asian ancestry. pelvic dimensions (bi‐iliac and bi‐acetabular breadth, anteroposterior pelvic inlet and outlet, interspinous and intertuberous diameter) were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. height and tibia length were measured manually. birth weight and gestational age were obtained by recall. multivariable regression models were fitted with a given pelvic dimension regressed on height‐residual, tibia, and birth weight, with the latter adjusted for gestational age. results controlling for birth weight, height‐residual was predictive of bi‐acetabular breadth, bi‐iliac breadth, and the pelvic inlet, while tibia length significantly predicted all dimensions except interspinous diameter. controlling for the linear growth variables, birth weight was predictive of bi‐iliac breadth only. conclusions markers of linear growth during both early and later development were associated with adult pelvic dimensions, whereas size at birth was poorly predictive. efforts to reduce stunting in early life may facilitate the attainment of maximum potential growth for both height and the pelvis. <UNK> introduction obstructed labor

using a cross‐sectional study design, we tested whether adult pelvic dimensions measured by magnetic resonance imaging (mri) are associated with adult height, and with markers of three specific growth periods. birth weight served to index nutritional investment in fetal life. tibia length and height‐residual (height minus tibia length) were used to index linear growth in the first <UNK> to <UNK> years of life, and linear growth from <UNK> years to its cessation, respectively. we used tibia length following previous authors (bailey et al., <UNK> pomeroy et al., <UNK> as leg length has been shown to be more sensitive than trunk length to early‐life ecological circumstances (bogin & baker, <UNK> sanna & soro, <UNK> and the length of the tibia may be particularly sensitive (jantz & jantz, <UNK> holliday & ruff, <UNK> although necessarily an approximation, we assigned tibia length to index linear growth from birth to <UNK> to <UNK> years because in this period growth is relatively rapid, highly sensitive to the environment, and adverse experience may confer lasting effects on tibial phenotype (cameron, <UNK> cole, <UNK> lejarraga, <UNK> martorell, <UNK> linear growth is

study by pan <UNK> found no association between height and pelvic dimensions in indian women. our results, however, are in line with a number of subsequent studies, which reported positive associations between adult height and the pelvis (bernard, <UNK> cox, <UNK> holland et al., <UNK> kakoma, <UNK> sharma et al., <UNK> to investigate the impact of earlier vs later linear growth on pelvis size, we partitioned height into tibia length, which is suggested to be a sensitive marker of early‐life environmental conditions and thus may act to index growth in this period (bailey et al., <UNK> pomeroy et al., <UNK> and height‐residual. the latter, a component of height variability independent of tibia length and including the thigh (femur) and trunk, served to index growth after the first <UNK> to <UNK> years of life. we found that both components of height significantly predicted several pelvic dimensions, and the correlations of tibia or height‐residual with pelvic outcomes were similar (see figures <UNK> and <UNK> this suggests that linear growth in both earlier and later periods is important for adult pelvis size. in contrast, birth weight, our index of nutritional investment in fetal life, was a significant predictor of only one pelvic dimension, bi‐iliac breadth. with respect to the relative variability of the pelvic dimensions investigated, the anteroposterior outlet had the highest cv. for example, its value of <UNK> contrasted with that of the intertuberous diameter <UNK> which is a transverse measure of the outlet. it is possible that the anteroposterior outlet's relatively high variability in our sample is related to variation in sacral/coccygeal length (tague, <UNK> however, greater measurement error for this dimension due to poor image quality around the coccyx is also plausible. several variables could have served as linear growth proxies. because tibia and femur lengths are likely highly correlated, height‐residual may include some tibia information via the femur. if we used leg length (tibia + femur) as our proxy of early linear growth, however, height‐residual would represent sitting height, and be far less predictive without the femur component. authors have often used relative leg length (leg length/height) to index early childhood environmental experience (eg, bogin, smith, orden, varela‐silva, & loucky, <UNK> lawlor, taylor, davey smith, gunnell, & ebrahim, <UNK> however, the use of tibia or lower leg length for this purpose is similarly well supported (but see kinra, rameshwar sarma, hards, davey smith, & ben‐shlomo, <UNK> in a study from peru, for example, tibia length showed greater differences than head‐trunk height or foot length between differentially stressed highland and lowland children (pomeroy et al., <UNK> similarly, bailey et al. <UNK> used differential growth of the tibia to assess the effects of variation in nutrition and susceptibility to hypoxic stress in han and tibetan children at high altitude. in mexican maya children, knee height as a measure of distal leg length (indexing the tibia) associated more strongly with environmental variables than with those reflecting ancestry (vázquez‐vázquez et al., <UNK> bogin and varela‐silva <UNK> suggested that “measuring lower leg length is especially important as the tibia is more sensitive to changes in the health environment than is the femur or the long bones of the arm” (p. <UNK> at the same time, tibia growth in absolute terms also reflects fetal experience, demonstrated by the detrimental impacts of maternal smoking (lindsay, thomas, & catalano, <UNK> diabetes (lampl & jeanty, <UNK> and intrauterine growth restriction (goetzinger, cahill, macones, & odibo, <UNK> on leg length. it is therefore more appropriate to consider birth weight a marker of in utero nutritional supply, rather than growth per se, whereas tibia length and height‐residual are more direct growth measures. importantly, though, we have shown that birth weight sds is not associated with tibia length in our sample, allowing these variables to function as independent markers of fetal and postnatal life in the present analysis. the lack of association between birth weight and most pelvic dimensions was unsurprising, considering the lack of association between birth weight and height, while height does correlate with the pelvis. however, the fact that birth weight did not correlate with height is itself surprising in the light of previous findings (adair, <UNK> haeffner, barbieri, rona, bettiol, & silva, <UNK> sachdev et al., <UNK> victora et al., <UNK> in delhi, india, for example, increased birth weight and birth length were associated with increased adult height (sachdev et al., <UNK> and a positive birth weight‐adult height relationship was observed in pooled results from study cohorts in brazil, guatemala, india, south africa, and the philippines (victora et al., <UNK> our findings may be explained by poor sensitivity of birth weight as a fetal growth marker, for example, resulting from noise in the data due to variability in fat mass. fat mass as a component of birth weight is not only highly variable, but also apparently increased relative to lean mass in south asians at birth (modi et al., <UNK> yajnik et al., <UNK> beyond this, birth weight and gestational age may have been noisy due to poor recall. in order to explore the level of precision in birth weights required for our findings to stand, we conducted a sensitivity analysis based on the uk study of o'sullivan and colleagues. the authors found in a large sample that <UNK> of parents recalled their child's birth weight within <UNK> g of hospital records, up to <UNK> years after delivery (o'sullivan, pearce, & parker, <UNK> in a single analysis, we substituted our collected birth weight values with values randomly increased or decreased by <UNK> g. using the adjusted values, correlations of birth weight sds with bi‐iliac and bi‐acetabular breadths were no longer significant. birth weight remained a significant predictor of bi‐iliac breadth in the multiple regression model, however, model <UNK> was reduced from <UNK> to <UNK> this study builds on prior evidence, which suggested contributions of the early‐life environment to variability in adult pelvic morphology (angel et al., <UNK> kelley & angel, <UNK> nicholson, <UNK> thoms, <UNK> <UNK> it is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to formally situate the pelvis within dohad, and directly test for associations between proxies of fetal and postnatal growth and adult pelvic dimensions. indeed, the pelvis has been understudied in the dohad literature, despite both its capacity to be shaped, like height, by early life nutritional conditions, and the potential importance of pelvis size and shape variability for risk of obstructed labor. in contrast, dohad has aided in understanding how early‐life nutritional and environmental exposures may impact tissue growth to increase the risk of chronic conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity (agarwal et al., <UNK> cameron & demerath, <UNK> mcmillen & robinson, <UNK> nutritional deprivation in utero, for example, was proposed to adversely impact pancreatic development, thus disrupting glucose homeostasis and predisposing to diabetes mellitus (hales & barker, <UNK> such a link requires an insult to occur within an early period of environmental sensitivity, or a so‐called “critical window” of phenotypic plasticity, which ultimately closes, resulting in the tracking of insult‐driven effects to adult phenotype (barker, <UNK> fowden, giussani, & forhead, <UNK> godfrey & barker, <UNK> the current study suggests, however, that variability in several pelvic dimensions may be sensitive to linear growth both in and after the first <UNK> to <UNK> years of postnatal life. growth of the pelvis may broadly track growth in stature, despite adult height being achieved prior to the cessation of pelvic growth (moerman, <UNK> sharma et al., <UNK> our findings do not confirm, but they are consistent, with the notion that an environmental insult in one growth period could be offset to some degree by improved conditions in another. this is captured, for example, by the phenomenon of “catch‐up growth,” which may occur in different growth periods following environmental insults (cameron, <UNK> ong, ahmed, emmett, preece, & dunger, <UNK> although, to reiterate, linear growth is relatively canalized following the first <UNK> to <UNK> years of life (cameron, <UNK> lejarraga, <UNK> martorell, <UNK> the promotion of early growth is clearly a priority, as the effects of poor nutrition on lower leg growth in the first two years of life contribute to risk for stunting (cole, <UNK> and could plausibly result in failure to reach one's genetic potential for both height and the pelvis. this is supported by studies where shorter women were more likely

(wells, pomeroy, walimbe, popkin, & yajnik, <UNK> importantly, secular height trends are principally influenced by postnatal growth (cole, <UNK> sanna & soro, <UNK> and our results are consistent with the suggestion that nutritional interventions to reduce stunting, already promoted for many other reasons (dewey & begum, <UNK> might benefit both adult height and pelvis size. prior work has examined secular trends in pelvic size and morphology, although results have been somewhat mixed. a <UNK> study from northern ireland showed that secular increases in height were associated with secular increases in pelvic dimensions (holland et al., <UNK> driscoll <UNK> using skeletal material, identified changes in shape, but not size, of the female pelvis over time. also examining skeletal collections, delprete <UNK> reported evidence for alteration in pelvic morphology over three centuries, although changes were not uniform across the collections. this is an important area for further study as low‐ and middle‐income populations increasingly suffer from overweight and obesity, even as they continue to experience undernutrition, sometimes within the same household or individual (doak, adair, bentley, monteiro, & popkin, <UNK> a woman may, for example, be short and have a smaller pelvis due to trans‐generational or poor early nutritional circumstances and also experience overweight in adulthood as environmental exposures change. overweight and obesity raise the risk of macrosomic offspring, increasing the risk of fetomaternal disproportion and obstructed labor. indeed, a recent study found that indian women who were both short and overweight were more likely to have a cesarean delivery than women who were either short or overweight alone (wells, wibaek, & poullas, <UNK> the question of whether pelvimetry (measurement of the female pelvis) is useful for predicting obstructed labor or operative delivery at the individual level has been assessed by a number of authors, with mixed results (connolly & mckenna, <UNK> harper, odibo, stamilio, & macones, <UNK> lenhard et al., <UNK> liselele, boulvain, tshibangu, & meuris, <UNK> spörri et al., <UNK> sun

x‐ray pelvimetry for predicting risk of obstructed labor and optimal mode of delivery (pattinson, cuthbert, & vannevel, <UNK> moreover, it may be argued that access to adequate obstetric care plays a far greater role in determining rates of maternal/offspring morbidity and death due to obstructed labor (campbell & graham, <UNK> ronsmans et al., <UNK> the current study recognizes these issues; however, it is important to look beyond predictions of birth outcomes at the individual level. investigators must seek to characterize more broadly when, and how much, linear growth translates into pelvic growth, in order to understand how populations experiencing variable secular height trends and differential exposure to nutritional transition may be more or less susceptible to risk of obstructed labor. a principal strength of this study is the use of three‐dimensional mri, which offers the opportunity to measure the pelvis in vivo while avoiding potential confounding by overlying soft tissue. moreover, all measurements were made on the same equipment by a single observer. however, the sample size was relatively small, and the precision of birth weight sds may have suffered from poor recall, as mentioned above. we employed a cross‐sectional design and used proxies for fetal nutritional supply and early and later postnatal growth; longitudinal studies in diverse populations are needed to develop a clearer picture of how different growth periods shape adult pelvic phenotype. finally, height (lettre, <UNK> and dimensions of the pelvis (sharma, <UNK> demonstrate heritability, and variability in human body proportions and size may also reflect long‐term differential exposure to ecological factors such as temperature (ruff, <UNK> further studies are likewise needed to disentangle these effects from those related to nutritionally‐influenced developmental growth plasticity. in conclusion, our study is consistent with others in demonstrating links between the pelvis and adult height, while also providing new evidence for potential positive effects of both early and later linear growth on adult pelvis size. at the same time, we found little evidence to support the prediction that in utero nutritional investment shapes pelvic dimensions. future work should seek to characterize the developmental trajectory of different pelvic dimensions and also investigate the potential impacts of early‐life nutritional interventions (eg, those aimed at reducing stunting) on adult pelvis size and shape. it will be important to focus efforts on reversing negative secular trends in height, especially in populations where maternal bmi is increasing (wells et al., <UNK> this can be achieved by improving success in the prevention of early linear growth

what predicts intergenerational change in anthropometry? it is a truth universally acknowledged, that children now are taller, heavier and fatter than their parents and grandparents were. trends in adult height over the past <UNK> years have recently been documented in detail by the ncd risk factor collaboration, comparing mean adult height by sex in <UNK> countries between <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> some countries have seen height increase by up to <UNK> cm. in addition, the pace of growth in childhood has accelerated, so that adult height is now reached at an earlier age. this has the effect of inflating the apparent increase in height during childhood, as children of a particular age are both taller and more advanced in developmental age <UNK> weight has also been increasing in line with height; but over the past half-century, it has outstripped height, and this has led to the secular trend of rising body mass index (bmi) and the public health concerns of increasing obesity. documenting these secular trends in child growth usually involves comparing anthropometry in crosssectional studies at different times; for example national surveys carried out every <UNK> or <UNK> years <UNK> it is unusual to be able to make a direct comparison of the growth of children with their parents. the article by sinha, et al. <UNK> in this issue of indian pediatrics uses an interesting and unusual intergenerational study design to do just that – the growth patterns of children born around <UNK> and recruited to the new delhi birth cohort were compared with those of their own children as measured more recently. the comparisons focussed on the age groups <UNK> and <UNK> years, where the outcomes were the intergenerational z-score changes in height, weight and bmi, adjusted for age and sex. the findings were striking – over the follow-up period, the children increased in height by a whole standard deviation, corresponding to <UNK> cm in the younger children and <UNK> cm in the older. weight increased similarly, by <UNK> and <UNK> kg in the two age groups; while bmi changed only in the older children, by <UNK> <UNK> and in the <UNK> year group it remained the same. the authors concluded that children tend to “grow up” before they “grow out.” this is one surprise, that the younger children were not fatter than their parents were at the same age, despite the steep rise in obesity prevalence that has occurred over the period. but the intergenerational study design also provided other interesting insights, some of them counterintuitive: the increases were greater for smaller and older parents, with poorer sanitation and higher education, and for older children. it is instructive to consider each of these associations in turn, and to explore their relevance to health policy. by far the strongest association was with parental size – the secular increase was appreciably greater for shorter parents. the authors provide three potential explanations for this: “statistical regression to the mean, narrowing of socio-economic inequalities and greater biological response among deprived strata”, and they are optimistic that it represents a reduction in height inequity. however, they are perhaps over-optimistic, in that the most likely explanation is the first of the three, regression to the mean, which is a statistical not a social or biological construct. it states simply that extreme measurements (e.g. height) are on average less extreme on remeasurement; so shorter parents tend to produce somewhat less short children, and vice versa for taller parents and children. it was first described by francis galton, working in the same context as here, with the heights of parents and children <UNK> as a statistical phenomenon, regression to the mean is substantial and ever-present; so it tends to dwarf any other factors that may be operating. the next strongest association the authors found was with parental age; the children of older parents tended to be relatively taller. the authors speculate that the parents being older meant they were exposed longer to improved living conditions, and passed this on to their children. however, there is another more likely explanation; the parents were all born around <UNK> so if they were older when their children were born, the children must have been born later and hence experienced more of the underlying secular trend. in this sense, parental age is simply a measure of passing time, and the child’s year of birth would have been similarly predictive. the child’s age was another important predictor of secular change, which was appreciably greater in the older age group. the authors view this as a proxy for exposure duration, but again it is more likely to be structural, reflecting the advanced developmental age of the children compared to their parents; so they reach milestones relatively earlier than their parents and hence appear taller. this effect increases with age until puberty and then disappears once adult height is reached <UNK> so one would expect it to be greater for age <UNK> y than age <UNK> y. the secular change in developmental age may also explain why bmi did not increase in the <UNK> year group. the bmi curve typically rises steeply in infancy, peaks just before <UNK> year, then falls until adiposity rebound at age <UNK> y when it rises again <UNK> the advance in developmental age shifts this pattern to the left, with both the age at bmi peak and the age at adiposity rebound getting earlier <UNK> independently of any secular increase in bmi. because of its shape, the age-shifted curve is slightly lower than the original curve at some ages (fig. <UNK> and this generates an apparent fall in bmi that partially compensates for the secular bmi rise. so, in this sense the authors are right that children tend to “grow up” before they “grow out.” the wash (water, sanitation and hygiene) score, was the one socio-economic factor to have a measurable effect on the secular change in height, weight and bmi. it presumably means that the children brought up in better conditions than their parents grew better as a result. weight and bmi were also relatively greater in children whose parents were more educated; this though looks more like greater obesity than improved growth, as there was no associated height effect. in summary, the study confirms intergenerational increases in height, weight and bmi, and identifies several factors that predict them. however, most of the factors reflect either statistical or biological associations that may not be very relevant to policy. in terms of policy relevance, only sanitation in the parent cohort impacted significantly on the secular height trend, suggesting that improved sanitation is a worthwhile policy goal. sanitation in the child cohort did not show an effect, but this may be because it has improved materially in <UNK> years, making its impact harder to detect.

using super-imposition by translation and rotation (sitar) to relate pubertal growth to bone health in later life: the medical research council (mrc) national survey of health and development abstract background: to explore associations between pubertal growth and later bone health in a cohort with infrequent measurements, using another cohort with more frequent measurements to support the modelling, data from the medical research council (mrc) national survey of health and development <UNK> years, <UNK> <UNK> subjects/measurements) and the avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac) <UNK> years) <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were related to national survey of health and development (nshd) bone health outcomes at <UNK> years. methods: nshd data were analysed using super-imposition by translation and rotation (sitar) growth curve analysis, either alone or jointly with alspac data. improved estimation of pubertal growth parameters of size, tempo and velocity was assessed by changes in model fit and correlations with contemporary measures of pubertal timing. bone outcomes of radius [trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vbmd) and diaphysis cross-sectional area (csa)] were regressed on the sitar parameters, adjusted for current body size. results: the nshd sitar parameters were better estimated in conjunction with alspac, i.e. more strongly correlated with pubertal timing. trabecular vbmd was associated with early height tempo, whereas diaphysis csa was related to weight size, early vc the author <UNK> tempo and slow velocity, the bone outcomes being around <UNK> higher for the better vs worse growth pattern. conclusions: by pooling nshd and alspac data, sitar more accurately summarized pubertal growth and weight gain in nshd, and in turn demonstrated notable associations between pubertal timing and later bone outcomes. these associations give insight into the importance of the pubertal period for future skeletal health and osteoporosis risk. puberty is a time of dramatic change in body size and composition, driven by a complex hormonal cascade that results in rapid weight gain and height gain, the timing of which varies widely between <UNK> studies using questionnaire-derived data on recalled age at menarche, a discrete event during late puberty in girls, indicate that the timing of puberty is influenced by both <UNK> and nongenetic factors, and that it has important relevance to later health <UNK> however, the regulation of pubertal changes in weight and height, and in particular the relevance of these growth traits to later outcomes, is difficult to study, for two reasons: the need for serial growth measurements over much of the second decade of life, and the need for a suitable methodology to model and summarize the pattern of pubertal growth to relate it to later outcome. an example of this arises in our recent report on the associations between childhood growth and bone outcomes at <UNK> <UNK> in the medical research council (mrc) national survey of health and development (nshd), a birth cohort born in one week in march <UNK> and followed up over the subsequent <UNK> <UNK> we found that greater height and weight growth during ‘pre-puberty’ and ‘postpuberty’ were positively associated with bone size, a predictor of fracture risk, at <UNK> years. yet, given that <UNK> of skeletal mineral is accrued within two years of peak height velocity, it was surprising not to find stronger associations with growth during ‘puberty’. whereas nshd has more frequent growth measurements than many subsequent studies, the analysis was limited by the infrequent time-points around puberty (with just three sweeps at the ages of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> years) which were too sparse to easily test for associations with pubertal growth. furthermore, the shape of the pubertal growth curve is complex, and summarizing it in a way that is suitable to relate to potential determinants or later outcomes is not straightforward. in a life-course context, most studies have treated adolescent height and weight as exposures, either as single measurements (i.e. size) or as change over time (i.e. velocity), and few have considered the maturational clock (i.e. tempo, the timing of puberty) as an exposure, which may be confounded with size and velocity. recently, the superimposition by translation and rotation (sitar) growth curve model has been shown to efficiently summarize pubertal growth based on these three parameters: size, velocity and <UNK> like most growth curve models, sitar works best with frequent serial data, and this limits its use in cohort studies that have only sparse anthropometry. the purpose of this paper is to apply sitar to nshd growth data, and to explore whether the sparse nature of the data can be compensated for by augmenting them with data from another cohort of comparable size but with more frequent measurements—the avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac) <UNK> to test whether the sitar parameters, particularly tempo, were biologically meaningful, we related them to contemporaneously collected

pregnant women living in bristol with an expected delivery date between april <UNK> and december <UNK> detailed information has been collected using self-administered questionnaires, data extraction from medical notes, and linkage to routine information systems and at research clinics. childhood weight and height were measured annually up to age <UNK> years, then at ages <UNK> and <UNK> years at dedicated alspac focus clinics by a trained research team. parent-reported heights and weights were also included. height was measured to the nearest <UNK> cm and weight to the nearest <UNK> kg. for the present analysis, data were restricted to the age range <UNK> years. ethical approval for the study was obtained from the alspac law and ethics committee and local research ethics committees. data management the data were examined for obvious outliers, and were further cleaned after preliminary fitting of the sitar models by excluding points with standardized residuals exceeding <UNK> in absolute value. data analysis the analysis was performed in two stages. first, the height and weight data were analysed using sitar growth curve <UNK> this is a shape-invariant growth model such that all individuals are assumed to have the same underlying shape of growth curve, subject to three simple transformations. this mean curve is estimated along with three subject-specific parameters termed size, tempo and velocity that transform the mean curve to fit individual growth curves. the size parameter for each child shifts the fitted curve up/down, reflecting differences in size; the tempo parameter shifts it left/right, reflecting differences in puberty timing; and the velocity parameter stretches/shrinks the underlying age scale to make the curve shallower/ steeper, reflecting differences in growth rate. the model fits the mean growth curve as a fixed effect natural cubic regression b-spline with specified degrees of freedom, and the parameters size, tempo and velocity are estimated as fixed effects and subject-specific random effects. the model was fitted with the nlme <UNK> and the first author’s sitar package in the statistical language <UNK> the sitar formula is yit ¼ <UNK> þ ai þ h t <UNK> bi <UNK> þ eit; <UNK> where yit is the measurement for subject i at age t; ai, bi and ci are, respectively, size, tempo and velocity random effects (along with corresponding fixed effects <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> h(.) is a cubic regression spline curve; and eit are independent normally distributed errors. each model was fitted to the sexes separately. initially, the models were fitted to the nshd data alone (age <UNK> years), and then again with the alspac data added (age <UNK> years). for the combined analyses, fixed effects were included in the model to distinguish between the two cohorts, allowing the cohort differences in mean size, tempo and velocity to be formally tested, leading to the extended formula yit ¼ <UNK> þ aalspac þ ai þ h t <UNK> balspac bi <UNK> þ eitnshd þ eitalspac; <UNK> where the cohort fixed effects have subscript alspac. this assumes that the mean curves for nshd and alspac are the same after adjusting for the cohort fixed effects. in addition, different residual variances were estimated for nshd and alspac, so that the reported residual variance refers to nshd explicitly, whether or not alspac data were in the model. the models were found to fit better after log-transforming age, and the resulting coefficients can be multiplied by <UNK> and viewed as percentage <UNK> similarly, the standard deviations (sds) of the tempo random effects are effectively coefficients of variation; the tempo random effects and sds are here converted to units of years by multiplying by the geometric mean age. the output from each sitar analysis consisted of a set of subject-specific random effects for size, tempo and velocity, plus the corresponding fixed effects and (for the joint models) the cohort differences, along with fixed effects for the mean curve coefficients. the second stage of the analysis involved just the nshd subjects, with sitar random effects from the joint models. their two bone outcomes were each regressed in turn on the six sitar random effects (three for height and three for weight), including sex as a main effect (this is termed model <UNK> the outcomes were in addition adjusted for body size: height and weight at <UNK> years (model <UNK> models involving subsets of the six sitar parameters were also fitted where the full results justified it, and sex interactions and quadratic terms were explored, though no clinically important effects were found. for all analyses, the bone outcomes and weight and height at age <UNK> years were log-transformed prior to analysis for allometric scaling purposes. it is important to assess the potential impact of pubertal growth on outcome, analogous to attributable risk. in the simplest case, a model with a single sitar parameter, this impact can be obtained directly by multiplying the regression coefficient by four times the parameter sd. this corresponds to the difference in outcome predicted for individuals with extreme growth patterns <UNK> sds from the mean for that parameter (i.e. comparing the third and ninety-seventh centiles). as the outcomes are logged, this difference can be multiplied by <UNK> and viewed as the percentage difference in outcome attributable to the contrast between the two growth <UNK> however, it is less obvious how to measure impact when the model contains more than one sitar parameter, as the parameters will be correlated, some of them highly, and the individual coefficients cannot be interpreted in isolation. to assess the impact of multiple sitar parameters, the following method was used: the linear predictor corresponding to the sitar parameters was derived as the sum of the parameters after multiplying each by its regression coefficient. this linear predictor shows how the predicted outcome varies across the spectrum of growth as represented by the combined sitar parameters, adjusted for other covariates in the model, and the corresponding impact is summarized as four times the sd of the linear predictor. this is a multivariate extension of the simple case, and is the appropriate way to express the impact of the sitar parameters as a single summary statistic. results sitar pubertal growth parameters in nshd cleaning the nshd height and weight data for outliers excluded <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> measurement occasions from age <UNK> to <UNK> years. the remaining <UNK> <UNK> measurements, for <UNK> boys <UNK> <UNK> measurements) and <UNK> girls <UNK> <UNK> measurements), were fitted to sitar models with <UNK> degrees of freedom. the analyses were then repeated with the nshd data augmented with alspac data for <UNK> boys and <UNK> girls, with respectively <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> measurements. the inclusion of alspac allowed <UNK> degrees of freedom for the mean curves in the two height models. figures <UNK> and <UNK> show the fitted growth curves. figure <UNK> compares the nshd mean curves for height and weight by sex, estimated alone (sole—dashed lines) and with alspac (joint—solid lines). the joint curves are generally smoother than the sole curves, with fewer bumps, and the sole and joint height curves are very similar in shape, though the joint curve for boys dips slightly after age <UNK> years. however, the weight curves differ materially after age <UNK> years, with the sole curves steeper before age <UNK> years and shallower after. this implies a real difference in the growth pattern between the two cohorts during and after puberty, even after the sitar adjustment, with greater weight gain in alspac. figure <UNK> shows the height and weight data by sex for alspac (grey) and nshd (black), illustrating the sparsity of the nshd data during puberty. note that, in two of the nshd sweeps, the measurement ages were not recorded, and ages <UNK> and <UNK> years were imputed. figure <UNK> also shows the mean curves for each cohort separately, as estimated with the joint model, where alspac is above and to the left in each case (and stops at age <UNK> years). these differences make clear that, in the <UNK> years between <UNK> (nshd) and <UNK> (alspac), there was a clear secular trend to greater height, greater weight and earlier puberty. in particular, weight in both sexes was greater for alspac at age <UNK> years than for nshd at age <UNK> years. cohort comparisons of sitar parameters the differences in mean curve shape between alspac and nshd shown in figure <UNK> arise from differences in the underlying sitar size, tempo and velocity parameters, estimated as fixed effects comparing the two cohorts. table <UNK> summarizes these fixed effects, confirming that, in general, alspac children were on average taller, heavier, earlier into puberty and faster-growing than nshd children. the apparent exception is for girls’ weight, where the tempo effect (corresponding to age at peak weight velocity) was slightly later for alspac. the velocity effect was dramatic, with growth in alspac <UNK> faster for height and no less than <UNK> faster for weight. it reflects sitar’s attempt to reconcile materially different curve shapes in the two cohorts. the weight increase in alspac compared with nshd was relatively greater during and after puberty than before, and to model this sitar had to shrink the age scale (i.e. increase velocity) but also postpone puberty in alspac. thus, the tempo effects probably underestimate the true differences in puberty timing. table <UNK> shows the fit of the nshd models, in terms of the residual standard deviations (rsds) and the sds of the sitar parameter random effects, without and with the figure <UNK> mean nshd growth curves as estimated by sitar: height (above) and weight (below) in boys (left) and girls (right), estimated alone (dashed lines) or jointly with alspac (solid lines). alspac data, sexes pooled (n ¼ <UNK> in the joint models, the rsd for height was <UNK> times larger in nshd than in alspac for both sexes, whereas for weight it was <UNK> times larger. compared with height, the tempo sd for weight was larger and the velocity sd three to four times larger in nshd. the results for the sole and joint models in table <UNK> are broadly similar, showing that adding alspac did not have a dramatic effect on fit. it slightly reduced the rsd for height, but increased it for weight. correlating the sitar random effects in the sole models with those in the joint models, all but one of the six correlations exceeded <UNK> so the addition of alspac had little effect. however, for weight tempo, the correlation was much lower at <UNK> showing that adding alspac affected weight tempo quite substantially. adding alspac also increased the correlations between height tempo and weight tempo, from <UNK> to <UNK> in boys and from <UNK> to <UNK> in girls, implying improved estimates, since the two are known to be strongly <UNK> figure <UNK> raw data (height above, weight below, boys left, girls right) for nshd

with size and velocity were all <UNK> for height, and for weight in the joint model, but for weight in the sole model they were both much higher at <UNK> so adding alspac enabled the weight-tempo effects to be separated from weight size and velocity. this latter contrast probably best explains the differences between the sole and joint models. comparison of sitar tempo with puberty timing table <UNK> shows the correlations in the nshd boys and girls between the measures of puberty timing and the sitar parameters from the sole nshd and joint nshd–alspac models. as expected, puberty timing correlated positively with sitar tempo, with correlations of around <UNK> (p < <UNK> the addition of alspac consistently increased each correlation, only weakly for height but dramatically so for weight, where the correlation doubled, though it was still less than for height. thus, despite the apparently small impact on the random effects of including alspac, it appreciably improved the estimate of puberty timing, particularly for weight. by contrast, the correlations of puberty timing with sitar size and velocity were weak, particularly with the joint models, as would be expected. relation between sitar growth parameters and bone outcomes the influence of pubertal growth on later bone outcomes is explored in table <UNK> where the outcomes are regressed on the sitar height and

the study shows that pubertal growth in nshd can be summarized compactly in terms of subject-specific sitar parameters, and that the addition of alspac data to the model provides smoother mean curves and more robust estimates of the weight-tempo random effects in nshd. the resulting sitar parameters are strongly associated with bone health outcomes measured <UNK> years later; vbmd is <UNK> less in late maturers compared with early, and <UNK> of the variance in diaphysis csa is explained by the pattern of pubertal weight gain. the growth pattern corresponding to later bone health is summarized by greater weight size, earlier weight tempo and lower weight velocity (table <UNK> as a subsidiary finding, the mean differences in the sitar parameters between nshd and alspac (see table <UNK> reflect marked upward secular trends in height and weight, in terms of both size and velocity, and earlier puberty for boys but less so for girls. indeed mean weight tempo for girls was seven weeks later in alspac. however, the mean curves in figure <UNK> show that puberty was consistently earlier in alspac in both sexes, indicating that the large velocity effect swamped the tempo effect. the greater robustness of the joint weight-tempo estimates is demonstrated in two ways: they are more highly correlated with height tempo (r <UNK> and they correlate more highly with contemporaneous questionnaire responses to puberty timing. some example r code is provided as a supplementary file. in detail, the modelling is imperfect. the height rsds of <UNK> cm are appreciably larger than for two other sitar published <UNK> where both rsds were <UNK> cm. however, these other studies started at age <UNK> years whereas nshd started at age <UNK> years, and this will have inflated the error. looking at the sds of the random effects, those for height are all smaller than in previously published studies <UNK> cm for size, <UNK> year for tempo and <UNK> for <UNK> ). in addition, the nshd mean curves, though improved when estimated jointly with alspac, are still lumpy (see figure <UNK> and the weight curves are forced to be steeper after puberty when alspac is added. this is because pubertal weight gain is greater in alspac than in nshd, and it violates the sitar assumption that the curves can be made the same shape by suitable choice of sitar parameters. however, this does not apply to the height curves, where the assumption holds and the curves for the two cohorts are essentially the same after sitar adjustment. an important design question when piggy-backing data, as done here with alspac, is getting the right mix of original and supporting data—if the added data are too few, they make no difference (as was found by initial experimentation with a much smaller growth study than <UNK> ), whereas, if they are too many, they may swamp the original data. it was important here to allow the rsds to differ for the two datasets, showing that height was more noisy in nshd than in alspac. this may be due partly to the missing age of measurement at age <UNK> years. the results of the regression models relating bone outcome at age <UNK> years to pubertal growth as summarized by sitar demonstrate the complexity both of pubertal growth and its relationship with bone status <UNK> years later. trabecular vbmd relates to age at peak height <UNK> whereas diaphysis csa is affected by all three facets of pubertal weight growth. these findings illustrate the extra information derived from the sitar model, with its tempo, size and velocity parameters, over and above reported pubertal timing, even in studies like nshd where the reports are prospectively obtained and clinically <UNK> each parameter represents a different aspect of growth. for a bone to be ‘fit-for-purpose’, it must appropriately adapt to longitudinal <UNK> and to the loading it undergoes, which will change with the timing, speed and mean weight gain, and it is consistent with the findings for csa. for vbmd and csa, the risk attributable to pubertal growth, i.e. the difference in predicted outcome for those <UNK> sds below as opposed to <UNK> sds above the mean of the linear predictor based on the sitar parameters, is substantial and clinically important, at around <UNK> adjusted for current body size, which would translate to a clinically relevant increased risk of <UNK> given that a <UNK> sd reduction in <UNK> results in a doubling of fracture risk, the differences in the current study represent a <UNK> to <UNK> increased risk of fracture between the two extremes. strengths and limitations strengths of the study are the large sample size, the long period of follow-up and well-characterized bone outcomes in <UNK> plus the large number of height and weight measurements from alspac through puberty. the use of pqct enables the investigation of multiple aspects of bone strength, which no other bone densitometry technique can provide. thus, it has been possible to understand how the different aspects of growth may influence skeletal health in later life. a limitation is that sitar assumes the same underlying growth curve for all individuals, after adjusting for size, tempo and velocity differences, yet the mean curves for weight in nshd and alspac are systematically different, with weight rising faster through puberty in alspac than in nshd. this affects the shape of the mean curve, and probably the velocity random effects as well, but the size and tempo random effects are likely to be relatively robust. conclusions in conclusion, individual patterns of pubertal growth in nshd, summarized by subject-specific sitar parameters, are better estimated when the relatively sparse nshd data are augmented with more frequent alspac data. relating the sitar parameters to bone outcomes in later life shows that pubertal growth, particularly earlier puberty, greater weight and slower weight gain, has a long-lasting effect on bone health, which is to a large extent independent of contemporary body size.

low maternal capital predicts life history trade-offs in daughters: why adverse outcomes cluster in individuals background: some individuals appear prone to multiple adverse outcomes, including poor health, school dropout, risky behavior and early reproduction. this clustering remains poorly understood. drawing on evolutionary life history theory, we hypothesized that maternal investment in early life would predict the developmental trajectory and adult phenotype of female offspring. specifically, we predicted that daughters receiving low investment would prioritize the life history functions of “reproduction” and “defense” over “growth” and “maintenance,” increasing the risk of several adverse outcomes. methods: we investigated <UNK> mother-daughter dyads from a birth cohort in pelotas, brazil. we combined data on maternal height, body mass index, income, and education into a composite index of “maternal capital.” daughter outcomes included reproductive status at <UNK> years, growth, adult anthropometry, body composition, cardio-metabolic risk, educational attainment, work status, and risky behavior. we tested whether daughters' early reproduction <UNK> years) and exposure to low maternal capital were associated with adverse outcomes, and whether this accounted for the clustering of adverse outcomes within individuals. results: daughters reproducing early were shorter, more centrally adipose, had less education and demonstrated more risky behavior compared to those not reproducing. low maternal capital was associated with greater likelihood of the daughter reproducing early, smoking and having committed violent crime. high maternal capital was positively associated with the daughter's birth weight and adult size, and the likelihood of being in school. associations of maternal capital with cardio-metabolic risk were inconsistent. daughters reproducing early comprised <UNK> of the population, but accounted for <UNK> of obesity; <UNK> of violent crime, low birth weight and short stature; <UNK> of current smoking; and <UNK> of school dropout. exposure to low maternal capital contributed similarly to the clustering of adverse outcomes among daughters. outcomes were worst among daughters characterized by both low maternal capital and early reproduction. conclusion: consistent with life history theory, daughters exposed to low maternal capital demonstrate “future discounting” in behavior and physiology, prioritizing early reproduction over growth, education, and health. trade-offs associated with low maternal capital and early reproduction contribute to clustering of adverse outcomes. our approach provides new insight into inter-generational cycles of disadvantage. introduction there is major public-policy interest in investing in children, in order to allow them to achieve their full potential in health and human capital, and flourish in adult life. this is particularly relevant to high-risk groups, who have been shown to contribute disproportionately to adverse adult outcomes. for example, a recent analysis of the dunedin cohort of <UNK> individuals showed that “a segment comprising [only] <UNK> of the cohort accounted for <UNK> of the cohort's injury insurance claims; <UNK> of excess obese kilograms; <UNK> of cigarettes smoked; <UNK> of hospital nights; <UNK> of welfare benefits; <UNK> of fatherless child-rearing; <UNK> of prescription fills; and <UNK> of criminal convictions” <UNK> as childhood risks predicted these adult outcomes, the authors concluded that early interventions targeting this high-risk segment of the population could yield large returns on investment. this study has important implications for public health. it highlights the benefits of considering a wide range of outcomes, embracing both health and human capital outcomes, within a single conceptual framework, and in addition, indicates that the clustering of adverse traits in adulthood has a developmental origin. nevertheless, the study also raises two related questions: first, we still need to explain why diverse adverse outcomes encompassing both physiological and behavioral traits should cluster within individuals; second, it remains unclear how early in the life-course interventions should be targeted, in order to maximize their benefits. we develop an evolutionary approach to address the first question, which has additional implications for the second. physiological and behavioral outcomes are often addressed using very different conceptual approaches, reflecting contrasting theoretical perspectives widely used by biomedical or social scientists. however, a unique integrative framework is provided by evolutionary life history theory, which aims to predict phenotypic variability in general <UNK> <UNK> and which can therefore address both physical and behavioral traits. this theory assumes that organisms are under selective pressure to harvest resources from the environment throughout the life-cycle, and to allocate them to biological functions to maximize fitness <UNK> energy is allocated between competing functions (maintenance, growth, reproduction and defense), resulting in trade-offs between them <UNK> most often, life history theory is used by biologists, in order to explain inter-species variability in traits such as reproductive strategy and longevity. for example, it has long been assumed that species exposed to high extrinsic mortality risk are unlikely to reap substantial pay-offs from investing in growth and maintenance, and will instead maximize fitness by prioritizing immediate survival and reproduction <UNK> such organisms therefore mature rapidly, and produce numerous offspring, few of which survive to adulthood. as extrinsic mortality risk falls, the pay-offs from investing in maintenance increase, thus extending average longevity <UNK> although this model is broadly supported, recent work suggests that the association between mortality risk and lifespan is more complex, and may depend for example on when in the lifespan mortality risk is greatest <UNK> nevertheless, this framework can explain the clustering of growth-, reproduction-, and longevity-related traits across species, with the trade-offs orchestrated through genetic adaptation <UNK> however, life history theory may also be applied to investigate variability within a species, and for example has been invoked by biologists to explain the clustering of behavioral traits, offering an adaptive perspective on “animal personalities” <UNK> this approach assumes that individuals vary in the relative importance allocated to current vs. future reproductive opportunities, resulting in populations with contrasting strategies for risk-taking behavior. individuals prioritizing future reproduction are expected to be risk-averse in multiple different contexts, in order to realize those future opportunities, whereas those prioritizing immediate reproduction are predicted to discount the long-term future and to be more risk-prone in a range of contexts. while genetic factors contribute to variability in life history traits, plasticity is also relevant. through norms of reaction (whereby a single genotype can give rise to a range of possible phenotypes, depending on the ecological stimuli or stresses encountered) <UNK> physiological and behavioral trade-offs may emerge within the life-course under the common logic of future discounting, and this approach can be extended to humans. regarding human behavior, for example, individuals exposed to harsh or unpredictable environments may have less incentive to invest in their health or education if they feel unlikely to realize the benefits at a later date <UNK> <UNK> regarding physiology, the “disposable soma” theory likewise assumes that the lower the likelihood of survival, the lower the pay-off from investing in cellular health <UNK> <UNK> constraints on somatic development may therefore undermine long-term health by favoring the prioritization of immediate survival and reproduction, increasing the rate of damage-accumulation with age <UNK> <UNK> there is increasing interest in applying life history theory to both physiology and behavior in humans <UNK> nonetheless, attempts to address phenotypic plasticity in this context remain scarce, and the results to date have been mixed <UNK> the exposures most commonly studied relate to post-natal life, and include behavioral markers of parental investment or extrinsic mortality risk <UNK> <UNK> in most studies, the outcome is also a single life history function, such as reproductive schedule. we suggest that these approaches neglect other important environmental factors that induce differential responses during early development, including those acting during prenatal life, and that previous studies have rarely considered competition across life history functions. we have developed a conceptual approach emphasizing that the initial source of environmental variability experienced by placental mammals derives not directly from the external environment, but from maternal phenotype <UNK> during the earliest stages of development, often termed “critical windows of development,” maternal phenotype represents a “safe harbor” <UNK> that can buffer the vulnerable fetus and infant from external stresses through multiple components of homeostasis <UNK> building on the “embodied capital” model <UNK> we refer to “maternal capital” as a suite of traits promoting investment in offspring in early life <UNK> maternal capital incorporates not only somatic traits (e.g., height, pelvic dimensions, energy stored in adipose tissue), physiological traits (e.g., homeostatic regulatory processes), social traits (e.g., supportive networks of kin or peers), cognitive traits (e.g., knowledge and skills acquired from formal education, or informally), and psychological traits (e.g., resilience to psychosocial stress), but also material assets (e.g., income, savings, housing etc.) that may benefit the offspring. maternal capital therefore represents a broad composite 'niche' to which the offspring is exposed during early life <UNK> since phenotypic plasticity is greatest in these early life periods, exposure to varying levels of maternal capital may generate long-lasting effects on offspring phenotype. the magnitude of maternal capital may vary markedly within a population, through the differential exposure of mothers to factors such as poverty, malnutrition, infectious disease and gender inequality <UNK> <UNK> as well as life history trade-offs that emerge during maternal development <UNK> any insult to the “safe harbor” may therefore propagate effects into the next generation. our over-arching hypothesis is that maternal investment, a function of the magnitude of maternal embodied capital, may leave a unique imprint on the offspring during their early stages of development, driving subsequent trade-offs in both behavioral and physiological traits. in turn, the emergence of multiple trade-offs might result in the clustering of beneficial traits within some individuals, and the clustering of adverse traits among others. such trade-offs may be especially relevant in hierarchical populations, in which social inequality is propagated over generations <UNK> <UNK> subordinate individuals are likely to experience reduced access to crucial resources throughout the life-course, generating the prediction that they must reorganize their life history strategy in order to maximize reproductive fitness under these harsh conditions <UNK> specifically, we hypothesize that lower maternal investment will induce trade-offs in the offspring that favor early reproduction to counter the elevated mortality risk <UNK> elevated immune defense to improve resistance to infectious disease <UNK> and more risk-prone behavior due to discounting of any long-term consequences <UNK> <UNK> at a cost to each of somatic growth, markers of cardio-metabolic health associated with homeostasis, and investment in education (figure <UNK> we lacked direct markers of immune function, and used central fat distribution as a marker of storing energy for this function (for example, many genes associated with immune function are highly expressed in visceral fat, and low levels of leptin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue, predicts mortality following severe malnutrition) <UNK> through these cumulative trade-offs, we predict the clustering of adverse outcomes among those exposed to low maternal investment. figure <UNK> www.frontiersin.org figure <UNK> schematic diagram illustrating our theoretical model derived from life history theory. the greater the magnitude of maternal investment during early life, the higher the phenotypic quality of the offspring and the greater the expected returns in the long-term future. offspring fitness would then be maximized by investing in growth, maintaining health, acquiring education, and avoiding risky behavior, delaying reproduction until these other benefits have been realized. lower maternal investment reduces the likely long-term returns, and favors earlier reproduction at a cost to competing traits. central abdominal fat indicates greater allocation of energy to immune function, but at a cost to cardio-metabolic health. we tested these hypotheses in a large prospective birth cohort in southern brazil, a country with very high levels of social inequality. we used early child-bearing <UNK> years) as a key marker of life history trade-offs among the daughters, as reproduction before <UNK> years is associated with health risks and other penalties among both mothers and offspring <UNK> and is widely discouraged by policy-makers <UNK> while reproduction is the currency of fitness from an evolutionary perspective. we restricted our analyses to mothers and daughters, reflecting our interest in “maternal capital” as the key exposure, and because trade-offs in male offspring might show different patterns. methods the birth cohort we studied is located in the city of pelotas <UNK>

<UNK> when all mothers who delivered a newborn in the five hospitals of the city and who resided in the urban area were invited to participate in a birth cohort study <UNK> of all births in the city area) <UNK> through daily visits to all <UNK> hospitals, data were collected on <UNK> live births (both sexes) and only <UNK> individuals <UNK> refused to participate. the cohort participants have been followed up at different time points thereafter. all visits were carried out by trained interviewers and fieldwork team members. further details of the methodology have been published previously <UNK> <UNK> among those not followed, small numbers had died or refused to participate, however the majority of losses were due to individuals not being traced, or having moved to other cities. in all phases of the study, ethical approval was obtained from the medical school ethics committee of the federal university of pelotas and full informed consent was provided by parents or their legal representatives (if the subject was aged under <UNK> years) or by cohort members. verbal consent was provided in the perinatal phase. data collection at the initiation of the study when the cohort members were born, data were collected on maternal phenotype including nutritional status, behavioral traits, reproductive history, educational attainment and family circumstances <UNK> a strength of the study is its prospective nature, such that maternal phenotype was measured at the start of the life-course of the offspring. data on family characteristics, pregnancy exposures, and early breast-feeding were obtained by questionnaires administered while the mother was still in hospital, and in a subsample at a <UNK> year follow-up. family income at the time of birth was assessed in units of minimum wages (in <UNK> <UNK> minimum wage = us$ <UNK> per month). maternal smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy were collected retrospectively at birth. gestational age was recorded in weeks. exclusive breast-feeding was recorded in days. maternal parity was recorded, and was used to create several dummy variables for analysis as described in more detail below. maternal age was recorded in relation to the date of the daughter's birth. offspring birth weight and length were measured at the hospital by the research team. weight and length at <UNK> months were measured in a subsample at the cohort participant's household. information on the daughter's age at menarche was obtained from the mother at the <UNK> years visit, and confirmed by the subject at the <UNK> years visit. age at menarche was assessed as the age of occurrence of the first menstrual cycle. at <UNK> years, weight and height were measured and used to calculate body mass index (bmi). waist circumference was measured using a non-elastic measuring tape. fat-free and fat mass were assessed using air-displacement plethysmography. cardiovascular risk markers measured at the <UNK> follow-up included: glucose, glycated hemoglobin <UNK> total cholesterol (tc), hdl-cholesterol (hdl-c), ldl-cholesterol (ldl-c), triglycerides (tgl), and systolic (sbp) and diastolic (dbp) blood pressure. the ratio of total cholesterol to hdl was also calculated, with higher values indicating a less favorable cholesterol profile. venous blood samples were collected regardless of fasting status, left at room temperature for <UNK> min and then centrifuged for <UNK> min at <UNK> g. serum aliquots were stored at <UNK> until analysis. blood samples were not taken in pregnant or suspected pregnant participants (n = <UNK> random glucose was measured by an automatic enzymatic colorimetric method. <UNK> was measured by the variant (bio-rad, hercules, ca) ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) method. lipids were measured using an automatic enzymatic colorimetric method in a biochemistry analyzer <UNK> mindray; shenzhen mindray bio-medical electronics, china). we excluded two individuals with implausibly high triglyceride values. blood pressure was recorded in the seated position using a calibrated digital wrist monitor (omron <UNK> beijing, china) at the start and end of the visit, and the mean of the measurements used in the analysis. a questionnaire was used to ascertain reproductive status at <UNK> years. for those who had reproduced, information was collected on the number of live offspring, the age at delivery, and the birth weight of the infant. a questionnaire was used to establish schooling status at <UNK> years, including categorical data (whether studying now; whether studied in the last year) and continuous data (completed years of education). for those not studying (n = <UNK> participants were asked to select from a list of <UNK> possible reasons accounting for this: difficulty learning; illness; work; no school or travel available; education not considered important; having children; married; violence; failed vestibular examination; other. participants were asked if they received any income from work, or an allowance (usually from parents) and the amount in reais (rs). questionnaires were also used to establish smoking behavior, and whether the participant had ever committed a violent crime. data processing we categorized daughters according to whether or not they had reproduced early (by <UNK> years) or not. we categorized mothers according to the magnitude of their capital. this approach combined markers of somatic capital (height, pre-pregnancy bmi) and social or material capital (maternal education and family income) into a composite index. each of these four traits has been widely associated with phenotypic variability in the next generation <UNK> for each trait, a cut-off was identified defining approximately the lower tertile in the population, in order to identify those substantially below the median, as follows: height: <UNK> cm pre-pregnancy bmi: <UNK> <UNK> maternal education: <UNK> years family income: <UNK> minimum salaries the four dummy variables were then summed, allowing mothers to be assigned a score based on the number of “capital penalties” with values ranging from <UNK> to <UNK> (i.e., mothers with high capital had few capital penalties). we used this variable to explore continuous associations of maternal capital with daughter outcomes. in addition, those with a score of <UNK> were categorized as the “low” composite maternal capital group, while those with a score of <UNK> categorized as the “high” composite maternal capital group. this allowed us to compare outcomes of daughters between these two contrasting maternal capital groups. for logistic regression analyses, we also divided maternal age into three groups, namely <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> years. for the same purpose, we divided the daughters into three groups in relation to maternal parity, namely first-borns, second-borns, and third+-borns. however, for descriptive analysis we also generated a category for high maternal parity, defined as the daughter being fourth/fifth-born. to assess clustering of adverse traits among the daughters, we defined several categorical variables. at <UNK> years, we defined obesity as bmi <UNK> <UNK> short stature as height <UNK> cm, and school dropout as those reporting not studying during the last year. self-reported current smoking and having committed violent crime were additional adverse outcomes. finally, we included low birth weight as an adverse outcome, as those with this characteristic remain at elevated risk of non-communicable disease through adult life <UNK> we defined “low birth weight” as <UNK> g. analytical steps we undertook several analytical steps, which are summarized in a conceptual diagram (figure <UNK> (a) our first analytical step was to test for inverse associations in the daughters between early reproduction <UNK> years) and markers of growth, health and education, which we interpret as trade-offs as predicted by life history theory. for this purpose, we analyzed several broad groups of outcomes of the daughters. the first comprised growth trajectory, comprising birth weight, infant growth, age at menarche, and adult size (height, fat-free mass, fat mass and its regional distribution). the second comprised markers of metabolic health, blood pressure and blood biochemistry. the third comprised behavioral profile, focusing on education, income, and risky behavior (smoking). we used these outcomes to assess relative investment during development in the competing life history functions of growth, maintenance and reproduction. markers of risky behavior (smoking, committing violent crime), were considered indicative of future discounting. we conducted these analyses by comparing daughters with vs. without offspring at <UNK> years, using independent samples t-tests or chi-squared tests. to test for “developmental origins” of these trade-offs, we extended the comparison to the daughters' growth trajectories in early life. to begin to test our key prediction that maternal capital is associated with these trade-offs, we also extended the comparison to the characteristics of their mothers. (b) our second analytical step tested our novel “maternal capital” model, by defining groups of mothers with different composite levels of maternal capital and quantifying associations with the daughters' phenotype. using the composite maternal capital index, we tested the hypothesis that variability in maternal phenotype predicted the likelihood of early reproduction by the daughter, and hence also predicted variability in the traits that either trade off against early reproduction, or correlate directly with it. we first fitted logistic regression models to confirm that multiple individual maternal traits predicted reproductive status of the daughter (had a child or not by age <UNK> years). these models included the four variables used to generate the composite index of maternal capital, but also additional markers of the capacity for maternal investment (age and parity) as well as “risky maternal behaviors” (smoking during pregnancy) that might constrain maternal investment. (c) third, we then ran regression models testing dose-response associations of daughter traits with the number of maternal capital penalties. we highlighted the contrast between daughters of low- vs. high-capital mothers using graphic analysis, supported by independent-sample t-tests. outcomes included the daughters' gestational age and early growth trajectory, breast-feeding experience, adult size and body composition, cardio-metabolic risk markers, risky behaviors, educational attainment, and early onset of reproduction, as well as maternal parity and the mother's risky behavior (smoking, alcohol intake). for growth, we were able to assess whether differences extended to the third generation, by analyzing birth weight of the daughter's own offspring. (d) our fourth analytical step followed the approach of caspi et al. <UNK> to evaluate the extent to which adverse outcomes were clustered among the minority of the daughters who had reproduced by <UNK> years, and among those who had been exposed to low maternal capital. we analyzed dichotomous outcomes for obesity <UNK> <UNK> short stature <UNK> cm), current smoking, school dropout, violent crime, and low birth weight, as justified above. we also explored the interactive associations of low maternal capital and early reproduction by the daughter with these adverse daughter outcomes. (e) associations between early reproduction in daughters and adverse outcomes might potentially be confounded by direct mother-daughter transmission of the outcome, due to shared genes or household environments. to exclude this possibility, we fitted regression models in which associations of the daughter's early childbearing with various outcomes were adjusted for equivalent traits in the mother. figure <UNK> www.frontiersin.org figure <UNK> conceptual diagram of the analytical steps.

(d) analysis of the interactive associations of early daughter reproduction and low maternal capital with adverse daughter outcomes. statistical analysis of the <UNK> female participants, <UNK> participated in the follow-up and provided questionnaire responses, of whom <UNK> also underwent the physical measurements of anthropometry and body composition, and <UNK> completed the blood test. there were small numbers of missing data for individual variables, hence we used all available data for every analysis. the subsample at <UNK> year (n = <UNK> over-sampled those with low birth weight. this was addressed using a weighting variable in the relevant regression models. categorical outcomes were assessed using chi-squared tests and odds ratios. conditional growth was calculated as regression residuals of final size on starting size, divided by the standard error of the estimate (see) of the regression model to generate conditional z-scores. continuous outcomes reported in the main figures were all natural-log transformed, so that subsequent independent samples t-tests express differences (multiplied by <UNK> in sympercent terms <UNK> to establish which maternal factors independently predicted daughters' reproduction status at <UNK> years, logistic regression models were fitted. maternal capital was divided into groups as follows, in order to identify high-risk groups and test for threshold effects: age <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> years height <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cm education <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> y income <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> minimum wages parity first-born, second-born, third+-born smoking in pregnancy yes, no maternal bmi <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> logistic regression models were also used to test the association of daughter phenotype with the odds of early reproduction, without or with adjustment for the equivalent trait in the mother. to test the interactive associations of low maternal capital and early daughter reproduction with adverse daughter outcomes, we conducted chi-squared tests on dichotomous variables (e.g., being short, out of school etc.). we compared simple exposures <UNK> groups, either high vs. low maternal capital, or early reproduction vs. no early reproduction) against a composite exposure <UNK> groups, differentiating reproductive status among each maternal capital groups). due to the small sample size of the lowest maternal capital group <UNK> capital penalties), we combined the <UNK> and <UNK> capital penalty groups to give a larger “low maternal capital” group for this analysis and compared them against those with <UNK> capital penalties. we used the likelihood ratio value to compare these models for their ability to explain variability in the dichotomous outcomes. all analyses were conducted in spss version <UNK> (ibm corporation, chicago) and r version <UNK> (the r foundation for statistical computing, vienna). results a total of <UNK> female cohort participants (the daughters) were followed up at <UNK> years, representing a <UNK> retention rate of the <UNK> individuals originally recruited at birth. those not followed up had lower birth weight (δ = <UNK> g, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> birth length (δ

significant, these differences were all of small magnitude, and no other differences in baseline maternal or child characteristics were evident (supplementary table <UNK> missing data analysis at <UNK> years, the proportion of missing data for daughter outcomes was as follows: <UNK> for reproductive status, education, work status and smoking status; <UNK> for birth weight and age at menarche; <UNK> for birth length; <UNK> for gestational age; <UNK> for the physical examination (blood pressure, anthropometry, and body composition); <UNK> for blood biochemistry; and <UNK> for violent crime. these missing outcome data could not be imputed, hence t-tests were used to assess whether these data were missing at random in relation to maternal capital predictors. for birth weight, birth length, age at menarche, and gestational age, data was missing at random. daughters (n = <UNK> missing data from the physical examination at <UNK> years (anthropometry, body composition, and blood pressure)

differences were apparent. daughters (n = <UNK> missing data from the blood sampling did not demonstrate any differences in maternal phenotype compared to daughters with complete data. daughters (n =

proportion of missing data for maternal predictors was low, being <UNK> for parity, smoking status and age; <UNK> for education; <UNK> for height; <UNK> for income; and <UNK> for weight. collectively, this meant that <UNK> lacked data on bmi. multiple imputation was implemented to address these missing predictor data. five imputed datasets were generated, and the results are discussed below. life-history trade-offs in association with early reproduction of daughters the comparison of daughters who had or had not reproduced by <UNK> years is summarized in figure <UNK> (see supplementary table <UNK> for numerical values). early-reproducing daughters were shorter (δ = <UNK> cm) than those without offspring, but similar in weight. they had higher bmi (δ = <UNK> <UNK> and were more likely to be obese (or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they had higher total fat mass index, however this was accompanied by lower triceps but higher subscapular skinfold, in combination indicating a more central fat deposition (figure <UNK> they had lower total cholesterol and hdl, and a less favorable ratio of total cholesterol to hdl (δ = <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but otherwise showed no differences

continuous variables are shown as percent differences and <UNK> confidence intervals, calculated from natural log-transformed variables. numerical values for all comparisons are given in supplementary table <UNK> figure <UNK> www.frontiersin.org figure <UNK> subscapular skinfold plotted against triceps skinfold in the adult daughters, stratified by whether they had reproduced by <UNK> years (red

more central fat deposition. these differences in adult size were associated with contrasting growth trajectories. daughters with children had been, at birth, significantly shorter (δ = <UNK> cm) and lighter (δ = <UNK> g), and had shorter gestation length (δ = <UNK> weeks). daughters with children also grew significantly less in length between birth and <UNK> year <UNK> conditional z-scores, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but similarly in weight, while in adolescence the two groups had similar age at menarche. overall, the early-reproducing daughters showed a growth trajectory favoring weight gain at the expense of linear growth (figure <UNK> and the contrast in height had already reached its adult magnitude in z-score terms by <UNK> year of age. figure <UNK> www.frontiersin.org figure <UNK> trajectories of growth in length/height z-score and weight z-score in the daughters, stratified by whether they had reproduced by <UNK> years or not. early reproducing daughters showed poor linear growth between birth and <UNK> year, but increased in weight between <UNK> and <UNK> years, resulting in their achieving similar weight at <UNK> years to non-reproducing daughters at a cost to growth in height. daughters bearing children early were much less likely than those still childless to have studied over the last year, or to be in school at the time of the follow-up, and had completed on average <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> years less education. among a subset with relevant data (n = <UNK> the most common reason that daughters with children gave for not being in school was being a mother <UNK> or being married <UNK> whereas for those without children, the most common reasons were work <UNK> or not considering education important <UNK> (table <UNK> when those giving the response “having children” were omitted from this analysis (since this response was only relevant to one group), the chi-square test remained significant (p < <UNK> and the strongest contrasts were daughters without children being more likely to have left school to work, for marriage, or for an unstated reason. table <UNK> www.frontiersin.org table <UNK> reasons for not studying, stratified by daughters' early reproduction status. daughters with children were less than half as likely to have received a monthly allowance (in brazilian reais, rs) or payment for work in the last month, though if they had, the amount was similar to that received by daughters without children (allowance: δ = <UNK> rs, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> work payment: δ = <UNK> rs, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they were more than three times as likely to declare themselves current smokers, and to have smoked at least once during the last week, and <UNK> times more likely to have committed violent crime. the two groups further showed significant contrasts in the characteristics of their mothers. compared to those without children, early-reproducing daughters with children were less likely to be first-born and more likely to be fourth+-born. their mothers were twice as likely to have smoked in pregnancy, but were no different in terms of alcohol intake. their mothers were on average significantly younger (δ = <UNK> y; <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shorter (δ = <UNK> cm; <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> poorer (δ = <UNK> minimum wages; <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and had less education (δ = <UNK> y; <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but they did not differ in bmi <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> these findings were essentially unchanged if multiple imputation was used to address the small proportion of missing data relating to maternal predictors. overall, early reproduction by daughters was associated with poorer growth and educational attainment, a more unhealthy distribution of body fat, and an increased likelihood of risky behavior. these trade-offs appeared to have their origins in early life, indicated by associations of early reproduction with growth trajectory and with maternal capital indicators. which components of maternal capital predict daughter's early reproduction? table <UNK> reports the results of logistic regression models, testing for independent associations of maternal characteristics with the risk of early reproduction by the daughter. young age, short height, low education, low income, higher parity, and smoking were all independent maternal predictors, whereas low maternal bmi was not. table <UNK> www.frontiersin.org table <UNK> multivariable logistic regression testing independent associations of maternal capital components with odds of daughter reproducing by <UNK> yearsa. this analysis justifies our use of a composite index of maternal capital to explore variability in daughter phenotype, as the effects of maternal capital components on offspring life history trajectory are independent and therefore likely to be cumulative. associations of maternal capital with daughter traits our maternal capital score was expressed as the cumulative number of penalties across the four traits, ranging from <UNK> to <UNK> the characteristics of individual maternal traits varied in a dose-response manner in association with the composite score (table <UNK> thus, as expected, the fewer the maternal capital penalties, the greater the mother's height, bmi, income and education. the composite index showed an inverse dose-response association with maternal age (table <UNK> but a direct association with the frequency of high parity. thus, low capital mothers were younger but given their tendency to higher parity, their daughters must on average compete with more siblings for maternal investment. table <UNK> www.frontiersin.org table <UNK> dose-response associations of individual maternal capital traits according to the number of penalties in the composite maternal capital index. table <UNK> www.frontiersin.org table <UNK> dose response associations of maternal or daughter traits according to the number of penalties in maternal capital. the composite maternal capital index also showed dose-response associations with diverse characteristics of the daughters (table <UNK> figure <UNK> of particular importance for our over-arching hypothesis, the greater the number of maternal capital penalties, the greater the likelihood of the daughter reproducing by <UNK> years, though the highest frequency of early reproduction occurred not in the lowest maternal capital group with <UNK> penalties <UNK> but in the next lowest group with <UNK> penalties <UNK> broadly, maternal capital was positively associated in dose-response manner with the daughter's growth trajectory and adult size, and the likelihood of her being in school, and inversely with the daughter's likelihood of smoking and of having committed violent crime. adjusting for triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold increased in association with the number of maternal capital penalties (p = <UNK> indicating a more central fat distribution in daughters receiving low maternal investment (figure <UNK> however, associations with cardio-metabolic risk markers with the maternal capital index were inconsistent. the duration of exclusive breast-feeding fell with increasing number of maternal capital penalties (test for trend p < <UNK> but the magnitude of this effect was very small (figure <UNK> figure <UNK> www.frontiersin.org figure <UNK> dose-response associations between daughter traits and the magnitude of maternal capital, categorized in terms of a total composite score of “penalties” (ranging from <UNK> to <UNK> selected from the categories “short stature,” “low body mass index,” “low education,” and “low family income.” see text for details of how the index and its categories are defined. the greater the number of capital penalties, the lower the magnitude of maternal capital. figure <UNK> www.frontiersin.org figure <UNK> dose-response associations of subscapular skinfold, adjusted for triceps skinfold, according to the number of “penalties” in maternal capital (ranging

duration of exclusive breast-feeding, according to the number of “penalties” in maternal capital (ranging from <UNK> to <UNK> test for trend p = <UNK> figure <UNK> (see supplementary table <UNK> for numerical values) illustrates these patterns by contrasting the daughters from the highest and lowest maternal capital groups. the results show substantial similarity with the comparison of daughters with/without offspring, as shown in the figure <UNK> the low and high maternal groups contrasted strongly in the individual maternal traits: low-capital mothers had substantially lower values for mean height (δ = <UNK> cm, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pre-pregnancy bmi (δ = <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> educational attainment (δ = <UNK> y, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and family income (δ = <UNK> minimum wages, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> low-capital mothers were more than twice as likely to smoke during pregnancy, but no more likely to drink alcohol. low-capital mothers were nearly three times more likely than high-capital mothers to be high-parity <UNK> offspring), but were similarly likely to be first-time mothers. daughters of low-capital mothers were <UNK> times as likely as those of high-capital mothers to have reproduced by <UNK> years, and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> times more likely to have two or more children by this age. daughters of low-capital mothers were lighter and shorter at birth and remained smaller at <UNK> year than those of high-capital mothers, and achieved menarche <UNK> months later. low-capital daughters remained <UNK> cm shorter and <UNK> kg lighter at <UNK> years, and had lower lean body mass and whole-body fat mass. they had lower triceps but similar subscapular skinfold, indicating a more central abdominal fat distribution. taking into account the average age at menarche and adult height of each group, we estimate that the daughters of low-capital mothers would on average have been shorter and lighter than those of high-capital mothers at the time of menarche. daughters of low-capital mothers did not differ from those of high-capital mothers in their fasting glucose, triglycerides or blood pressure. they had lower total cholesterol, with this difference due to significantly lower hdl (“healthy” cholesterol) whereas “unhealthy” ldl cholesterol was similar between the groups. thus, in contrast to the associations with body size and body composition, maternal capital was not a good predictor of daughters' cardio-metabolic physiology. daughters of low-capital mothers were only one fifth as likely as high-capital daughters to have studied over the previous year, or to be in school at the time of the follow-up, and on average they had completed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fewer years education. low-capital daughters were less likely to have received a monthly allowance in the previous month, though if they did it was of similar magnitude to that received by high-capital daughters (δ = <UNK> rs, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they were equally likely to have been paid for work, and for those working, the monthly payment was similar to that received by high-capital daughters (δ = <UNK> rs, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> low-capital daughters were almost twice as likely to smoke, and more than twice as likely to have committed violent crime. overall, lower maternal capital was associated with an increased risk of early reproduction in the daughter, along with poorer linear growth, less healthy fat distribution, lower educational attainment, and greater likelihood of risky behavior. clustering of outcomes and interaction analysis we considered two possible drivers of clustering of adverse outcomes in the daughters: early reproduction and low maternal capital. first, we compared all daughters who had reproduced by <UNK> years against those who had not. daughters who reproduced by <UNK> years comprised <UNK> of the population, but accounted for <UNK> of obesity, <UNK> of violent crime, <UNK> of short stature, <UNK> of current smoking and <UNK> of school dropout. they also accounted for <UNK> of low birth weight. in turn, we combined the daughters from the two groups characterized by the lowest levels of maternal capital (either <UNK> or <UNK> penalties, n = <UNK> and compared this group against the remainder of the cohort. the low capital group comprised <UNK> of the population of daughters, and accounted for <UNK> of obesity, <UNK> of violent crime, <UNK> of smoking, <UNK> of short stature, <UNK> of low birth weight, <UNK> of school dropout, and <UNK> of early reproduction. thus, the most common adverse outcome in the low capital segment was early childbearing. the interactive associations of adverse outcomes with daughter's exposure to low maternal capital and early reproduction are given in table <UNK> compared to simple models, which compared the outcomes either across the low vs. high maternal capital groups, or between early reproducing daughters vs. those not reproducing, the model that compared across all four groups explained more variability in the distribution, indicated by higher likelihood ratio values. for most traits, the pattern was very similar: among early reproducing daughters, outcomes were worse if her mother was also in the low capital group, compared to the high capital group. similarly, among daughters with low maternal capital, outcomes were worse if the daughter had also reproduced early, compared to not reproducing early. thus, the worst outcomes for almost every trait were evident in daughters with both low maternal capital and early reproduction, however the one exception was overweight, where the worst outcome was evident in early reproducing daughters from the high maternal capital group. table <UNK> www.frontiersin.org table <UNK> chi-squared tests of interactive associations of maternal capital status and daughter reproductive status with adverse daughter outcomes. both early reproduction and low maternal capital therefore contribute to clustering of adverse outcomes among individuals in this population, and they may represent different components of the overall causal chain. overall, the worst outcomes occurred among daughters characterized by both early reproduction and exposure to low maternal capital in early life. adjusting for direct mother-daughter transmission of traits given that early-reproducing daughters were both shorter, and also the offspring of shorter mothers, maternal phenotype should be controlled for when testing the association of early reproduction with the daughter's growth trajectory. such associations might be driven by shared genetic factors, or non-genetic inter-generational transmission. a similar scenario applies to behavioral traits, which might be replicated across generations due to shared family habits or opportunities. adjusting for maternal height, length at birth and <UNK> year and adult height all remained inversely associated with the odds of early reproduction by the daughter (table <UNK> conversely, adjusting for maternal size, low weight at birth and <UNK> year was inversely associated with the odds of early reproduction by the daughter, whereas weight, bmi, and fat mass index at <UNK> years were positively associated with the risk. of particular interest, the model for bmi showed contrasting associations between the mother and daughter, with lower maternal bmi, and higher daughter bmi, predicting early reproduction by the daughter. overall, these associations indicated that poor early growth followed by greater gains in weight and fat after <UNK> year favored early reproduction, indicating an overall growth trajectory favoring weight gain over linear growth, as indicated in figure <UNK> moreover, the association between early reproduction and short adult stature was primarily driven not by reproduction curtailing adolescent growth, but rather by poor early growth patterns predicting early reproduction. table <UNK> www.frontiersin.org table <UNK> odds ratio of early reproduction associated with the daughter's growth phenotype, without/with adjustment for maternal phenotype. likewise, adjusting for the equivalent component of maternal phenotype, early reproducing daughters had attained fewer years of education, were less likely to be in school, and more likely to smoke (table <UNK> table <UNK> www.frontiersin.org table <UNK> association of early reproduction with components of daughter phenotype, without/with adjustment for the same, or similar component of maternal phenotype. in general, therefore, early reproduction was associated with unfavorable trade-offs relating to growth, health, education and risk-taking, independent of the potential direct maternal transmission of phenotypic traits. discussion the early developmental period, during which phenotype is most sensitive to the environment, is also the period when environmental stresses and stimuli are primarily transduced through maternal phenotype <UNK> <UNK> on this basis, we hypothesized that maternal capital, a marker of the resources available for investment, may leave a unique imprint on the offspring during early life, impacting both behavioral and physiological traits. specifically, we predicted that early reproduction in daughters would correlate with risk-prone behavior, and demonstrate trade-offs with each of growth, health, and investment in education. we further predicted that such trade-offs would be induced by exposure to low maternal capital in early life. our results support this conceptual approach, with several key findings. first, supporting figure <UNK> we found that early reproduction was indeed associated with reduced investment in competing traits, including adult height and lean mass, and levels of education. early reproduction was also associated with a greater propensity for risky behavior, and with some markers of poorer cardio-metabolic health, such as a higher risk of obesity, more central fat deposition and a less favorable cholesterol profile. second, these trade-offs began to emerge early in development, indicated by contrasting growth trajectories. on average, early-reproducing daughters were smaller at birth than their childless peers and remained shorter in adulthood, but by <UNK> year of age they had negated their deficit in weight, and by adulthood they demonstrated higher bmi and markers of whole-body and central adiposity. these growth contrasts were not mediated by age at menarche, rather the significant factor was a trade-off between linear growth and weight gain, commencing in early life. on this basis, the trajectory to early reproduction had already started before birth, and any increase in nutritional supply in early post-natal life did not resolve earlier deficits in linear growth, but rather promoted weight gain. a more extreme version of this scenario is illustrated by international adoption studies, which have found that if poor early growth is followed by exposure to increased resources in childhood, sexual maturation is substantially accelerated without promoting linear growth <UNK> <UNK> third, supporting figure <UNK> early reproduction was associated with low maternal capital, with early-reproducing daughters born to younger, shorter, poorer, and less educated mothers. their mothers were also more likely to smoke and to have larger family size, indicative of greater inter-sibling competition for maternal investment. the importance of maternal investment for explaining variability in daughter phenotype was confirmed by comparing groups of daughters stratified by high or low levels of our composite index of maternal capital. supporting figure <UNK> low maternal capital was associated with the daughter trading off growth and education in favor of greater likelihood of early reproduction, central adiposity, and risky behaviors. again, these patterns were initiated in early life, demonstrated by reduced birth weight and infant growth. menarche occurred later in the low capital daughters, despite their higher odds of reproducing by <UNK> years, indicating continued constraint of linear growth. sexual maturation therefore appears to have occurred at smaller body size rather than younger age in the daughters of low capital mothers, consistent with other studies in low-/middle-income countries <UNK> <UNK> fourth, an important finding was that early-reproducing daughters did not simply replicate maternal traits. rather, holding constant the presence or absence of a particular adverse outcome in the mother, markers of poor growth, and development in the daughter were independent predictors of early reproduction by the daughter. likewise, early reproduction by the daughter was associated with lower educational attainment and current smoking, independent of the mother's education and smoking status at baseline. an intriguing finding was that lower maternal bmi, but higher daughter bmi, predicted early reproduction by the daughter. fifth, supporting figure <UNK> we found a synergistic association of adverse outcomes with exposure to low maternal capital and early reproduction. specifically, outcomes were worse among low-capital daughters if they had also reproduced early, while outcomes were worse among early reproducing daughters if they had also been exposed to low maternal capital. these trade-offs indicate a generic link between low maternal investment and “future discounting” by the offspring that is both mediated by, and also exacerbated by, early reproduction. these findings are consistent with other studies linking poor early growth with lower educational attainment <UNK> earlier reproduction <UNK> reduced family income <UNK> and poorer adult health <UNK> <UNK> these associations furthermore demonstrate a dose-response nature, so that the greater the magnitude of maternal capital, the better the daughter's growth and educational progress, and the lower the likelihood of her reproducing by <UNK> years. however, an interesting finding was that the highest frequency of early childbearing occurred not among daughters in the lowest maternal capital group, but in the second-lowest group. we speculate that the daughters of the lowest capital mothers experienced continued exposure to poverty during childhood, which may have constrained the magnitude of the resulting trade-offs, including the likelihood of reproducing early. consistent with that hypothesis, they had a later age of menarche than all the other groups (table <UNK> although low birth weight has been associated with earlier menarche in high-income populations, the magnitude of this effect is very small (difference of <UNK> months compared to high birth weights), whereas daughters with higher weight at <UNK> years underwent menarche a full year earlier compared with those with low weight at this age <UNK> there may be human societies in which access to resources during development is so constrained among those of lower rank that higher-ranking individuals reproduce earlier, and this scenario has been reported in several primate species <UNK> of relevance to understanding such variability in human populations, age at menarche in low-middle-income countries correlates with infant mortality rate <UNK> suggesting that when a greater proportion of energy intake is diverted to immune function the pace of maturation is reduced. fifth, we showed that the segments of the population reproducing early, or exposed to low maternal capital, were characterized by a cluster of adverse outcomes including shorter stature, more central fat deposition, less education, and more risky behavior. the evidence for a trade-off between early reproduction and health markers was weaker, however this is most likely because non-communicable diseases primarily develop later in the adult life-course. early-reproducing daughters had few overt markers of cardio-metabolic risk, but their lower birth weight, shorter stature, higher bmi, and more central fat distribution all predict poorer cardio-metabolic health from middle age onwards. as mentioned in the introduction, the closer association of abdominal body fat than peripheral fat with markers of immune function allows us to consider variability in central adiposity as a broad marker of investment in immune function <UNK> our results therefore indicate that daughters exposed to low maternal capital prioritized the allocation of energy to immune defense, which may help resist infections in the short term, but at a cost to long-term cardio-metabolic health. our results offer unique insight into why inter-generational cycles of disadvantage are perpetuated: exposure to lower maternal capital is associated with a life history trajectory that compromises physical and educational development, in favor of an increased susceptibility to early reproduction, accompanied by greater immune defense. those who realize this tendency for early reproduction compound these trade-offs. the capacity for facultative adjustment of life history strategy in response to maternal capital has been predicted to be crucial in hierarchical societies, due to the long-term consequences of variability in early growth trajectories <UNK> our findings are consistent with previous research, which has linked parental investment with the life-history trajectory of offspring, especially daughters. for example, studies on us children have linked the timing of menarche with the quality of mother-child relationships <UNK> or markers of paternal investment <UNK> however, few studies have extended this approach to markers of pre-natal maternal investment. exceptions include a study of young south asian women living in the uk, which found that those with lower birth weight (indicating reduced maternal investment in utero) were characterized by trade-offs favoring reproductive potential over growth and the maintenance of health <UNK> in a larger uk birth cohort, low birth weight was associated with faster maturation and earlier anticipation of starting a family during adolescence, followed by increased likelihood of reproducing before <UNK> years <UNK> overall, such research remains largely limited to high-income western populations, and there is need for studies in other settings, and to address male offspring <UNK> both the behavioral and physiological trade-offs we have documented are consistent with the logic of future discounting. a link between early reproduction with social or economic disadvantage during early life is well-recognized <UNK> as are associations in adulthood of early childbearing with poor health outcomes and reduced life opportunities <UNK> <UNK> likewise, previous research using similar conceptual models has linked higher perceived extrinsic mortality risk with higher rates of avoidable death at the population level, and with less effort in maintaining health and earlier reproduction at the individual level <UNK> <UNK> in terms of behavior, those whose family members typically perform low-skilled work may see less value in extended education, since it delays access to wages <UNK> while high community rates of adult violence and morbidity may negate public health advice to preserve health by avoiding smoking or high alcohol consumption <UNK> although markers of adversity during development seem to be universally associated with riskier behavior, the exact nature of the risky behavior undertaken may differ between populations according to cultural norms, which may account for our null findings for maternal alcohol consumption. by the same logic, poor growth in early life reduces the constitutional somatic quality of the body, through depleting components of organ function that contribute to homeostasis. as encapsulated in the “disposable soma” hypothesis, the payoff for investing in “maintenance” to reduce the rate of deterioration in old age must inevitably decline, if the chances of reaching old age are reduced <UNK> <UNK> this may help explain the elevated diabetes susceptibility in old age among those with low birth weight, since investing in the capacity to prevent diabetes in the long-term will benefit only a minority of such individuals if the majority are likely to succumb to mortality earlier <UNK> <UNK> our analysis builds on these earlier studies, by linking early reproduction with both physiological and behavioral outcomes indicative of future discounting. our key new insight is that this future discounting is associated with low maternal investment. a variety of theoretical frameworks have been used to study the consequences of exposure to adversity and deprived environments on markers of health and human capital <UNK> <UNK> a very simple conceptual approach, for example, could predict that adverse outcomes are inter-correlated, and that those at the lowest level of social hierarchies tend to have less of everything. however, our findings do not support such a simple model—it is not clear, for example, why mothers with low capital should have daughters who are more likely to smoke (a habit that incurs regular financial costs) or reproduce early (which also generates metabolic and material costs). life history theory offers a better fit with these findings, through its incorporation of the principles of trade-offs and future discounting. in a different vein, there are also other theoretical frameworks that are not necessarily inconsistent with life history theory, and which make similar predictions based on different theoretical assumptions <UNK> it is already recognized that different theories may be addressing proximate or ultimate levels of explanation, and that they may be complementary rather than contradictory <UNK> in identifying trade-offs, it is important not to blame mothers for their low capital, or for the adverse outcomes in their daughters, or indeed the daughters themselves. as indicated by our evidence on inter-generational associations, being short, thin, uneducated, and poor are traits that are largely beyond individual control. it is noteworthy that relevant underlying trade-offs were already emerging during fetal life. interestingly, maternal capital status was only weakly correlated with the duration of exclusive breast-feeding, where mothers may have greater opportunity consciously to influence their investment in their offspring. early reproduction is widely considered an unsatisfactory trait by policy makers. however, a tendency to reproduce early in adverse environments is expected to have been favored by selection in ancestral environments, in the face of high extrinsic mortality risk. such trade-offs may continue to be elicited in contemporary environments, even though they adversely impact health and educational attainment in both generations. the emphasis should therefore be on improving environmental conditions, to reduce these trade-offs. strengths and limitations among the strengths of the study are the prospective data on maternal capital and early growth patterns of the daughters, the wide range of outcomes spanning both physiology and behavior assessed in the daughters, the large sample size, and the relatively high cohort retention rate at <UNK> years. moreover, very few studies have previously tested life history predictions in low-/middle-income country populations, in particular those characterized by very high levels of social inequality. our study also had several limitations. first, a fifth of the cohort did not participate in the adult follow-up, however baseline differences between those followed and those not followed were few and of small magnitude, hence any bias from this source is unlikely to jeopardize our findings. the lower average weight and length at birth among those not followed up suggests that the magnitude of the association of poor growth with elevated risk of early reproduction we report may be conservative. however, the only maternal trait that varied by follow-up status was bmi, which showed no independent association with early reproduction by the daughter. hence there is likely to be negligible bias in our overall assessment of the association between maternal capital and adverse daughter outcomes. second, a small amount of data was missing for both maternal and daughter traits, in most cases <UNK> but reaching a maximum of <UNK> for the violent crime outcome in daughters. however, we consider that these missing data had little effect on our results. for the mothers, the missing data were imputed, but the findings changed negligibly. for the daughters, those missing data on anthropometry and body composition tended to have shorter, younger and less educated mothers, while those missing data on violent crime had mothers with lower family income, but in each case the magnitude of these differences relative to the range in the entire population was small. data on the blood test appeared to be missing at random. third, we elected to use a categorical approach to integrate the different components of maternal phenotype, rather than conducting analysis of continuous variables. this approach reduced our ability to assess daughter outcomes across the whole range of maternal capital, however the benefit was that it allowed us to focus on mothers who were in the bottom tertile of the population for any given trait, i.e., a high-risk group. moreover, by counting “maternal capital penalties,” we could analyse the consequences of mothers lacking capital across a range of different outcomes. we used the same categorical approach for daughters, in order to assess the odds of daughters falling into high-risk groups. overall, we suggest that this focus on high-risk groups among both mothers and daughters helps understand inter-generational cycles of disadvantage. while different approaches might have emphasized different associations in these data, we believe that our findings are robust and would have broadly emerged using other analytical designs. fourth, we lacked data on paternal phenotype (education, income, height, nutritional status, presence in the household) and therefore could not test for independent effects of paternal investment. although we treated household income as a component of maternal capital, it may commonly relate to both parents' earning capacity. similarly, education is characterized by assortative mating, with men tending to marry women of equal or fewer years of schooling, hence we cannot differentiate a specific association attributable to the mother's education. if height of the two parents is correlated, then likewise, the reduced early growth rates of offspring of shorter mothers might in part reflect a low paternal growth drive. however, while acknowledging these paternal effects, we could also consider such assortative mating with low capital fathers to represent the “extended phenotype” of the low-capital mother <UNK> since high-capital mothers are likely to use their phenotype (greater wealth, education, and body size) to increase their chances of pairing with high-capital fathers. fifth, we had information on only a single child within each family, and could not therefore test how maternal investment might vary through the reproductive career. the fact that low-capital mothers tended to have higher parity than high-mothers suggests greater competition between the offspring of low capital mothers for a smaller pool of maternal resources. since mothers may accumulate capital through the life-course, and since low capital mothers tend as we have shown to reproduce early, the adverse consequences for the offspring of low capital mothers might be greatest if they are also first-borns. given the birth order differences in our sample, our findings may therefore be conservative. more generally our findings relate to a specific time period and specific city in southern brazil, and it is unclear how they might generalize to other periods or geographical settings. sixth, our analysis was observational, and could not demonstrate causal associations of maternal capital and daughter outcomes, nor direct trade-offs between the different daughter outcomes. while correlations between life history traits are widely interpreted as demonstrating trade-offs in human studies <UNK> an experimental approach would be necessary to demonstrate that increasing or decreasing energy allocation to one function causes the opposite effect on another function. however, mathematical modeling offers another opportunity to provide support for our interpretation <UNK> future work in this area could extend our approach to male offspring, and could use alternative approaches to derive cumulative maternal capital scores. regarding outcomes, it would be valuable to assess more direct markers of immune function such as leptin, or the status of pro-inflammatory markers. finally, while our focus here was on the manifestation of trade-offs at the onset of adulthood when aging effects are modest, longer-term follow-up would allow us to investigate how these trade-offs might change across the daughter's reproductive career. in addition, it would be possible investigate how daughters' lifetime fitness itself varies in association with the timing of reproduction and the magnitude of maternal capital to which they were exposed in early life. in conclusion, our study has shown that early reproduction is associated with an increased likelihood of adverse adult outcomes, which are expected to impact adversely on future generations. in this way, we highlight the central role of trade-offs associated with early reproduction in perpetuating inter-generational cycles of disadvantage. we further showed that the life history trajectory and adult phenotype of daughters can be predicted from a composite index of maternal capital, with both physical and socio-economic maternal traits contributing. both behavioral and physiological outcomes demonstrated a common pattern of

<UNK> we explained less clustering than caspi et al., but this may be due to our focus on early reproduction to assess adult trade-offs, and to the relatively young age of the sample <UNK> years, compared to <UNK> years in the dunedin cohort). clustering may become more pronounced with age, particularly regarding health markers. although post-natal factors affecting adult outcomes are also relevant, our study is important in showing that factors acting in prenatal life and infancy already account for some clustering of adverse outcomes. differences in female growth up to age <UNK> had largely been determined by the end of infancy in our study, while other studies indicate that secular trends in height are also largely accounted for by growth prior to <UNK> years <UNK> the policy implications are that interventions targeting childhood and adolescence are likely to come too late to resolve these high-risk developmental trajectories. while efforts to prevent early reproduction will reduce the consequences of exposure to low maternal capital, the most effective intervention to improve daughter outcomes would be to improve maternal capital, thus reducing the risks of poor early growth and early reproduction in the daughter. interventions on both health and education are likely to achieve their greatest beneficial effects if they target women before they conceive their offspring. moreover, interventions should be sustained over a multi-generational time-frame for the full benefits to emerge, through the cumulative exposure of each generation to favorable maternal capital during early critical windows. finally, societies need to become more gender equal so women have equal access to resources to accumulate their maternal capital. such an approach is likely to be essential to resolve inter-generational cycles of disadvantage that adversely affect both men and women. the incentive for such an approach is that successful interventions could produce benefits across a wide range of behavioral and physiological traits.

optimal design for longitudinal studies to estimate pubertal height growth in individuals abstract background: the sitar model expresses individual pubertal height growth in terms of mean size, peak height velocity (phv) and age at phv. aim: to use sitar to identify the optimal time interval between measurements to summarise individual pubertal height growth. subjects and methods: heights in <UNK> boys aged <UNK> years from christ’s hospital school measured on <UNK> <UNK> occasions (a median of <UNK> heights per boy) were analysed using the sitar (superimposition by translation and rotation) mixed effects growth curve model, which estimates a mean curve and three subject-specific random effects. separate models were fitted to sub-sets of the data with measurement intervals of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> months, and the different models were compared. results: the models for intervals <UNK> months gave effectively identical results for the residual standard deviation <UNK> cm), mean spline curve <UNK> degrees of freedom) and random effects (correlations <UNK> showing there is no benefit in measuring height more often than annually. the model for <UNK> intervals fitted slightly less well, but needed just four-to-five measurements per individual. conclusions: height during puberty needs to be measured only annually and, with slightly lower precision, just four biennial measurements can be sufficient. introduction growth in puberty is recognised as an important stage in the life course, with the pattern of growth at this time impacting significantly on later health. as a recent example, pubertal height and weight growth in the british <UNK> birth cohort were found to have a clinically important effect on bone health <UNK> years later (cole et al. <UNK> kuh et al. <UNK> it was not only the individual’s size (i.e. mean height and weight) in puberty that was influential, but also two aspects of their pubertal growth spurt: its timing and intensity. the timing of puberty based on height or weight in individuals is usually defined by the age when they are growing fastest, their age at peak velocity (marshall & tanner <UNK> <UNK> equally, the intensity of puberty is summarised by their peak velocity, which is inversely correlated with their duration of puberty—the faster they grow, the sooner they reach adult size. the mean age at peak height velocity (phv) is <UNK> years in boys and <UNK> years earlier in girls, while mean phv is <UNK> cm/year in the two sexes. however, both timing and intensity vary enormously from one individual to another; the population standard deviations (sd) of phv and age at phv being <UNK> cm/year and <UNK> year, respectively (cole et al. <UNK> thus, the distribution of age at phv in the population spans more than <UNK> years in each sex. in the past, the age at peak velocity in individuals was estimated by fitting a growth curve to their serial growth data, e.g. the five-parameter preece-baines curve (preece & baines <UNK> or a natural cubic smoothing spline curve (sandhu et al. <UNK> from this their age at peak velocity could be obtained, either as the solution to a quadratic in the parameters or from the first derivative of the spline curve. however, the downside of this approach was the need to repeat the analysis for each individual. now, with the advent of non-linear mixed effects models, it is possible to estimate puberty timing for individuals by fitting a single model to the entire cohort, and functions of the subject random effects identify the timings for individuals. a recent paper by simpkin et al. <UNK> compared three such methods for estimating age at phv: a multilevel model using fractional polynomials (mlm-fp) (goldstein <UNK> superimposition by translation and rotation (sitar) (cole et al. <UNK> and principal analysis by conditional expectation (pace) (yao et al. <UNK> each model was compared with the preecebaines model <UNK> fitted to individuals (preece & baines, <UNK> and the focus was the degree of bias in the estimated mean age at phv. the authors concluded that, of the three models, only sitar estimated age at phv, essentially without bias, and they recommended it and the preece-baines model on this basis. the sitar model (cole et al. <UNK> has a number of advantages over the preece-baines model. it fits all the individuals in a single model, whereas preece-baines fits them separately. it estimates the age at phv in individuals as a random effect relative to the mean age at phv, which is simpler to obtain than calculating it from other parameters. it also fits the mean curve as a cubic spline, which is more flexible in shape than the parametric preece-baines curve. in addition, sitar includes two further subject-specific random effects representing each individual’s relative size and growth intensity (i.e. phv), which, together with the timing random effect, account for most of the variance in pubertal height growth—sitar consistently explains over <UNK> of the crosssectional variance (cole et al. <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> prentice et al. <UNK> the analysis by simpkin et al. <UNK> simulated height growth curves for boys from <UNK> years using the preecebaines model <UNK> (preece & baines <UNK> while systematically varying the measurement error, sample size, time interval between measurements, and measurement balance. it found that sitar performed well, irrespective of the selected measurement error, sample size, or time interval, with the exception of measurements every <UNK> months when the model failed to converge or was seriously biased. simpkin et al. <UNK> also analysed the same four models using real data for boys from christ’s hospital school, and found that the correlations between age at phv estimated by the different methods were generally low. in their analyses simpkin et al. <UNK> varied the frequency of measurement occasions, but they did not address the specific design question as to which measurement interval is the most efficient for estimating pubertal growth, and in previous cohort studies this interval has varied widely. j. m. tanner’s harpenden growth study collected measurements every <UNK> months during puberty (marshall & tanner <UNK> <UNK> while the edinburgh growth study saw subjects every <UNK> or <UNK> months (cole et al. <UNK> the wrocław growth study collected measurements annually (bielicki & waliszko <UNK> and the avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac) clinically examined children every <UNK> or <UNK> years during puberty (boyd et al. <UNK> it is evident that more frequent measurements will lead to better estimates, be they of the timing or the intensity of the growth spurt. however, there is likely to be an optimal measurement frequency, such that extra measurements beyond the optimum improve the estimates only marginally. this study aims to use the sitar model to address the question: what is the optimal time interval between measurements to quantify pubertal height growth in individual boys, providing adequate accuracy at reasonable cost? in doing so it will build on and extend the work of simpkin et al. <UNK> using the same christ’s hospital school dataset. methods data management the analysis is based on a single dataset of <UNK> <UNK> height measurements collected on <UNK> boys aged <UNK> years from christ’s hospital boys school, horsham, sussex, uk, between <UNK> and <UNK> (heights were not measured in the ch girls school). christ’s hospital is an independent school, established in <UNK> which has always admitted pupils from a wide social and geographical background, asking parents to contribute towards fees according to their means. virtually all the boys were born in the uk, so it is likely the vast majority were of european descent. simpkin et al. <UNK> used broadly the same dataset, with <UNK> <UNK> heights from <UNK> boys. height was measured with an avery yard-arm platform scale with height standard attached and recorded to the nearest <UNK> inch <UNK> mm) (friend <UNK> for analysis, the heights were expressed in centimetres to two decimal places. the boys were measured at the start and end of each term, i.e. six times a year, throughout their time at the school. the first height per child was at a median age of <UNK> (interquartile range ¼ <UNK> years, the last height was at <UNK> <UNK> years, and the time interval from first to last measurement was <UNK> <UNK> years. the scale of the dataset makes it suitable to compare the performance of different sampling designs. the dataset was first cleaned by excluding measurements whose residuals after fitting the sitar model (see next section) exceeded <UNK> residual standard deviations <UNK> cm) in absolute value (n ¼ <UNK> or <UNK> the same dataset, except with <UNK> outlying measurements excluded, was used to validate the sitar growth curve model, see figure <UNK> of cole et al. <UNK> the ideal dataset to address the research question would consist of frequent regularly spaced measurements, from which longer measurement intervals could be obtained by selecting suitably spaced sub-sets of the data. however, the school pattern at christ’s hospital consisted of a shorter spring term, its length depending on the timing of easter, and longer summer and autumn terms, while the holidays were of <UNK> or <UNK> weeks duration. as a result, the distribution of time intervals between measurements had three distinct peaks at <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> weeks. this complicated the selection of suitable measurements to represent particular time intervals. in addition, some measurements were inevitably missing, so it was not realistic to expect every nth measurement to be equally spaced in time. instead, an algorithm was developed to extract equally spaced measurements, which has been implemented as the timegap function in the sitar library (cole <UNK> of the statistical language r version <UNK> (r core team <UNK> the same library was used to fit the sitar models. timegap works as follows: (a) a target time interval is specified (e.g. <UNK> months); then, for each individual, timegap (b) calculates the differences in age between all pairs of measurements; (c) expresses them as multiples of the target interval; (d) restricts them to those within a tolerance of <UNK> of (an integer multiple of) the target interval; and (e) identifies those providing the longest sequence of measurements. in this way sub-sets of measurements for each individual were obtained where the time gaps between measurements were close to one or more target intervals. the following time intervals were investigated as simple fractions or multiples of <UNK> months: <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> months, <UNK> and <UNK> years, and sub-set datasets for each interval were constructed using timegap. the <UNK> interval was included to test the findings of simpkin et al. <UNK> note that the actual ages of measurement were not constrained. time intervals of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> years were also explored, but the sitar models fitted to them failed to converge and they are not considered further. inevitably the numbers of subjects and measurements in each dataset differed, and, to address this, the data were restricted to the sub-set of individuals with measurements in all six datasets. statistical analysis the purpose of the analysis was to compare the different time intervals by summarising the data using a separate sitar model for each interval; the model based on the full dataset was also fitted for comparison. sitar (superimposition by translation and rotation) is a shape invariant growth curve model consisting of a natural cubic bspline mean curve and three subject-specific random effects that have the effect of shifting the mean curve to match the subjects’ own growth curves (beath <UNK> cole et al. <UNK> lindstrom <UNK> the three random effects are size, a measure of relative height in the individual, timing (or tempo), the relative timing of their age at phv (aphv), and intensity, their relative phv. in geometric terms the three random effects can be thought of as size shifting the individual curves up/ down, timing shifting them left/right, and intensity stretching/ shrinking the age scale, to alter the average slope. the purpose of these adjustments is to—as closely as possible— superimpose the individual curves on the mean curve. the complexity of the mean spline curve’s shape was controlled by choosing the degrees of freedom to minimise the bayesian information criterion (bic). the sitar models were fitted, as height vs log age, with either <UNK> or <UNK> degrees of freedom for the mean curve, age being log-transformed to reflect a multiplicative age effect. with log age the timing random effect is a difference in log age, which corresponds to a percentage difference in age (cole & altman <UNK> so individuals differ in developmental age by a few percentage points, which corresponds to the age scale being stretched or shrunk; this is more valid biologically than a linear age scale being shifted right or left. the model included both random and fixed effects for size, timing, and intensity. the size effect was in units of centimetres, while timing and intensity were in fractional units (i.e. multiplied by <UNK> to give percentages) relative to aphv and phv, respectively. the models were compared on the basis of mean curve shape, residual standard deviation, mean aphv (the age when the first derivative of the mean curve, plotted as height vs age, was maximal), mean phv (the velocity at mean aphv) and the random effect standard deviations and their correlations across the models for different time intervals. to investigate the <UNK> interval in more detail, separate models were fitted for individuals with two, three, four and five measurements. results the edited

as informative as measurements taken <UNK> months apart for estimating the timing and intensity of peak height velocity in individuals. this insight could reduce the annual number of measurements in future studies from six to one, with little loss of precision—clearly a considerable saving. extending the time interval to <UNK> years would further halve the number of measurement occasions, but at a cost of slightly greater imprecision. ideally the median age of measurement <UNK> years here) should be close to mean aphv. the fact that the <UNK> interval model fitted as well as it did is instructive. the modal and median number of heights per boy was four (range is two-to-six), and the total number of heights only <UNK> of that for the full model, yet the two estimated mean ages at phv differed by only <UNK> years and the two sds for the timing random effect, at <UNK> and <UNK> were also very similar. it seems to be a good example of ‘borrowing strength’, that just a few measurements per child spread evenly across the age range can accurately estimate the timing of puberty (cole et al. <UNK> with simpkin et al. <UNK> the <UNK> model failed, fitting poorly for the unbalanced design (each measurement age within a <UNK> window) and failing to fit at all for the balanced design (all individuals measured at the same ages). why this should be is unclear, as simpkin et al. <UNK> gave no details of the models they fitted, e.g. the number of spline degrees of freedom. however, table <UNK> provides a clue, at least for the unbalanced case, in that here the <UNK> model fitted with <UNK> degrees of freedom, but not <UNK> simpkin’s model might well have fitted had they used fewer degrees of freedom. the study by simpkin et al. <UNK> involved both simulated and real data, the simulations testing for bias in aphv while the christ’s data explored model agreement in aphv. the findings here rely on real data, which were obviously less tightly controlled than simulated data. however, they were largely equally spaced in time, thanks to timegap, and the distribution of measurement ages reflected those likely to be seen in practice. thus, the findings have face validity. it has long been known that estimating the shape of the mean curve in puberty without adjusting for the pattern of growth in individuals attenuates the velocity curve and biases the mean curve (cole et al. <UNK> merrell <UNK> by adjusting for individual timing and intensity, sitar provides an unbiased estimate of the curve, irrespective of the number of measurements. in this sense, the findings are unsurprising, that reducing the number of measurements (and increasing the time interval between them) hardly affects the mean curve (and hence aphv), as confirmed by simpkin et al. <UNK> however, the fact that the residual standard deviation and the random effects are also largely unaffected is an unexpected bonus. how generalisable are the findings? it is impossible to know without repeating the study in different contexts, but several previous studies have shown that pubertal height growth in both sexes is well modelled by sitar (cole et al. <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> prentice et al. <UNK> as such, it efficiently estimates the variability in the age at phv, so it is well suited to compare different designs for estimating it. a limitation of the current dataset is its being restricted to boys, and the pubertal growth spurt is known to be less intense in girls (marshall & tanner <UNK> which might make its timing harder to estimate. against that the standard deviation of aphv is similar in the two sexes (marshall & tanner <UNK> <UNK> months <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> year <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> years figure <UNK> scatterplot matrix of random effects for

start puberty <UNK> years earlier than boys on average (marshall & tanner, <UNK> their measurement ages need to be advanced correspondingly. the strengths of the study are the application of sitar growth curve analysis to efficiently summarise the information available for each measurement interval and the large number of subjects and measurements over an age range exceeding <UNK> years, allowing comparison of time intervals from <UNK> months to <UNK> years. limitations include the data being restricted to boys, as discussed above, the ethnicity, and the data being rather old, dating back <UNK> years. these factors are likely to affect mean age at phv to some extent, but not the paper’s main conclusions. in addition, the non-uniform measurement pattern through the year has meant that the shorter time intervals were under-represented compared to those for <UNK> months or more. the topic of optimal design for longitudinal studies as addressed here has an extensive literature, which has tended to focus on designed missingness (helms, <UNK> morara et al. <UNK> verbeke & lesaffre, <UNK> this corresponds to the mixed longitudinal design, where individuals are recruited and followed up from different ages, as opposed to the pure longitudinal design of the present study. however, the question addressed here could be extended to include designed missingness by excluding individuals from further measurement once they have clearly passed their age at peak velocity. this would reduce the number of measurements needing to be collected later in puberty, although whether or not the saving was worthwhile would need further work. in conclusion, the sitar analysis has demonstrated that annual measurements are sufficient to estimate age at peak height velocity to high precision, and that biennial measurements on as few as four occasions suffer only a slight loss of precision.

commentary: methods for calculating growth trajectories and constructing growth centiles abstract this commentary rounds off a collection of papers focusing on statistical methods for analysing growth data. in two papers, anderson and colleagues discuss growth trajectory models in early life, using data on height and weight from the hbgdki initiative, while two papers from ohuma and altman review methods for centile construction, with data from the <UNK> project used to provide worked examples of centiles for birthweight and fetal head circumference. anderson et al focus on four growth trajectory models: quadratic laird‐ware, sitar, brokenstick, and face, where the latter two fit better than the former two applied to length data in individuals. on this basis, they recommend brokenstick and face for future work. however, they do not discuss the timescale on which the growth models assess growth faltering nor the relevance of this timescale to later health outcome. models that best detect short‐term fluctuations in growth (brokenstick and face) may not necessarily be best at predicting later outcome. it is premature to exclude the quadratic laird‐ware or sitar models, which give a parsimonious summary of growth in individuals over a longer timescale. ohuma and altman highlight the poor quality of reporting in fetal centile studies, and they provide recommendations for good practice. their birthweight centiles example illustrates both the power of the gamlss software and its capacity for misuse. the longitudinal fetal head circumference centiles are biased such that <UNK> of infants are below the <UNK> centile and <UNK> above the <UNK> <UNK> anderson, hafen, sofrygin, ryan, and hbgdki community the two papers from dr anderson and colleagues are among the first published outputs from the healthy birth growth and development knowledge integration (hbgdki) initiative, a major project funded by the gates <UNK> its aim is to reduce the global burden associated with poor nutritional status and impaired cognitive development in young children, by assembling data on growth and development from nutrition studies worldwide and by meta‐analysing the individual data. the aim of the first paper is to describe and compare modern methods for analysing longitudinal growth trajectories of length/height and weight, with a view to making recommendations for future practice. the scale of the initiative is impressive—the project has so far collected data on over <UNK> studies, and the first paper here focuses on <UNK> studies involving over <UNK> <UNK> children and almost <UNK> <UNK> measurement occasions. (in parenthesis, one difficulty with the project lies in its name—the acronym hbgdki is unmemorable and easily confused with the deceptively similar hbdgki, which also appears several times in their paper.) <UNK> growth trajectory models six growth trajectory models are considered: linear and quadratic versions of <UNK> my own <UNK> <UNK> multilevel <UNK> and functional pca or <UNK> all the analysis is done in r, with the code available in the hbgd <UNK> a very powerful software resource. to explore the findings in greater depth, it is useful to understand in broad terms how the growth models differ. they are all mixed models, with random subject effects, and as the authors say “there exists an overall mean curve for a particular population, and the differences between children can be explained as deviations from this mean curve.” the models differ in terms of the smoothness of the mean curve and also the smoothness of individual deviations (departures) from the mean curve. smoothness here is quantified in terms of degrees of freedom or d.f., reflecting the order of a polynomial or the number of knots in a spline curve. the d.f. for the laird‐ware models are two (linear) and three (quadratic) for the mean curve and, similarly, two and three for each subject's deviations. the d.f. for the sitar mean spline curve are user‐selected, though the authors do not state what they used. then, each subject has three d.f. to summarise departures from the mean curve, reflecting transformations of the mean curve corresponding to shifts on the measurement and age axes, plus a scaling of the age axis. thus, in this sense, sitar and quadratic laird‐ware are similar, each having three d.f. for deviations and around three d.f. for the mean curve (depending on the exact choice for sitar). the remaining three models all involve specifying a number of knots for spline curves (the brokenstick is a linear spline model, while face fits cubic splines), and in this analysis, the software defaults were used, though again, we are not told what the defaults were nor how they were determined. among other things, the required number of d.f. will depend on the size and age range of the data, which extended from birth to <UNK> days or <UNK> years in the most longstanding studies (table <UNK> a height trajectory from birth to <UNK> years is complex in shape and requires at least eight d.f. to fit adequately, but only two studies lasted this long and the median upper age across studies was <UNK> years; for such early life studies, the curve shape is much simpler, requiring only three or four d.f. <UNK> comparing model trajectories the models are first applied to the content dataset (children aged <UNK> to <UNK> years from a low income country), and the results are summarised in figures <UNK> and <UNK> showing the data and fitted curves for <UNK> distinct growth models as applied to “a single randomly selected child” (quotation marks mine—see later). figure <UNK> contains results for the six models applied to height, while figure <UNK> has the equivalent results for five models with height z‐score (haz), where sitar is omitted as it lacks biological sense on the z‐score scale. the differences between models in figure <UNK> are quite subtle, with the exception of linear laird‐ware where the fitted curve is a straight line. quadratic laird‐ware is very similar to sitar, and both fit reasonably well; this implies that both are using three d.f. for the mean curve and three for subject deviations. however, the authors feel that the laird‐ware models “are not flexible enough to model a sensible growth curve,” while sitar and the other three models “do a reasonable job.” the brokenstick and face curves are appreciably less smooth than the other four, reflecting more d.f. to play with. each curve represents the sum of the model mean curve and the subject deviations, so the extra d.f. may be allocated to either or both. figure <UNK> does not give the mean curves, so it is not possible to tell how smooth they are. figure <UNK> shows the analogous results on the haz scale. the multiple correlation is much smaller than in figure <UNK> and the plots considerably noisier, because the age trend in height has largely been removed by the z‐score transformation. when applied to the who reference sample, the mean z‐score curve is given by haz(t) = <UNK> in an obvious notation, a horizontal straight line through the origin, so the mean curve is the simplest possible. in practice, the study mean curves will not be so simple, but haz in lme countries is known to fall during the first year and then plateau, a much simpler pattern than seen in figure <UNK> thus, the models in figure <UNK> ought to allocate fewer d.f. to the mean curve than to the subject deviations, though again, there is no information on this. the authors acknowledge (on pages <UNK> and <UNK> that fewer d.f. are needed on the z‐score scale, but it is a shame that they do not expand on the statement. what is curious about figure <UNK> is the child's trajectory; haz increases monotonically with age, from <UNK> at birth to <UNK> at <UNK> years, ie dramatic length gain, in stark contrast to the early fall then plateau that one would expect for a low income country. it is hard to believe that the child was randomly selected, though equally, it is puzzling why such an extreme trajectory might have been chosen. the two laird‐ware models perform poorly in figure <UNK> ie, they are too smooth (inflexible) to pick up short‐term variation in haz. the other three models are less smooth and broadly similar in terms of flexibility. with the increased detail, it is possible to see that the brokenstick curve consists of five segments, ie four d.f., and the two spline model curves are similar in shape and probably have a similar number of d.f. (though smoothed with cubic rather than linear splines). <UNK> comparing model fit on the back of this analysis, the authors decide to focus on the penalised spline, brokenstick, and face models. the laird‐ware models are dismissed owing to their poor fit, while sitar is overlooked because its convergence can be a problem with larger datasets, and it does not fit naturally on the z‐score scale. the cross‐validation analysis for the three remaining models is extended to all <UNK> studies, and the results are shown in tables <UNK> and <UNK> the mean squared errors (mses) vary considerably from study to study, probably reflecting differences in age range. face fails to fit for <UNK> of the <UNK> studies, and mses are smaller on the z‐score scale than the height scale, where brokenstick and face perform best. figures <UNK> and <UNK> confirm that brokenstick fits better on the z‐score scale, though the figures would work better with the mse axes on log scales. the better fit on the z‐score scale is probably due to the extra d.f. available for subject deviations, given that the mean curve is simpler and the models all use the default d.f. tables <UNK> to <UNK> explore this by varying the number of knots in the three models applied to dataset e (presumably content, and presumably on the z‐score scale). what they demonstrate, at least for brokenstick and face, is a simple truth—using more d.f. for subject deviations improves the fit. however, it is striking that unlike brokenstick and penalised spline, face performs very similarly on the height and z‐score scales. this is surprising, and it challenges the authors' recommendation to always work on the z‐score scale. given the massive amount of work involved in assembling tables <UNK> and <UNK> it would be interesting to explore them in more detail by predicting the mse in terms of study‐specific factors such as the numbers of children and observations, distribution of time gaps, age range, etc. this would, for example, evidence the authors' statement that brokenstick performs better with fewer observations per child. <UNK> growth faltering, time interval, and smoothing overall, the authors conclude that brokenstick and face are useful and work best on the z‐score scale. but, this leads to the bigger question: how should the results of the analyses be exploited? the aim of characterising growth trajectories is to relate growth faltering to later outcome. the authors suggest three examples of relevant growth indicators based on the trajectories: “mean growth over a particular time period, number of days in a particular growth state, or indicators relating to growth derivative.” they all involve specifying a time period, which can be short or long. for example, they particularly mention the mean derivative, ie, the increment, over the first year. this dependence on the time scale is fundamental to growth assessment, and it relates directly to the smoothness of the growth trajectories. for example, the brokenstick curve in figure <UNK> has five segments spread over <UNK> days, each segment corresponding on average to <UNK> days or <UNK> months. this is the timescale on which growth faltering will be detected: on a shorter timescale, faltering is smoothed out, while on a longer timescale, the noise obscures the growth signal. this means that the brokenstick model is tuned to growth assessment over this period of <UNK> months. conversely, the quadratic laird‐ware or sitar curves are smooth across the whole age range and hence apply on that timescale, which could be <UNK> years or longer. the example given of growth increment over the first year is instructive. face and brokenstick are tuned to shorter timescales than this, so they may not predict first year increment any better than quadratic laird‐ware or sitar. if the analysis were to be repeated using just the first year data, then quadratic laird‐ware or sitar would provide exactly the required individual growth summary—an intercept corresponding to their length, and a slope corresponding to their length increment. in addition, sitar is unique in providing an estimate of the individual's age at peak length velocity, which occurs in the first month or two after birth and which is a useful summary statistic of early growth intensity that the other models lack. <UNK> conclusion in summary, i am impressed by the colossal amount of work that has been put into the project. the recommendations to use brokenstick or face on the z‐score scale are reasonable and well evidenced, demonstrating that the two models quantify growth faltering on a timescale of a few months. against that i am slightly disappointed that the results are not more extensive, given the vast amount of data available. but the key issue, which the paper does not address, is whether such a timescale is optimal for predicting later adverse outcome. it is assumed that, since brokenstick and face explain the most variability, then the timescale on which they operate must be optimal for prediction. but this does not follow at all; short‐term haz variability may be less relevant than long‐term variability for predicting later health outcome. it is important that the models be compared, not only on their ability to predict early growth but also on their ability to predict later outcome. such a comparison will need to include quadratic laird‐ware and sitar, as they provide parsimonious and unambiguous summaries of early growth in individuals that the more complex brokenstick and face do not and cannot provide. <UNK> anderson, xiao, checkley, and hbgdki community the second of the two anderson papers aims to simplify the comparison of measures of weight or height at two ages in the same individual. the rate of change in size over time represents growth velocity, and the child's expected velocity depends on their two ages of measurement. to quantify the expected velocity requires a growth velocity reference, analogous to the fetal size references of ohuma and altman (see later). however, velocity references are complex to construct because each velocity measurement involves two ages not one, and hence two measurement errors, which interact with the time interval between measurements in a complex way. an alternative approach, which avoids the need for a velocity reference, is to switch from the measurement scale (ie, kg or cm) to the z‐score scale. the z‐score (or standard deviation score) is the measurement transformed to a normal equivalent deviate, so that when applied to the reference population, it has mean <UNK> and sd <UNK> irrespective of age or sex. anderson et al use the world health organization growth standard as <UNK> the properties of z‐scores make it much easier to compare two measurements in an <UNK> and lead to equation <UNK> of anderson et al that measures growth velocity conditional on the first of the two measurements, or conditional velocity for short. the equation involves the two z‐scores and the correlation between them, ie, the correlation of measurements obtained at the two measurement ages. in general, this correlation is not known, and the aim of the paper is to provide a meta‐analytic estimate of the correlation for a two‐way grid of measurement ages. in this way, it becomes possible to calculate conditional velocity for any pair of z‐scores simply by looking up the correlation for the two measurement ages. there is, however, a tension between individual ages and age groups. the age scale needs to be discretised to provide groups of measurements, which can then be used to calculate the correlations across age groups. but, these correlations then relate to the age group, not a specific age. anderson et al address this by analysing the data in weekly age groups (n = <UNK> ie, from birth to <UNK> years), which provides useful granularity close to birth but considerable redundancy at older ages. note that <UNK> <UNK> for the correlation matrix is a large number, and many of the cells will have few or no data. so, it would have been interesting to explore reducing the number of age groups by letting them vary in width, while preserving the detail of the correlation structure. an even neater approach would be to develop a way to calculate the correlations based on individual ages rather than age groups. to combine the correlation matrices across studies, the authors consider two alternative approaches, ie, univariate and multivariate. the univariate approach combines studies by applying a meta‐analysis to study correlations for each cell of the correlation matrix and then smooths the resulting matrix, while the multivariate approach smooths each study's correlation matrix as a surface and then combines the surfaces. in practice, the univariate approach turns out to be easier. the meta‐analysis works with fisher‐transformed correlations, and it estimates study‐specific random effects assuming that all the cells of each study's correlation matrix are larger or smaller than the mean by the same amount. in practice, this may be unrealistic because studies will have different measurement error structures at different ages, with some studies having noisier measurements (and hence lower correlations) in infancy due to say an adverse environment; but, the same may not apply at later ages where growth patterns are less susceptible to environmental pressures. to what extent taking this into account might affect the correlation matrix is unclear. the heat maps showing the age‐varying correlation structure are impressive. in general, they show that correlations for measurements close in age are high, but that the correlations fall as the time gap increases. also, the rate at which the correlation falls with increasing time gap is greater in infancy than later in childhood. what the heat maps do not show is the value of the correlation near the diagonal at different ages; this is of interest as its difference from unity reflects the measurement error at that age (or nugget). the smoothed heat maps in figures <UNK> and <UNK> show several circular patches of dark red along the diagonal, indicating peaks in the correlation, and it would be interesting to know if they reflect biological landmarks. one practical problem with the heat maps is that they are not transferable. researchers wanting to use them to calculate growth velocity do not have access to them, so that making the information available online will be important. <UNK> ohuma and altman <UNK> the two papers by dr ohuma and professor altman describe the statistical methodology behind the fetal and neonatal growth references produced by the <UNK> project, funded (like the hbgdki) by the gates foundation. similarly to anderson and colleagues, they focus primarily on growth in early life, but unlike anderson et al, who assess individual postnatal growth, they quantify the distribution of normal fetal and neonatal size and growth by gestation. their first paper reviews design considerations for such references, in terms of data collection, handling, and analysis, while the second describes the statistical analysis for two of the references presented as worked examples. i refer to the papers as <UNK> and <UNK> respectively. the design review in <UNK> is comprehensive and highlights deficiencies in current practice and includes recommendations for improvement. to quote the abstract, “important design features such as inclusion and exclusion criteria, ultrasound quality control measures, sample size determination, anthropometric evaluation, gestational age (ga) estimation, assessment of outliers, and chart presentation are seldom well addressed, considered or reported.” those familiar with altman's work will recognise the tone, reflecting his longstanding concern with poor reporting practice. below, i respond to some of the points raised, grouped using section headings taken from their review. the key feature of the <UNK> project is that it provides prescriptive rather than descriptive growth references, based on reference samples of fetuses and infants from eight countries selected to be “healthy.” this matches the design of the world health organization growth <UNK> which was based on infants and young children from six countries born at term and selected for health. however, the concept of “health” is harder to apply to infants born preterm than to those born at term, since being born preterm is clearly not healthy. <UNK> draws a distinction between healthy and unhealthy preterm infants by applying carefully chosen selection criteria. <UNK> cross‐sectional, longitudinal, or mixed study designs study design for growth references relates to the nature of the data, cross‐sectional or longitudinal, ie, whether individuals are measured once or repeatedly. the former leads to charts of size, ie conventional growth centile charts, while the latter assesses growth velocity. ohuma and altman point out that, in practice, longitudinal data are often used to construct size charts, by ignoring the repeated measures in the data. this is effective though inefficient, as the centiles are, in general, unbiased but less precise; repeat measures are unbiased so long as they are independent of the way they are <UNK> linked to this, the authors also draw a clear distinction between size charts and growth charts, the phrase “size and growth” appearing several times in the paper. however, they do not make clear that growth charts monitor change in size over time in the form of growth velocity charts, which are quite different in appearance from size charts. they discuss growth velocity charts hardly at all. <UNK> multiple centres an important design issue that arises for a multicentre study such as <UNK> is whether or not the data from particular centres can validly be included. <UNK> used data from multiple countries to obtain an international growth standard, though the countries inevitably differed in detail from each other. the advantage of a prescriptive international standard is that growth statistics based on the standard can be compared directly across countries, whereas with locally representative descriptive growth references such comparisons cannot be made. conversely, local descriptive references can—so long as they are up‐to‐date—provide unbiased assessments of centile position in individual children, because the centiles are representative of the target population, and an international prescriptive reference cannot do this. thus, there are pros and cons with both approaches. <UNK> quality control the paper's focus on fetal and neonatal charts makes the assessment of gestational age particularly important. ohuma and altman describe how best to estimate gestational age, using the last menstrual period combined with the ultrasound dating scan. they emphasise the need for quality control, checking for variability both between and within ultrasonographers, in the same way as for anthropometry in postnatal growth studies. to control for variability, the <UNK> study scans were all carried out in triplicate, which could then be averaged or modelled in the fitting process. incidentally, another way to summarise the triplicate measurements would have been with the median rather than the mean, as it is more robust if the error distribution has heavier tails than <UNK> the median also corresponds directly to one of the triplicate measurements, and it needs no calculation. later, <UNK> discusses the issue of single versus repeated measurements in terms of variability. using the mean or median of replicate measurements reduces measurement error, but it can also introduce bias. the issue is how the centiles are used in clinical practice—if single rather than repeated measurements are routinely used, then the data will be noisier than the centiles reflect. linked to quality control is the question of data management—the identification and handling of data outliers. <UNK> mentions outliers in passing, but without any discussion about data cleaning. this is the important first stage in the statistical analysis process, and it needs to be formalised in the protocol. <UNK> sample size the topic of sample size for growth studies is surprisingly complicated, for both size and growth charts, as the authors note. i discussed the topic at length in <UNK> and it appears to have hardly advanced since <UNK> if the sample size calculation is based on the precision of the extreme chart centiles, as is logical, it is not obvious how precise they need to be nor how the precision should depend on gestational age or the degree of smoothing. a particular difficulty with neonatal size references is their dependence on gestational age, such that the vast majority of infants are born at term <UNK> to <UNK> weeks), while the numbers born preterm become progressively smaller with increasing prematurity. sample size considerations for growth velocity charts are further complicated by the need to incorporate the correlation between successive measurements. the <UNK> birthweight reference was based on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> of them were born at term <UNK> table <UNK> preterm births were poorly represented, particularly at the earliest gestations, and there were just <UNK> and <UNK> infants, respectively, at <UNK> and <UNK> weeks gestation <UNK> weeks being the study's start gestation). these numbers are clearly very small to model centiles adequately, particularly when split by sex. the lack of data for extremely preterm neonates born before <UNK> weeks gestation is another weakness, since birthweight assessment in the extremely preterm is particularly important for management. this fact was belatedly acknowledged by the later publication of <UNK> centiles for very preterm <UNK> based on <UNK> infants from <UNK> to <UNK> weeks gestation, although they included the health warning that “centiles below <UNK> weeks should be interpreted with caution given the small sample <UNK> for comparison, the england and wales birthweight centiles from <UNK> to <UNK> weeks gestation recently published by norris et <UNK> in were based on <UNK> million births, of which <UNK> were born before <UNK> weeks. with numbers like these, one has confidence in the accuracy and precision of the extreme centiles at the earliest gestations, which, to be honest, one does not with the <UNK> centiles. <UNK> routinely collected versus research data the key difference between the norris paper and <UNK> is the use of routinely collected rather than research data. <UNK> discusses the pros and cons of using routine data and concludes that, with certain caveats, they can be a valuable resource. they also note that routinely collected birthweight data are generally accurate, which raises the question as to why <UNK> did not make use of them to increase their sample size. <UNK> statistical methodology ohuma and altman's <UNK> main requirements for the statistical construction of growth centiles are that they should change smoothly with gestation, provide a good fit to the data, rely on the simplest statistical model necessary, and allow calculation of z‐scores. the chosen model should test for goodness of fit, including the normality assumption, and estimate both mean and standard deviation (sd) as functions of gestation. in addition, they expect to see reported a raw data summary and the fitted centiles by gestation, a graphical comparison of fitted centiles superimposed on the raw data, and regression equations for the mean and sd. <UNK> ohuma and altman <UNK> the second paper by ohuma and altman provides two worked examples of centile construction, chosen to illustrate the different methodologies for cross‐sectional and longitudinal data. the first covers birthweight and the second fetal head circumference. <UNK> birthweight centiles when constructing birthweight centiles, the first stage of the analysis is to choose the regression model. the aim is to estimate the gestation‐varying distribution of birthweight in terms of smooth gestation‐specific curves for the distribution moments: the mean, sd, and possibly skewness and kurtosis. then, if the moment curves are smooth, the centiles curves based on them will be smooth too. ohuma and altman <UNK> consider fractional polynomials, first described by royston and <UNK> the lms method of cole and <UNK> and two extensions of lms, the <UNK> and <UNK> methods of rigby and stasinopoulos. all these models are members of the gamlss family (generalised additive models for location, scale, and <UNK> which can be fitted using gamlss <UNK> gamlss specifies each model in terms of its frequency distribution and the smoothing technique used. commonly used distributions (there are over <UNK> to choose from!) include the normal (no), box‐cox cole‐green (bccg, as used by the lms method), and the lms extensions box‐cox power exponential (bcpe) and box‐cox t (bct) as used by lmsp and lmst. the models differ in terms both of how many distribution moments they have (respectively <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> above) and of the simpler distribution they are based on (respectively normal, normal, power exponential, and t). so, lms, lmsp, and lmst all model skewness, and in addition, lmsp and lmst model kurtosis. <UNK> also use three other distributions, power exponential (pe), skew power exponential type <UNK> <UNK> and skew t type <UNK> <UNK> where pe models kurtosis while <UNK> and <UNK> model skewness and kurtosis. like the distribution family, the specification of the smoothing technique in gamlss is enormously flexible. common choices are a polynomial (eg linear or quadratic), or a fractional polynomial, or one of the many forms of spline curve. the basic <UNK> fractional polynomial model is actually a fractional polynomial with a normal distribution, while the lms method as originally described was a cubic smoothing spline with a bccg distribution. similarly, lmsp and lmst are typically fitted using cubic splines. figure <UNK> of <UNK> illustrates the gamlss taxonomy, though it mixes up fractional polynomials—a smoothing technique—with lms models that represent distinct distributions. after this preamble, we now look at the birthweight centiles analysis in table <UNK> of <UNK> there are <UNK> models for each sex, which can be most simply compared via the aic and bic. both criteria fall with rising model complexity, and the values for lms, lmst, and lmsp are all smaller than for the corresponding fractional polynomial models in both sexes (the bic of <UNK> for <UNK> in girls should presumably be <UNK> this indicates that cubic splines are better than fractional polynomials for fitting the moment curves. the best fractional polynomial fits are with the <UNK> distribution, and ohuma and altman select this as their “best buy”, on the basis of centile appearance and linearity of the worm plots and q‐q plots (note that worm and q‐q plots are identical apart from a <UNK> rotation). this is surprising, given that the fractional polynomials fit worse by aic and bic, and it is a pity that the authors provide no evidence to support the statement that the fit is better in terms of centiles and residuals. figure <UNK> compares three predicted centiles <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from four models ( for boys?)—fractional polynomials with no, bccg, and <UNK> and cubic splines with bccg. it is striking that the centiles for the four models agree closely for <UNK> to <UNK> weeks gestation, and the material differences between them are restricted to <UNK> and <UNK> weeks, where the data are sparse. the fact that elsewhere the model centiles match well indicates that the differences between the models are nothing to do with the distribution, and all to do with the curve shape—ie, the smoothing technique—at the extremes. but, there is a further wrinkle. ohuma and altman state repeatedly that the chosen model should be as simple as possible, and figure <UNK> shows there is little to choose between four of them. six of the <UNK> models in table <UNK> adjust for kurtosis, yet there is no sign in figure <UNK> that the kurtosis adjustment makes any difference—the no (mean and sd) and <UNK> (mean, sd, skewness, and kurtosis) centiles are almost identical. kurtosis reflects heavy or light tails to the distribution, as shown by the s‐shape in the worm plots of figures <UNK> and <UNK> for the normal distribution (figure <UNK> the worm is near linear between <UNK> and <UNK> whereas for the <UNK> distribution (figure <UNK> the linearity extends from <UNK> to <UNK> clearly far better. so, if kurtosis is so much better with <UNK> why does not it show in figure <UNK> the reason is that the centiles there are not extreme enough to show it; <UNK> corresponds to the <UNK> and <UNK> centiles, so centiles that are less extreme than these are unaffected by kurtosis. the outer centiles on the <UNK> charts are the <UNK> and <UNK> which are far less extreme than the <UNK> and <UNK> for this reason, there is no point in modelling kurtosis—a simpler model with mean, sd, and skewness would perform just as well. this example highlights the care needed to model with gamlss. the plethora of available models and smoothing techniques can seduce the analyst into trying them all and selecting the best. but, as we have seen, the six kurtosis models could have been ruled out at an early stage, since the kurtosis adjustment was never going to affect the centiles. another general modelling principle would be to exploit the data structure by “borrowing strength”. the two sexes are modelled separately here, yet it is known that their distributions are very similar, with girls slightly lighter than boys on average at all gestations. thus, fitting a model with the sexes combined and including a sex effect would simplify the model to advantage, particularly at the early gestations with few data. this was the approach used to model birthweight in very preterm uk <UNK> fitting the lms method with a log link for μ, where the mean sex difference in birthweight was <UNK> <UNK> fetal head circumference centiles fetal head circumference in <UNK> was measured longitudinally during <UNK> with a mode of <UNK> measurements per subject (range <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> table <UNK> thus, the data structure of measurements at level <UNK> and subjects at level <UNK> implies a hierarchical (multilevel) model. in addition, each measurement was made in triplicate (actually, three separate images were each read three <UNK> which can be viewed as an extra level <UNK> ohuma and altman fit four alternative hierarchical models reflecting this structure, as summarised in <UNK> table <UNK> they assume a normal distribution for all and model the mean and sd with fractional polynomials. based on the deviance, there is evidence of heterogeneity between subjects in the intercept and slope, but the most interesting columns in the table are the percentages of observations outside the <UNK> and <UNK> centiles. nominally these should be <UNK> and the values for the simple random intercept model are close to <UNK> but with increasing model complexity, this tail area increases, reaching <UNK> with the three‐level model. somewhat surprisingly, this latter model is the one chosen as optimal. it is a surprising choice because the model is severely biased in the tails, with <UNK> of observations below the <UNK> centile and <UNK> above the <UNK> centile. neonatalogists expect to see <UNK> not <UNK> of infants in the tails and are likely to be both surprised and confused to know there are <UNK> more than expected. what if anything could have been done to avoid this bias? the seminal paper by <UNK> showed how to model longitudinal fetal data to produce unbiased centiles, and his method could be applied here. it involved transforming both the measurement scale and the gestational age scale so as to make the mean curve linear, which could then be modelled with random intercepts and optionally random slopes. in this case, the variance is a function of the <UNK> and <UNK> variances. because the mean curve is linear the subject random effects do not introduce bias in the centiles. <UNK> conclusion the statistical analysis of the <UNK> reflects a major undertaking by the authors. however, i feel that the outcome could have been better with a more nuanced approach to the analysis and with a greater awareness of how the resulting charts are used in clinical practice.

abstract background: james tanner emphasised the “tempo” of growth, i.e. the adolescent spurt as summarised by its timing (age at peak velocity or apv) and intensity (peak velocity, pv). aim: the paper applies the sitar growth curve model to pubertal growth data with the aim of clarifying the growth pattern across multiple measurements and the spectrum of apv and pv. subjects and methods: data for <UNK> years on ten anthropometric measurements in <UNK> children from the harpenden growth study, and on height in <UNK> children from the alspac study, were analysed using sitar (superimposition by translation and rotation). sitar models pubertal growth as a mean curve with apv and pv fitted as subject-specific random effects, and a random measurement intercept. results: mean apv for

apv and pv groups and fitting separate sitar models to each group confirmed sitar’s good fit while highlighting the spectrum of growth patterns. conclusion: sitar works well to summarise pubertal growth. the disappointment is that tanner did not live to see it in action. introduction the human adolescent growth spurt is a remarkable phenomenon seen in few other primate species. occurring towards the end of the growth period, after height velocity has been falling steadily since early infancy, the velocity suddenly increases to a peak of around <UNK> cm/year in boys and <UNK> cm/year in girls, a growth rate not seen since late infancy. then, just as suddenly, the rate falls to zero and growth ceases (tanner <UNK> the pubertal growth spurt is unusual not only for its intensity but also for its timing. peak height velocity in individuals can occur as early as <UNK> years of age in girls or as late as <UNK> years in boys. on average boys peak two years later than girls, and this, coupled with their greater peak velocity (pv), explains the sex difference in adult height – the two sexes are very similar in height at <UNK> years (tanner <UNK> the combination of the sharp change in velocity and the peak’s variable timing leads to an apparently chaotic pattern of height growth across individuals during puberty. james ‘jim’ m tanner <UNK> was an eminent british auxologist (a term that he invented), whose contribution to the study of human growth throughout the second half of the <UNK> century was remarkably wide-ranging. he was perhaps most famous for his work on growth at adolescence, which was the title of his first of many books on growth (tanner <UNK> in it he explored pubertal growth in depth, comparing the changes in the different organ systems in the two sexes, and discussing how to measure the progress of puberty in individuals. he emphasised the concept of the tempo of growth, a measure of passing time in individuals relating to their pubertal status as quantified by their developmental age. developmental age is a measure of maturation and can be based on the appearance of the individual child’s bones, teeth or secondary sexual characteristics, including menarche in girls. they are all markers that over time progress through a series of consistent and well-documented developmental stages. the tanner stages of pubic hair, breast development and genitalia have proved popular for assessing developmental age, as they can be assessed on a single occasion and require no specialised equipment (unlike the radiographic images required for bones or teeth) (marshall and tanner <UNK> <UNK> alternatively, developmental age can be based on the timing of growth landmarks such as peak height velocity. this however cannot be measured on a single occasion; it requires longitudinal data, with individuals measured repeatedly over time. the data then need to be analysed to generate the individual velocity curves and extract the ages at pv. thus, as tanner <UNK> pointed out, there are two requirements to study growth: a cohort study of individuals followed over time and a trained anthropometrist to make the measurements. in <UNK> tanner’s developing interest in growth led him to set up the harpenden growth study, recruiting as his experimental officer reginald ‘reg’ h whitehouse, straight out of the royal army medical corps (tanner <UNK> whitehouse quickly established himself as an anthropometrist of the highest calibre, making hundreds of thousands of growth measurements (by tanner’s own estimate), using equipment he himself designed, until his retirement in <UNK> whitehouse also proved himself indispensable in analysing the growth data, meticulously plotting the points and drawing smooth curves through them. this work led to the seminal two-part <UNK> tanner, whitehouse and takaishi paper on height and weight growth reference charts, which has set the example for many subsequent studies on growth references (tanner et al. <UNK> later tanner and whitehouse (with statisticians marubini and resele) analysed the adolescent growth spurt in <UNK> boys and <UNK> girls from the harpenden growth study, fitting logistic curves to height, sitting height, leg length, shoulder width and hip width for each individual (tanner et al. <UNK> the curves fitted well overall, and the ages at pv were highly correlated across measurements, but the corresponding velocities less so. analytical methods for growth data have advanced since these papers were written. however the underlying aim remains the same: to summarise mean growth as a smooth curve and to express individual growth patterns relative to the mean. a recently described growth curve model, superimposition by translation and rotation (sitar) (cole et al. <UNK> is well suited to growth in puberty. based on a group of individuals it estimates a mean growth curve and defines the individual curves relative to it in terms of their size, timing and intensity of growth. in particular, timing corresponds directly with the individual’s age at pv (apv), while intensity equates to pv, which means that applying sitar is a simple way to categorise individuals in terms of their “tempo of growth”. tanner’s simple but elegant vision of pubertal growth was that individual growth patterns could be summarised largely by the timing and intensity of pv. conveniently, the sitar model makes this same assumption, and at the same time it assumes – as tanner did – that conditional on timing and intensity, the underlying velocity curve is essentially constant in shape. the aim of this paper is to celebrate the legacy of tanner – and whitehouse – by using sitar to explore the adolescent growth spurt from two distinct perspectives: how it varies across ten distinct linear measurements from the harpenden growth study, and how in detail the shape of the height velocity curve depends on timing and intensity, using data from the much larger avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac). the first perspective builds on tanner’s paradigm whereas the second tests it, by seeing just how invariant the height velocity curve is to differences in timing and intensity. subjects and methods harpenden growth study the harpenden growth study consisted of <UNK> white british children, <UNK> girls and <UNK> boys, born between <UNK>

workers or the lower middle class (tanner <UNK> they were measured <UNK> outside puberty and <UNK> during puberty, up to <UNK> years of age, on a total of <UNK> distinct measurement occasions, <UNK>

by median size: height*, sitting height*, leg length* (by difference), thigh circumference, shoulder width*, foot length, hip width*, arm circumference, knee width and elbow width (the asterisked measurements were also analysed by tanner et al. <UNK> note that the technical names for shoulder, hip, knee and elbow width used by tanner were respectively bi-acromial, bi-iliac, bi-epifemur and bi-epihumerus width. all measurements were recorded to the last complete <UNK> cm. to focus on puberty the age range here is restricted to <UNK> to <UNK> years, during which period <UNK> children <UNK> girls and <UNK> boys) were measured on <UNK> distinct occasions. avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac) the avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac) consisted of over <UNK> children from bristol uk recruited antenatally in <UNK> and followed up to age <UNK> (boyd et al. <UNK> height was measured, to the nearest <UNK> cm, annually up to age <UNK> then at ages <UNK> and <UNK> by trained researchers. the present analysis involves <UNK> girls and <UNK> boys with <UNK> and <UNK> measurements aged from <UNK> to <UNK> years. data cleaning the two datasets had already been cleaned. for further cleaning sitar models (see below) were fitted, and outliers were identified with standardised residuals exceeding <UNK> in absolute value (only <UNK> of data are this extreme based on a normal distribution). there were very few outliers in the harpenden study, and they were inspected individually and either corrected (based on the context) or excluded. for the numerically larger alspac models the outliers were excluded. individuals with at least one measurement were included. statistical methods sitar is a mixed effects growth curve model featuring a cubic spline mean curve and three subject-specific random effects that adjust the mean curve to best match the subjects’ own curves (cole et al. <UNK> cole et al. <UNK> the random effects are called size, timing and intensity, and each represents a simple transformation of the mean curve. size indicates an up/down shift of the mean curve (in measurement units), reflecting how tall/short the individual is relative to the mean; timing reflects the individual apv (in age units e.g. years), seen as a right/left shift in the curve, positive for a later peak than average and negative for earlier; and intensity reflects the rate of passage through puberty as measured by pv (in fractional units), positive for faster than average and negative for slower. the degree of intensity shows itself by shrinking/stretching the age scale, which can be visualised as follows: imagine the image of a growth curve projected onto a half-open door. the effect of further opening the door is to make the curve appear narrower and steeper, corresponding to higher intensity, while closing the door makes the curve wider, shallower and lower intensity. algebraically the sitar model is given by yij=αi+h[(tij−βi)eγi]+εij <UNK> where <UNK> subjects, <UNK> measurements, y and t are length (or other outcome) and age respectively, h[.] is a cubic spline function, α,β,γ are the normally distributed random effects size, timing and intensity, and ε is the residual assumed distributed as <UNK> the smoothness of the natural cubic spline mean curve is controlled by the number of degrees of freedom (d.f.), each corresponding to a spline fixed effect, with the number chosen to minimise the bayesian information criterion (bic). in addition, there are fixed effects for size, timing and intensity, which ensure the corresponding random effects have mean zero. in nearly all the models here age was fitted after natural log transformation, to improve the fit, which effectively measures age differences in percentage units rather than years (cole and altman <UNK> all the results were back-transformed to age for presentation purposes. the output from each sitar model consists of the mean curve as defined by the fixed effect coefficients, plus fixed effects for α,β,γ, subject random effects for α,β,γ summarised by their standard deviations and correlations, the residual standard deviation ε and the percentage of variance explained by the model, calculated as <UNK> where <UNK> is the residual variance of the model fitted without random effects, i.e. with just the cubic spline mean curve. for models fitted with log age, the timing random effect sd was multiplied by median age to give units of age. the intensity random effect sd is age-invariant and essentially unaffected by age transformation. the mean velocity curve was derived (in units of cm per year) as the first derivative of the mean curve plotted against age. in addition, four outputs were estimated from each mean velocity curve: the mean ages of pv and takeoff velocity (the minimum velocity prior to the peak), and the corresponding mean velocities. note the mean curves are all plotted as length versus age, whether the sitar model used age or log age. standard errors for the outputs were obtained using the bootstrap. for presentation purposes the curves were also compared in terms of percent velocity (i.e. in units of % per year), to adjust for the size differences between the measures. this was achieved by plotting length versus age with length on a <UNK> × natural log scale, and the first derivative of the curve is velocity measured in percent units (cole and altman <UNK> the aim of the alspac analysis was to test the sitar assumption that the underlying mean height curve is essentially the same shape for all individuals after adjusting for the timing and intensity of their growth spurt. to this end separate (global) sitar models were first fitted for boys and girls, with log transformed age and <UNK> d.f. for the spline curves. then individuals were split by sex into nine equal size groups based on the value of their timing random effects, i.e. apv, and separate “local” sitar models were fitted to each group. as a second stage each apv group was split into five equal size groups based on individuals’ intensity random effects (pv) from the local apv model, giving <UNK> groups by sex, where in each group individuals were closely matched by timing and intensity. again, separate local sitar models were fitted to each group. the group mean curves (either nine groups by apv or <UNK> groups by apv and pv) were then compared with the corresponding mean curves predicted from the global models, based on the mean timing and intensity random effects for each group. the numbers of nine apv and five pv groups were chosen to provide similar numbers per group of around <UNK> give more emphasis to timing than intensity, provide a median group by using odd numbers, and compromise between group number and group size. the models grouped by timing were fitted with <UNK> d.f. and the timing random effect was omitted as it was already adjusted for. the models grouped by timing and intensity also had <UNK> d.f., with both the timing and intensity random effects omitted as they were adjusted for. all the analyses were carried out in r version <UNK> (r

subjects, female <UNK> born in <UNK> with ten measurements on <UNK> occasions from age <UNK> to <UNK> years. the measurements vary in size from height (median <UNK> cm) to elbow width (median <UNK> cm), but all of them demonstrate a growth spurt at around <UNK> years. the regularity of the individual curves is striking, testimony to whitehouse’s skill. note that the curves for arm circumference and thigh circumference are noisier than the length curves, reflecting their soft mass component. note also that leg length increases faster than sitting height prior to puberty but has a smaller pubertal growth spurt. figure <UNK> data for one girl (id <UNK> from the harpenden growth study between <UNK> and <UNK> years. mean growth curves separate sitar models were fitted to the ten

all except the four smallest female measurements, and the variance explained by the models ranged from <UNK> to <UNK> again less for the smaller measurements and the circumferences. the residual standard deviations (sd) were largest for the large measurements, e.g. <UNK> cm for height, but divided by the median to give residual percent coefficients of variation (cv) they were the smallest <UNK> for height). table <UNK> summarises the random effect structure of the models. the sds reflect the population variability in size, timing and intensity. the size sd is given in both absolute (cm) and proportional (%) units, using size at age <UNK> as denominator. on the percent sd scale the two sexes are very similar, with that for leg length <UNK> unexpectedly larger than for sitting height <UNK> while that for height <UNK> is intermediate. the timing sd (variability in apv) is close to one year for all measurements. the intensity sd is generally around <UNK> to <UNK> (corresponding to <UNK> to <UNK> variation in pv), but somewhat larger for the smaller measurements and appreciably larger for the circumferences. the correlations in table <UNK> are nearly all positive, with median values of around <UNK> for size-timing and timing-intensity, and <UNK> for intensity-size, indicating that larger individuals tend to have a later and more intense pubertal spurt. however the correlations are misleading as most are based on log age not age, which affects the correlations. for example, if boys height is refitted using age, the timing-intensity correlation of <UNK> changes to <UNK> indicating that timing and intensity are inversely correlated. thus the true correlation between timing (as based on age) and intensity is negative not positive, and this applies quite generally in table <UNK> the model mean curves in figure <UNK> are replotted in figure <UNK> on a log <UNK> scale, i.e. constant rate of doubling, which scales the curves to be similar in shape, and in particular allows them to be compared across measurements by sex. for example, the height and shoulder width curves are seen to be very similar. figure <UNK> mean curves for the harpenden growth study sitar length models by sex, with length on a log <UNK> scale to highlight the similarities in curve shape. mean velocity curves however, the best way to compare the growth spurts is via the corresponding velocity curves, as seen in figure <UNK> by sex. each measurement facet has its own scale, which enlarges the smaller measurement spurts. the corresponding apvs are highlighted as vertical lines, and the girls’ peaks are consistently about two years earlier than the boys’ (mean apvs across measurements <UNK> se <UNK> and <UNK> se <UNK> years for girls and boys). pv is generally slightly greater for boys than girls, with the striking exceptions of thigh circumference and to a lesser extent hip width. figure <UNK> mean velocity curves (cm/yr) for the harpenden growth study sitar length models by sex (girls left, boys right), with the ages at peak velocity indicated by vertical lines. figure <UNK> is useful for comparing velocity curves in the two sexes, but less so for comparing across measurements, as the scales differ. the slopes of the curves in figure <UNK> are directly comparable across measurements, being on a log scale, and as explained in the methods, the slopes of these curves correspond to growth velocity measured in percent units. the corresponding percent velocity curves are shown in figure <UNK> which make clear that peak percent velocity is not related to size; it is largest for boys arm circumference and girls thigh circumference, with both exceeding <UNK> per year, while the smallest velocity is for girls knee width <UNK> per year), a factor of just over two difference compared to the thirty-fold difference for linear velocity (boys height <UNK> cm/year versus girls elbow width <UNK> cm/year, table <UNK> for the other measurements pv is consistently around <UNK> per year and slightly greater for boys than girls. figure <UNK> mean percent velocity curves for the harpenden growth study sitar length models by sex (girls left, boys right), with the ages at peak velocity indicated by vertical lines. as well as pv, a second landmark on the velocity curve is takeoff, the point where velocity is at a minimum immediately prior to the peak. table <UNK> summarises the means for pv and takeoff velocity and their corresponding ages, both on the linear (cm per year) and proportional (% per year) scales as seen in figures <UNK> and <UNK> the ages at takeoff/peak are very similar whether calculated on the cm or % scale, so those on the % scale are omitted. bootstrap standard errors for apv range from <UNK> years for height and leg length up to <UNK> years for the smaller measurements and the circumferences. for pv the standard errors are <UNK> cm per year for height and sitting height, <UNK> for leg length, and in between for the other measurements. mean age at takeoff is two years earlier than mean age at peak, and earlier still for the circumferences. the takeoff velocities are about half the peak velocities on average, varying from a third or less for the circumferences to near equality for foot length in girls. the correlation across measurements between linear velocity at takeoff and at peak is high at <UNK> but for percent velocity the corresponding correlation is small and negative at <UNK> so the two are effectively unrelated when the scale differences are accounted for, showing that each measurement has its own distinct profile from takeoff to peak. random effects an obvious question is whether individuals tend to be consistently large/small, early/late or fast/slow across all their measurements, and this can be tested for by looking at the correlations between the random effects. across the ten measurements there are <UNK> correlations for each of size, timing and intensity in the two sexes, the median correlations being <UNK> (size), <UNK> (timing) and <UNK> (intensity) for boys and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> for girls. so within individuals, timing is conserved across measurements just as strongly as size is, while intensity is less so. the order of measurements in each correlation matrix can be rearranged so the largest correlations migrate towards the diagonal – a process known as seriation – and this ranks the measurements in terms of their strength of association with their neighbours (see supplementary table <UNK> it effectively ranks them by their median correlation with the other measurements. across the three random effects in the two sexes, height and leg length are consistently the most closely associated, followed by foot length and sitting height, while thigh and arm circumference are consistently the least associated, with the other four measurements in between. for example, the boys’ size random effects for height and leg length correlate at <UNK> whereas those for height and arm circumference correlate only at <UNK> similar contrasts in correlation apply for boys’ timing and intensity random effects, and also for girls. so in terms of individual growth patterns, foot length is surprisingly similar to height and its two components, while the circumferences are very different. alspac figure <UNK> shows the height data for <UNK> girls and <UNK> boys in alspac, where the nine data sweeps are clearly seen. the final sweep provides data from <UNK> to <UNK> years where the coverage is relatively sparse. figure <UNK> illustrates the sitar mean height curves and height velocity curves fitted to the data. on average girls are taller than boys between <UNK> and <UNK> years, while mean height velocity at age <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> cm per year in girls and boys, respectively. table <UNK> summarises the two sitar models, showing residual sds twice those in harpenden and correspondingly less variance explained. mean apv is earlier than in harpenden by <UNK> and <UNK> years (girls/boys), while pv is <UNK> cm per year greater and predicted height at age <UNK> is <UNK> cm greater. the bootstrap standard errors for mean apv and pv are around <UNK> years and <UNK> cm per year, respectively. figure <UNK> height data for <UNK> boys and <UNK> girls in alspac, collected over nine data sweeps between <UNK> and <UNK> years. figure <UNK> sitar mean height and height velocity curves for alspac by sex, with the ages at peak velocity indicated by vertical lines (girls left, boys right). tables <UNK> and <UNK> explore how age at peak height velocity affects the mean growth pattern. for this, individuals were split into nine equal size groups according to their timing random effect, and sitar models were fitted to each group by sex. thus the groups represent the spectrum from early to late puberty. table <UNK> shows that the groups all have the same number of <UNK> individuals, but the early and late groups have consistently more data points and are also consistently more variable (with less variance explained, larger residual sds, and larger size and intensity random effect sds) than the central groups. table <UNK> confirms that the groups are clearly ranked by mean apv, with <UNK> to <UNK> years between the earliest and latest groups. age at takeoff shows a weaker trend, particularly in boys, but velocity at takeoff is strongly and inversely related to apv in both sexes. pv also falls with increasing apv. those maturing late are consistently taller at age <UNK> by <UNK> cm in girls and <UNK> cm in boys compared to the earliest maturers. figures <UNK> (girls) and <UNK> (boys) visualise the mean height and height velocity curves for the groups in tables <UNK> and <UNK> they are derived in two distinct ways – a) as predicted by the global sitar models based on the group mean random effects for size, timing and intensity, and b) as fitted by the local group-specific sitar models. figure <UNK> sitar mean height and height velocity curves for alspac girls, split into nine groups by age at peak height velocity. the left panels are predictions from the global model, while on the right are the group-specific mean curves. the global and local height curves in figures <UNK> and <UNK> are very similar in shape, indicating that sitar has done a good job of predicting mean height by age across the spectrum of apv. however the height velocity curves are less so; the global curves are very consistent in shape and show a clear trend downwards with increasing apv (this trend arises from the use of a log age transformation, and had age been used instead predicted pv would be essentially the same across groups). the local curves, in contrast, vary considerably in terms of velocity and curve shape near the peak, but also in the shape of the curve prior to takeoff. figure <UNK> sitar mean height and height velocity curves for alspac boys, split into nine groups by age at peak height velocity. the left panels are predictions from the global model, while on the right are the group-specific mean curves. the global velocity curves show velocity falling slowly until takeoff, whereas with the local curves velocity prior to takeoff falls dramatically in girls and rises then falls in boys. this subsidiary peak in boys around age <UNK> years can also be seen in the height curves, where there is an upward “bulge” for the later groups. the reason why these patterns are not reflected in the global curves is because they feature in only some of the groups, and averaged across groups they disappear. it is possible that the differences in velocity, particularly prior to takeoff, arise from sampling error and are not biologically meaningful. to test this the nine apv groups are each split into five further groups by individual intensity random effects i.e. pv, so splitting them into independent groups of faster and slower growers with the same apv. figures <UNK> (girls) and <UNK> (boys) show the local velocity curves for these <UNK> × <UNK> = <UNK> groups by sex, where to aid navigation, each facet shows the global mean velocity curve in grey. the figures confirm two things; that mean pv is greater in those whose intensity random effect is greater, and that velocity prior to takeoff does indeed vary systematically in shape according to apv. this is particularly marked for boys, where the facets for the first two apv groups show no sign of a pre-takeoff peak, whereas the later facets show an increasingly obvious peak at around age <UNK> years, largely independent of apv. for girls there is just the hint of a pre-takeoff peak in the latest maturing facet. each of the <UNK> models in these figures is based on <UNK> individuals, providing strong independent evidence for the existence of a “midgrowth” spurt at age <UNK> in later-maturing boys. figure <UNK> sitar mean height velocity curves for alspac girls, split into nine groups by age at peak height velocity (apv) and in turn five groups by peak height velocity (pv). discussion study findings the study has confirmed the complexity of linear growth in puberty, driven as it is by individual variation in – tanner’s term - the “tempo of growth”. this shows itself as variability in the intensity and timing of growth, i.e. pv and the age when pv occurs. the results show that the sitar growth curve model works well with growth in puberty, because it explicitly estimates these two parameters in individuals, along with a third parameter representing their mean size. simpkin et al. compared several alternative growth curve models for height in puberty, and they also concluded that sitar was useful in providing unbiased estimates of age at peak height velocity (simpkin et al. <UNK> but that said, the more detailed alspac analysis has brought to light the existence of a midgrowth spurt at around <UNK> years in the later-maturing boys. by its nature it is hard to see unless the data are sufficiently numerous to disaggregate. harpenden growth study the harpenden growth study is an important resource, not only for the biological insights arising from the data, but also for the way they demonstrate reg whitehouse’s auxological skill. the lexis diagram (figure <UNK> shows how tanner and whitehouse set about obtaining the study children they needed, with many recruited at the outset in <UNK> and followed up for <UNK> or more years, while other older early recruits dropped out soon afterwards. tanner and whitehouse continued to recruit children steadily over the next twenty years, typically at ages between <UNK> and <UNK> years, and tanner went on to use the study data in several seminal papers (tanner et al. <UNK> marshall and tanner <UNK> <UNK> tanner et al. <UNK> mean growth curves the good fit of sitar is demonstrated by the proportion of variance it explains. taking as a baseline the data treated cross-sectionally, i.e. ignoring the repeated measures component, and then adding the three sitar random effects, explains over <UNK> and up to <UNK> of the variance (table <UNK> leaving a small component corresponding to the residual sd. in harpenden the residual sd ranges from <UNK> cm for height down to <UNK> cm for knee and elbow width, while proportionally height is the least noisy of the measurements, its residual cv being only <UNK> versus <UNK> for knee and elbow. this reflects the fact that variability consists of two components: biological variation which scales with the measurement (i.e. the sd is proportional to size), and measurement error which is scale-invariant (in cm units) and hence relatively larger for small measurements. for height in alspac the residual sd was <UNK> cm, twice that in harpenden, reflecting the trade-off in measurement quality between a small study with a single (excellent) auxologist and the necessarily larger-scale and hence noisier measuring regime in a cohort the size of alspac. an obvious strength of the harpenden study is the opportunity it provides to compare the growth patterns of ten distinct linear measurements, ranging in size from height (median <UNK> cm) to elbow width <UNK> cm), a thirty-fold range (see tables <UNK> and figure <UNK> tanner also analysed five of the measurements in <UNK> boys and <UNK> girls (tanner et al. <UNK> tabulating mean (sd) age at takeoff, apv, pv and final size by sex. despite the smaller sample size his results were very similar to those in table <UNK> final size agreed to within <UNK> cm except for boys’ height <UNK> cm), and similarly for apv to within <UNK> years. however, his correlations between the apvs of the five variables were implausibly larger – median <UNK> and maximum <UNK> - than the equivalent correlations for the timing random effects in supplementary table <UNK> mean velocity as a percentage it has already been noted how variability scales across the measurements, but comparing the growth curves is complicated as the peak velocities are so different (table <UNK> plotting the data on a log scale (figure <UNK> which converts velocity to percentage units, is a simple way to adjust for the differences in scale and allows the growth curves to be compared directly. the spacings between the measurement curves are similar in boys and girls, the one obvious exception being thigh circumference which is relatively larger for girls after puberty. figure <UNK> compares velocity in percentage units in the two sexes. expressing velocity this way is novel, the more usual units being cm per year, but it is particularly useful here for comparing measurements on the different scales. figure <UNK> and table <UNK> show that peak percent velocity is strongly conserved, with all except arm and thigh circumference in the narrow range of <UNK> per year, on average about <UNK> greater for boys than girls. however figure <UNK> and table <UNK> also show that the shapes of the velocity curves differ in detail between measurements, with sex differences in pv, apv and age at takeoff making each measurement profile unique. sitting height and leg length provide an interesting contrast in growth pattern. prior to puberty, leg length grows fastest and sitting height slowest in both sexes. so during this period leg length increases progressively as a proportion of height. the two are similar in pv at around <UNK> cm per year in girls/boys, but at takeoff sitting height velocity is <UNK> cm per year lower than for leg length (figure <UNK> figures <UNK> and <UNK> show that sitting height continues growing well after leg length growth has ceased, and in boys it continues to age <UNK> and beyond. also the size random effect sd is appreciably larger for leg length than sitting height <UNK> vs <UNK> table <UNK> so there is greater variability in leg length. thus the two components of height grow in rather different ways during childhood. the two circumferences, thigh and arm, behave differently from the eight lengths and widths. they have the largest percent peak velocities (for arm in boys and thigh in girls) and amongst the smallest velocities at takeoff. so the intensity of the circumference growth spurt (i.e. the increase in velocity from takeoff to peak) is particularly high, presumably due to the fact that it measures not just bone but also soft mass, which accumulates faster than bone. this fits with the residual cvs and the intensity random effect sds for the circumferences being more than twice those for the other measurements (tables <UNK> and <UNK> comparing random effects thus far the discussion has focussed on the shapes of the sitar mean curves and velocity curves. the other component of the sitar model is the set of subject random effects that indicate how the growth curves of individuals differ from the mean curve. table <UNK> shows that the sd for the size random effect is more uniform when presented as the percent cv rather than the sd in cm units. this represents the variability of each measurement once timing and intensity have been adjusted for, so it reflects the variability when growth has ceased i.e. in adulthood. this population cv is equivalent to that estimated for growth references using the lms method (cole and green <UNK> where the cv is the “s” in “lms”. thus for height in the british <UNK> reference

<UNK> (tanner et al. <UNK> in harpenden sitting height is by far the least variable of all the measurements, whereas leg length is amongst the most variable (excepting the circumferences). the timing random effect sds in table <UNK> are all (again with the exception of the circumferences) close to one year, the median being <UNK> years. for height they are <UNK> years in the two sexes, matching closely tanner’s experience – “the sd of age at phv is a little less than <UNK> year in nearly all published series; we have taken the value <UNK> years” (tanner and davies <UNK> in alspac the two sds are slightly more varied at <UNK> and <UNK> years (table <UNK> the intensity random effect reflects the individual’s proportional difference in pv relative to the mean. so the intensity sd is effectively the cv for pv, or multiplied by <UNK> the percent cv for pv. the values for the intensity sd in table <UNK> show it to be related to size, with the smallest values for height and leg length <UNK> and the largest (excepting the circumferences) for knee width and elbow width <UNK> with multiple measurements available, it is obvious to ask if individuals tend to be similar in their random effects across measurements, i.e. do they tend to be consistently large/small, or early/late, or fast/slow in their growth pattern. this is addressed by looking at the correlations between measurements for each random effect by sex, as seen in supplementary table <UNK> the variables in the correlation matrices are sorted to put highly correlated measurements next to each other, which has the effect of migrating large coefficients towards the diagonal and small correlations away from it. the most strongly associated measurements are height and leg length (unsurprisingly, as leg length is a component of height) but more surprisingly the next most associated measurement is not sitting height but foot length (it ranks third three times and fourth twice in supplementary table <UNK> why such a distal measurement should be closely correlated with height is something of a mystery – perhaps it represents a link between leg length and foot length. as expected from what has gone before, the two circumferences are consistently last in the rankings, being similar to each other but different from all the other variables. alspac the alspac study design involved nine data sweeps spaced one to two years apart (figure <UNK> this has been shown to be close to the optimal design for studying pubertal growth, as annual or biennial measurements minimise the data collection while retaining relevant information on the mean curve and subject random effects (cole <UNK> on these grounds one could argue that the <UNK> measurement regime used in harpenden was unnecessarily intensive. the sitar models for alspac by sex appear in figure <UNK> and table <UNK> they can be compared directly to the sitar models described by frysz et al. <UNK> which were fitted to a selected subset of alspac data from age <UNK> to <UNK> years. thus they had <UNK> measurements on <UNK> boys and <UNK> girls, as against <UNK> points, <UNK> boys and <UNK> girls here (table <UNK> despite the disparities in sample size their mean (sd) apvs were very similar to those here: girls <UNK> <UNK> and boys <UNK> <UNK> years, as against <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> years (table <UNK> and similarly for pv: <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> here (table <UNK> the percentage of variance explained was close to <UNK> in all four models, and the two sets of random effect sds were also very similar. frysz et al. restricted their sample to individuals with at least one measurement in each of the age groups <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> < <UNK> years. the fact that the results are effectively the same without applying this filter indicates that the filtering is unnecessary, and that results based on the whole sample are unbiased. in addition, the increased numbers allow for a mean curve with <UNK> d.f. rather than the <UNK> used by frysz, which may explain the greater boys pv here of <UNK> cm versus <UNK> cm per year. comparing mean predicted adult height in alspac and harpenden demonstrates the secular trend in height from <UNK> to <UNK> a period of <UNK> years between their median dates of birth. height at age <UNK> increased by <UNK> cm in boys and <UNK> cm in girls over that time, corresponding to trends of <UNK> and <UNK> cm per decade respectively. however the harpenden children were of lower social class than in alspac, and this may have exaggerated the trend. for comparison trends from the flemish <UNK> growth reference were <UNK> and <UNK> cm per decade (roelants et al. <UNK> and for the finnish <UNK> reference <UNK> cm per decade in both sexes (saari et al. <UNK> a strength of sitar is its ability to sort individuals by apv (simpkin et al. <UNK> thus it is easy to use the global model to split the ten thousand alspac children into nine groups by sex, based on their timing random effects, and then analyse these local groups separately. the results in tables <UNK> and <UNK> and figures <UNK> and <UNK> confirm that the local group curves (top right in each figure) are not only correctly ranked by mean apv, but are also very similar in shape to the curves predicted from the global models (top left). table <UNK> shows that despite having equal numbers of subjects, the central groups have fewer measurements and are generally less noisy than the more extreme groups. this is due to the group membership being based on individual timing random effects, and individuals with relatively few points have their random effect shrunk towards the mean of zero (in the extreme case of an individual with just one measurement, their timing random effect is zero). thus the central groups have fewer measurements per subject on average, and also less opportunity to generate residual variation. it is noticeable with the predicted velocity curves (figures <UNK> and <UNK> bottom left) that pv falls steadily as apv rises; this is due to the sitar model using log age rather than age, which provides a better fit as apv is negatively correlated with pv as previously discussed (cole et al. <UNK> tanner also documented a negative correlation between apv and pv in his harpenden analysis (tanner et al. <UNK> this same trend can be seen with the locally estimated velocity curves (bottom right), particularly in boys, though the curves are more ragged. note that in girls the agreement between the global and local velocity curves is generally close. however for boys two features of the local velocity curves are absent from the global curves – the later apv groups show a peak in velocity at around <UNK> years that the earlier apv groups lack, and several of the curves dip below zero velocity approaching age <UNK> indicating predicted mean adult height falling over time. the early velocity peak is also seen in the height curves (top right, figure <UNK> as an upward bulge at age <UNK> restricted to the older apv groups. the two features occur at the extremes of age and show that sitar is less effective at modelling these extremes. the negative velocity curves may arise from the timing of the final data sweep at age <UNK> it is clear from figure <UNK> that the data are sparse after age <UNK> and it would require only slight downward bias to tip the mean curve slopes negative. figures <UNK> (girls) and figures <UNK> (boys) show each apv group split into five pv groups. the individual girls curves are generally similar in shape, although a few dip below zero velocity at age <UNK> however the boys curves show a remarkable spectrum of curve shapes, ranging from the earliest and fastest growing (top curve, top left facet) to the latest and slowest growing (bottom curve, bottom right facet). the peak in velocity at age <UNK> seen consistently in the later apv groups of figure <UNK> looks like a midgrowth spurt, but this term has already been applied to a spurt documented as occurring nearer age <UNK> than <UNK> (tanner and cameron <UNK> gasser et al. <UNK> remer and manz <UNK> the data analysed here start at age <UNK> and so are not able to detect a spurt that early. whether this age <UNK> peak is just a delayed version of the age <UNK> peak, or whether it is novel, would need further analysis to unpick. figure <UNK> sitar mean height velocity curves for alspac boys, split into nine groups by age at peak height velocity (apv) and in turn five groups by peak height velocity (pv). to demonstrate the spectrum of height growth in boys, figure <UNK> shows the individual growth curves in the two extreme timing-intensity groups of figure <UNK> each representing <UNK> of the cohort total. their mean curves are also shown superimposed (with solid lines for the local mean and dotted lines for the predicted global mean). because they are filtered by apv and pv the individual curves are essentially parallel to each other. mean apv in the two groups is <UNK> and <UNK> years respectively, i.e. <UNK> years apart, while mean pv is <UNK> and <UNK> cm per year, a factor of two different (figure <UNK> yet despite these differences sitar does a reasonable job of predicting the two growth patterns from the global model (dotted lines), although it infers a growth spurt in the late curve where none exists. figure <UNK> height growth curves for alspac boys with two contrasting patterns of development; left) early and fast - apv group <UNK> and pv group <UNK> (n = <UNK> and right) late and slow – apv group <UNK> and pv group <UNK> (n = <UNK> the corresponding sitar mean curves are shown as solid black lines, and the dotted lines are predicted mean curves (based on mean apv and mean pv) from the global sitar model. this ability of sitar to identify groups of individuals with early or late apv could be exploited in cohort studies to construct specialist growth references for early and late developers. it could be done for example using all the data for the first and last groups, respectively, of figures <UNK> and <UNK> (n > <UNK> table <UNK> and fitting growth reference centiles to them using the lms method (cole and green <UNK> this would be most useful for the clinical management of constitutional growth delay, where the chart would document the growth pattern of the <UNK> most delayed normal children. it might also be reassuring to parents to see just how late the growth spurt can be. however figure <UNK> makes clear that the late developing boys are still growing at age <UNK> so there would be insufficient data to extend the centiles to final height. and it should be acknowledged that tanner staging could be used instead of apv to identify the early and late groups. however apv is likely to be more accurate, being based on a growth curve rather than a single clinical assessment, and measured on a continuous rather than a five-point scale. strengths and limitations the study has some obvious strengths. the harpenden growth study is an important resource of very high quality growth data containing information on ten separate measurements in a cohort of children born seventy years ago, while alspac provides high quality height data on a very large number of individuals born thirty years ago. given this richness of material it is hard to identify limitations in the study design, and the analysis was thorough, though it could obviously have been extended in a number of ways. conclusions the analysis of growth data during puberty is greatly simplified using sitar, as the subject random effects of timing and intensity accurately characterise the tempo of growth of individuals. the analyses of data from the harpenden growth study and alspac have shed light on the growth patterns of a range of linear measurements and on the spectrum of height growth as seen in early, average and late developers.
