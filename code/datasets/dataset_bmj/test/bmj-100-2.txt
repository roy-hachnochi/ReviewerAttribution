This study examined trajectories of BMI over the last five decades and to assess to what
extent the obesogenic environment influenced body mass index differently depending on the
degree of genetic predisposition. This large scaled longitudinal study found that there was a
substantial difference in BMI between the highest and lowest quantiles of genetic
susceptibility for all ages at each time-period, and the difference increased gradually from
the 1960s to the 2000s. The differences in BMI between the most and least genetically
predisposed increased from 1.2kg/m2 among men and 1.70 kg/m2 among women (1960s)

to 2.29 kg/m2 among men and 3.14 kg/m2 among women (20002). They concluded that the
genetically predisposed are at greater risk for higher BMI and the gene by obesogenic
environment interaction amplifies this effect primarily amongst today’s youth, while, the
results in the present study are not sufficient to support this conclusion. Previous GWAS
(Hum Mol Genet. 2016 Jan 15; 25(2): 389–403.) and genetic association analyses (JAMA.
2016 Jul 5;316(1):63-9. doi: 10.1001/jama.2016.8729.) have implicated that these
adiposity variants represent age-related differences in strength of the associations with body
mass index.
Major concerns
1.
This study included 96 of the 97 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously
identified to be associated with BMI among adults. While age of participants included in this
study largely varied from 13 to 80 y. Previous GWAS for BMI among adults and childhood
showed that genetic effects on adiposity vary across lifespan. As you may know the GWAS
for BMI among childhood only identified 15 loci, most of that are associated with adult BMI.
How do authors explain these differences?
2.
The rationale of this study could be clearer. Especially how this study design may
inform gene by obesogenic environment interaction to support your objective “assess to
what extent the obesogenic environment influenced body mass index differently depending
on the degree of genetic predisposition.
3.
This study did not test the gene by obesogenic environment interaction, which is
very complex. Therefore, the results are not sufficient to get a conclusion “the gene by
obesogenic environment interaction amplifies this effect primarily amongst today’s youth”.
4.
How about the genetic association of individual variant with BMI in participants aged
13-18, and those aged 18-80 y? especially among Norway population.
5.
Several studies (JAMA. 2016 Jul 5;316(1):63-9. Diabetes. 2018 Feb;67(2):248-255.
Int J Epidemiol. 2018 Apr 1;47(2):506-515.) have reported the genetic association with BMI
in life course. It’s better to avoid to use “no other longitudinal study has examined this
association with BMI over a long term period.”
