This paper examines impressive data on trends in BMI in Norway, including differences
according to genetic-risk scores for high BMI. The following points should be addressed:
•
It is hard to interpret the main findings. The authors should empirically test the
various interactions implied rather than solely analysing sub groups separately. That is,
formally test gene*year, and gene*year*age interactions (“Our study suggests that genetic
predisposition interacts with the obesogenic environment”). Same for gender differences (“In
general, genetic predisposition had a stronger effect on women’s BMI at all ages”).
•
The authors should consider testing if the relative difference between BMI differs by
gene group. This may change the interpretation of findings. For example, if group 1 + 2
have BMIs of 15 + 16, the absolute difference is 1, yet in relative terms it is ~6.67%; if
group 1 + 2 have BMIs of 30 + 32, the absolute difference is 2, yet in relative terms it is still
~6.67%.
Other comments:
•
The sample selection is extremely complex, and it is currently difficult to follow and
appraise how this might affect result interpretation. I suggest the authors present a
conventional flow diagram (from top to bottom), potentially in addition to the complex one
currently presented (from left to right).
•
The authors should consider in greater detail in the Discussion if missing genetic
data / other potential sources of selection bias could bias findings.
•
“Observations from participants 80 years and older were excluded as BMI is affected
by disease in old age.” This is not particularly convincing at stated, and is unreferenced.
Disease may lower BMI in younger age groups.
•
How was “insufficient genotyping quality” defined/determined?
•
More details needed on the modelling, was age included as solely a linear term?
•
“presented separate results for high versus low genetic predisposition for obesity” –
what are these groups? Quintiles ? (not quantiles as specified in results?)
•
Was genetic risk linearly associated with BMI? This seems a necessary assumption
for presenting the top and bottom groups only. It would be helpful to show all groups
•
Please state the average number of BMI measures per participant.
•
“Among individuals in the highest quantile of genetic susceptibility
•
“the prevalence of obesity increased from 5% to 20% for men and 6% to 23% for
women (Table S2).” I couldn’t find these estimates in the table. Please specify the
years/ages referred to exactly.
•
Why were analyses repeated among never smokers?
•
Discussion. The paragraph on selection is hard to follow. “A non-participation study
for HUNT3 with self-reported height and weight lifted the possibility that BMI was slightly
overestimated”. What does this mean? Please specify the potential sources of bias, and likely
direction/strength based on empirical evidence where available. “generally representative”
could be due to any factor (eg, gender) and not necessarily be relevant to the inferences
made in this paper.
•
Please clarify the labelling for the figure 1. Are these birth cohorts?

•
For figure 1, the 1920s groups appear to have higher age-specific BMI than more
recently born generations. This goes against some of the conclusions drawn in the paper.
Please can authors check/consider this.
•
Discussion. The authors refer to reference 5, which is a small comment article. Thus
I think the authors should consider more broadly the potential causes of the obesity increase
they refer to (political reform is 1 potential reason, which may itself be caused by other
factors).
•
Discussion. “Although environments may differ, the interplay between genes and the
environment will exist in populations throughout the world”. This sentence doesn’t seem
substantiated nor seems helpful. Of interest however is to understand if genetic risk differs
in different populations. It is unlikely to be universally the same. It is also unnecessarily
repeated in the concluding paragraph. Authors should consider how could results from
Norway be generalised to other countries
•
Discussion. “as lifestyle research is prone to statistical and methodological
challenges” This is too vague. Please clarify. I also suggest avoidance of the word lifestyle
since choices may be constrained.
•
Discussion, p11. I suggest authors avoid the use of quotes.
•
Discussion. “Disentangling the mechanisms underlying the obesity epidemic could
facilitate more effective prevention strategies targeting specific environmental contributors”.
This is quite vague and not very closely related to what this paper showed. I would
encourage the authors to think again about this. How could the findings be useful (even if
indirectly)?
