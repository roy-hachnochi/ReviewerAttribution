Loupy et al report results from an international cohort study from ten academic medical
centres from Europe and the United States. They studied 33 candidate prognostic factors of
kidney allograft survival and the outcome was allograft failure (i.e., return on dialysis or preemptive retransplantation). Among 7,557 kidney transplant recipients , 1,067 allografts
failed (14.12%) after a median follow-up time posttransplant of 7.12 years. In the derivation
cohort, eight functional, histological and immunological prognostic factors were
independently associated with allograft failure and were then combined into a risk prediction
score (iBox). The iBox was shown accurate when assessed at different times post-transplant,
was validated in different clinical scenarios and outperformed previous risk prediction scores
as well as risk score based solely on functional parameters eGFR and proteinuria. the
authors concluded that this is an integrative, accurate, and readily implementable risk
prediction score for kidney allograft failure showing generalisability across centres worldwide
and common clinical scenario.
Well designed and well written study on a topic which is challenging for clinicians and
patients.
However the authors need to underline the limitation of having patients from different
transplant units across countries and various races.
