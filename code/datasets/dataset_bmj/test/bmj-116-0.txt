Summary
The authors use data from the US Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use File to characterize use and
spending on prescription drugs for Medicare Part D enrollees during 2011-2015. They find that
expenditures on Medicare Part D prescription drugs more than doubled between 2011 and 2015 (11.9
billion to 25.8 billion) and that out of pocket spending increased by 49% (2.0 billion to $2.9 billion),
although the increase was relatively modest at the individual patient level (increase in $0.45 or 4%).
These increases reflected increases in the number of prescriptions as well as drug prices, which
increased at rates faster than inflation for half of the drugs, and in come cases the increases were more
than 100 times the rate of inflation.
Major comments:
The article addresses an important topic, that of increasing drug prices in the U.S., and helps to quantify
the increasing impact on total Medicare spending and out of pocket spending on prescription drugs. The
manuscript is a descriptive study, and is generally clear (with some specific comments included below
that may help to improve clarity). The focus on World Health Organization Model List of Essential
Medicines is a nice way to identify medications that are important to study. The main limitation is that
the authors haven’t provided context as to why this topic would be of interest to non-American readers
of BMJ.
Specific comments:
Lines 23-24. Suggest noting that this is a focus on spending by U.S. Medicare enrollees.

Lines 44-45. The abstract conclusion states that the spending increases are driven largely by increased
use of novel agents, but the abstract results do not mention novel agents.
Introduction: as above, the introduction would benefit from context about why this topic would be of
interest to non-Americans. Also, it would be helpful to provide some additional information about
Medicare Part D.
Line 98. Suggest referring to eTable1 here (as well as in the results section).
Line 111. It is not clear here or elsewhere if “total” spending reflects “total Medicare spending” or “total
spending -including spending by Medicare and patients”.
Line 117. It is not clear what is meant by “each of the seven categories”. This was the first mention that
I saw of seven categories.
Lines 119-122: The description of the volume and cost index as “(change in drug volume based on fixed
set of costs, and vice versa)” is not clear. Also, can the authors please clarify what they mean by “unit
count”? Is this number of patients filling scripts? Number fills? Number of 30-day equivalent fills?
Something else? Also, how many of the 265 drugs were excluded based on lacking data in 2011 or
2015? Were the data missing because of product entry/exit? Did missing data affect any other
estimates?
The results highlight drugs for which prices increased faster than inflation, but I did not see that analysis
described in the methods.
Lines 143-147. Was cumulative beneficiary count the total number of Part D enrolled beneficiaries who
filled at least one prescription in a given year? Is the “total number of prescriptions” referring to
prescriptions filled? Any differences for 1-month vs. 3-month supplies?
Line 150. Is this out-of-pocket spending for Part D enrollees or Part D enrollees who filed prescriptions?
Line 153. It seems also notable that 50% of drugs did not increase faster than the rate of inflation. For
what % of drugs did per-unit cost decrease?
Line 161. The authors state “Among the drugs experiencing increased spending”, are they referring to
the 133 drugs where per-unit costs increased faster than the rate of inflation?
Line 166-172. This set of findings seems to conflate 2 constructs: novel agents as well as variations in
unit costs. The finding that 92% of the increase attributed to novel drugs is accounted for by only 2
drugs is striking… and it seems that this is less about “novel drugs” than about 2 specific drugs for the
treatment of hepatitis C.
Lines 234-235. This final statement suggests that patients may not be able to afford these drugs without
efforts to curb costs, but the data presented suggest that patients are seeing only a small fraction of the
increased costs; the vast majority of the spending increases are being seen by the Medicare program,
thus important to address the impact on payers (which of course may be increasingly transmitted to
patients with higher premiums, deductibles, and copayments/coinsurance.
