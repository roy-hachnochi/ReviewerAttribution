Thanks for the opportunity to review this analysis article on developing an implementation research
agenda to increase adoption of non-communicable disease programmes. It has many interesting
ideas. Please find below specific comments and suggestions for the authors.
Major
1.
In developing research questions there is no mention of theories and frameworks for
understanding and addressing implementation dilemmas. I feel this is a major omission in this paper.
See Nilsen 2015 for example
https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-015-0242-0
2.
On p. 7 The authors state “As noted in the six national NCD plans reviewed, many had
upstream questions about the acceptance and adoption of interventions, though over time there is
likely to be growing interest in questions about feasibility, fidelity, coverage and effectiveness” I was
surprised that there was little mention on the role of health economic evaluations as part of the
implementation agenda. The move in many countries, such as Thailand, to developing health
technology assessment boards is a step in this direction to provide advice to payers on where to
invest scarce resources.
3.
More broadly there is little mention of financing interventions to support NCD programs.
Public, NGO and private payers - insurance design, co-payment relief etc are critical enablers to
supporting uptake of NCD policies, population health programs and targeted care delivery
interventions.
4.
On p.8 in the conclusion there is mention of implementation research to foster learning
organisations. There was little mention of data systems and the importance of appropriate information
infrastructure, governance and tools to support implementation research. For example see
https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001991
5.
In line with the premise of this article that different questions need to be posed for different
audiences, it would be helpful to define 'policy makers' in more detail. MoH people have different

needs from finance and treasury. What is the role of presidents and prime ministers? How are the
needs/ expectations of national vs regional policy makers addressed? What are the issues faced by
mid-level bureaucrats responsible for implementation? All of these are policy makers or implementers
but each have very different needs in terms of research questions that might matter to them and
other constraints/ opportunities that are within or outside of their remit.
6.
P.7 “Systematically examining NCD implementation challenges along the continuum of
“implementation outcome variables” can also be very helpful” Although, the continuum concept can be
helpful, increasingly implementation research is recognising that linear approaches are too simplistic
and models that try to understand complexity, non-linearity and unpredictability are needed to help
understand and overcome implementation dilemmas. It does not necessarily follow that addressing
one problem then frees one up to address the next problem down the line.

Minor
1.

Typo p.3 line 42 ‘the”

2.
Interventions and programs are used somewhat interchangeably throughout the paper. It
would be helpful to provide more clarity in defining what is in and out of scope for this paper. Is it
everything from upstream prevention (legal and regulatory) through to service and individual level
strategies or some subset of the spectrum?

3.
Introduction p.3- The dot point list of barriers is somewhat arbitrary and not referenced.
Suggest putting some kind of structure around this list such as macro, meso, micro level factors. e.g
the last dot point talks about silos of care delivery and programs, neglected populations, inter-sectoral
stakeholders, business sector.
4.
What was the rationale for the selection of those particular countries and what were the
methods for developing the table summary in the web annex?
5.

Silos mentioned often but little detail on specifically what are these siloes.

6.
P.5 The authors mention “Another common thread throughout the plans is the focus on
prevention, and the need to shift from disease specific to person-centred approaches” Can you clarify
what this means in practical terms?
7.
P.4 “Policy-makers, managers, and citizen groups frequently have concerns about
implementation of NCD interventions. But these concerns are not typically framed as answerable
questions” I was surprised to not see care providers included in this list of groups with concerns about
implementation
8.
I could not make sense of this sentence: “Identifying groups whose interests and power may
oppose NCD control strategies would emerge from stakeholder analysis, is a common subject for
implementation research.”
9.

Any references to support the assertion that “reverse research days” are effective?
