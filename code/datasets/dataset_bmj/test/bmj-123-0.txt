I thank the authors for an extensive revision of their paper to address my
previous comments and suggestions. Overall, the paper is methodologically
rigorous and presents its findings in a balanced way. My only two remaining
comments are the following:
- When discussing the policy implications of the findings, it would be helpful to
also comment on the importance of conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis
when determining which intervention should be prioritised in guidelines.
- I strongly recommend including a table in the online only appendix that
provides details of the risk of bias judgments that were agreed by the two
investigators. This is important to ensure that other researchers can
cross-check/replicate these assessments in the future.
