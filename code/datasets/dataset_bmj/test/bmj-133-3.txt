This is a very exciting paper. It sets out the economics of self care, coherently
putting self-care on the current agenda. The main issue that is missing is that
diagnostics self-care retains the same initial problems with access conventional
health service, only among a small group of individuals, i.e. those with positive
tests. It would be good to incorporate a discussion of this. Some of this can possibly
draw on the literature around linkage to care following HIVSelf testing, or in high
income countries, the STI self-swabbing literature.
Reg. mHealth possibly increasing health inequalities, I agree this is possilbe, if it is
seen as a cost saving approach. I think it is important emphasize that we need to do
things better, more efficiently not solely cheaper. By enabling more able users to
use self-care approaches, this might free up resources to support those who are
most in need of face to face support.
I would also like to see where the gaps are in terms of self-care research agenda,
i.e. what is holding up rolling self care out?
These are just some thoughts on how to improve this very interesting piece.
Best wishes,
