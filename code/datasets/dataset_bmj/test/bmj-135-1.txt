Great paper to add to the BMJ publications.
This manuscript, “Breast cancer risk in transgender people receiving hormone therapy”
uses a large cohort of trans people in the Netherlands. This is a very important and
exciting paper.
In the introduction, there is an assumption that transgender people experience gender
dysphoria. Maybe this is accurate for the Netherlands, but in the US, the DSM-V has
disentangled these two concepts. “gender identity disorder” was dropped and “gender
dysphoria” was added; for a ‘gender dysphoria’ diagnosed one needed to feel distress at
the mismatch. Ergo not all trans people face gender dysphoria.
Another broad comment, “Besides gender-affirming hormone therapy (HT), transgender
people often desire further surgical transition…..” This comment is without citation and
may not be factual. Transgender classification is an umbrella term that encompasses
many facets of gender expression that differ from biological sex assignment at birth. This
sentence needs to be more circumspect. “Some TG desire…., though the percent is not
known.” Looking at the data, it seems that transpeople at this facility have gender
affirming surgery (maybe add the statistics) since this isn’t the norm for other places and
makes me wonder about the generalizability of the findings. Is it more than just hormone
but also the surgical changes that make a difference?
A third reason for us not being able to determine the breast cancer risk is that gender
identity is not captured in the cancer registry required elements, in the United States. Is
this the same for the Netherlands?
It would be helpful to add years (223 months (18.6 yr)) along with months for ease of
translation.
table 1. For example, case 7 is 43 years old, has had (434 months = 33.3 years hormone
use) 33 years of hormones so started at age 10? And had vaginoplasty at 10 years old? Is
that correct?
18 cases listed with one without a number; who is that one; assume it is a 2nd diagnosis.
Unclear…

The results were easy to follow and the discussion was well crafted.
My only concern is the potential unique population with only 3 or 4 cases not having
surgical intervention. I would really like a table that describes the trans population at the
VU Univ Med Centre Amsterdam demographics.
