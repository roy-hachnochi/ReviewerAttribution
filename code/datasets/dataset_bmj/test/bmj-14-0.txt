The authors response to point 1, states that one study used OR, the rest HR and so to
combine they present RR. A sensitivity analysis removes the single OR. Point 2 response
states that all studies presented HR and to keep consistency with the primary analysis they
present RR. It is not at all clear why the authors would take this approach rather than
combining HR directly to give overall HR estimates, since this is given in all except one
study whereas RR are not actually presented in any. RR are not identical to HR and any
approximation should be noted and justified. In this case such approximation seems
unnecessary.
The authors have otherwise addressed my comments appropriately.
