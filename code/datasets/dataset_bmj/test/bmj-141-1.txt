The study was well designed and conducted. I recommend the authors to add the following
information:
1. The causal effects of BP outcome were estimated by means of a linear regression.
However, figure 2 showed that there exists potential non-linear relationship between running
variables (especially for the diastolic BP) and the outcome. Authors should introduce why the
linear fit was selected, or reconsider higher order polynomial methods to determine an
optimal polynomial approximation.
2. As authors described, subsequent steps of care continuum (e.g. encouraging individuals
with high BP to make lifestyle changes and seek further care for hypertension etc.) were
implemented following by the screening. This study reported a significant impact of
screening on systolic BP reduction among older adults, but without any information about
the effects of health behavior changes and healthcare utilization. I think that authors should
make additional evaluation on the behavior changes to help readers/policymakers to better
interpret the potential role of screening on hypertension care.
