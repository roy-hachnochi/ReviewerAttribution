The authors made a substantial effort to improve data analysis and presentation: the quality of the
paper has been considerably improved, further increasing the robustness of their findings and the
strength and novelty of this paper. In the end, they convincingly demostrated this metaanalysis is the
best available evidence about sotagliflozin in type 1 diabetes, and such will remain for quite long, given
that no further trials are ongoing or planned in type 1 diabetes. Their findings would certainly have
important clinical implications for the current management of type 1 diabetes and guide future research
on this drug in diabetes.
All my concerns have been adequately addressed.
Some minor suggestions/corrections:
-consider presenting just summary estimates in the forest plots and removing unnecessary and raw
data from the plots. The Figures as they are are too dense and numbers hardly readable.
-pg 15 line 50: should be supplementary Table 3 and not Table 4
-pg 17 line 8: should be supplementaryTable 3 and notTable 4
Pg 18 line 29: should be Table 5
