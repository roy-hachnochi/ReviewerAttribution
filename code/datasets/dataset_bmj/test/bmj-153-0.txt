Authors have considered reviewers' suggestions and improved the paper
accordingly. I would like to thanks all the authors for answering all my
comments.
Although authors have already published an article in BMJ Open in 2017,
reporting an increased drug-attributable mortality risk due to PPI use among the
population of United States Veterans, in this paper reviewed they found others

relevant findings related to the association between PPI exposure and
cause-specific mortality, applying advanced statistical methodologies. The paper
now is well presented and complete and I do not have any major concerns about
its publication in BMJ.
I only have some minor observations:
- Please in the title change “morality” with “mortality”.
- The Kaplan-Meier curves of PPI and H2 blockers groups are noted as
“Supplemental Figure 2” in the legend but then is wrongly reported in the text as
“Supplemental Figure 1”.
- In my opinion it is important to explain more in detail the results achieved with
cumulative exposure and time-varying exposure analysis in the discussion.
Furthermore, none of these notable results has been reported in the abstract.
