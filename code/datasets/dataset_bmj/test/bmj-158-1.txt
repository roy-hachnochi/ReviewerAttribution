General comments
While the study design used in this manuscript was appropriate, results of this manuscript
add little new knowledge to the literature. First, the dose-response association between
accelerometer-measured moderate-intensity physical activity and all-cause mortality found
in this review (Figure 3e) was very similar with the association found in NHANES
2003-2006 participants alone (Figure 1A in Lee, 2016). Similarly, the dose-response
association between accelerometer-measured sedentary behaviors and all-cause mortality
found in this review (Figure 3f) was very similar with the association found in NHANES
2003-2006 participants alone (Figure 1C in Lee, 2016). Second, besides categorizing the
time spent on physical activity and sedentary behaviors by quartiles as the exposure
variable, the crude time spent as continuous variables should also be tested, so that the
results could be translated quantitatively into effect size.

Page 4, lines 15. No need to specify the search update. Same for page 7, line 23.
Page 4, lines 19-24. Were there any requirements on the quality of the studies to be
included? Same for page 8, lines 33-35.
Page 4, lines 33-35. Did you mean that you used Cox proportional hazards regression to
re-analyze the data, or the included studies used Cox proportional hazards regression to
analyze the data?
Page 4, line 43. “Did not participate”. Did you mean that individual level participant data
were not available?
Page 7, lines 27-34. Why not “accelerometry”?
Page 7, line 55 – page 8, line 3. Did you mean that only studies that placed the
accelerometers at hip were included? In order to justify the exclusion of these three
studies, the authors should provide evidence showing the lack of association of movement
count data between accelerometers worn at different parts of the body.
Page 9, lines 3-19. These cutoffs were for ActiGraph accelerometer only.
Page 9, lines 42-44. I don't understand the rationale behind the categorization of exposure
data into quartiles. It made the interpretation of the results difficult and the conclusion
could not be translated quantitatively into effect size nor recommendations (e.g., one
additional hour per day of sedentary behavior was associated with an elevated hazard of
mortality of XXX).
Page 11, line 36. How were these two studies (26, 35) identified?
Table 1. It maybe clearer to use “number of deaths” instead of “number of cases”.
“Covariates” should be replaced by “Confounders”.
Table 2. The unit for PA (min/d) was meaningless here as the volume of PA was
categorized by quartiles.
