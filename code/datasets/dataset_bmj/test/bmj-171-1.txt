I read with interest the manuscript of Alexander et al. regarding the association between
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a
population-based, primary care electronic healthcare record data. The manuscript is
interesting, well-written and the data support the conclusion of the Authors.
I have only some concerns:
- If I understood correctly, the overall percentage of individuals with NAFLD is
approximately 0.7% (120,795 patients with recorded NAFLD/NASH diagnoses were
identified out of 17.7 million patients in the databases). It seems a very small percentage
for detecting the potential association between NAFLD and CVD. In my opinion, this aspect
should be broadly discussed in the manuscript as well as acknowledged in the
interpretation of data;
- In the methods, it is not fully clear how the diagnosis of AMI and stroke were made;
- What about if you conduct sensitivity analyses including only NASH patients?;
- In the full adjusted models, although the Authors have conducted some sensitivity
analyses, I would suggest to adjust also for BMI (Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol 2018; 6:
944-953) and alcohol consumption (Lancet 2018;391:1513â€“23).
- What about if you exclude individuals with any consumption of alcohol (Dig Liver Dis.
