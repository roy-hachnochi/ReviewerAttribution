This is a well-written article which clearly outlines the issues regarding health and development of HEU
children and how we should both investigate and manage these. I have a couple of small comments
which need to be addressed and a few ideas for the authors to consider.
1. p5, line 53 to p 6, line 5: The authors mention the disadvantage of the large Zimbabwean study in
that it was conducted when ARVs were hardly available so it can provide no data relevant to today's
ARV-exposed cohorts. However, it also be mentioned that it provides an important, and now vanishingly
rare, study of the effects of HIV exposure alone, without the complication of varying ARV regimens.
2. In their discussion towards the end on the Way Forward, the authors discuss the practical and ethical
issues of routine monitoring of HEU children. However, I think the way forward needs to start by getting
more good quality research data in order to determine which groups, including HUA and EHE, have any
excess risks at all, what these are, and what cost-effective interventions are available to mitigate risks.
If there is no problem or no solution, then implementing a surveillance programme is not a priority.
3. The 2nd and 3rd key messages are quite similar and could be combined.
Small points:
4. Page 4. line 55: It is not clear what is meant by 'efficiency' of ARVs.
5. Page 10: Reference #9 seems to have got messed up.
