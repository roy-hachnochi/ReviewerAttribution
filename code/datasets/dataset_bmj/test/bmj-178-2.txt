This is a timely and important topic. The number of HEU children is rapidly rising and is becoming one
of the largest HIV affected populations. The authors present a nice and balanced discussion of the need
to invest in the long-term follow up of these children. Interesting discussion is also presented for HIV
unexposed but ARV exposed children born to mothers using PrEP during pregnancy, and HIV and ARV
unexposed children living in households affected by HIV. The paper presents the need for defining
exposures, encourages prospective cohort studies of HEUs and routine follow up of HEU with a trigger
based approach, and discusses the issue of maternal HIV disclosure and HIV stigma in having the
HIV/ARV exposure status linked to a child’s health record.
I have a few minor comments:
In the second Key Message which start with “This” – I am not sure what “This” refers to. I suggest
editing to increase clarity.
In the Standfirst it is stated “…that short and long-term monitoring of HIV and/or antiretroviral (ARV)
exposure in children is critical to identifying ways of improving individual clinical care…”. This statement
is not quite clear as it is not HIV and ARV exposure that is monitored in the children but rather the
health of the HEU children. I suggest editing the statement.
In the Definition of exposure status: I recommend revising the first sentence to increase clarity. The
first half of the sentence seems to refer to a general definition of exposures, while in the second half of
the sentence the authors mention ARV drug regimens. Splitting into two sentences would be helpful.
Plus, I am not sure what “variation in how exposures are constructed” means.
In the same section, second paragraph the authors mention that high levels of maternal HIV viremia and
systemic inflammation could result in immune dysfunction. This is true, but not the only adverse
outcomes. Inflammation has been linked to other developmental issues including higher risk of autism
spectrum disorder.
There is a period missing in the sentence ending with reference 9
