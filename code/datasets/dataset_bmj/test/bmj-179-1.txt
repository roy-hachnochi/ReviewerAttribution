This is a massive, landmark meta-epidemiological study examining the effects of blinding in
randomized trials. Of particularly novelty is the distinction of various groups being blinded
for different types of outcomes. The topic is highly relevant to stakeholders in research and
healthcare. The presentation of methods and findings is excellent. My comments relate
mainly to areas for further clarification and trying to explain the surprising results.
1) The authors provide three explanations for the results: blinding is truly not as important
as believed, meta-epidemiologic limitations, and lack of precision. Could there be additional
explanations:
a. Blinding of a single group (patient/provider/observer) in a trial might be insufficient to
counteract the bias introduced by the non-blinding of the other groups (i.e. all groups may
need to be blinded in a trial to reduce bias overall).
b. “Blinded” trials were not actually blinded: The persons who were stated/intended to be
blinded were aware of the intervention assignments (e.g. due to obvious adverse effects or
efficacy; poorly matched placebo).
c. Selective reporting of outcomes – assuming that blinding leads to smaller effect sizes, and
that smaller effect sizes are less likely to be reported in a published paper, then the pooled
estimate for a given outcome from blinded trials may be inflated, reducing the contrast with
unblinded trials.
d. Potential misclassification of blinding status in this review as “probably yes” versus
“probably no”
2) Page 4, line 55: It would be helpful to have examples of information that would lead to a
classification of “probably yes/no”.
3) Page 6, lines 8-24: It is challenging to disentangle the effects of blinding one, two, or all
three types of persons in a trial (8 possible combinations). Each of the 5 main analyses
compares two sets of trials that differ in terms of the type of persons blinded (see below).
Set 1 lists the types of trials that are combined for comparison with trials listed in Set 2.
ANALYSIS Ia (Observer N/A)
Set 1: Patient and Provider
Patient only
Set 2: Provider only
No blinding
ANALYSIS Ib
Set 1: Patient, Observer, Provider
Patient and Observer only
Set 2: Observer and Provider only
Observer only
ANALYSIS IIa

Set 1: Provider, Observer, Patient
Provider and Observer only
Set 2: Patient only
No blinding
ANALYSIS IIb
Set 1: Provider, Patient, Observer
Provider and Observer only (if not patient-reported outcome)
Set 2: Patient and Observer only
Observer only (if not patient-reported outcome)
ANALYSIS III
Set 1: Observer only
Observer and Patient only
Observer and Provider only
Observer, Patient, Provider
Set 2: Patient only
Provider only
Patient and Provider only
No blinding
One might end up with comparisons that are hard to interpret depending on the mix of trials
available in each analysis. As an illustrative (extreme) example, Analysis Ia could consist of
trials with only Patient blinding (and unblinded Providers) in Set 1 being compared with trials
where only the Providers are blinded in Set 2 (if there are no trials with everyone blinded,
and no unblinded trials available). The interpretation of a non-significant result for this
comparison would be that blinding of the patient alone is comparable to blinding of the
provider alone for patient-reported outcomes. We would not conclude that blinding of the
patient does not help reduce bias.
Similarly, for Analysis III, one could end up with a mix of trials such that trials with only
observers blinded are being compared with trials that only have patients blinded. Again, in
this extreme simplified instance, one would not conclude that blinding of observers does not
reduce detection bias, but that observer blinding is comparable to patient blinding.
Would it be useful to evaluate the mix of trials in each analysis, in terms of the 8 potential
categories of trial:
• No blinding
• Observer only
• Patient only
• Provider only
• Patient and Provider only
• Observer and Patient only
• Observer and Provider only
• Observer, Patient, Provider
Would it be informative and feasible to compare:
a) Sets of trials that only differ by the status of 1 blinded group, with the blinding status of
the other groups being fixed to be the same
b) Sets of trials with any group blinded versus trials with no blinding of any group
