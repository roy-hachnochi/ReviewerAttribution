The authors chose Fine&Gray subdistribution hazard models instead of cause-specific hazard
models that I suggested. In most scenarios, these two types of models give similar results.
Given the overall robust results, it may not be necessary to re-analyze everything again,
although presenting cause-specific hazard model results, even in the supplement is highly
recommended.
I have no further comments. Thank you for their tremendous efforts in revising the paper.
