This is a well-designed and applied clinical trial to test the effect of manual acupuncture on patients with
migraine. The authors have addressed the concerns of previous reviewers. I only have one minor
comment.
1. The authors emphasize that this is the first study to demonstrate the effect of manual acupuncture
treatment for migraine. Does that mean different mechanisms underlying manual and electro
acupuncture? I would suggest the authors include one or two paragraphs in discussion section on the
potential different mechanisms underlying manual and electro acupuncture or previous studies directly
comparing the two acupuncture modalities in human subjects.
