To EDITOR:
Excellent manuscript with a relevant topic. No major concerns. In my opinion, the scientific
input of this manuscript is high and the results of interest.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this paper.
To AUTHORS:
This is an excellent study that reports on the increased risk of incident dementia among
individuals with poor cardiovascular health at age 50 as defined by the AHA Life Simple 7.
The association between cardiovascular health at age 50 and dementia was also observed
in persons who remained free of cardiovascular disease during the follow-up period.
Similarly, poor cardiovascular health was associated with lower hippocampal volume and
more white matter disease on the MRI in a sample of participants. Incident dementia was
assessed among about 8000 Whitehall II Study participants (at age 50) through linkage to
a hospital, mental health services, and mortality registers until 2017, with a median of
follow up close to 25 years.
The study is well performed and of important relevance in the field.

Major limitations of the study are acknowledged and the use of the administrative data
discussed.
I do not have any major issues with this data, only two questions:
1.
Did the authors have available APOE4 status (from some genetic consortia; e.g.
Wellcome Trust, UK Biobank) that may be linked in a subsample?
2.
The last sentence in the first paragraph of the Discussion state “Higher CVH score
at age 50 was associated with higher whole brain volume and lower grey matter 20 years
later.” Is it really ‘with the lower gray matter’?
Thank you.
