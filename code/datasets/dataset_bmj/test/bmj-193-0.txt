The article is succinct and clear and articulates the problem well. It also provides thoughtful
ideas on what could be done differently. In my experience of working across the whole of
England in the NHS the authors have summarised it well. There is a significant issue with
regard to the impact on safety and safety culture from the myriad of regulators but also I the
way the regulators behave. As the authors say - regulation could in fact be making things
worse. I think it is worthy of publication.
