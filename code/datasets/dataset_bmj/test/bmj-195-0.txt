The authors have responded very positively to the reviewer comments. I have just two
minor points.
1. In response to a comment about the number of decimal places for the optimal
bandwidth, the authors say "We have now rounded all BP values in the paper to the first
integer, because it is indeed measured in whole mmHg." I'm not clear what is meant by
"the first integer", do they mean that BP is rounded to one decimal place?
2. In the Discussion they speculate about factors that might explain the reduction in BP,
listing weight loss, smoking, alcohol and exercise as having large effects. In each case the
coefficient is far from one but the confidence interval brackets one, so I think they mean
the confidence interval includes values that indicate a large effect (either positive or
negative). This needs to be clearer.
