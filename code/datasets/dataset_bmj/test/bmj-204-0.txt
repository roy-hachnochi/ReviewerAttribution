The paper highlights an important issue in the global health and development agenda.
However, it is unclear what specific purpose this submission has: is it to argue for more
development aid? To share new knowledge? Most of the information of little funding for
NCDs has been published before, and it is unclear what new evidence the authors add that
multisector plans would increase the fiscal space for NCDs.
Therefore, while the issue of the high health burden, and the economic detriment of
underinvestment in NCDs needs to be highlighted, this submission is to be regarded as
more of an advocacy paper than a novel research contribution.
