The article was well-written and highlighted an important aspect related to 30-day
readmissions i.e., illusory aspect in their reduction while organizations have come up with
smart strategies to mask the growth in another direction i.e., ED and OBS.
I do have two key questions to the authors:
1) What was the rationale behind the selection of the demographic and clinical comorbidity
profiles of patients hospitalized in 2014 as a reference for a study cohort that spanned
from January 2012 to September 2015?
2) In addition to the #visits, have the authors explored how has the strategy of utilizing ED
and OBS impacted the length of stay on the readmit encounters or the days between all
encounters?
Thank you for the opportunity to review.
