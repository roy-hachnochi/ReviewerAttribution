Thank you very much for asking me to review this paper. I very much enjoyed reading it.
Well done.
I think there are some very minor changes that may be helpful but, I feel this would be a
great paper for publication and that readers, especially policy makers and improvement
leaders would be very interested in.
Comments for minor changes are:
1) I don't really want to be one of those reviews that says you didn't cite me nevertheless for this paper, I think it is very relevant. There is some further literature
about regulatory agencies and improvement, based on my research, which you may wish
to add or review. This may strengthen the paragraph entitled reflection and resilience
[Furnival et al; 2016; Emerging Hybridity... Journal of Healthcare Organisation and
Management & Furnival et al 2018; Assessing improvement capability... International
Journal of Quality and Safety in Healthcare]

On line 54 page 5, it needs to say 'merger' rather than 'merge'
Finally, at the beginning of the paper you talk about the aim of the partnership to develop
a culture of continuous improvement [opening box]- but at the end of the paper in the
final paragraph, you describe the 'development of a culture of improvement capability' are these the same or different? Would a little more consistency of language be of help?
I can't wait to see further research papers from this - I would be interested for example as
to what might be recommended for regulatory agencies to do in the future when
supporting improvement and how some of the challenges they face in doing so may be
overcome.
