This analysis provides a brief overview of antibiotic use and resistance in China.
Major comments:
1.
The manuscript is difficult to follow and would benefit from extensive editing by a
native English speaker.
2.
The claims that the national campaign was effective (figure 1) and the ZMDP was
not should be supported by formal testing, for example via interrupted time-series.
3.
The figures should be described better and the axes of the figures should be
labelled more clearly. Why is there a differences in the start year for the left and right part

of figure 1? Does the right figure include both out and inpatient data? It would be helpful if
the ‘interventions’ are added to the figure to quickly see what was implemented when.
4.
Moreover incidence (a rate) of infections cannot be expressed as percentage. The
percentage of samples that are resistant in figure 2 is also dependent on the incidence of
susceptible infections and possible changes in test rates. (Absence of) changes may be
entirely attributable to changes in susceptibility testing practices.
5.
References are missing for several sentences. E.g. page 3: ‘.. current problems of
irrational use of antibiotics are mainly in primary care and rural settings’. This sentence
really needs a reference to back up this statement. Additionally it is not always clear where
numbers come from; e.g. ‘… per person per year was as high as 138 g, which was 10
times that consumed in the United States’. This sentence references a non-previewed
opinion piece that also doesn’t make clear where the numbers do come from.
6.
The reason provided by the authors that the national campaign was more
successful (note that this sentence is missing something) is quite speculative.
7.
The potential solutions do not seem to add anything to the existing literature and
do come a bit out of the blue without providing any evidence of their (potential)
effectiveness or thoughts about how to design and implement these interventions. In
general I find it a bit difficult to see what this paper adds to the existing literature.

Minor:
1.
Page 1. 'China is facing two major challenges on antibiotic use'. The subsequent
challenges that are described (total antibiotic consumption & level inappropriate antibiotic
use) are strongly related to each other. I would describe this as one challenge.
2.
Abbreviations should be spelled out the first time they are used (MRSA, IRPA, IRKP
and IRAB).
