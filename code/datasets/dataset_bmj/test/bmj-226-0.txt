The authors have responded very positively to the reviewer comments. I have a few very
minor further points.
1. The term multivariate is used when it should be multivariable. Multivariate indicates
multiple outcomes, whereas here there is just one - the models are univariate
multivariable.
2. Looking at the confidence intervals for the spline curves, I'm puzzled that they don't
diverge at the extremes. In Figure 6 for example, the confidence limits for the left hand
curve segments are essentially linear, whereas I would expect them to splay out at the
ends in the way they do at the right end of the right hand curve. This arises due to
uncertainty in the slope.
However I'm not saying they're wrong, but do please check them.

3. The numerical presentation is generally compact, and accords with guidelines I've
published on the subject - https://adc.bmj.com/content/100/7/608. However percentages
are given in the text to one decimal place where whole numbers would be easier to read
and just as informative. In any case the percentages can often be calculated from the
numbers. Alternatively one can use two significant digits.
