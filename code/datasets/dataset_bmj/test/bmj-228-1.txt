This is an interesting article, with quite a lot of work and I agree with the authors that
incidence is a better measurement than prevalence. I have some comments which
hopefully can make the paper better.
Methods:
Please mention/describe the main inclusioncriteria in het methodsection in the text as well
as the reason why abstracts may not be included such as quality reasons etc. Authors
please predefine populations beforehand (European, Asian, American f.e.) like you did for
the agegroups
i think you could skip table 3 from the supplemental material and in the text page you can
leave this out. Page 10, approach 2
If the authors think, there could be publicationbias, please make a funnelplot when
possible.
Results:
Please mention the main reason why abstracts were not included also in the text.
Please mention the incidencerates/ incidence in the timeframeperiods, this before the
trends in diabetes and add incidencerates in table 1.
in my opinion it is not interesting to know how many of the populations were stable ,
increasing ofr decreasing, and how many not. Please describe in general in the text for the
timeperiods and predefined age groups
Discussion
Please add some numbers in the first part of the discussion. An incidence(rate) for now and
back then f.e.
Focus in the discussion mainly on the differences in thimeperiods, so you can save the
amount of words
So in general a paper with a potential, but quite a few comments. In genral I would try to
make the main paper more readable to state in the main paper what is the method, some
more numbers in the resultsession and summurize and state in the text. The table and or
figure is for more detail. Please make sure you have mentioned a reference to the

ADDITION-study (a screening study for type 2 diabetes and maybe the brisk walking stuy
(Praet) for prevention.
I would like to see a new version. Succes!
