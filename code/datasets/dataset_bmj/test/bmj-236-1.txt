The authors found that those with a history of stress at a childhood or young age are at
greatest risk for life threatening infections due to inflammatory reactions and gene
expression, but there is no information on inflammatory markers to support this. There is no
information on whether these patients received antibiotics to treat infections, or tranquilizers
and sedatives that are frequently prescribed for anxiety, insomnia and other stress related
complaints. The only information we have is that SSRI’s, “which are recommended for the
long-term (beyond one year) risk of life-threatening infections seemed attenuated by
persistent use of SSRIs during the first year after the diagnosis of stress-related disorders.”
No mention is made that these drugs are banned in those under 18 in the U.K. and other
countries because of increased suicides. Dr. Fang lists no conflicts of interest, but in a 2018
publication also co-authored with Dr. Sang, he reported income from Pfizer and AbbieVie.
Pfizer markets Zoloft (sertraline) an SSRI which was the most prescribed psychiatric drug in
the U.S. in 2016. AbbieVie manufactures drugs to treat certain infections. No reference was
made to a large body of literature linking various infections to myocardial infarction, stroke
and atherosclerosis. The data on siblings does not indicate whether they lived with or were in
close contact with those that were infected. The authors mined the information available to
them as much as possible, but it is not enough to draw any meaningful conclusions in my
opinion, and would reject this unless a revision addresses the caveats noted above.
