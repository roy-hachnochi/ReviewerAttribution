This is a well-designed clinical study. The authors' randomized, double-blind, controlled
clinical trial showed that antibiotics could not treat chronic low back pain with Modic
changes.
Since Stirling et al. reported the presence of low virulent bacteria in herniated intervertebral
discs, a large number of basic and clinical studies have reported very contradictory results.
Albert et al. reported shocking results in their randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical
trial. They treated a group of patients with low back pain and Modic changes with the
antibiotic amoxicillin, compared with the control group, and the RMDQ score decreased by
8.3 points.
Is intervertebral disc degeneration with Modic changes associated with bacterial infection? Is
it true or not? If true, it may radically change our understanding of degenerative disc
disease. If it is false, taking antibiotics in large quantities for a long time will bring great side
effects to patients. We, doctors and patients, may all thank the authors of this well-designed
clinical trial.
I have a few concerns about this manuscript:
1. Previous studies have suggested that disc degeneration with Modic type 1 changes is
associated with low virulent bacterial infections. Why should the low back pain patients with
Modic type 2 changes be observed as a group? After all, the long-term use of antibiotics can
have great side effects.
2. Amoxicillin has a characteristic odor that patients may feel and may have some effect on
double blindness. In addition, long-term amoxicillin treatment group patients will have
greater gastrointestinal reactions, especially experienced patients.
3. Which of the patients in the antibiotic treatment group and placebo control group used
NSAIDs? What is the impact on the results?

4. The discussion section needs to be strengthened. Authors should draw clear conclusions
around the current debate.
