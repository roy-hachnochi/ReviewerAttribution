Very good paper reporting the results of a meta-analysis about a hot topic.
The only one limitation of this study is that the authors did not analyze early
postoperative urinary symptoms such as urgency, or post-micturition pain: this factor
represents the main concern of some of the reported procedures. Tha authors stressed this
limitation in the discussion.
