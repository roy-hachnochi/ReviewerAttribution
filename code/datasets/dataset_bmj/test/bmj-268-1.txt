Overall Impressions
This paper compares the NHS across a number of health system metrics to other countries with similar
characteristics.
This paper may be of use to policymakers or patient advocacy groups for further discussion, but likely
has limited utility to patients and their carers. While the authors incorporate data from patient
organizations, the patient perspective could be improved. Perhaps the authors could have included data
(if available) on how patients believe the NHS could better accommodate their needs, or how patients
perceive the NHS relative to the health care systems of other countries.
Comments: Organization
1. Although the analyses are extensive, the authors may have benefitted from reducing the number of
metrics selected, as it can be perceived as cumbersome in some areas.

1. Although an extensive number of comparisons are made using descriptive statistics, the inclusion of
inferential statistics would be welcomed to assess significance. For example, is there a statistically
significant difference between life expectancy in the UK (81.2) in comparison to the mean (81.5 or 81.9;
two different values appear to be listed in the abstract and introduction respectively)?
2. A more in-depth discussion of recommendations would have been beneficial. For example, in the first
paragraph of the discussion, the authors could elaborate more on what investments could be made to
improve health service and population health outcomes.
3. In the discussion, the authors mentioned how the relative assessment may have changed with the
inclusion of countries such as Portugal, Spain, and Italy. Although acknowledged, this would be a
beneficial addition. In addition, as a number of countries are selected from the G12, conducting a
comparison among all G12 countries would increase the breadth of the analysis.
