Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to review this interesting article on the current
status of ESKD care in world countries and regions, according to the second iteration of the GKHA
(whereas the first iteration was published two years ago as JAMA 2017;317:1864-1881, their reference
13). The article is clearly written and easy to read and understand. The survey and analysis seem to be
in line with the prespecified plans (Kidney Int Suppl. 2017:7:145-153, their reference 15). Potential
weakness may be that the conclusions are similar between the first and second iterations. In other
words, the main conclusion of the current paper (i.e. there is significant variability of kidney care in the
world, and kidney care is relatively poor in developing countries) was already suggested in the first
iteration of the GKHA. Otherwise, I think this is very good work and would attract many readers.
I have some minor suggestions:
- In abstract, “Intervention” sounds weird, because this is an observational study.
- The results seem to be a bit long, although there may not be word limit in BMJ.
- In discussion, use of subheadings (such as “Strengths and limitation”, “Comparison with existing
literature” and “Clinical, policy, and research implications”) may be common in BMJ.
- “What is already known on this topic” and “What this study adds” may be too long, compared with
previously published articles in BMJ.
