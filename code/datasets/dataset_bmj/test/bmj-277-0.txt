Are the study's aims and the issue and questions that the paper addresses relevant and
important to you as a patient? Do you think it would be relevant to other patients like you?
What about carers?

Yes, the issue is relevant to patients and carers, although it's uncertain how much these
results would influence behavior: dissemination of findings in popular media associated
with increase participation in receptive arts by patients, carers, and institutions where
patients live.
Are there any areas that you find relevant as a patient or carer that are missing or should
be highlighted? It may be more relevant to assess active participation in the arts, as the
authors suggest, but the numbers would be much smaller and more difficult to assess.
Would the treatment, intervention studied, or guidance given work in practice? Is it
feasible? What challenges might patients face that should be considered? The interventions
are practical and feasible.
Are the outcomes that are being measured in the study or described in the paper the same
as the outcomes that are important to patients? Are there others that should have been
considered? Yes and no.
Do you have any suggestions that might help the author(s) strengthen their paper to make
it more useful for doctors to share and discuss with patients?
Define salutogenic from first use. Few lay people will understand this term.
If and how the level of patient involvement in the research described could have been
improved. Authors are now required to state if and how they involved patients in setting
the research agenda and the design and implementation of the study and include this
information in a box within the manuscript. If there was no patient involvement we would
welcome your ideas on how this could have been done. We hope this will help authors
think of the best ways to include patients in their future research and further progressive
patient involvement in the research enterprise.
The investigators could have included patients and carers in analysis of the data. They
could have also described how they were involved in formulating the study questions. No
mention was made of how these results will be disseminated beyond BMJ.
