The authors investigated the longitudinal association between arts engagement and
mortality in a survival analysis using data from an observational study (ELISA) linked to
national mortality data in the UK. They calculated hazard ratios comparing engagement
levels in arts (never, infrequently, frequently) and calculated percentage of protective
association explained by several covariates, including demographic, socioeconomic, and
health related variables. The authors concluded on an association between engagement in
arts and mortality, and on a potential protective effect of arts against mortality.
This study was carefully conducted and treats a question implicating many and various
interrelated variables. Despite of this difficulty, the authors made a great work in
disentangling the concepts and applying them with care. The authors cautiously selected
relevant variables to adjust for and used pertinent descriptive and causal inference
methods. Also, they used an appropriate language to describe their findings, and
concluded with caution on a potential causal relationship between engagement in arts and
mortality. Nevertheless, there is one major and several minor points to be addressed:

Major issue
1. p.13, Table 2: It is not clear whether the hazard models are hierarchical, i.e. whether
the mediators are progressively added to the first model (I guess not) or whether they are
analysed separately. For instance, does the hazard ratio of “0.74 (0.69-0.79)” for wealth
correspond to the model: “Basic model (age, gender) + education, occupational status &
employment status + wealth” or to the model: “Basic model (age, gender) + wealth”?
Also, it is not clear to me how the mediators are included in the analyses. Were the
mediators made of different variables separately, or were the mediators created as a
composite variable made from the different variables? For instance: “Mediator: +
education, occupational status & employment status”, were these three variables added as
separate variables in the model or composite variable created out of the three?
If they were added as separate variables, there may be some collinearity issues, which
bias the HRs and the PPAEs. I would suggest that the authors take this into account in
their analyses.
Minor issues
1. I would suggest to add some information on the description of the participants in the
methods section (p.5). I would suggest, for instance to mention, when the study (ELISA)
started, and what are the “waves” and when they took place. It is not clear if wave 2 is a
data collection wave, if wave 1 was the HSE, or if a wave is one recruitment wave among
several in the study.
2. I would suggest that the authors describe how the information listed on p.6, line 58 to
p.7, line 8 was collected: “age (in years), gender (male or female), […] total non-pension
wealth (quintiles) […] and occupational status (using the 5-item National Statistics
Socio-economic Classification)”. If the information was self-reported, this could be of
concern for the variable on “wealth”. If necessary, I would suggest that the author
comment on this point.
3. I would suggest that the authors state what kind of data linkage method was used
(deterministic or probabilistic).
4. I have several suggestions and comments on the definition of variables. First, I would
suggest to give some more precisions about “employment status”, this variable is
ambiguous, because “not working” can mean unemployed or retired, which has not the
same impact on both mortality and engagement in arts. Second, I would suggest to
replace “sedentary lifestyle” by “physical activity” (p.11, table 1) with the three levels of
activity stated in the method (p.9). Third, I am not quite sure to understand what “output
area” means, respectively what does “output” refer to.
5. p.9, table 1: I would suggest to add a measure of variability (95% confidence interval)
together with the p-value. I would also suggest that the authors mention what the
p-values stand for (trend?).
6. I would suggest three very minor edits: p.5 line 10: The abbreviation for the English
Longitudinal Study of Ageing was not introduced. I would suggest to change “[…] Study of
Ageing: a nationally[…] ” to “[…] Study of Ageing (ELISA): a nationally […]”.p.12, line 12:
the upper bound of the 95% confidence is missing for the E-value.
