Comments for editor and authors
The paper presents the results of a quasi-experimental study, pertaining to change in
calories purchases, following the implementation of compulsory calories labeling, in three US
States. The paper presents results based on longitudinal data over a period of about 150
weeks (pre/post implementation), and a total of about 50 million transactions in 139
restaurants. They used interrupted time series regression to obtain counter factual estimates
of pre/post changes in level and trends in calorie consumption. They performed sensitivity
analyses and also discussed calorie changes (level and trend) according to different types of
food items (entrees, sides etc.). They interpreted their results cautiously, with regard to the
small observed overall pre/post immediate decrease (and which does not last as such after 1
year follow) and taking into account the limitations of their study that they clearly
delineated.
Overall this is a very interesting study, seeking the answer to an important public health
policy question, a very well written paper, based on sound data and technically relevant
methodology. Beyond a few minor points that can be enhanced, my main remark is that the
paper would gain from some more “flesh on the bone”: indeed in its present state, it looks
very technical and/or results centered. Indeed (cf. the introduction and the very short
discussion), it could probably discuss more, for example: - the general context of the study
(e.g. how much is the calories decrease vs. average calorie intake in the population, what
could be the public health impact of such a decrease etc.), - other types of proposed labeling
which even of not entirely comparable also aim at curbing calorie intake (e.g. Nutri Score in
France/Europe, activity equivalent calorie labeling suggested by some authors) etc. Cf. also
detailed comments for authors below pertaining to minor issues (and to that latter general
issue in the comments pertaining to the discussion).
Title: should the title inform about the setting (that is the USA)?
Introduction
Line 73-75: Ok this is the precise context of the study, but this is one example of labeling
intervention in one country (there is a more global worldwide context of such type of
compulsory and/or voluntary labeling that could be briefly alluded to?)

Line 76-79: although this is not the main subject of the article, beyond calorie intake (which
is a mediating factor), there are long term goals pertaining more distal outcomes (curbing
obesity, diabetes etc.)? [cf. that this is alluded to line 87-89, but this is more general]
Line 81-87: calorie labeling is one type of labeling that could be used (e.g. “traffic light”
labeling proposed in France of the EU). Of course this is not the subject of the study but this
could be briefly alluded in the intro (and also discussed somewhat more in the discussion
section)?
Line 85: this is major (cf. in discussion)
Line 88-89: this objective pertaining to obesity should also be stated more generally at the
beginning of the intro
Methods
Very minor general remark - units for energy: it is understood that when not otherwise
specified a calorie is a kilo calories (and that is so in the labeling of products). Without
recommending the use of kJ (which is difficult to understand without converting to calories)
many scientific papers do use Kcal?
Line 118: this is a huge “sample” size so that even minute changes would likely result in
rejecting the null hypothesis. But the authors mainly discuss the overall estimates of
changes/trends, with few references to P-value and that is nice. In table 3 though, the Ps for
heterogeneity are also likely impacted by this “overpowering” of the study: so that even the
P=0.05 in the right left corner is probably not very meaningful?
Line 121-126: that means it is also possible to estimate changes in nutrient content beyond
calories and/or to estimate things such as diet quality scores etc.? Did the authors perform
such calculations? Or is it a path for further research? [This of course to be considered as
secondary analysis].
Line 149-153: limitations of these SES indicators could be dealt with in the discussion.
Line 155-162: it is not clear how the two parts of the model are connected/intertwined:
“time series” models usually account for some autocorrelation between measures on the
same statistical units at different points in time, with techniques specific to that field (e.g.
ARIMA etc.). Indeed this is also sometimes dealt with using random and/or mixed models (to
take into account autocorrelations). The authors also state that they used linear mixed
models. Please try to make this point clearer (it could also be useful, as for repeatability
purposes, that the authors give in a supplementary material document their detailed model
and/or the relevant SAS code).
Line 172-174: this rather belongs to another paragraph up above pertaining to different
sample sizes (or to beginning of result section)?
Line 174-179: we think that primary “impact” measures for assessment of the intervention
(pre/post change in level or trend), [or secondary criteria (one year after follow-up)], should
be more emphasized, delineated (instead of being listed in parentheses in between modeling
issues). We would recommend 1) explaining the models 2) defining the measures in a
separate sentence e.g. “The main criteria for assessment of the effect of the intervention
was x and x……”
Also it is to be noted that the authors used the term “impact” only once in the title,
throughout the manuscript they use the term “effect”. Should this be homogenized?
Results:
Line 225: is that a lot or not with reference to the average daily energy intake of the
population (=> discussion)?

Table 2 “beta” in the title of the table is not very readable, the precision regarding CI could
be in footnote of table. Also title is not 100% accurate (there are different information’s in
the table).
It could more readable and help understand the table if units were in the headings of the
columns (instead of the footnotes), e.g. calories/transaction etc. If that could simplify /
reduce the number of footnotes that should be nice

Column 2: 1160+74+201 does not sum to 1440 (likely because not all categories are listed
in the table). A footnote could explain this.
Figure 2: the scaling of the Y should be changed (origin around 1000 or even 500) so that
the shift is more emphasized (event if some data points are outside the range), as in
supplementary figure 1. Need for a legend for the different symbols and lines (as in
supplementary figure 1). Line showing holiday and seasonal effects (as in supp. Fig 1, Panel
B) could be added e.g. as dotted line.
Supplementary figure 1: Could be removed as information could be integrated in figure 2
(Panel B: cf. remark above for Y scaling). Panel B: cf. above also regarding
seasonal/holidays effects.
Line 238-239: could this be tested “formally” (e.g. P-value)? As for values of estimates it
would seem that there are more that “slight differences” (line 238)? Ok, absolute changes
are not very different (as all are small), but in the context where the overall change is also in
absolute quite small, these changes differ somewhat by categories (e.g. null for SSBs, vs.
others for level change, positive change for sides vs negative for other categories for other
categories).
Line 252: cf. above regarding interpretation of P-values.
Discussion
Line 266 (end) and 267: “were still small” (does this pertain to differences between
categories). If pertains to overall changes may be more relevant in previous sentence?
Interpreting changes in “level” is straightforward but what about trends?
Although a “trend” in calories/transaction is simple to understand from a modeling point of
view (that is some sort of slope), it is more difficult to understand in the context. Why do
calories/transaction increase (more or less according to pre/post and or categories)? What
does this mean? What are possible explanations? [This is general and not necessarily
related to the intervention itself]. Is it because people eat more and more outside the home?
Because one get more and more calories/monetary unit? Etc.? One could have imagined a
“flat” slope in the pre period then some sort of positive catch-up slope in the post period (to
get back to or close to the pre intervention level after some time). Of course that is not so,
and that underlines the relevance of the counterfactual modeling not only for pres vs.post
level but also for slopes. But beyond technicalities, there is a need for understanding more
from a nutrition point of view what this slopes means (especially the pre period slope).
Line 272-274: very important point. Would there be any way to generate at least a coarse
estimate of the number of customers / transaction? Anyway, what about the average calorie
intake/day/person in this population (that would help put in perspective the calories /
changes in the study even without subject level data?)
With reference to comment above about line 85, i.e. population level effects on calorie intake
and thus obesity and NCDs reduction, how important are the observed effects from a public
health point of view?
Line 294-305. Ok. But this type of labeling is only one of possible labeling interventions that
have been tested (or envisioned) in other countries? How does this compare (even if not
entirely comparable from a technical point of view)?
Generally discussion stays quite close to the data and that is to the credit of the authors not
to overgeneralize their results. But the reader would maybe like to understand more the
context, the issues, the bigger picture in which this (very impressive) study fits.
