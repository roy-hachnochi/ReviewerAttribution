It might be helpful to include further specifications as to which VR exercises were used and in which
patients. I understand that these were individually tailored, but information relating to how this
variability affected experimental control conditions would be helpful. This would also likely help to make
the paper more relevant to patient practice.
Further information on patient qualities would be helpful. Gender disparities in the experimental groups
are mentioned. How might these have affected outcomes?
