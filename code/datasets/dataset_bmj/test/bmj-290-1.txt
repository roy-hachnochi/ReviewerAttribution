Thank you for the kind invitation to review this interesting, important and well executed study. I have no
major comments and anticipate that the BMJ readership will find great pleasure in, and use of this
manuscript, should it be accepted and published in the BMJ.
Minor comments:
Abstract page 2 row 38: Define ”impairment”
Abstract page 2+3 results: No need to report both 3 and 6 months outcome, just state e.g. ”The findings
were similar at X months”
Section 2 page 3 “What this study adds”: Add “with or without physiotherapist…”
Introduction, page 5: What was the research team’s hypothesis regarding this study? I.e. did they
expect better performance of the guided VR vs unguided or did they expect similar results?
Outcomes, page 9, row 40: A three way question is not dichotomous
Page 10, line 3: How were data on AEs collected?
General:

The guided VR scheme did not seem to increase treatment adherence much. Do the authors want to
speculate why so?
Please dive a bit further into the issue of generalizability in the discussion. There was a very high
percentage who didn’t even respond to the invitation. Could there have been a selection bias leading to
inclusion of well motivated patients with a high probability to respond to the intervention? What does
this say about the method’s potential to be of help for those who were not included? How does this
impact generalizability? Is this form of rehabilitation feasible in non-selected GP patient cohorts?
