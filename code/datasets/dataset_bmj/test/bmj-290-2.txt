This paper reports a study of the effectiveness of internet-based vestibular rehabilitation in the primary
care population. The authors have in earlier studies demonstrated their expertise in this field, and
conducted in this study a three-armed trial comparing the internet rehabilitation to ‘usual care’. ‘Usual
care’ was defined in accordance with the Dutch College of GPs guideline ‘Dizziness’.
The paper is scientifically sound and presents clinically relevant finings. Due to its ‘pragmatic’ design, it
is possible to translate the findings to daily primary care.
I have a number of points:
1. Randomization took place on the level of individual patients. As a consequence, GPs could have
patients allocated to different interventions, with the risk of ‘spill-over’ of the intervention condition to
patients in the control/usual care. Did the authors take measures to avoid this? How often were patients
from the same practice included, anyway? And in general – could patients on their own initiative access

through the internet rehabilitation programmes with instructions for exercises, outside the study
protocol?
2. The authors refer to the Dutch College of GPs guideline ‘Dizziness’ as condition of usual care. This is
logical given the status and authority of the Dutch College of GPs guidelines. But to what extent was the
actual performance of the GPs in patients in the control condition in line with the guideline ‘Dizziness’?
In the introduction I miss reference to the generally proposed interventions for dizziness/vestibular
problems, other than exercise treatment.
3. For implementation of the study findings, it is important to clarify how well the study population
resembles ‘the’ primary care population with dizziness/vestibular problems. The authors excluded
patients with ‘serious’ comorbidity – what was ‘serious’ in the context of this study and what were the
reasons to apply this in a pragmatic study design? And despite the inevitable selection and exclusion
that took place: how well did the study group in the end compare to the usual primary care population
with dizziness/vestibular problems? From the Dutch general practice registrations (Nijmegen Continuous
Morbidity Registration/NIVEL National Studies) the composition of this population in terms of sex, age,
comorbidity is well documented and available for comparison. This would further substantiate the
relevance of the study findings for primary care.
4. The intervention was based on an English protocol, translated to Dutch. Did the authors check that
the Dutch version had the same meaning and operated equal to the original English version?

5. The authors assess the differences between intervention and control condition in terms of statistical
significance and clinical relevance. For this, the level of 3 points on their questionnaire was used. It
would be helpful to provide a bit more information on this: what represents – in terms of well-being,
functional status or days without symptoms this difference? Is there a publication to refer to?
6. For clinical understanding of the effects of the intervention I would welcome a bit more clarity of how
patients under the usual care, guided and unguided internet rehabilitation improved from their baseline
status. What is – as a comparison – the natural history and how many patients would have become free
of symptoms without any intervention?

7. Patients in the unguided internet intervention condition received e-mail reminders. In other words,
there was (some) guidance, and ‘unguided’ is not exactly the correct description of the intervention.
8. What were serious side effects and what side effects could have been expected from the proposed
interventions?
