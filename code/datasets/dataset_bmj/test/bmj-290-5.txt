Vertigo has major impacts on the wellbeing of patients, especially in the old. Rehabilitation - or more
generally speaking - activity is of the utmost importance. Thus, I really welcome this study and the
conclusions and protocol of the study is quite straight.
some minor points:
1. an "and" is missing page 3 (first sentence under heading 2) unguided guided intervention
2. there is a bias, the responder rate is very low, thus only pateints who want to change something or
highly motivated patients will participate (nevertheless, the conclusion are the same, that patients may
improve, but it may not be suited for all)
3. anxiety is one the most debilitating symptoms in vertigo patients, thus when looking at results of
GAD7 this underscore the importance of anxiety and vestibular disorders - this should be more worked
out in the manuscript
4. very important: is there an age-dependend effect - will effects increase or decrease with age?
5. most important: are there any co-medication (for anxiety?),
6. it is mentioned in the manuscript - but still it is a limitation, that may not be solved - which diagnosis
were included? what is about neuritis vestibularis - do they need the same procedure than patients with
migraine or BPPV
7 test are very subjective, it would be nice to have an objective cliincal assessment by physicians nevertheless, the main aim that patients will improve remains, but is anxiety that drive amelioration or
clinical relevant improvements
