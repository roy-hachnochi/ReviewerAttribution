Vertigo is a complex subject and treatment options are limited. It is my experience that most ENTs and
GPs tend to resort to pharmacological treatment as the primary course. Due to the complex nature of
anatomical pathways, physiological (and pathological) processes physicians find it unrewarding to treat
such patients.In my experience at least in the India vestibular rehabilitation is a scarcely used as
primary mode of treatment or as an adjunct to pharmacological modalities.
The study is well designed and highlights the role of guided or unguided vestibular rehabilitation (V) in
patients of chronic vertigo. How ever the term 'chronic vertigo' has not been adequately explained.
What does this term entails in terms of diagnosis or differential diagnosis. What is the break up of
various diseases that were included in the above said term. What treatment these patients received
when they were initially diagnosed and how did they respond to it.
Personally I will prefer that the authors explain this point before further review may be performed.
