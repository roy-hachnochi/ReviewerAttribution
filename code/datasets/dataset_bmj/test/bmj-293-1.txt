Dear authors,
I review your manuscript as a patient with atopic dermatitis who is also a patient advocate
in that field. I am also very multi-morbid (hiv positive, cardiomyopathy, cornea disease).
Your manuscript entails a systematic review and guide with regard to methods of
measuring multimorbidity in community and population studies.
On the manuscript itself I have no comments to make. It is well and clearly written, and
the message from the manuscript is simple and clear. So, in that regard I find the
manuscript quite lengthy. Maybe some parts could be in an online supplement, whilst
keeping the essentials in the article itself? But, that can also be a matter of taste, and not
up to me.
I wish the authors best of luck with their manuscript.
With highest regards,

Bernd Arents
