This is the most cogent, persuasive and balanced presentation of this controversial issue
that I have ever read and I have no suggestions for revision. The focus on primary (not
secondary) prevention provides clarity to the discussion. The sections on side effects and
the need for data sharing make the points briefly, without detracting from other elements
of the discussion.
My only minor comments are that (1) Reference 14 (which is quite interesting) should
have the weblink indicated and (2) a simple graphic to show the difference between
absolute and relative risk would enhance the article (and be eminently tweet-able). For
example, graphing 10 year risk on the vertical axis for the 45 woman and 65 year old man
in the example, with points for with and without statin therapy would show the absolute
reduction as a short and long arrow. The relative risk could be added as text next to each
arrow. Or a more complex graph showing 10-year risk with and without statin therapy
with the x-axis being baseline risk might be considered.
Hope these comments are helpful, Catherine Otto
