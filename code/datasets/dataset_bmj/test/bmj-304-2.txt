Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. It is an interesting perspective and one that is not
often in the literature. I do, though, have a few thoughts and suggestions for ways to improve the
manuscript:
-I find it someone difficult to follow temporally. Paper goes back and forth between 2014 events and
later analyses. Suggest authors do a careful read and clearly delineate timelines.
-Regarding the World Health Survey- can the authors capture the exact language in the survey?
-In ‘populations impacted’ line 15 on sub-population marginalization. This is an important statement,
but can it be backed with evidence? The authors go directly into the example of Liberia, but the previous
statement is more general.
-In the discussion of distrust, how is that measured?
Page 4, line 24. 9.6% of GDP would be more meaningful with a number to compare it to
Page 4, line 28- evidence base for people choosing to forgo care, even when available?
Page 4, line 51, need to define HICs
Page 4, line 45, suggest not using ‘pandemic’ for the West Africa outbreak
Page 5, line 13- is this quote in relation to West Africa or North Kivu?
Page 8 line 4-6: You jumped again to DRC. It will be easier to follow if you are more explicit about
what outbreak you are referring to. Also, can you cite evidence for India and China?
Page 8: looking forward- this summarizes why you had the sections you do above, but would be helpful
to have a more explicit pathway presented at the start.
Page 8: Suggest that the suggestions are more explicit. Who should routinely assess distrust? How
should they do it? When? And how would it feed back into decision making?
Box 2: Where are the citations for this? Based on author knowledge? Should this be a box or integrated
into the paper?

Table 1- if this has been presented elsewhere, (NASEM report), is it critical to show it here as well, or
can it just be cited?
Box 3- first person account- make clear that this is from one of the authors. How will the box be
presented with the rest of the paper? The accounts are powerful, but don’t seem to fit all that well with
the rest of the academic paper. Defer to editors, but may want to reconsider how these are presented.
