This is a much improved version of this manuscript which is of a standard suitable for
publication. My very minor outstanding comments are as below:
Abstract: the term 'statistical life' is unclear
p4. 'What this study adds' point 3 - 'achievable amounts of PM' is unclear - I can
understand using the term 'achievable' in the context of reduction but in regard to an
increase it is difficult to understand.
p9. Statistical analysis - please change racial composition of the ZIP code to 'area-level
measure of ethnicity'
p11. 'The economic costs of the annual increase of deaths at discharge was calculated' please change to 'were' calculated
p13. The approach to patient engagement with regard to the research findings seems very
limited in scope. Presumably there are Medicare organisations providing patient
representation which could be consulted upon with regard to the selected outcome
measures? It would also be helpful to specifically disseminate findings to this audience via
appropriate mechanisms.
General: The authors have referred to the WHO air quality guideline currently being
reviewed with the date of expected publication in 2020. It would be helpful to also refer to
the risks arising from long-term exposure in combination with short-term exposure as a
composite risk factor which although not directly the focus of this research article are
relevant in development of this guidance (and interpretation of findings).
