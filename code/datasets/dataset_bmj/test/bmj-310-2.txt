I really appreciated the revised paper by Wei and colleagues, as I appreciated the first
version.
However, I have to confess that the changes for responding to all the comments in some
cases made heavier the reading. I suggest synthesizing the text, without compromising the
information.
Here follow minor suggestions:
Title I would delete “cause-specific”
In the abstract, I suggest to report the results by the two categories of causes (rarely
studied / previously studied) as done in the paper, or at least to state the impact of rarely
studied conditions on the results.
Page 5 - Lines 2-9 (Introduction): I suggest to explain what PM2.5 is and why it is
considered more toxic than PM10 or coarse in one sentence (3-4 lines).
Page 8 – Lines 21-22 + Page 9- Lines 1-2: I think it is enough to state the limitation on
exposure assessment in the discussion (Page 19, lines 7-9), and that it is not useful to
raise the point in the method section.
Page 18 – Lines 3-4 I would delete the sentence on Bonferroni correction here.
Supplemental material. There are typos in the appendix Figure S2 and S3 “relatiev
increase”
