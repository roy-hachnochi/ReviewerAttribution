Thanks for giving me the opportunity to review this paper. I would like to compliment the
authors for the completion of this study. They performed a high-quality RCT with high
relevance for practitioners treating MSK conditions. This study researched the effects of
Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) injections in non-surgically treated patients with acute Achilles
tendon rupture, compared to a placebo injection. The main finding is that muscle-tendon
function is not improved more in patients who received PRP injection versus patients who
received a placebo injection. These results can be used by clinicians in their consideration to
refrain from injecting PRP in patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture. However, I have a
number of remarks and suggestions for improvement of the manuscript, mainly about the
description of the methodology and presentation of data. Below I will give my detailed
remarks:
General comments:
- Please describe all items in a consistent order in the text. This provides structure and
improves readability. Make sure all mentioned outcomes are described in methods (including
statistical analysis), results and discussion.
- Abstract: please follow the advised structure (Objectives, Methods, Results and Conclusion)
and maximum words.

- The added study protocol was of 24-07-2017, which is after the study started. Eligibility
criteria changed around May 2016; can the authors explain in the manuscript which eligibility
criteria were changed and why?
- Please be consistent in nomenclature (.e.g. placebo or imitation injection) and order of
outcomes.
- When a test or analysis is supported by or elaborated in a table, figure or supplementary
file, please mention this in the body of the text.
- There is a lot of information that decreases readability of the manuscript. While it is
important to prevent selective reporting, I think this study can easily be divided into two
different manuscripts. If the authors would choose to decrease the number of presented
outcome measures for this manuscript, they should be very explicit about this and explain
the choices made. If you would summarize the most important results briefly to a general
practitioner, what would you mention?
Specific comments:
Abstract:
This manuscript describes one primary outcome and many secondary outcomes. As it is
difficult to describe the methods, analyses, results and conclusions of all these outcomes, I
would suggest to select the most important outcomes and describe these.
- Pg 3, line 29-36: Why sum up almost all contraindications? I suggest to display the most
important eligibility criteria (e.g. rupture within preceding 12 days, ability to walk
pre-injury).
- Please elaborate the study methods: when was the injection given, what is the placebo
(saline or dry needling?), what is standard rehabilitation care, which statistical analyses are
used for the data that is presented in the abstract?
- Pg 3, line 49: As not everyone is familiar with these specific tests (LSI and HRET), I
suggest describing these tests in a few words.
- Pg 3, line 52: Patient-reported function and Quality of life: were these domains based on a
specific (and validated) questionnaire? As stated above, the abstract can be improved when
it would be more focused on the most important outcomes.
- Pg 4, line 3: Number of included patients is not explicitly mentioned in the results section
(while this is the largest study in this field so far!). Suggestion: ‘A total of 230 patients were
included, with an average of 46 years old and 25% were female.
- Pg 4, line 8: advice to abbreviate Platelet rich plasma in PRP
- Pg 4, line 8: What is a ‘good quality’ of PRP and what is the ‘expected growth factor
content’? Again, it will be hard to explain this all in the abstract and the authors will have to
make decisions about what is important to display in the abstract and what is not (secondary
outcome).
- Pg 4, line 12-15: I would suggest to describe the means of LSI outcomes in both groups
first and after that the mean difference with 95%CI.
- Pg 4, line 17: The results do not seem to be based on ITT. It is, from the abstract, however
not clear which method is used. Please specify.
- Pg 4, line 24: : Is patient-reported recovery same as patient-reported function? Again, it is
important to use specific and consistent terminology.
- Pg 4, line 26-29: Soft-tissue injuries: I’d be careful in extrapolating the results to all
soft-tissue injuries. This study is about acute Achilles tendon ruptures, so please describe
conclusions for this patient group. Potentially, the results could be the same for acute tendon
injuries on other locations (e.g. cuff of proximal hamstring). This is – however – something
that could be described in the discussion and not in the conclusion, as it is speculative.
Introduction:
The introduction is lacking structure in this form. I suggest starting with the description of
Achilles tendon ruptures and why it is a problem. Next, explain why PRP might work. End
this paragraph with the ‘gap of knowledge’: apparently efficacy remains uncertain. The last
paragraph should describe aims of this study.
Specific comments:
- Pg 4, line 24-30: Isn’t the main problem of the majority of these 37 PRP studies that there
are multiple forms of bias? I suggest to mention this explicitly. I am also missing brief

information about the PRP studies that have been performed in the Achilles region. This
helps the reader to gain knowledge about what already has been done (and this will assist to
display the ‘gap of knowledge’!)
- Pg 5, line 35: Terminology that can be improved: The Achilles: the Achilles tendon
- Pg 4, line 38-40: Terminology that can be improved: Weight-bearing activities that load
the tendon: tendon loading activities.
Methods:
I suggest to change the order of the methods section to improve readability. Explain the
study design, followed by patients, which underwent a certain procedure. This leads to the
next paragraph: randomization. Describe the outcome measures and their corresponding
tests, time points and questionnaires. End the method with statistical analysis, in which all
performed analyses are described.
Specific comments:
- Pg 6, line 7-13: Please mention whether there is medical ethics approval for this study.
- Pg 6, line 7-13: Where was the patient included? Emergency department, orthopaedic
department?
- Pg 6, line 19-22: ‘… Who had an acute Achilles tendon rupture within 12 days of rupture’:
do you mean they ruptured their Achilles tendon 12 days after injury, or that patients
presented themselves within 12 days after Achilles tendon rupture? Please be as specific as
possible.
- In the supplementary file, it is mentioned that inclusion criteria changed after May 2016.
Why was this done? I suggest to explicitly mention protocol deviations and their reasons.
- Pg 6, line 19-20: What was the definition for Achilles tendon rupture? Who diagnosed the
patient? Was imaging needed to diagnose it and if so, which modality was used?
- Pg 6, line 24-27: Patients were excluded if they had an insertional tendon injury or injury
at the musculotendinous junction; how was this ruled out? What was the exact definition of
an insertional rupture and rupture of the MTJ?
- Pg 6, line 42-52: Please include more information about the randomization process. How
was randomization performed in practice? Where researchers or physicians involved in the
patient care also involved in allocation or was this performed by a person (or software
created by an individual) of the OCTRU? Please be specific about this, at it is important
information to ensure allocation concealment. Was block randomisation performed?
- Pg 7, line 12-29: The differences in procedures (amount of venous blood withdrawn) might
have affected the blinding of patients (which is acknowledged by the authors). How was this
communicated to the patients? Usually, patients have to be informed very explicitly about
the procedures and also about the amount of blood withdrawn. Was this needed according to
the medical ethics commission or not? Please describe specifically whether patients knew
about the amount of blood that was going to be withdrawn. If they did, it is more likely that
this might have had affected blinding.
- Pg 7, line 33-36: Which medical specialty did the individuals have that performed
injections? How experienced were these clinicians?
- Pg 7, line 33-38: Was the injection clinically guided or was imaging used? A gap can be
large, so could the authors more specifically mention where the injection was aimed at? Was
a specific injection technique used to ensure spreading of the injected fluid within the gap?
- Pg 7, line 37-38: Were the syringes blinded?
- Pg 8, line 35-38: Measuring growth factor content can be variable. It is for example
depended on the amount of activation of platelets (and thus the time between PRP
preparation and analysis of PRP and also whether PRP was frozen before analysis, which
activates platelets). Please provide more information on handling of PRP before analysis is
this will gain insight on whether the results are reproducible.
- Pg 8, line 49-50: Face-to-face or by telephone: who communicated with these patients?
- Pg 8, line 47: What is included in these follow-up questionnaires? Please elaborate.
- Pg 8, line 54-57: Please explain HRET directly after its introduction. The hypothesis of PRP
working mechanisms should be mentioned at the end of the introduction.
- Pg 9, line 15: LSI: please elaborate the definition of injured/uninjured limb measurement.

- Who reviewed the assessment videos? Please provide initials. Furthermore, what were
criteria for an ‘invalid recording’?
- Pg 9, line 29-32: Pain scores from the ATRS: according to my knowledge, there is no pain
score in this questionnaire. This questionnaire asks whether the patient is limited because of
pain in the calf/Achilles tendon/foot (Nilson-Helander et al, 2007). Please be specific about
this description.
- Pg 9, line 27-42: At which time points were the secondary outcomes measured?
- Pg 10, line 7-24: Masking: please describe this under ‘intervention’.
- Pg 10, line 30-31: DMEC: first write the full name before giving the abbreviation.
- Pg 10, line 51-54: How was the data tested for normality? Which test was performed when
data was not normally distributed?
- Pg 11, line 33-36: What was the cut-off for PRP that ‘did not concentrate platelets
compared to their whole blood’?
- Pg 11, line 44-47: Which variables were ‘stratification variables and pre-defined prognostic
variables’? Based on which data or study?
- Pg 12, line 5-6: What was as the definition for success of masking?
- Pg 12, line 21-43: Patient and public involvement: I suggest to shorten this paragraph.
Results:
Specific comments:
- Pg 15, line 8-13: Figure 2 stated the reasons for receiving placebo injection while the
patient was allocated to the intervention group. One patient did not attend and 5 had
unsuccessful venesection. Reasons for not meeting eligibility criteria (Table S1) were
inadequate venous access for drawing blood. Should these patients be excluded based on
this criterion?
- Pg 15, line 21-34: Prepared PRP: not everyone knows which PRP concentration values are
regarded as ‘optimum’. What do these values mean? What is normal?
- Pg 15, 37-45: Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis: this isn’t mentioned in the methods.
Was this part of the trial or strictly usual care per hospital?
- Pg 15, line 49 – pg 16, line 15: Please use consistent nomenclature. Choose either mean
(SD) or mean+SD.
- Pg 15, line 58-59: Post hoc analysis: this is not described in statistical analysis.
- Pg 15, line 10-15: A number of GF concentrations are presented in the second paragraph,
but it will be hard for readers to estimate its value. Is it possible to show this in a figure or to
display it as a percentage change from whole blood to PRP concentrate?
- Pg 18, line 32-37: As HRET is your primary outcome, please describe this outcome after
baseline characteristics.
- Pg 16, line 10-15: Table 3 shows that VEGF did correlate with work LSI, but in the fore-last
paragraph of the results it is mentioned that GF concentrations did not. What is true?
Furthermore, is it possible to analyze this in a regression model and to include multiple
potentially influencing PRP-related factors in the model? This data are interesting and not so
many studies are large enough to make correlations.
Discussion:
Specific comments:
- Pg 20, line 5-10: As this is the largest RCT studying the effects of PRP, I suggest to
emphasize this.
- Pg 20, line 28-31: a functional outcome measure is chosen as primary outcome. It is –
however – questionable whether this is more important than a validated patient-reported
outcome (like the ATRS). The ATRS has the ability to measure true impact on patient’s daily
life and is therefore very useful. Furthermore, other factors might influence the outcome of
the HRET (calf muscle condition, activity level, motivation of the patient), which are not
directly related to the satisfaction of the patient. Please provide a more balanced decision
making on outcome measures (pro’s and con’s).
- Pg 20, line 33-36: This is the first time patient-reported recovery is mentioned. How is this
measured in this domain?

- Pg 20-22: Many of the secondary outcome measures are not mentioned in the discussion.
How do these outcomes compare to other studies?
- Pg 21, line 10-20: Strengths and limitation: the first strength that your study has is the
large number of inclusions. I suggest starting with this instead of PRP analysis.
- Pg 21, line 24-52: Elaboration on PRP: I suggest moving this from strengths and limitations
to the general discussion. Furthermore, this part of the discussion is mainly about platelets
and leukocytes, while the results are more focused on GF content and relation with outcome.
I would expect more information in discussion about GF content or my suggestion would be
to have more balance in presented results and elements discussed.
- Pg 22, 12-18: Time-to-weight bearing and referral rates are not described in the methods.
Conclusion:
- Pg 22, line 28-34: Soft-tissue injuries: I’d be careful in extrapolating the results to all
soft-tissue injuries. This study is about acute Achilles tendon ruptures, so please describe
conclusions for this patient group.
Figure 2:
- Both groups are described as allocated to intervention.
Table 1:
- C and D: the range of these values do not match the explanation.
- Number of comorbidities: this isn’t written in the methods.
Table 2:
- What is PLT-F?
Table 4:
- A large portion of adverse events is described under ‘other problem’ (107). As this is such
a large number compared to the other options, it makes me wonder which other problems
were reported. Perhaps one event description was missing from your adverse events?
Figure S3:
- How can the mean pre-injury score be higher than the baseline score of the mental
component score and physical component score?
Table S2:
- Please use placebo injection instead of imitation injection.
It was a pleasure to read this manuscript. Despite my critical comments, I would like to
encourage the authors to revise the manuscript.
