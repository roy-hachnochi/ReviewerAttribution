This is an important study that highlights the need to look at multiple sources of data when interpreting
trends that could be affected by changes in data quality or systems over time. This triangulation of data
sources has also been effective in other settings, e.g. child maltreatment (see, e.g. Roehrkasse et al.
Administrative data and long-term trends in child maltreatment: the prospects and pitfalls. The Lancet
Public Health, Volume 4, Issue 3, e121 - e122).
I have a few suggestions, the main one being that there should be a little more recognition of the
potential pitfalls in using administrative hospital / mortality data to look at trends (where differences in
recording over time can also occur, e.g. in response to changing guidelines e.g. QOF). In addition to the
critique of the police data, the limitations of the hospital and mortality data used in this study should
also be discussed.
Box 1 states that there is typically a delay between death and registration of 5 days. In fact, only around
40% of deaths are registered within 5 days, and around 4% of deaths are registered the year after the
death occurred. Only 7.1% of deaths to external causes of morbidity and mortality were registered
within five days of the death in 2016
(https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodolog
ies/impactofregistrationdelaysonmortalitystatistics2016). This should be discussed, in light of the
reliability of the mortality data and the difference late registration might make to results.
Was the HES data restricted to Admitted Patient Care? From Figure 1a, this seems to be the case, but
this is not clear in Box 1 which mentioned appointments and attendances. I would question whether it is
appropriate to include elective admissions in these estimates. It might be helpful to say that diagnoses
aren’t historically recorded with accuracy in HES A&E data.
Please be specific about what you mean by ‘rate’, e.g. in Figure 1a. Could there have been double
counting of events if someone was re-admitted more than once following the same event?
Further to the above comment, the text states that “HES suggest 0.086 per 1000 population are
admitted to hospital each year”. Again this implies that you are counting people rather than admissions,
was this the case? Please be explicit about the unit of analysis within HES.

Is it possible to tell whether the increase in homicides by knife since 2014 was offset by reductions in
homicides by other means?
The text mentions that “stalking and harassment” is now included in the definition of violent crime.
Crimes like this are less likely to result in death, hospital admission, or A&E. This is a limitation of the
data presented and there should be some discussion of this – that a limitation of this analysis is that we
cannot infer anything about trends in other forms of violent crime.
Figure 2 – be more precise in what the ratio represents (is this a ratio of rates or of numbers?) What
exactly is the comparable subset that is being compared? It would be helpful to give some figures here,
e.g. how many crimes in each source for at least some of the years.
Figure 3 axis states ‘hospital attendances’ but the figure caption describes this more specifically as A&E
attendances. Please be consistent and state the data source.
