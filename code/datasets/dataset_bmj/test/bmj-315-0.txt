This is a clever idea that examines an important problem. The analysis appears to have been well
planned and executed. The authors considered the important confounder of an imbalance in genders
across fields. There were some sensible sensitivity analyses. The authors could definitely use “novel” in
their abstract!

The difference between genders was small on an absolute scale. However, any association is interesting,
because it confirms that this is a viable pathway for explaining some of the large discrepancy in careers,
and similar differences might also exist in talks, jobs applications, CVs, etc.
The discussion talks about a disadvantage for women because of their more cautious use of language.
However, this could be reversed, as a more cautious use could well be more scientifically sound,
especially for results that are novel and have yet to be replicated. The argument could be framed as
men needing to be more cautious and for them to catch-up with women. There is a growing scrutiny of
the past literature (including papers like this one) and a growing understanding of spin. We should be
careful of using language that may encourage women (or men) to do the wrong thing in order to benefit
their career.
The authors looked at a binary response of any positive word in the abstract. Why not examine a count
of the number of positive words per abstract? Perhaps the Poisson assumption of independent
observations is violated, but more positive words could plausibly create a stronger reaction in readers,
so a model looking at counts seems reasonable.
The authors did not control for the number of words in the abstract. If men tend to write longer
abstracts, then part of the effect may simply be the use of more words. Conversely if men write shorter
abstracts, then the observed effect will be even stronger on a per-word scale.
Minor comments
- Table 1. 1 decimal place for percents should be fine, and could be integers for those over 10%
- Page 7, it would be useful to compare the characteristics of articles with and without missing author
gender, as this is a potential source of bias
- Page 12, line 20, statistical significance is not a good criteria for importance. It wasn’t clear if the
results in this paragraph were the adjusted ones.
- The association between positive words in the abstract and subsequent citation counts was examined
using linear regression. The large sample size may mean this approach is fine, but the large number of
zeros could mean that a better approach is a Poisson regression model. The residuals of the linear model
should be checked for skew and outliers.
