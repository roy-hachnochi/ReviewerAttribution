P8 Box 1 - The after negotiation column appears to shift outcomes to imply less serious outcomes.
The inclusion of ‘placebo’ implies a degree of normality (a subtle alteration but persuasive on an
unconscious level.) Could be construed as manipulative.
P9 lines174-181. 104 weeks of treatment is neither here nor there in terms of life-long treatment.
Misleading.
I agree entirely with the conclusion. Prescriber AND patient should be made aware of risks and side
effects without delay - the patient particularly since it is he/she who must live with the consequences
of misinformation and therefore needs to make a properly informed choice and offered alternative
drug free treatments/lifestyle choices. (Though I realise that that is outside the remit of this review)
