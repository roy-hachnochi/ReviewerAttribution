This paper has been revised to address many of the points raised by the editors and the
reviewers. Just a few issues remain.

1. A more structured and informative Abstract is presented.

2. A clearer and more detailed explanation of the statistical modelling process is given and
a more comprehensive presentation of the associated p-values is provided.

3. The multivariable analyses now include extra covariates, that is, family history of cancer
and cardiovascular disease (see footnote to Tables 2 and 3). However, these covariates
also need to be added to the list of covariates reported in the text in the Statistical
Analysis section (Page 7).

4. Sensitivity analyses have been added, which include stratified analyses relating to
various types of modifying factors, and the use of a time-varying dairy intake updated
every 4 years. The latter analysis is reported to show no association between dairy intake
and total mortality, cancer mortality or CVD. This result does differ from that obtained
using cumulative average of dairy intake. Hence I would suggest some mention is
warranted here about the associations between food consumption and mortality being
dependent on the way in which food consumption is measured.

5. In Tables 2 and 3 a large number of p-values are presented. The problem of multiple
testing, the effect on the overall significance level , and the impact on the interpretation of
the results here should be acknowledged.
