Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. In this essay, the authors
provide a narrative review of structural drivers of gender inequality and health disparities,
focusing primarily on the outcomes of sexual & reproductive health and also focusing
primarily on 4 mechanistic channels: assets, labour force participation, and political
participation. I understand that there are obvious length considerations given that this
appears to be some sort of invited essay, but at points the authors' focal issues seem a bit
arbitrary. For example, in the discussion of asset disparities as a driver of gender
inequality, the authors choose to focus on food insecurity. I recognize that food insecurity
is an important explanation for the gendered patterning we observe across a wide range
of health outcomes, but is it more important than, say, the gender-unequal laws
governing land ownership and asset inheritance in many countries? Questions like these
tend to drag down the extent to which the essay as a whole is persuasive. Perhaps an
alternative front end, differently framed, might make these arbitrary decisions about focus
seem less arbitrary.
I offer the following additional comments:
1. Paragraph 3 is a bit under-referenced in general. Relatedly -- obviously the authors are
not writing a systematic review, but I think it is worth emphasizing the extent to which the
literature on gender-unequal norms, such as it is, focuses on measures at the individual
level. That is, even studies of the effects of "norms" on outcomes actually measure a
composition of beliefs and perceptions (i.e., the extent to which one perceives the norm
_and_ has beliefs that are consistent with the norm), for example: Shannon K et al, PLoS
One 2012;7:e28739, or Shattuck D et al, Men Masc 2013;16:540-559. Study designs that
analyze the effects of gender-unequal norms as a contextual-level variable are rarer, e.g.:
Koenig et al, Demog 2003;40:269-288; Tsai AC et al, AIDS 2012;26:381-386,
VanderEnde et al, Soc Sci Med 2012;75:1143-1155. This is a significant gap in the
literature that tends to undermine the evidence base being mobilized to support
arguments like those being described in this essay.
2. Page 3, line 28: The dig at neoliberalism/capitalism may be unnecessary (here as well
as in Figure 1), especially in light of the authors' later points about economic opportunities
being a key determinant of delayed marriage (see below). Capitalism is the driving force
behind the opening of call centers, for example, that are driving schooling and fertility
decisions in India. So is capitalism good or bad?

3. Page 3, line 30: I believe the authors meant "gendered power relations"?
4. Page 3, line 58: I don't think the Malhotra JAH paper is the best citation to support the
authors' claim that increased economic and educational opportunity for girls led to the
decline in child marriage. More convincing studies about the causal determinants of age at
marriage might be Boulier & Rosenzweig (J Polit Econ 1984;92:712-32) in the Philippines
or Brien & Lillard (J Hum Resour 1994;29:1167-1204) in Malaysia. There is also strong
causal evidence that labor market participation and fertility decisions by women have been
driven by economic opportunities (Jensen, Q J Econ 2012;127:753-92; Oster et al., J Dev
Econ 2013;104:123-35) and television (Jensen & Oster, Q J Econ 2009;124:1057-94), at
least in India.
5. Page 4, food insecurity: It is curious to this reviewer why the authors have chosen to
focus on food insecurity. Land ownership and laws governing land ownership and asset
transfers are critical determinants of health disparities (Allendorf, World Dev
2007;35:1975-88; Meinzen-Dick et al, Agricult Sys 2019;172:72-82; Dworkin et al, Arch
Sex Behav 2013;42:703-13). Water insecurity is also an important determinant of health
outcomes (Geere et al., BMJ Global Health 2018;3:e000764; Geere et al. JOGH
2018;8:010406; Bisung & Elliott, Can J Pub Health 2017;108:e442-e447; Stevenson et
al., Soc Sci Med 2012;75:392-400) -- and these effects are gendered (Tsai et al., J Water
Health 2016;14:280-292; Bisung & Elliott, J Water Health 2017;15:17-30; Wutich &
Ragsdale, Soc Sci Med 2008;67:2116-25), given that women bear primary responsibility
for water carriage and household resource management (Geere et al., Environ Health
2010;9:52) and also have differential access to water markets and water sharing
networks. However, there is less research linking water insecurity to HIV-related
outcomes of interest. In general this is a fairly young area of research but one that should
not be ignored (Wutich & Beresford, Econ Anthropol 2019;6:168-82).
6. Page 4, labour force participation: As written this paragraph seems to imply the
absence of tradeoffs when it comes to labour force participation by adolescent girls. But
we know that, in some countries and at some age thresholds, education and labor are
substitutes (e.g., Psacharopoulos, J Popul Econ 1997;10:377-386; Beegle et al, J Hum
Resour 2009;44:871-89) and that this is overall welfare-reducing, because for children
the returns to education are higher than the returns to labour force participation
(Psacharopoulos, World Dev 1994;22:1325-43).
7. Page 4, line 40: The authors write "Women's economic participation is associated
with..." -- see above citations about economic _opportunity_ as a determinant of fertility
decisions.
8. Page 5, political participation: It is probably worth pointing out that, in addition to its
effects on "health-friendly" programmes and legislation, increasing women's political
representation may itself reduce gender bias (Beaman et al., Q J Econ
2009;124:1497-1540; Iyer et al., Am Econ J Appl Econ 2012;4:165-93) and exert
intergenerational effects on increasing human capital accumulation among girls (Beaman
et al., Science 2012;335:582-86) in India, although these effects are not universally
observed (Broockman, Electoral Stud 2014;34:190-204).
9. I think it is worth including a discussion section about how the same gender-unequal
norms can produce health disadvantage for boys and men. Some of the disparities are
apparent in Table 1, which shows that the rate of death from road injuries among
adolescent boys exceeds that among girls by a factor of 3 and interpersonal violence is not
a top 5 cause of death among girls (despite the fact that women and girls are much more
likely to be subject to intimate partner and non-partner violence, as is apparent in Table
2). The same gendered norms and hegemonic masculinities that place women at greater
risk for some health disparities also place men at greater risk for other health disparities
(Carswell et al, AIDS 1989;3:759-61; Mbizvo & Bassett, Health Policy Plan

1996;11:84-92; Tsai & Siedner, PLoS Med 2015;12:e1001906; Hawkes & Buse, Lancet
2013;381:1783-87).
10. Both Tables 1 & 2 should include a footnote that describes what the shaded grey areas
denote.
