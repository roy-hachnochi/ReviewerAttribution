I thank the authors for further addressing my comments, and for the detailed and
considerate response.
Only a few minor things remain
1) the authors says increased risks in the manuscript, but technically it should be increased
rates
2) The abstract implies an interaction (subgroup difference) by saying: “The increased risks
were more pronounced among offspring of diabetic mothers with comorbid CVD (HR: 1.73,
95% CI: 1.36 to 2.20) or diabetic complications (HR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.25 to 2.05).” – yet
the actual difference or interaction is not reported. Same issue occurs in the main results
and interaction results should be added to tables 2 and 3
3) What this study adds: “Preventing, screening and treating diabetes in women of
childbearing age is important not only for improving health of the women but also for
reducing long-term CVD risks in their offspring” – this is assuming the relationship is causal,
so needs to say as such. Causality has not been proved by this study.
4) “Our study provides first-line evidence …” – what does the word ‘first-line’ mean? Suggest
remove.
5) 0.6962 is the reported p-value for non-proportion hazards – 2 decimal places will suffice
With best wishes, Richard Riley
