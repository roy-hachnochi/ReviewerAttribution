This study presents a meta-analysis that is well described by its title. It is interesting,
topical, well written and, to my eyes, very competently executed.
I am usually the sort of reviewer who has provides pages of comments and the paucity of
the comments I make below – all of which are of relatively minor importance – is testament
to the sentence that precedes this one.

1. The first sentence of the paper – “News reporting by traditional media on the topic of
suicide has increased substantially in recent decades mirroring the generally increasing
societal focus on mental health and suicide prevention” – is supported by three citations.
However, of these three, the only one providing direct evidence of a substantial increase in
recent decades is reference 1 (Changes in Media Reporting of Suicide in Australia Between
2000/01 and 2006/07). And, as is obvious from the title, the data reported is not that
contemporary. The two WHO booklets would obviously be secondary sources if they
documented a substantial increase, though despite my looking through both I couldn't see
any reference to this. (They are large works and I may have missed these references if, say,
they did not contain the word “media”). I suggest the authors either re-phrase the sentence
or find new citations to add to reference 1.
2. The paper’s second sentence reads, “This [the substantial increase in reporting] is
*potentially* concerning given evidence that media reports on suicide have been associated
with increased rates of suicide” [emphasis added]. It is only a little thing, but I think it is
safe to say that given the evidence of a link cited, if there is a substantial increase in suicide
reporting in recent decades, this would be definitely "concerning" and I do not think the
modifier "potentially” is necessary or even appropriate.
3. Under the title “Ethics Statement” the authors write, “This study used publicly available
data only and therefore no ethical review was required”. This sentence should be re-phrased.
It cannot be the case that just because the study used publicly available data there were no
potential ethical issues with conducting it and therefore ethical review was unnecessary. In
saying this, I am not suggesting that there *are* ethical issues with the study, nor am I
suggesting that it should not be published because it did not have formal ethical review,
however this sentence’s implication that studies that only use publicly available data do not
require ethical review for that reason is clearly wrong.
4. The authors write, “The World Health Organization has emphasized that media
professionals should exercise caution when reporting on celebrity suicides. Our findings
highlight that caution is also necessary when reporting on non-celebrity suicide, which also
carries a similar and significant risk [citation omitted]”. The WHO booklet referred to
suggests that journalists "[a]pply particular caution when reporting celebrity suicides", there
is no suggestion that the WHO does not feel that caution need not be applied in
non-celebrity suicides. Though the authors do not say anything that is false, it would easy
with the current phrasing of those two sentences to draw a wrong conclusion as to what the
WHO have said. The authors ought to re-phrase these sentences so that they cannot be
interpreted in that way.
5. The last phrase in the paper refers to a recommendation that the authors suggest
“typically” appears in media guidelines about suicide reporting – “a message of hope that
suicide is preventable”. I am not sure how often this advice actually appears in these
guidelines (the authors do not cite any specific guidelines), but, in my view, it seems unlikely
that journalists will, as a matter of routine include such "a message of hope" in their
reporting. The last phrase of a paper is prime real estate and this phrase seemed to me to a
rather lacklustre property to place upon it. While the authors would, of course, be at liberty
to leave it as is, they may want to consider a revision.

Please note that while I definitely have some expertise in suicide research and some in the
Werther effect, despite my having been a co-author now on numerous meta-analysis, I
would still be loath to class myself as an expert on the finer statistical points of these. While
the stats look fine to me, I would defer to anyone able to claim real expertise in the area.
