1. Line 14, Page 5, use “aerodiameter” or “aerodynamic diameter” is more precise than
“diameter”.
2. Line 24, Page 5, developed countries have not only lower pollution level, but different
chemical profile of pollution.
3. Line 40, Page 5, should use past tense, “produces” “produced”
4. Line 53, Page 6, “…allow the examination of the association…” “…allow to examine the
association…”
5. Line 19, Page 7, ICD 9 or ICD 10?
6. Line 56, Page 7: did the authors use daily averaged O3 or 8-hour maximal?
7. Line 29, Page 8: “slowly varying or time-invariant individual-level risk factors” is more
precise here, since sex and age are time-invariant not “slowly varying”.
8. Line 33, Page 9: perhaps considering a sensitivity analysis on the df choice on
temperature and humidity?
9. Line 41 – 43, Page 8: again, should use two-pollutant analysis; and also provide another
table describing the correlation between air pollutants. Other pollutants may confound the
association between PM2.5 and hospital admission.

10. Line 56, Page 8: our short-term analysis in the U.S. indicated that lag01 is a good
exposure metric of PM2.5. Perhaps the sensitivity analysis should include lag01 as an
exposure metric as well.
11. Line 11, Page 9: The authors may consider dividing the country into several regions
based on the chemical composition of PM2.5, and conduct subgroup analysis based on this
division. This subgroup analysis can shed light on the association between PM2.5
components and hospital admission. The authors can also conduct another subgroup
analysis, based on the concentration of other pollutants, which can reveal the confounding
effect by other air pollutants.
12. Line 19, Page 9: the beta coefficients of quasi-Poisson regression follow students’ t-test,
so the authors should t-test, not Z-test, to test whether the beta coefficients are different
(i.e., effect modification). This is very important, since results on effect modification may
change.
13. Line 53, Page 12: “didn’t ” “did not”
14. Line 35, Page 13: claiming results to be “independent of other air pollutants” is not
accurate, since the authors used single-pollutant analysis and did not control for the effect of
other air pollutants. It is highly recommended to use two-pollutant or multi-pollutant
analysis. I personally feel it is fine to have insignificant results from two-pollutant or
multi-pollutant analysis.
15. Line 38 – 40, Page 14: this is a major advantage of using hospital admission as outcome
of interest, compare with using mortality as the outcome. The authors should highlight it.
16. Line 6 – 7, Page 15: this is not harvesting effect, at least not the harvesting effect
environmental epidemiologists are talking about [1] .
17. Table 2: the authors should relative risk and percentage change to report results; it is
better to use only one measure throughout the paper.
18. Table 3, Table S1, Table S2: from my personal experience, it is better to add “%” in the
table to emphasize the numbers are percentage change, otherwise, it is quite easy to cause
misunderstanding…
19. Figure 2: presenting the y-axis as percentage change may be better?
