RE: The economy of wellbeing: what is it and what are the implications for health
In this short paper, the authors aim to discuss the implication of the “economy of wellbeing” for the
health sector. The authors specifically review evidence on the measurement and determinants of
wellbeing. They then discuss how this type of evidence could be used to set public sector priorities in
order to align health policy with the promotion of wellbeing.
Overall, the paper provides a very short discussion on the economy of wellbeing and its implications
for health. Although the paper highlighted the attempt to create composite measures of wellbeing on
page 2, I suggested providing more information in the third paragraph about these measures. In the

Conclusion section, the authors can also comment on the use of broader consequences of the health
system in the existing health economic evaluation studies (cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and
cost-benefit analyses) in order to provide better insights into the impact of the health system
spendings.
