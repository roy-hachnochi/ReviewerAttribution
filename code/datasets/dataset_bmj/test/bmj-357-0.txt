In this observational study, authors used data from the journal submission systems of two
well-known general medical journals, the BMJ and BMJ Open, and analysed the submission
dates and times of manuscripts and reviewers’ reports. The analysis included a period of
seven years starting from 2012. The main finding was that many submissions occur early in
the morning, late in the evening, during weekends or holidays. The rate of such submissions
varies significantly between countries, but there was no an increasing trend from 2012 until
2019. Authors stated limitations of their study, mentioned some uncertainties and concluded
that many researchers are overworked, under pressure to publish and that they scarify their
private life for professional.
Although it is known that researchers at universities often complain of being overloaded with
teaching, work with students, administrative work, research and, in the case of medical
faculties, clinical duties and patients, many academics do not have (and are not expected to
have) regular working hours. There are classes late in the evening (“could not be scheduled
otherwise due to insufficient room”) and teaching stuff at medical faculties often works in
shifts in hospitals (one can suppose that most contributions to the BMJ and BMJ Open come
from researchers in the medical field). Thus, researchers are often not expected to work
from 9 to 5 and working in other periods doesn’t necessarily mean that they scarify their
leisure time.
Data of this study reports on the submission event, not actually on writing of a manuscript
or review report. One can suppose that before submission an author/reviewer performs final
reading and correction (maybe final checking of journal requirements), therefore needing to
concentrate, and working early in the morning, late in the evening, during weekends,
perhaps at home or during a quiet clinical shift, enables favorable environment – less crowd
around, less noise, other duties finished (as recognized by the authors themselves) and, not
to neglect, faster internet and upload of files (“most of the others are not working”). So, the
moment of submission is, in a sense, a final decision which needs a clear, undisturbed mind.
The data of this study has shown that in some countries it is highly unlikely that researchers
will submit out-of-9-to-5-hours, which may speak in favor of their well-planned,
well-organised and technically well-supported working life, but in countries with intensive
out-of-hours submissions it still can’t be said that these researchers are overworked just
based on the submission times.
I suggest authors to modify the article to stress the submission moments (as supported by
the empirical data) which may or may not directly reflect the overwork. Also, since there

wasn’t a change in the submission trend in a 7-year period (and the researchers are
constantly pushed to publish more), it is questionable whether submission times reflect the
research burden of academic life and whether they are a proper argument for working longer
hours. According to the presented data, working out-of-hours doesn’t confirm working more,
only at different times (which is essentially not unexpected).
