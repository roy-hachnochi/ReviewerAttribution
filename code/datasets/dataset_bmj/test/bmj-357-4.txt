I enjoyed this paper quite a bit and have relatively few suggestions:
1) Stats review advisable as some of the methods are sufficiently complex that I do not feel
qualified if things were done properly.
2) An assumption of this paper is that the researcher is the one uploading the material. In
some countries there may be better administrative support and a standard hours worker
does it during standard hours even though the author was burning the midnight oil the night
before finishing it. This is a limitation.
3) One additional analysis that would be worthwhile is to investigate whether p(out of hours
posting) is a function (for the reviews, not the submissions) of the closeness to the due date.
I would hypothesize that those submitting up against the deadline would be more likely to
submit on weekends/wee hours but perhaps the opposite is true. Worth a look?
4) I am not sure that Table 3 provides sufficient information (given the null result) to
warrant inclusion in the main paper. Might be better as a supplementary table (leaving
room for a table/figure reporting the new analysis I suggested above!
Overall, however, I think this is a great Xmas issue paper and would be pleased to see it in
print.
