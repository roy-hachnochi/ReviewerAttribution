I thank the authors for replying to my comments and revising the article. I am pleased to
see the analysis of covariance results added. There are some unresolved issues still.
1) The authors now explain that they used negative binomial regression, and I agree this is
sensible. They use this to derive relative risks, but are they not relative rates? I suggested
they tell us about the difference in log-counts, which when exponentiated is a ratio of rates
(as it is counts per unit time, which here is 90 days I think)
See for example here:
https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/output/negative-binomial-regression/
If the authors want to use the word risk, then they need to say an explicit time-point by
which the risk happens by
2) I asked the authors why the Bayesian and frequentist results appear to disagree, and
suggested this may be due to the prior distributions having a strong influence in the
Bayesian analysis. The response received is somewhat confusing, and I am not entirely
confident that we have resolved this.
e.g. the authors say “We re-reviewed the analyses with our statisticians. Our statisticians
believe that, because the numbers are low and one of the surgeons had no enterotomies,
the generalized linear model (GLM) stratified by surgeon may have provided skewed
results. Without the stratification, the p-value is 0.498. It does not change the frequentist
result perspective. ” – I am not sure what the authors mean by ‘skewed results’ – biased
results? Anyway, I do not see why stratification would cause issues in the frequentist
approach and not the Bayesian approach, UNLESS the prior distributions are adding
important information.
Stratification is the correct approach, because otherwise the clustering of patients within
surgeons is not accounted for. But the authors might want to put a random effect on the
surgeon, rather than estimating separate terms for each, due to the few evemts
Clearly, there is tiny information to be making strong inferences here “There were
two enterotomies with RVHR compared to none with LVHR and the Bayesian analysis
demonstrated a 78% probability of RVHR increasing the risk of enterotomy”
Therefore we are left with a Bayesian analysis that says 78% chance of success, compared
to a frequentist p-value of 0.99 with stratification. These still do not seem to tally. To me, I
would expect a p-value of 0.99 to correspond to a Bayesian probability of close to 0.5
(50%).
“This study unexpectedly demonstrated that RVHR was associated with an increased risk of
enterotomy (3% vs 0%)” – a strong conclusion and yet the p-value is 0.996.
Also the authors say “We will leave it to the discretion of the journal editors and statistician
which p-value to report.” – this is not appropriate for us to make this decision, as it
passing the buck to people who do not have the actual data and are not doing the actual
modelling. It is not very reassuring.
3) “However, robotic repair had longer operative duration (141 vs 77 minutes;
coefficient=62.89 [95%CI=45.75-80.01]; p=<0.001”
- what does coefficient mean?
4) “robotic repair had clinically important differences in enterotomies (3% vs 0%;
p=0.996)” – this relates to point 2, but clearly this statement seems inappropriate because
of the lack of strong evidence that this is not a chance difference. We need the 95% CI
please. I think the strong statement is coming from the Bayesian framework.

5) “There were no differences in conversions to open, number of readmissions, emergency
room visits, wound complications or other complications” – better to say there was no clear
evidence of a difference? As there were observed differences, just that it is not statistically
strong evidence of a genuine difference. Same applies to ‘No difference was seen in change
of pain scores between groups at 1-month post-operative follow up.’
6) “A higher percentage of patients in the RVHR arm experienced a major worsening in
AW-QOL (28.1% vs 13.6%; RR=2.07 [95%CI=0.98-4.41]; p=0.058) while a higher
percentage of patients in the LVHR group had a major improvement in AW-QOL (43.8% vs
52.5%; RR=1.20 [95%CI=0.83-1.74]; p=0.330).” – I would add a sentence to say
‘although, confidence intervals were wide’
7) Table 3: we need treatment effect estimates and 95% CIs, not just p-values, to
compare the groups
In summary, whilst recognising the improvements in the paper, I think there remain
serious concerns about the interpretation (especially for the enterotomies analysis) that
the BMJ and authors need to consider going forward. Regardless, I hope my comments are
ultimately useful to the BMJ and the authors, who have clearly worked very hard to
undertake this trial.
Best wishes, Richard Riley
