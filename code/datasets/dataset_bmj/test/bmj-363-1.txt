I appreciate the revisions and have reviewed the peer review and related comments. I
think this paper is much clearer throughout.
I can’t recall any other papers reporting the specific function used in the statistical
software, so this is new to me. Though not a biostatistician myself, I can see the value in
this, and perhaps this could even be encouraged (at least in an appendix) by EQUATOR
guidelines. Not only does this take up minimal space, but in an era where many use R and
open source programing where there are many ways to do something incorrectly, this is
worth encouraging.
Apologies for not catching this the first time, but the power calculations were based on
injection drug use prevalence. While the ITT involves asking practices to screen for
injection drug use, NONE of the practices accepted this (p10 lines11-12). Perhaps this is
not much an issue as the power calculations (p7 lines 35/36) were identical to the
frequency of injection use in the cohort (p10 line 31). I appreciate the clarity on the
primary outcome (p11 lines 12-14).
I appreciate the nuanced discussion and justification of the CE analysis, and I think this is
an acceptable justification: “Since we have no data on the proportion of individuals that
were active injectors, we have not altered the model to include transmission. We did not
feel that we should add a further limitation to the discussion which would “favour” the
intervention."
Excellent work with this revision.
