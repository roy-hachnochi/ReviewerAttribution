The revision is considerably improved, with a clear structure and message. I have a couple
of minor observations.
1. The many acronyms complicate the story. It may be that they are familiar to the target
audience, but I personally would be happier with fewer of them.
2. The figures now are much clearer. I suggest in Figure 1 omitting the All columns, to
match Figures 4-6, and reversing the legend to reflect the graph.
