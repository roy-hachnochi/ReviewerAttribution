Thank you for the opportunity to review the manuscript: The healthiness and sustainability
of national and global food-based dietary guidelines.
Overall this manuscript is of interest/relevance and the authors have tried to analyze a
large amount of data. However, I would be more than happy if the authors could expand
their analysis since several important food groups are missing, and categorization is not
always informative. I have several suggestions to improve the quality of the manuscript.

Major
1. Cause effect language needs to be avoided since all associations are based on
observational data (Abstract and page 15; line 19-31)
a. Please add also uncertainty intervals in the Abstract
2. The authors need to provide a more deeply elaborated rationale why only 8 food groups
were analyzed? Please provide also a reference;
a. Unfortunately oils were not included in your analysis.
b. I would also highly suggest including grains, and then ideally separate between whole
grains and refined grains.
c. Moreover, I found the categorization for meat suboptimal (red meat, poultry, processed
meat would be better), since the health association differ quite strongly between the
different types of meat.
d. Page 8 (line 5-14); inconsistent; please state clearly which 8 food groups do you
include.
3. Please provide a reference for your categorization. Moreover, I would highly suggest to
report the certainty of evidence for the health association for each food group (e.g.
according to GRADE or the WCRF grading). These will differ strongly for diseases (i.e.
dairy: inversely associated with risk of colorectal cancer, but neutral for mortality). Most, if
not all, guidelines are not based on a structured approach like GRADE
(https://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/). It would be very interesting if the underlying
evidence process of each guideline is described (in the supplements) and included also in
the discussion section.
4. Page 11 (line 6-18): inconsistency: now you analyze fruit and vegetables separately.
Why sugar is not included? Since defined as discouraged on page 8 (line 12)?
5. Some of the meta-analyses (ref 42-50) are in my opinion quite old. The GBD is updating
the meta-analyses for the GBD studies.
Minor
1. In my opinion the manuscript is quite long and could be shortened.
2. Supplementary material is difficult to read, due formatting problems.
