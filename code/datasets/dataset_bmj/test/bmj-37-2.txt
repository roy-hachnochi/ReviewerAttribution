As a lay reviewer, I found this paper to be well written and very interesting, with messages
that need to be brought to the attention of not only the medical community but also the
general public and policy makers at a national and international level.
The question of what to eat or not to eat to extend and maintain quality of life is regarded
as important by a significant section of the patient community â€“ whether parents of young
children, those approaching older years, or those who are keen on a healthy lifestyle. The
effects of various dietary regimens and their effect on food sustainability and climate
change are also matters which are attracting much greater publicity and public awareness,
so the subject of this paper is topical, timely and relevant to many patients and carers.
The figures are clear and explanatory not only to specialist professionals.
The conclusions of this paper, that dietary changes in line with FBDGs may be associated
with health benefits, can in principle be readily taken up and acted upon by individuals. It
is interesting, although perhaps not surprising, that there is so much variation between
different sets of guidelines. An informed patient/carer might be left wondering which
guidelines to follow.
No recommendations were considered on oils, whole grains or processed meat - because
available data was of poor quality, highlighting the need for better research data. Also,
this highlights that there is little data currently in FBDGs on use of plant-based proteins, an
area of current topical interest amongst those considering flexitarian/vegetarian/vegan diet
plans.
Also, the lack of alignment of FBDGs with global environmental targets is of interest to the
informed and concerned public and highlights the need for this to be addressed. An
informed reader would be interested by the conclusion that reduction of sugar intake
(along with reduced intake of other staples such as grains and potatoes) could potentially
have the dual benefit of improved health and reduced land/water/fertiliser demands.
The conclusions of this paper are also important for future public health and to inform the
debate on sustainability and environmental protection, and highlight the need for a much
greater focus on this aspect at a government and international agency level.
A
significant and important finding is that the current WHO guidelines, which might be used
in principle as a starting point for any country wishing to develop FBDGs, do not have
sufficient detail to optimise health and environmental impacts in line with sustainability
goals. This is important not so much for individual patients and carers, but needs to be
brought to the attention of national and international policy makers. The need for greater
policy support for implementation of guidelines is also emphasised.

I would recommend that this paper should be taken forward for publication.
