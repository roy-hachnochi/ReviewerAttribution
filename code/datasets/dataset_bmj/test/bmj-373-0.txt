This version of the paper is a major improvement, and addresses the majority of the
concerns I had before. Below are my remaining concerns, broken into substantial and
minor.
Substantial Concerns:
1. As I tried to point out before (and apologies if this wasn’t clear), the paper would
benefit from some discussion of the difference between within and between country
equity. This distinction is important because different decision-makers can influence equity
at these two different levels. For within country comparisons, the primary decision-maker
is the government, and therefore equitable financing is if OOP is being relied upon, and
equitable funding is about who is benefiting from government and donor spending. For
between country analyses, the only decision-makers actively distributing resources across
countries is the donor community. I’m not sure assessing government spending levels
across countries makes much sense. (Of course there is more government spending per
capita in middle income countries rather than low-income countries.) Which bodies
(donors or governments) can be held responsible for ensuring equity where is critical and
seems confused in the current draft.
2. The third and four sections writing remains quite distinct from the first two. For
example, phrases are introduced and defined in the first two sections but not used often in

the next two sections (such as financing versus funding, and horizontal versus vertical
equity). Pulling some of these themes from the first two sections into the third and fourth
sections a little more will make the paper feel like it has more continuity.
3. There remains no serious limitations section. Both data sources used for this study have
limitations that are important for the reader to consider and impact the reliability of the
authors’ claims. The Muskoka2 has limitations that should be mentioned, including the
assignment of what is RMNCH (ie including relatively arbitrary portions of malaria funding,
HIV funding, including humanitarian aid, etc.). The NHA data used for tracking domestic
spending also has major concerns about being comparable across time, as well as across
countries, especially for key health focus areas. Conversations with the experts at WHO
who help guide the creation of these datasets highlight that they are very cautious about
how they recommend the data be used and have stressed before that it is not appropriate
for comparison across time/country, especially when focusing on a single health focus
area.
4. The paper makes a point of focusing on reproductive, maternal, newborn and child
health, with mention of the importance of adolescent health, although when need is
considered for the concentration curves, only income, newborn, and child health are
considered. It would be valuable to also include a health metric related to maternal and
adolescent health (separately).
Minor:
1. The subtitle (after the colon) doesn’t seem correct since the unit of analyses are
countries not people. Recommend changing to “Are the countries most in need being left
behind?”
2. While it is mentioned, I do think it is critical enough that it needs to be mentioned
earlier and more prominently that within country inequality is of the utmost importance,
although not seriously focused on in this paper because the paper relies on national level
data. The implicit assumption of the paper is that resources are funded equitably (relative
to the source) within the country. More caution on this is advised.
3. Lines 134 and 136 say “and/or” but should likely be “and” since I imagine both criteria
are needed for equitable financing and equitable funding.
4. It should be pointed out that the IHME DAH estimates also track development
assistance for malaria, HIV, some humanitarian aid, and basic health care. As is, the text
suggests that these aren’t tracked, which isn’t true. These funds simply aren’t lumped in
with maternal and child health for reporting, although can be easily combined with
maternal and child health if a user were interested in tracking something broader than
tradition maternal and child health aid.
