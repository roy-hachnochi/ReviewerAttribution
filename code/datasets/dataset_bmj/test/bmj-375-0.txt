The authors have responded to the comments I raised on the initial submission. Many of the replies take
the form of "Yes we agree, but we are constrained by the word limit" (loosely paraphrased), so I imagine
the editorial guidance will be more helpful in guiding what to include/exclude and the form of the final
publication. Where the authors have otherwise declined to incorporate my feedback, they provide
reasonable justification for disagreement. In two instances (comments #4/7 and #8) the authors state
they have added "some" references but did not. In comments #4/7, I suggested Boulier, Brien, Jensen,
Oster, Jensen; in the revised manuscript, the authors cite one (Jensen). In comment #8, I suggested
Beaman, Iyer, Beaman, Broockman; in the revised manuscript, the authors cited none. Unless the
authors are working with a definition of "some" that differs from mine, perhaps in these two responses a
better response would involve transparency about what changes they are (not) making and why (ie,
word limit). Otherwise, I have no further comments to add. This is a nicely written manuscript that calls
attention to some of the structural drivers of health among adolescent girls and young women. I hope it
gets a wide reading.
