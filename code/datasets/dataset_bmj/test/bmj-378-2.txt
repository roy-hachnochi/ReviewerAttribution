Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. It is a well-written and clearly
presented piece of work, adressing the fundamental question: Are the major
perinatal complications separate entities or may they be different phenotypical
presentations of a common pathology?
The data used arise from the Norwegian Birth Register, a well-exploited resource
often used by the authors.
The authors have taken the major pitfalls in reproductive epidemiology into account
by running a large number of sensitivy/sub analyses to address bias.
I really like the paper.
I have, in fact, only minor comments/suggestions to this manuscript:
1. In the abstract (Objectives) I would suggest to add 'delivery' after preterm. Along
the same lines:
2. The language is now and then 'clinical slang', which I dislike: e.g. write placental
abruption, not abruption
3. Page 10, lines 9-8 from the bottom: Did the clinician deliver the mother? I think
that the clinician induced the mother's delivery of the baby.
4. I think Table 2 and Fig 1 are redundant. I prefer Table 2 and think that you could
delete Fig 1 without problems.
5. Page 17. The authors compare estimates that have different reference groups. I
do not find it justified.
6. Page 8 where the SGA used is described. You describe parity specific BW les than
2,5% at term. I think that SGA should be made according to all birth in the same
week of gestation - and you may have done that? If so, please make it clear in the
text. If not, I think that this misclassification may explain some of the association
between SGa and sunsequent preterm birth, and I suggest that you re-calculate
SGA.
7. I would have liked to read your considerations about the finding of similar
estimates in women who have had a partner change between pregnancies. I would
have expected an attenuation. Do you think that the 'underlying factor' is something
exclusively attributed to the woman?
