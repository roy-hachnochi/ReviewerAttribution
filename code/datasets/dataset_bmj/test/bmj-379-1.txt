This is a very well-done manuscript which addresses an extremely important issue for the
NHS. The manuscript is very number-dense, but a lot of this is helpful.
Do the authors have any suggestions regarding how to limit the expenditures on litigation
directly? It might be worth mentioning these briefly before moving into the safety
improvement discussing. For example, in the U.S. disclosure programs have proved
helpful, and internationally no-fault programs have also been successful.
Specific comments:
1) In the structural area, suggest adding "but are not limited to," before staffing, as there
are other issues as well, such as outmoded facilities and information technology.
2) In the learning section, I would suggest adding the term "learning healthcare system"
somewhere, as this is the phrase being used most widely to describe how organizations
can get to what the authors are describing.
3) In the system-wide improvement section, suggest referencing the recent Lancet
Commission paper on improving quality--it made the point the authors are describing
eloquently.
