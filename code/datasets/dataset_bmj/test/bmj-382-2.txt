The authors present a compelling manuscript showing that habitual fish oil use is associated
with a lower risk of all-cause and CVD mortality and provides a marginal benefit against CVD
events among the general population. The manuscript is written well and assumptions and
results are supported by relevant references.
There are, however some minor points the authors need to address to make it ready for
submission:
Line 75-77: Although there have been marked advances in recent years regarding our
understanding of the potential role of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of CVD events,
clear gaps in knowledge remain.
More relevant references are required to support this sentence. The mention of
meta-analyses that support this statement would be of relevance.
Line 78: Data from laboratory studies, epidemiological investigations, and randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) indicate a role of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of CVD.
There is no reference for laboratory studies that indicate a role of omega-3 fatty acids in the
prevention of CVD.
Line 92: The study power could be even more restricted by potential confounding factors
when the modulation of such associations is explored.
The confounding factors and the associations that the authors are talking about are unclear.
This sentence should be phrased differently so that the meaning is more apparent.
Line 241: Typo. There should be no “and”.
Line 310: sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses that may help minimize confounding.
Should there be “factors” at the end of the sentence?
