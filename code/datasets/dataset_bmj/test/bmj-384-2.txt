Thank you for giving me the opportunity to read this paper and to consider it as a
patient/lay person.
Whilst not targeted at, or planned to be distributed to patient groups, as someone who is
part of a group that includes patients who can initially be misdiagnosed following MI (due
to age/gender) I find the subject of this paper to be both interesting and important.
I understand that both ECG and CMR are widely available in UK hospitals and are both safe
and well tolerated by patients.
The conclusions of the paper focus particularly on high risk patients i.e. those with diabetes
or of older age. From a patient viewpoint I think it would be interesting to know if there
was any meaningful data surrounding low risk groups. I would assume those patients who
are already determined to be at high risk of CVD would have monitoring/interventions in
place so their healthcare plan may not change significantly if UMI is later recognised
through screening. However, I would assume those at low risk who have UMI may have a
more significant change to their health management if they are screened and diagnosed
and therefore there would be greater opportunity of improved outcomes? For example,
was there any data on the difference between men v women or older v younger population
and the numbers of UMI being identified through ECG/CMR. I would have thought higher
numbers of low risk patients initially have their MI missed as they do not fit the profile of
risk for CVD.
In terms of the reported outcomes, as a patient, I am not clear as to whether there is any
real improvement to outcomes following screening/identification of UMI? The paper as I
read it seems to suggest outcomes are very similar for UMI/RMI. Is there further
information on if/how patient treatment changes following identification of MI following
previous misdiagnosis or if patient approach to lifestyle choices changes?
Could any conclusions be drawn from the data as to whether more patients in the general
population should be screened with CMR or ECG or alternatively, whether diagnostic
screening should not be increased overall, but ECG or CMR should be used in place of other
more routine medical test?
