The revisions have addressed my major concerns about the presentation of data. I
particularly like Figure 1a. As I am not an expert in the statistical approach used, I defer to
others on the methodological issues.
The discussion is improved, but should be improved further. It favors citing other research
and repeated shorthand references to CDC and HHS guidelines over plain language
explanations of what may be going on and what the clinical implications are. I would

encourage the authors to try again and use a clear structure and progression. --summary of
key findings
--what is new (compared to existing research)
--what may explain the findings
--what are the clinical implications
--what are the research implications
--what are the limitations.
