Second Review to BMJ (Oscar Leonel Rueda Ochoa)
Dear Editor, thanks again for invite to me to review this paper. As I mentioned before, Dr.
Huang and colleagues made an important scientific effort to answer a clinically relevant
question regarding the dose-response relationship between dietary sodium reduction and
blood pressure change and the impact of intervention duration. This Systematic-Review
and meta-analysis was well conducted, following PRISMA consensus and applying all
methodological tools suggested by Cochrane collaboration. The paper was well written,
with a clear clinical message. My opinion regarding specific topic are:
.
1. Originality –
Although previous studies have been published evaluating the association of the reduction
in salt intake with the decrease in blood pressure figures. This meta-analysis adds valuable
information about dose - response, both in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients. In
addition, it shows that the effect of the reduction in salt intake is time dependent and is
heterogeneous especially in certain subgroups. All of the above constitutes a valuable
contribution in knowledge in that particular topic.
2. Importance of work to general readers - does this work matter to clinicians, patients,
teachers, or policymakers? Is a general journal the right place for it?
Given the enormous impact that arterial hypertension has on public health worldwide, and
the recent publication of new guidelines for its management, which emphasize not only
pharmacological treatment but also non-pharmacological treatment. It is important to
continue to increase in readers the awareness of the importance of reducing salt intake for
both the management and prevention of high blood pressure. This topic interests
everyone: Clinical doctors, teachers, policymakers. Given the wide spectrum of readers
and their impact, BMJ is an ideal Journal to publish this article.
3. Scientific reliability Research Question - clearly defined and appropriately answered?
Yes, research question clearly defined
4. Overall design of study - adequate ?
This systematic review-meta-analysis followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations.
Overall design is adequate.
5. Participants studied - adequately described and their conditions defined?
Yes. They were adequately described.
6. Methods - adequately described? Complies with relevant reporting standard - Eg
CONSORT for randomised trials ? Ethical ?
This research was methodological well done.
7. Results - answer the research question? Credible? Well presented?
Besides high heterogeneity, meta-regression adjusted by multiple co-factors showed
dose-response in the statistical association between reduce salt intake and changes in
Blood pressure. It was also evident that trials with greater duration showed twice the effect
on blood pressure reduction compared to trials of short duration. Tables and graphs are
well presented

8. Interpretation and conclusions - warranted by and sufficiently derived from/focused on
the data? Message clear?
The interpretation and conclusion are focused on the data and the message is clear.
9. References - up to date and relevant? Any glaring omissions?
Relevant references were included.
10. Abstract/summary/key messages/What this paper adds - reflect accurately what the
paper says?
The abstract is adequate. I would like include “systematic review” and “meta-analysis” as
keywords too.
Finally, I highly recommend this paper could be published in BMJ.
Sincerely,
