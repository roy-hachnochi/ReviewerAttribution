This is an interesting and well-written paper which adds to the growing descriptive
literature on the ties between medical specialty societies and industry.
1. The rationale for the focus on overdiagnosis is unclear and this one specific type of bias
in systematic reviews and guidelines is not well framed. The first mention is line 27 page
3, where it is unclear why overdiagnosis is being emphasized, of all the potential impacts

of industry influence. It is the author’s special interest, but this is not an adequate
reason. I suggest presenting the potential for influence of industry more broadly, with a
listing of various key areas of impact, of which overdiagnosis is but one.
2. The examination of “mention of overuse” seems superficial and of little use or interest.
So what if a guideline mentions overdiagnosis? Why is a “mention” important to guideline
or review end-users? Without much more detail on how the guideline avoided
recommendations that might lead to overdiagnosis, this analysis seems of little use. I
note that 7 guidelines did have recommendations related to overdiagnosis, which is a
useful finding.
3. You added analysis of gender – what was your hypothesis? What is the significance of
your findings?
4. Regarding the Physician’s payment database:
a. Does the database ensure that each provider is unique? In its early days when I used it
providers could be listed multiple times, for example with and without their middle initial
or in different practice locations. Has this issue been solved?
b. Doesn’t the database ONLY have US-based physicians? If that is the case, why present
the ration of 235/328, as is not meaningful. Please clarify the inclusion criteria for the
database.
c. The database is not “new”: it was first available in October 2010.
5. The conclusions (page 11) could offer a few suggestions as to how to minimize industry
influence in guidelines and potential future research questions. The reader is left with
“nothing should compel acceptance of their claims of independence…”. This seems a
rather unsatisfactory finishing point.
6. Could you examine industry ties and amounts by for primary-care-based “specialties”
such as ACP (general internists) and psychiatry? Perhaps you don’t have sufficient
information, but the data you do present suggest there may be significant differences.
Might this be an area for future study?
