It is important for everyone, including patients and their families, that biomedical research
is done by the people best able to do it. Institutions conducting such research will only find
the best people if they make a deliberate policy to consider those who do not fit the
traditional criteria for consideration as well as those who do. The poor representation of
women, disabled people and black and ethnic minorities in the tenured biomedical research
community, compared with the population in general suggests that something has been
going wrong with the search for the best people up until now. I therefore welcome this
attempt to review the methods used to select academics for tenure.
However, I don't think that the authors have gone far enough in discussing the possible
'Progressive Incentives' that could be included within those methods.
For example, they have acknowledged the existence of patient and public involvement
(PPI) in research by stating that they did not use it in their own study (why not? They do
not explain.), but they have made no comment about how the use of PPI in research could
be included amongst the progressive incentives in criteria for tenure.
Academic Institutions whose faculties of biomedical science have embraced the
Involvement of patients in their research (and of course they all should have) could invite
them to review their promotion and tenure policies in the light of the findings of this
research.
It is also disappointing, I think, that the researchers have missed the opportunity to
comment on the fact that the Institutions' criteria for tenure which they have reviewed do
not, it seems, allow for the fact that some researchers work part-time and therefore should
not be expected to meet the same requirements, in numerical terms, as full timers. In this
context, I am also not happy with the use of the phrase 'extenuating circumstance',
whether it originated within this paper or within the criteria for tenure documents that the
researchers found as part of the research.
The ability to take parental or medical leave, or to work part-time, are, and always should
be, part of a civilised society; they should not be included under a heading that suggests
that they ought to be exceptions to the 'normal' way of doing things, and that they are
therefore 'abnormal'.
