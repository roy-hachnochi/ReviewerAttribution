This paper is much improved. I agree the estimates for early adiposity, particularly on
breast cancer and prostate cancer, may be correct. I also worry that they are open to an
overlooked source of selection bias in observational studies. Specifically, the problem is
the inevitable exclusion from the study of those who have already died of the exposure
and those who have already died of a competing risk of the outcome, which can reverse
estimates, as explained here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23700026. This may
not be a problem here, but it is a potential explanation for the puzzling finding that early
life adiposity protects or has no effect. So, maybe the interpretation could be a little more
nuanced.
