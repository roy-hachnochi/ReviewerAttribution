Please note that I am at the same university as the study authors and have
collaborated with study authors Jha and Orav on previous studies. However, I have
expertise in analysis of Medicare claims data, have linked TJC accreditation data to
Medicare data in a previous study (other than the study I am currently reviewing
and my own study that is referenced, I am unaware of prior studies that perform
this linkage), and (through my prior work) am familiar with the broader literature on
the role of hospital accreditation in influencing patient outcomes.
This article studies the relationship between hospital accreditation and patient
outcomes in U.S. hospitals. The hospital accreditation business is large and is an
important mechanism through which hospitals attempt to ensure the provision of
high quality health care. The study links data on Medicare beneficiaries who are
hospitalized for a set of general medical or surgical conditions to data on
accreditation by either the Joint Commission (TJC), other non-TJC accrediting
organizations, or state surveyors. The basic finding of the article is that accreditation
bears very little relationship with 3 main patient outcomes: 30 day mortality, 30 day
readmissions, and patient experience with hospital care. Process measures of quality
were not assessed.

I am unaware of other studies which comprehensively analyze the relationship
between hospital accreditation, in particular accreditation by TJC, and patient
outcomes, at least using data as recent as that in this article. At the time of my own
work on this issue - which studied how patient outcomes change during the exact
dates of TJC hospital inspections - my review of the literature was consistent with
how these study authors have interpreted current studies. Findings on the role of
accreditation in hospitals are mixed, usually focus on process measures of
outcomes, and do not study the relationship with patient outcomes. I would add that
most if not all previous studies are smaller in size than the current study. The
question that's asked is important given the size of this industry, the importance
that is placed by regulators on hospital accreditation, the efforts that hospitals go
through to gain accreditation, and the belief that accreditation is necessary, despite
many other factors that may be as or more important to hospitals in incentivizing
them to provide high quality care.
I have several comments / suggestions:
1.
The BMJ audience is international. While the existing Discussion briefly
highlights work on the role of hospital inspection in other countries, many readers of
the BMJ will be unfamiliar with how hospital accreditation works in the US and what
is the role and importance of TJC. US reader will know this information but other
ex-US readers may not. I would include more detail on these issues to make them
salient to international readers.
2.
I generally found the empirical approach to be appropriate. An alternative
approach with longitudinal data could be to look at how hospital outcomes change
before and after accreditation. Aside from issues with data availability, this analysis
may be difficult to conduct if most hospitals stay accredited and rarely is it the case
that hospitals switch in and out of accreditation status.
3.
The authors can consider adding more discussion as to why accreditation is
not associated with better outcomes. There are at least a few reasons that come to
mind. US hospitals compete with one another within local or regional markets. A
primary thesis of competitive markets is that competition drives improvements in
quality. While there are asymmetries of information in health care, one reason
accreditation may not be associated with patient outcomes is that hosptials are
already competing on presumably patient outcomes and other factors. In addition to
this explanation, the malpractice system in the US may already exert influence on
hospitals to provide high quality care. Finally, insurers have information about
quality of care in hospitals and may use their bargaining power to influence
decisions of hospitals to invest in quality of care. Insurers can exlude low quality
providers from their network and this competitive pressure may induce investments
into quality. Finally, it may be the case that accreditation can improve process
measures but these measures are poorly correlated with the outcomes the authors
study.
4.
Can the authors provide some data on how many hospitals attempt to get
TJC accreditation but do not? If this information is available, they might consider
comparing those hospitals that achieved TJC accreditation versus those that
attempted to but did not.
5.
Some of the language in the discussion is causal or approaches causal
statements. Given that the study design isn't quasi-experimental, it would be worth
while in any revision for the authors to pay close attention to emphasizing the
association of accreditation with patient outcomes, rather than a causal effect.
