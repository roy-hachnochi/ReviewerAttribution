GENERAL COMMENTS
This manuscript discusses the elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV
(EMTCT) in the context of high HIV prevalence settings. The authors aim to compare
perinatally acquired HIV with perinatally acquired tetanus to highlight the complexity
of EMTCT. In addition, the authors propose tracking additional reproductive and
HIV-related progress indicators to assist with the EMTCT agenda.
The manuscript reports on an important topic; however, the manuscript could be
strengthened and better developed. In general:
The discussion on MNTE is quite limited (4 sentences) and is inconsistent
with the stated aim of the paper to compare EMTCT with MNTE. Though information
on MNTE is presented in the tables and figures, very little is discussed in the text.
The 7 proposed indicators to measure targets along the continuum of
reproductive and HIV-related healthcare are listed without any justification or further
explanation, and does not take into account the EMTCT monitoring framework,
which includes targets for each of the 4 prongs that overlap with the proposed
indicators, such as family planning and antiretroviral treatment (ART) targets. This
weakens the argument for these additional indicators, especially since discussion on
these proposed indicators is very limited.
The manuscript has errors throughout, including missing or misplaced
punctuation, inconsistent usage of acronyms, unconventional terminology, typos,
and inconsistent formatting. Recommend a detailed review to check for grammatical
inconsistencies and errors.
In some cases, text should be rewritten to improve flow and clarity.
B. SPECIFIC COMMENTS
Please see specific comments below. Due to the number of grammatical errors, I did
not list each one, but as stated above, I would recommend a detailed review.
Title:
-

Please use conventional terminology in referencing EMTCT in the title.

Abstract:
Methods: The sensitivity analysis involving case rates, maternal HIV
prevalence, and MTCT should be described in this section.
Results, 1st sentence: The sentence is missing a period.

Results, last sentence: This sentence reads more like a conclusion than
result. Suggest moving.
Conclusions: The listing of all the proposed targets in one conclusion
sentence is dense and difficult to read, and probably not the best approach for the
abstract. Suggest summarizing or pulling out a few example targets.
Conclusions: There is an extra “percent” between percent antenatal booking
before 12 weeks and percent women with the recommended number of antenatal
visits.
Introduction:
First paragraph, last sentence (line 26): Please clarify what is meant by “the
system in which interventions are implemented.”
Second paragraph, 5th sentence: “MTCT” is defined in this sentence, but in
the context of EMTCT, which was defined in a previous sentence.
Second paragraph, 5th and 6th sentences: There is a “(1)” at the end of
both sentences, but it is unclear what is being referenced.
Second paragraph, last sentence: The PMTCT acronym is oddly defined
here; recommend using the more conventional terminology.
Third paragraph, last sentence: This is sentence is a bit awkward and should
be rewritten.
What are the complexities of eliminating mother to child HIV transmission (MTCT)?:
First paragraph: The comparison between EMTCT and MNTE presented here
is quite limited. This could be strengthened by describing differences between the
two in more detail, such as providing actual window periods and giving more
technical descriptions of modes of transmission and interventions.
First paragraph, last sentence: The listing of PMTCT interventions in this
sentence is comprehensive, but difficult to read and doesn’t provide much depth.
Suggest re-writing, and describing the interventions in a little more detail.
Second paragraph: Some description of the sensitivity analysis would be
helpful to introduce the approach before providing the results.
Second paragraph, third to last sentence: The sentence starting, “At a
maternal HIV prevalence…” is unclear. Please rewrite.
Third paragraph: This paragraph in particular seems underdeveloped:
o
The proposed key targets for recognition of progress are listed briefly
without providing justification, definitions, or descriptions.
o
The measurement of a number of the indicators seems beyond the scope of
most surveillance and monitoring and evaluation activities, making routine
assessment of indicators improbable.
o
It is not clear that these milestones would be any more achievable than the
EMTCT indicators.
o
The scaling system seems to be arbitrary, and it is unclear whether the
proposed coverage level categories have any epidemiological/clinical significance.
o
Finally, the larger EMTCT monitoring and validation framework includes
process indicators and targets that overlap with the proposed indicators, such as
family planning and antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage indicators. It is unclear
if the authors took the existing indicators into account when formulating the
additional indicators proposed in this paper.
Text Box 1:
Recommend reviewing and rewriting the “Elimination as a Public Health
Problem” bullet. The text for this bullet does not match the style of previous bullets,
and a comma seems to be misplaced in the last sentence.
Tables and Figure:
Table 1: Recommend reformatting the first row, “Cause and course of the
disease.” The text is very dense and difficult to read. Suggest separating cause of

disease and course of disease, and possibly going even further to separating out
transmission, treatment, and prevention.
Table 1: The EMTCT description in “Cause and course of the disease” has
some inconsistencies and errors, including use and definition of acronyms, an extra
period at the end of the second sentence, and a typo in the 5th sentence (“Mortality
amongst untreated HIV infected infants in high…”). I would also recommend
hyphenating “HIV-infected” and “HIV-exposed.”
Table 1: The EMTCT description in “Cause and course of the disease” defines
the acronym “ART” as “antiroviral drugs.” The more conventional approach is to use
the acronym “ARVs.” Also, “antiretroviral drugs” is mentioned in other rows, so
please use “ARVs” consistently throughout the table.
Table 1: In “Elimination strategies” for MNTE, there is an extra “of” in
strategy #2.
Table 1: In “Validation criteria for elimination” for EMTCT, the first bullet
under “Impact indicator criteria” repeats “case rate” a few times. Suggest removing
“(case rate)” at the end of the first sentence.
Table 1: Please ensure the list of acronyms at the bottom of the table is
complete and consistent with the table.
Table 2: Recommend reformatting to make the table more readable. Also,
suggest making the heading for case rate simply “Case rate per 100,000 live births”
and place the case rate definition as a footnote.
Table 3: Recommend reformatting. The presentation of the scaling system
seems unnecessary, as well as the text boxes above the table.
