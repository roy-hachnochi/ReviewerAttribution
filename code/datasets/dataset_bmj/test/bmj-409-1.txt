This study examines the association between vegetarianism and risk of IHD and stroke.
Strengths include its prospective design, large sample size and the high representation of vegetarianism
in this cohort, making it very suitable to study this quesion.
However, this reseach question has been previously studied in this cohort. The authors indicate this in
the introduction, but it is insufficiently explained what exactly this additional paper adds. The previous
study stems from 2013; how much follow-up has been added; how many cases? It should be clearly
explained what this study adds to the previous one and the additional literature.
Other comments;
1. The dietary assessment is described in the methods, but no information is provided on whether the
FFQ was validated. Against what? And what was the outcome?
2. No information is provided in the methods about how confounders were assessed. This should be
briefly described.
3. In senstivity analyses missing values were imputed by multiple imputation, but no mention is made of
how many missing values variables had. This should be reported.
4. An important limitation of the study is the use of one baseline FFQ only with a long follow-up duration.
Perhaps a sensitivity analysis should be done to account for this by truncating follow-up after 5-7 years
or so.
5. When reporting nutriÃ«nt intakes it would be of interest to see sodium intake if available. Although this
cannot be sufficiently captured by a FFQ, the sodium intake from diet (excluding added salt) could be
informative. For the foods it would be good to report legume intake as this is an important substitute for
meat.
