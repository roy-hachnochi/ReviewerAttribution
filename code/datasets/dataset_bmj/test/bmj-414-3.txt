This is an interesting review of the various disclosure laws and how they may currently be interpreted.
However, I would have liked to see more substantive suggestions on how to effectively function under
current laws. Providing just the problem does little to advance the practice of apology and disclosure.
Though briefly stated there was no clear connection to how different disclosure practices improve patient
safety, quality improvement, patient experience and staff experience. There is a lot in the literature
suggesting that even an apology that includes admission of guilt may reduce the amount and frequency
of settlements. When a patient has been knowingly harmed by not following standard of care the focus
should be on the patient and/or their family not on a concern that an apology may be admissible. This
article does a nice job of laying out current laws but does not provide enough guidance for providers to
navigate this difficult reality.
