Some of the information presented is useful, but there is too much information
which results in the manuscript being too overwhelming and losing the interest of
the reader. The manuscript needs to be shortened if it is to retain the interest of the
reader. Perhaps the manuscript should just focus on the high quality of evidence
nutrients/foods.
This is an extremely long article comprising 30 pages before the Tables and 141
pages with Figures, Tables and Supplementary material. Table 1 is 11 pages long.
Most of the paragraphs are very long. Because of the length of the manuscript, it
becomes tedious. There is quite a lot of repetition of words in the results section.
The manuscript would be enhanced by concentrating on a briefer list of
foods/nutrients, rather than including them all. For example, breast feeding is
probably not necessary, nor are most of the micronutrients. The Supplementary
Figures could be plotted with more Figures on a page to shorten the manuscript.
Most of the associations are relatively small. Where summary relative risks are
calculated for an increase in serving size, these serving sizes seem to be rather
large, emphasizing that the original relative risks were very small.
Some sentences are difficult to understand as they do not conform to traditional
English rules. There are some grammatical errors. Sentences should not begin with
a numerical number. The number written as a word is acceptable. 'Vegetable' not
'Vegatable' on page 41.
