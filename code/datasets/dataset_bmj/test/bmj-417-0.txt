A excellent and thorough assessment of the published literature supporting the allocation of
supplemental funds to hospitals to cover the costs of selected new technologies, including devices and
drugs. I found the paper to be exceptionally clearly written and the underlying literature analysis to be
comprehensive and commendable.
