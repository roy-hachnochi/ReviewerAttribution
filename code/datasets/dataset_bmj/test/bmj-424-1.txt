While I have studied migrant health polices (see below), it is not the main focus of my
research. The bulk of my reviewing has been for social science journals, for more
empirically and theoretically oriented pieces rather than medical journal commentaries. I
note this so that you can contextualize my comments, which may be more or less useful
for this kind of endeavor. I find this article to be interesting and useful.
I didn’t find much evidence from the Latin American region, which is the one I know best.
I wrote a paper on this with Koen Voorend in Journal of International Migration and
Integration talking about how countries deny/extend access to migrants in the context of
international imperatives and local policy domains. I think the authors can find some cites
there and it also addresses the issue that authors argue: that is, often universalism is
seen as connoting access for citizens of nationals, since national governments are
providers, and migrants are often left out. I also found the issue of cost as the main
argument interesting, in fact I think most opponents would argue it’s an issue of rights
and deservedness: who has a right to make claims on the state (note, I am not agreeing
with this logic, but I do think it’s the prominent one). Of-course this is related to cost but
I think an important one to note: it is a social/cultural logic, less an economic one.
To that effect, I would like a little more engagement with how international organizations
(the authors discuss the SDGs) are shaping national responses to migrants: making
universal coverage an imperative but also promoting privatization in some instances, etc. I
talk some about these policy tools in my recent book Banking on Health.
Altogether this is a timely and interesting piece.
