Vaccine safety is of paramount importance because usually (but not always)
vaccines are given to healthy populations to prevent a nebulous concept of disease
(eg childhood vaccines and HPV vaccine). Certain vaccines are not in this paradigm
and this difference does need to be mentioned in the article. The concepts of
vaccination practice and vaccination pharmacovigilance are inextricably entwined in
the article, which means that the authors implicitly base vaccination policy more on
vaccine safety than vaccine effectiveness. It is critical that this article itself does not

undermine public confidence in the vaccination system by innuendo that the system
is not looking at safety seriously.
Overall this article mixes the individual and population level aspects of vaccine
pharmacovigilance and falls short of suggesting how their proposed next steps might
be realised. For example, where there is no or little clinical consensus on the
diagnosis of a syndrome, it is unrealistic to expect standard or even augmented
pharmacovigilance measures for vaccines to detect a small increase in such a
syndrome. It is also currently unrealistic to expect that the population based
vaccination program would be able to consider susceptible individual genotypes
especially as such genotyping is not current practice - ie these cases and the
genotype have been discovered after the vaccination and there is no way to
determine whether the POTS/other syndrome would have occurred without the
vaccine. Therefore it is not clear exactly what the authors propose as a realistic
change to vaccination practice.
Additionally, the authors should note that reasons for vaccination against infectious
diseases (eg childhood diseases and flu) may be different than reasons for
vaccination against disease such as HPV, and this may have an impact on the
personal choice exercised.
Specific comments are below
Page 1: Please revise lines 27 to 31 which contains a definition of pharmacovigilance
which is not really complete, and is really a definition of signal detection.
Pharmacovigilance is partly hypothesis generating, but this is really the signal
detection part of pharmacovigilance rather than the discipline in its entirety.
Pharmacovigilance also includes hypothesis testing, and is much more than just the
post marketing part of drug safety. The definition given also conflicts with the better
explanation later in the paragraph.
Page 2: Paragraph 3 is unclear. Is it suggesting that all early cases were of postural
orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or is this simply an example? please clarify
Page 3: Given the current state of knowledge please clarify how "further
investigations to elucidate risk factors for adverse events following immunisation"
might be realised. This seems to be based on a single case report and it is not clear
what might be improved at present. if it is anticipated that this might be "future
knowledge" then this should be stated more clearly.
Page 4: "These signals for the HPV vaccines" presumably does not apply to GBS, but
to the POTS discussion, please clarify. Please also dissociate this sentence from the
discussion on novel adjuvants as it is not clear how or why these aspects have been
related in this paragraph.
Please also comment on/amend the following sentence as it is in the current tense
and should probably be in the future tense. “A recent review in the journal Vaccine
describes a new era of ‘‘predictive vaccinology”. In this new paradigm, the
traditional concept in vaccination policy that ‘‘one size and dose fits all” is
abandoned as we acquire the ability to make predictions for each individual:
predictions regarding the likelihood of production of a protective response (benefit)
and the likelihood of a significant AEFI”
I think this should be attenuated as follows “A recent review in the journal Vaccine
describes a new era of ‘‘predictive vaccinology”. In this new paradigm, the
traditional concept in vaccination policy that ‘‘one size and dose fits all” may be
updated as we acquire the ability to make predictions for each individual: predictions
regarding the likelihood of production of a protective response (benefit) and the
likelihood of a significant AEFI”
