Zhao, Veeranki, Magnussen & Zi reported in their population-based cohort study that U.S.
adults who achieve the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines (both leisure time aerobic physical
activity as well as muscle-strengthening activity) have significant reduced risk of all-cause
and specific cause mortality. Using 18 waves of National Health Interview Surveys with
linkage to the National Death Index records, they quantified participant self-reported
physical activity and categorized populations into categories of adherence to the
guidelines: meeting strength only, aerobic only, and both guidelines, or neither. The results
are applicable to a scope of populations evident in their subgroup analyses. The manuscript
was well written and the data sources and analyses are well described. The statistical
analyses are appropriate. The end result is a high quality, easy to read and generalizable
study. I have provided some very minor suggestions below.

Comments

Page 2: Abstract
- Change PA to Physical activity and specify in brackets PA
- In describing the exposures specific that amount of PA is per week
- It would enhance the stand-alone utility of the abstract if the authors could find the word
space to include what ‘sufficient strengthening’ is defined as.

- Line 18 – ‘In contrast’ is not needed/appropriate term here. Suggest removing.
Page 5:
- Line 43/33: what is the relevance of 19,125 in 2008 when data is used starting in 1997?
Please update or clarify.
- It is not clear at what point or how often the questions about PA were asked. Is each
person in the dataset from 1997 to 2014 only asked about PA once? Also some clarification
on whether the questions about PA made reference to their typical habits in the past x time
frame or current habits etc would be helpful. If the questions did not specific a time frame
then this should be mentioned. Otherwise the description of the PA data is very clearly
described.

- Line 9/10: consider removing ‘up’ from “writing up of the manuscript”
- Paragraph 2, ‘population characteristics’: mentioned proportion of participants who
engaged in highest activity but not the lowest. While both are available in the Table, this
would be an interesting descriptive comparison for the reader.

- If word limit allows, a description of some of the important findings from the sub-group
analyses would be a helpful addition.

- Line35-37: Should either include a reference or soften the boldness of this statement
around increased literacy and policies and high likelihood of promotion of physical activity.
