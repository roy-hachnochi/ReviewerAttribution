The authors have examined risk of type 2 diabetes in two large databases with use of 5 alpha reductase
inhibitors or tamsulosin. The manuscript is well written overall, from a well respected group and led by
a clear hypothesis.
It would read that the results were unexpected in that the original hypothesis , led by their human
studies, was that dutasteride but not finasteride would increase risk of T2DM. By contrast they find that
both dutasteride and finasteride were associated with increased risk relative to tamsulosin.
Discussion of this Page 19 lines 29-51 seemed the least compelling part of the paper. The results given,
and their previous short term human data (their ref 8), are discrepant and this is discussed quite briefly.
Given that androgen deprivation therapy increases risk of diabetes would it not also be possible that a
more general antiandrogen effect is the mechanism rather than effects on 5 alpha reductase 1? Given
the discrepancy I felt that this part of discussion needed more space and consideration.
One alternate hypothesis (that tamsulosin was protective rather than the 5 alpha reductase inhibitors
having adverse effect) is dealt with on Page 18 lines 9- 40 and with further data analysis in
supplements. It is stated that “Significantly, patients receiving combination therapy with tamsulosin and
5α-reductase inhibitors also had the same increased risks of T2DM compared with tamsulosin alone.”

I would have thought that the key analysis here would be of patients on combination of 5 alpha
reductase and tamsulosin vs tamsulosin alone . This could have been more clearly presented: the
comparison in table 2 of “total finasteride and dutasteride” is described as “ receiving 5α-reductase
inhibitor either alone or in combination with tamsulosin” vs tamsulosin . The comparison asked for
would appear to be the groups in Supplementary table S2 but Supplementary table S5 is again given as
“Total”. One point of this would be the need for clearer direction to specific parts of the
supplementaries.
Minor issues
Duration of BPH- how defined – seems unlikely that drug prescribed after 14 days of BPH?
