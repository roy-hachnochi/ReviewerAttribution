The authors performed a nationwide population-based study to investigate the risk of type 2 diabetes
mellitus (DM) after the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) therapy for benign prostate hyperplasia
(BPH). Based on the data, the authors suggest that therapy with 5ARI may increase the risk of type 2
DM in the BPH patients. This is an interesting study and it can be published after some revision.
Strengths of this study:
1
Large randomized sample size.
2
Data about the patients are obtained from a national database and this leads to a well accurate
data collection with STROBE Statement.
Specific comments:
1
Comparing the BPH patients treated by 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor alone and those by
tamsulosin alone is not reasonable. Because:
1.1
In real-world practice, using 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor alone is mainly to BPH patients without
severe LUTS. This is why the IQR of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor alone groups in Table 1 and 3 is shorter
than tamsulosin alone group.

1.2
No matter in the UK or in Taiwan, these two groups (5-alpha-reductase inhibitor alone and
tamsulosin alone) are different in disease severity. In the UK, according to the NICE guideline, not only
the combination of an alpha-blocker and a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor but also alpha-blocker (alfuzosin,
doxazosin, tamsulosin or terazosin) is suggested to men with moderate to severe LUTS. In Taiwan, the
NHIâ€™s 5ARI reimbursement criteria before 2013 were (1) moderate to severe signs and symptoms (IPSS
>7) of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) after alpha 1-adrenergic blockers treatment, a maximum urine
flow rate of less than 15ml/sec or an enlarged prostate volume of more than 20 mL as measured by
transrectal ultrasound, (2) excluding the possibility of prostate cancer, and (3) good response to the
5ARI (maximum urine flow rate increased or prostate volume decreased) in the first year of treatment.
Patients must meet all three criteria for 5ARI treatment.
The authors should correct this big bias.
2.
There many alpha-blockers (alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin or terazosin) for treatment to BPH
patients. The authors should explain why they selected the patient treated with tamsulosin into this
study, not the patient treated with doxazosin or other alpha-blockers.
3.
The blood glucose levels or various DM-related risk information of the subjects before and after
5ARI use was not available for calculation.
4.

Please describe the potential side effects or possible drug-drug interaction of 5ARIs.
