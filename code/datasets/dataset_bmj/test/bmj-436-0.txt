Title: Sugary drink consumption and cancer risk: results from NutriNet-Sante prospective
cohort
Review comments:
The topic of research is interesting and the manuscript is well written. Due to the challenges
present in the nutritional epidemiological studies, the findings should be interpreted with
caution. I have listed minor revisions (/suggestions) to improve the quality of the article.
Also, I have a few queries that require further clarification.
Abstract:
The number of breast cancer cases reported in the abstract was 683. However, the number
reported in table 1 and appendix 4 was 693.
Materials and Methods:
Page 7 of 33: data collection
Study individuals’ dietary intake pattern will be different during weekdays and weekends, as
well as by season. Details on weighted average accounting for intake variation by the
above-mentioned factors need to be addressed in this section.

1)
It is not clear whether the authors have excluded participants with prevalent heart
disease or diabetes at baseline that would possibly result in a changed diet. If not excluded,
the number (%) of participants with existing disease condition should be reported in table 1
and these variables should be adjusted for in the multivariable models.
2)
The authors have mentioned that under-reporters of energy intake were excluded;
How many participants reported extreme energy intake levels?

3)
Absolute daily amount of sugary drink intake was used in the data analyses. What
was the observed correlation between sugary drinks and energy intake in this study
population? Why density models (for examples, daily amount per 1000kcal as continuous,
and sex-specific tertiles created based on these energy-adjusted intake values as categories)
were not considered for data analyses? Would you expect the results to be similar?
4)
Previous epidemiological studies have suggested possible association between heavy
smoking and increased intake of sugar and sugary drinks. It is unclear whether the authors
have investigated the associations in this study.

1) Appendix 3 - The distribution plots suggest some outliers (data skewed to the right). As
sex-specific tertiles were used in the data analyses, it will be useful to present sex-specific
intake distribution of sugary drinks.
2) Please check the total number of breast cancer cases.
3) Could you tabulate the associations between consumption sugary drinks (total, sub-types,
and 100% fruit juice) and visceral adiposity index
Tables.
Table 1:
Dietary intake data (such as sugary drinks, sugar and alcohol) were highly skewed.
Reporting median (inter-quartile range) will be useful for these dietary variables.
Table 2:
1) I assume No refers to No (number of cases/non-cases).
2) * multivariable models adjusted for sex (in models for overall, colorectal cancer ONLY).
3) Did the main model include total energy intake or energy intake without alcohol?
4) I am not sure why other important confounding variables such as dietary variables,
medical history, and visceral adiposity index were not adjusted for in the main model.
5) If possible, table 2 and appendix 4 can be combined.
Appendix 4:
Appendix 4 presents the association between categories of sugary drinks and cancer risk.
The following footnote is not relevant here: †For sugary drinks overall, 100% fruit juices and
sugary drinks except 100% fruit juices, hazard ratio are given for an increase of 100mL/d.
