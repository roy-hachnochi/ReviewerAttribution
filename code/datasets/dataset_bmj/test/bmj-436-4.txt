The authors investigated the association of sugary drinks and ASB with cancer risk in this
manuscript. The topic is relevant to current discussions of nutritional recommendations and
policy actions and the manuscript is well-written overall. Some additional analyses and
discussion points might help augment the conclusion, as well as clarify the novelty of the
current findings.
1)
In the box on p.2, the authors mostly discussed prior evidence relevant to
cardio-metabolic risk, although this is relevant to potential mechanisms linking SSB to
cancer risk, some brief summary of existing evidence on cancer risk and limitations would
help readers appreciate the novelty of this work in addition to existing studies, since many
previous studies did report an increased risk for adiposity and obesity related cancers.
2)
Under what this study adds, the result for ASB could also be added even if itâ€™s not
significant, if this was also a novel finding.
3)
Both in the what this study adds box and the abstract, it should be clarified that
sugary drinks included 100% fruit juice.
4)
In the first paragraph of the introduction, a brief definition of summary exposure
value would be helpful.
5)
The participants were included in the analyses only if they had at least two 24 hour
dietary records. Because SSB or ASB consumption might vary by day of the week, it is
possible that the use of two records might not be an accurate representation of regular
consumption, especially both days happened to fall on weekdays or weekend days. When the
analyses was restricted to people who have at least six records (Model 13 in Appendix 6),
the point estimates were noticeably different, and the association between 100% fruit juice
and all cancers did not appear to be statistically significant. This could indicate that bias was
present in the main results as currently shown.
6)
On p.6, what was the proportion of participants in the cohort who agreed to provide
biological samples and bio-impedance measurements?
7)
The results for SSB was presented as per 100 ml/day, but for ASB was presented as
per 10 ml/day. The rationale for this difference should be clarified, and it would also be
helpful to specify the units in the methods section. ASB can often be considered as direct
substitutions for SSBS, but given the difference in unit, side by side comparisons of the
effect sizes of the different beverage types was not possible. Presenting the results of risk by
tertiles of ASB consumption might be helpful.
8)
In the NutriNet-Sante cohort, consumption of SSB excluding fruit juice, fruit juice,
and ASB seem to correlated (Table 1), a mutually adjusted model adjusted model would
therefore appear warranted to rule out the confounding effects of the different beverage
types, when studying the individual beverages.
9)
The authors reported that the relation between sugar drinks and overall cancer risk
was not significant when the main model was adjusted for sugar from sugar drinks, which
also suggest that sugar from sugar drinks is at least partly contributing to the association
between sugary drinks and cancer risk. Results from this model could be discussed alongside
the results for per 10g increased daily intake of sugar from sugary drinks on p.11. Since
both models are relevant to the discussion, it might also be helpful to present both sets of
results as well.
10)
Based on the current text, it appears that baseline BMI only was used in the
modelling, although information on weight was collected every 6 months. This might be a
limitation, since BMI could have changed even during the initial two year period of dietary
recall, therefore resulting in a mismatch between the timeframe of exposure and covariate
adjustment. Also, has self-reported weight in the study been validated previously, perhaps

against the bio-impedance measures? Additionally, the appropriateness and possible
limitations of using BMI as an indicator of adiposity could be further discussed.
11)
The covariates imputed for by multiple imputation should be clarified. The
manuscript text suggested that all covariates were imputed for, but Appendix 6 indicated
imputation was only done for physical activity and education.
12)
Since many exposures, covariates, and outcomes were based on self-report
measures, the possibility of bias due to misreporting should be acknowledged.
13)
Total fat is a very heterogeneous macronutrient group, have the authors considered
adjusting for saturated fats, and mono- or poly-unsaturated fats instead?
14)
In Appendix 5, p-value for heterogeneity across the strata might be helpful for
interpreting the stratified results. The authors presumably showed stratified results only for
all cancers and breast cancer because the main results were significant only for these two
outcomes? However, it is plausible that if there were significant heterogeneity between
SSB/ASB and risk of prostate or colorectal cancer by obesity status, it might be masked in
the main model which would be adjusted to the mean BMI. Therefore, it might be worthwhile
to also show the stratified results for prostate and colorectal cancer as well.
