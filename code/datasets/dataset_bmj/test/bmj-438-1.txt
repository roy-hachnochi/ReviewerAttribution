This article reads like an introduction chapter in a book. It presents a thorough review of the literature
and concisely describes organizational factors contributing to quality improvement. However, I fail to

see how it contributes something new to the literature. It has no guiding theoretical framework,
presents no original research, and does not propose any new framework. Furthermore, the article is
written at a high level so there is very little practical offered.
