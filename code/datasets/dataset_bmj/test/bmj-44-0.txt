The authors have responded to all comments. Just a couple of relatively minor points:
1. It is usual to give estimate and ci, and not just p-value, in the abstract. Hence, the
estimated percentage difference and ci should be added to the sentence that has been
inserted re comparison of traditional and non-traditional criteria (p=0.001).
2. The authors have changed the OR for the Leiden index to represent an increase of 50
points as suggested. The tables need to make clear that the OR given are for 50 points and
not still 1.
