This is a fantastic paper, well written and comprehensive. I very much enjoyed reading it
and believe it is good to publish as is. Below I have added some comments as
supplementary thoughts that the authors may want to consider at their discretion.
• A good reference the authors may be interested to include is a report by the US
Department of Commerce published in 2004 which argues that price deregulation
internationally is good, particularly for US consumers, as it stimulates access and innovation.
It also models how much more foreign countries can expect to pay for drugs with and
without price controls. It gives some perspective about the origins of the current challenges
we face. See Pharmaceutical Price Controls in OECD Countries Implications for U.S.
Consumers, Pricing, Research and Development, and Innovation
(https://2016.trade.gov/td/health/DrugPricingStudy.pdf)
• I think it is quite clear now that prices have nothing to do with R&D. For instance, PhRMA
(the US industry lobby group) in 2017 required members to have an R&D to global sales
ratio of only 10% (see https://www.phrma.org/advocacy/research-development). This would
suggest that even if R&D cost zero, prices would only drop a maximum of about 10% if it is
true that it is directly related to R&D (assuming most companies sit around this threshold).

• Another complicating factor are attempts to accelerate access to medicines in order to
stimulate innovation by making it easier to get the drugs licensed and funded. While in
theory showing a willingness to pay may stimulate innovation, as Fojo et al state, it may in
fact undermine innovation by setting the bar of success too low
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25068501).
• A discussion that needs to be had in this space is to what extent are “unfair” prices a sign
of governments attempting to prop up an industry of critical importance to many developed
economies due to its employment of a large number of highly skilled and well reimbursed
tax-payers (I’ve tried to address this very briefly elsewhere
https://theconversation.com/faster-access-to-new-drugs-doesnt-always-mean-better-treatm
ent-74369 ). It is worthwhile noting that when we look at measures of drug innovation that
go beyond pure count data (e.g. number of drugs approved or patents issued), and look at
actual clinical impact or economic outcomes, the trend doesn’t look very healthy (See
Kesselheim et al https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23722626).
• Related to the above is the concerning trend of politicising and judicalising health
technology assessment, and making decisions on the basis of lobbying rather than science.
Herceptin (See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18515778 ) and Orkambi (See
https://www.wsj.com/articles/costly-drug-vertex-is-denied-and-medicaid-patients-sue-1405
564205 ) come to mind. This can make it harder for governments and private payers to deny
access, and coerce them to perhaps accept prices they wouldn’t have otherwise. E.g. Via the
UK Cancer Drug fund drugs which were denied by NICE at a cheaper price were reimbursed
at a much higher price (See
https://theconversation.com/if-we-dont-talk-about-value-cancer-drugs-will-become-terminal
-for-health-systems-44072).
• While patient advocates often focus on pressuring payers to fund expensive medicines
because they are soft targets, there are promising moves in the other direction with the
establishment of the Patients for Affordable Drugs website to lobby for industry to reduce
prices (https://www.patientsforaffordabledrugs.org/ ). I believe that in the current
environment where consumers have an ever increasing say in policy decisions, fair pricing
won’t be achieved without mobilising countervailing forces amongst consumer groups.
