This paper provides a useful contribution to understanding optimal strategies for asthma
management. It is useful to asthma patients and medical professionals because it employs
a rigorous selection criteria in order to consolidate available evidence from over 100 trials.
The findings in the paper resonate with me as a patient because regularly supported
self-management is a practice that helps me to manage my asthma symptoms effectively.
However, I have had contact with several clinicians who have exhibited varying attitudes to
the importance of having an action plan in place. Iâ€™m glad this paper is reinforcing the
importance of action plans as a strategy for asthma management, however, there is a lot
of work that needs to be done to achieve consistency in the asthma care provided by
professionals.
It was great to see that the authors controlled for asthma severity and mentioned some
key differences that they found in their summary of findings. I would have liked them to
draw out this discussion a bit more, e.g. hypothesise as to why they found differences and
mention some implications for how this can be dealt with in practice.
The concern they expressed about the use of apps for logging symptoms without any
advice on how to respond if deterioration occurs is a useful point. The authors ought to
recommend that app developers take this into careful consideration. I feel that apps can
provide patients with a false sense of security.
My main concern about the paper is that because it is largely supportive of current
guidelines it could be unlikely to have any great impact. I feel that the authors need to
address more clearly what their ambition is for the paper, what they want it to achieve for
patients and how they wish for it to change policy and practice.
