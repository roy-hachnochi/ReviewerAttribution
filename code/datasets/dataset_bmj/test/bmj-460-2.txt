This is a very good piece of research, the methods (laboratory, clinical confirmation, ascertainment of
disease, statistical analysis) are well explained and applied, making the results very valid.
I only have two comments:

1)
Although there might not be enough cases of adenosquamous cell carcinoma (ASC) or the other
rare types (RICC), the age categories of 30 to 60 and above 60 are not intuitive, can the authors
produce a table with at least three age-groups, for instance: 30-39, 40-49 and 50 over?, or better
discuss the lack of power to conduct such analysis?
2)
Only 12% (41 of 338 cases including 31 less than 30y) were screen-detected (Table 1) while
56% of ASC and RICC (172 of 307 cases over 30y) attended screening (Table 2), however most of them
were not detected by the screening process since these types of cancers are more aggressive and
progress rapidly. The main results show that there is a risk reduction of developing ASC and RICC on
women who attend screening, however, most cases are symptomatic and not screen-detected, can the
authors discuss this further?
Apart from these comments, I think the manuscript is very valuable for the scientific audience, and
should be published.
