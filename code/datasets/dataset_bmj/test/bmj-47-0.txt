The manuscript under revision is well executed and well written
During the current pandemic articles on cohorts of patients from countries that have the most
experience in battling this disease are worthwhile
And the main message regarding the duration of viral shedding in mild and severe Covid 19 patients and
the viral shedding in different excretions is clear and useful.
The statistical analysis is well executed and clearly described
I therefore regard this manuscript as potentially fit for publication
However, the main limitation of this manuscript is the limited information that is provided on medication
used in the different patient groups
There was a very high usage of steroids and antiviral drugs, which both could have dramatic effects on
viral dynamics and clinical outcome.
The authors do mention this in their limitation section, but in my view they need to include more data on
the different drugs used in their results section.
