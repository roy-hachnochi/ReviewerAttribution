The authors have addressed the points raised and I have just a few comments to make on the revised
manuscript:
1. Although the authors have not addressed the query re meta-regression to identify factors associated
with mRDT uptake (which as they state needs to be considered for interpretation), in the discussion
they do warn against over-interpretation of the meta-analysis point estimate as this is a combination of
data across highly variable epidemiological settings. Hence the decision to not proceed with metaregression is reasonable.
2. The range of RRs (Figure 1 and table 3), page 12, ranged from 0.65 to 2.98, not 1.03 to 2.98. Whilst
I understand that the range given is of those with higher prescription rate where mRDTs were
introduced, the current presentation might be misleading and the sentence should be modified.
3. What is the rationale for excluding the two trials which compared data from randomised intervention
groups after mRDT implementation to baseline data? It should be clarified in the text that they are
excluded and why.

4. Please clarify the methods for combining individual and cluster randomised trials within the metaanalysis. Were clinics accounted for in the cluster trials?
