General:
The authors report the proportion of major birth defects whose causes were known and unknown while considering morphology
and pathogenesis. Cell-free DNA screening for fetal aneuploidy has been widely used in recent years, and therefore the
estimated proportions on genetic causes, trisomies especially, using data collected almost 10 years ago may not be applicable
to current status.
Specific:
1. It is not clear how information on environmental causes for a specific case was obtained. In the textbook “Catalog of
teratogenic agents” by Thomas H. Sheperd and Ronald J. Lemire, 13th edition, proven human teratogenic agents include 3
types of radiation, 9 types of infection, 12 maternal conditions, and 36 drugs or environmental chemicals. Were all or most of
these agents were inquired from a case with birth defects? If not, underestimation of known causes will be substantial.

2. For genetic causes, were all cases or a group of specific cases received the same laboratory workup? If not, the estimated
know genetic causes will be underestimated or biased. Information on how do physicians order laboratory workup for patients
with birth defects in the participating hospitals should be provided.
3. What is the age range and distribution of fetuses/infants when they received genetic assessment? Later assessment will
tend to identify more genetic causes, but not environmental causes.
