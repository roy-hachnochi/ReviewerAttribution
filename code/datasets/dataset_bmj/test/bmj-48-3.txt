General remarks:
This is a large study with the main subject of validation and comparison of different models
for prediction of malignancy of ovarian mass. The study included 4905 patients and 978
malignant tumors and was performed in the hands of trained ultrasonographers. Overall
clinical utility of models was highest for ADNEX especially with Ca125 and SRRisk and
lowest for RMI.
RMI is a wide used model for reference to oncologic center and also for selection of
surgery. This study clearly showed, that IOTA models might have a higher clinical value
than RMI and this is a very clinical relevant information, that may change the diagnostic
set-up in gynecological praxis. The manuscript is well written, and only a small numbers of
changes is suggested.
The strength of this study was several investigators in several centers, sample size, and
use of predefined ultrasound terms according to protocol. Moreover adnex masses not
treated with surgery were included.
However, patients were prospectively included by a few trained sonographers in each
center, and not all patients with masses in each center were included. Inclusion was
prospective, but details of not included patients were not given, although centers with a
low numbers of included patients/ high numbers of not included patients were excluded.
Details of included and not included patients would increase the value of this study.
Selection bias cannot be excluded and lower efficiency of the different models is possible,
and should be discussed.
However, validation and comparison of the different models may only be slightly dependent
on this possible bias and is at least highly valid in this population. Difference between
ADNEX MODEL and RMI was significant in premenopausal women, not in postmenopausal,
which also needs to be addressed.
Centers were encouraged to measure the level of serum CA125 in all patients, but this was
not a requirement for inclusion in the study. Measurement of CA125 was left to clinical
judgment and local protocols, which is a weakness of the study. Information on CA125 was
missing in 2620 of the 4905 (53%) patients. Some outcomes were labelled uncertain and
hence missing. Multiple imputation was used to address missing values. The imputations
were based on variables used as predictors in the models, and variables that are associated
with CA125 or with outcome or with their missingness. Evaluation of the complex multiple
imputation performed in this study is performed by a statistician and is beyond my statistic
experience, but seems to be relevantly performed. However, almost half the patients had
multiple imputation of Ca125, which is a weakness, when ADNEX with ca-125 is
emphasized as the best model- please discuss.
Inclusion of masses, that not were treated surgically with a reasonable follow-up period
was also a strength of this study. However, 20% of masses were malignant, which is
higher than in women generally observed with adnex masses, which also should be
addressed in discussion.
Statistics analysis with subgroup analysis of AUC and calibration curves, and in addition
analysis of each center is impressive and comprehensive.

Abstract:
Median age at recruitment was 48 years (range 18-98)- not an information important to
include in abstract.
Overall clinical utility measured by Net Benefit was highest for ADNEX and SRRisk
and lowest for RMI. Why not include AUC for SRRisk in abstract?
“Conclusion: ADNEX is the best model to discriminate between benign and malignant
masses in all patients presenting with an adnexal mass including those managed
conservatively.”
It seems better than RMI, but why is better than SRRisk based on your results? There is no
significant difference? Moreover, in the subgroup of postmenopausal women there are no

statistical significant difference in AUC between ADNEX with Ca125 and RMI. Could you
reword conclusion ?

Results:
First section of results can be shortened, details in tables and figures is not needed in text.
Please restrict to most important information to simplify reading.
Page 14 first section of results line 18 to 60. Several details are given both in text and
tables and can be shortened.
The sentence:”The SR binary classification had an overall sensitivity of 90% (86% to 94%)
and specificity of 87% (83% to 91%)”.This is unclear please reword
Table 4 : p-values for ROC comparison would be optimal in legend
Figure 2: p-values for ROC comparison in legend would simplify comparison
“In every subgroup, RMI had the lowest overall AUC and ADNEX with CA125 the highest
(Figure 5, Supplementary Table 6). Notably, among the 1958 patients with at least one
follow-up scan, the overall AUC was 0.76 for RMI and ranged from 0.87 to 0.89 for the
IOTA models. Due to the low malignancy rate (2%) in this subgroup, the confidence
interval around the AUC was wide. Calibration analysis indicated that the risk of malignancy
was overestimated in this subgroup (Supplementary Figures 19-34).”
There was significant difference in premenopausal, but not postmenopausal between RMI
and ADNEX with ca125- this should be described in results and included in discussion.
The comprehensive evaluation of calibration is well described
“ADNEX with CA125 had an overall calibration intercept of 0.19 (-0.01 to 0.40) and a slope
of 1.11 (0.98 to 1.25). Risk estimates were slightly underestimated (Figure 3). Calibration
of SRRisk was slightly better, that of LR2 was poorer.”
There is no significant difference in AUC between ADNEX with ca-125 and SRrisk – but
SRrisk was better calibrated, please motivate more clearly the preference of ADNEX with
Ca125 as compared to the other IOTA models in discussion
Heterogeneity between the different centers was considerable, but smallest for ADNEX with
Ca125. Please try to explain heterogeneity in discussion. How will you expect the
performance will be in the hands of common clinicians compared to RMI? How much
learning is needed to implement ADNEX in general gynecologic praxis and are we ready to
implement ADNEX in gynecologic praxis based on this study?
