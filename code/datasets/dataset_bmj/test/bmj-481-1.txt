This is a very good, succinct summary of the vital role grassroots organizations can
and should play in advancing the SDGs. Three points:
1. As with most discussions on this topic there is a failure to point out the need for
legal remedies when all else fails. We know this is difficult in many environments
but without any enforcement mechanisms attempts at accountability often fail.
2. There is some repetition of thought under the subheading Grassroots
Organizations, Accountability and the SDGs around lines 6-26. The authors may
want to review this.
3. Grassroots participation can be important not only for disadvantaged
communities. Of course, these are the ones most in need but social accountability
must cross all economic levels. The authors may want to think about instances
where this may be important, as is their mention of the need for grassroots linkages
with the elite and intermediary organizations.
Overall, however, an excellent piece. Clearly presented and well written.
Congratulations to the authors and keep up the good work!
