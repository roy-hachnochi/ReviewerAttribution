I am generally happy with the revisions made to the manuscript as the methods are now much clearer and the
discussion section of the report now gives more explanation of the limitations of these Mendelian randomisation
analyses. Some minor comments are:
1. For the observational association analyses reported on page 11 the analyses are only adjusted for age and sex.
Should they not also have been adjusted for assessment centre location?
2. On page 12 the authors report that the 69 genetics variants included for BMI only explained 1.5% of the
variance in BMI in the UKB participants despite having a very large F-statistic. Does this not cast some doubt on
the reliability of the genetically determined BMI associations with SES? This should be mentioned as part of the
discussion.
3. The sensitivity analyses using the BOLT-LMM method should be part of the main methods section rather than
the supplementary methods section.
4. In Supplementary tables 4A and 4B the observational associations with job class and annual household income
with height were stronger than the genetic associations. The converse was seen for BMI. Do the authors have an
explanation for these findings?
