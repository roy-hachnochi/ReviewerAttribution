This is an interesting study examining the association between potato consumption and diagnosed hypertension in three
cohorts – the Nurses’ Health Study I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-up study in the US. Appropriate adjustment is
made in the analysis for confounding by factors such as BMI and change in weight.
The introduction is too US centric for an international audience. It would be useful to refer to international. recommendations
(eg WHO recommendations about portions of fruit and vegetables state “Potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy
roots are not classified as fruits or vegetables” http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs394/en/ although FAO guidelines
do not.
The major limitation of the study is that the determination of hypertension based on self-report. While validation studies have
confirmed the positive predictive value of this against samples of measured blood pressure in the cohorts, they have not
confirmed the negative predictive value of this. Other studies have suggested an 89% NPV (Okura Y 2004). It should be
discussed that false negative individuals may have had lower educational background or income and this may have been
correlated diet.
The findings that participants who consumed 4 or more servings of potato chips per week had a lower risk of developing
hypertension in men in the HPFS and no association in the other two cohorts is puzzling. This is discussed. However the most
likely explanation is residual confounding. It is possible that sodium intake was poorly assessed in the food frequency
questionnaire (high variances from urinary sodium and potassium have been reported from FFQ especially in men who may
have been be less familiar with food preparation in the last century – eg Day N, McKeown N et al Int J Epidemiology 2001).
