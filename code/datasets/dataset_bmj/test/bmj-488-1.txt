Dijkstra et al. report the long-term (14-year) outcomes of CIN3+ and cervical cancer in the RCT, POBASCAM. The
study provides important evidence regarding the safety following a negative screen. That being said, there were
critical analyses and data that were not presented and needed to be:
1. It is well established that a single negative HPV test is twice as reassuring as negative Pap test, whatever the base
screening interval. What is not well known is how much more reassurance there is following two negative HPV tests vs.
the first.
2. The authors do not provide important stratified analyses by age. Nor do they look at outcomes such as
AIS/adenocarcinoma, which has been reported to be more poorly detected by Pap.
3. While there are three rounds of screening in this population, there must be a fourth screen to measure the
outcomes. How were women screened at “exit”?
4. The author should provide a detailed consort diagram of the trial, the number of outcomes by round of screening,
etc. It would also be useful to have the outcomes by result for the baseline screen, which was the main difference in
the two arms, presented rather than asking the reviewer to go back to the earlier papers. This all could be integrated
into a single consort diagram.
5. In Table 1, the authors need to also show the sub-groups for each negative result, since that is in whom the
differences really exist. So do not just present HPV- but also include Pap+ and Pap- strata. Conversely, for Pap-, HPV+
and HPV- strata should be presented. To that point, the control arm HPV- women (vs. HPV- women in the intervention
arm) should have more disease earlier on and be more reassuring later since some HPV-/Pap+ is being acted on. That
does not seem to be the case. Why?
