Thank you for the revised manuscript. My only remaining comment is that I believe the key paragraph on Eligibility
Criteria in Methods could be made even more clear. You now state that a criteria was that the studies were placebo
controlled, but I think it should say explicitly that studies were eligible if the control arm was treated with placebo + SU.
This is made clear otherwise throughout the manuscript, and it should be clearly stated here as well. Thank you.
