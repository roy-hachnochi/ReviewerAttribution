The AHA Get With The Guidelines Registry provides unique insights into the process and outcome of in-hopsital cardiac arrest.
The authors are to be commended using the power of this registry to attempt to answer an important question around the role
and timing of adrenaline in patients who sustain cardiac arrest in hospital as a consequence of ventricular fibrillation or
ventricular tachycardia.
This paper builds on their work in non-shockable rhythms published by the BMJ previously.
In the absence of randomised trials in this area, we will continue to rely on observational data. The key challenge in
observational studies is accuracy of the data collected for quality assurance purposes and the influence of un-measured
confounders. My questions aim to focus in these areas.
Main comments:
1) Peace 2015 reported wide variation in manual recordings of timing of drug administration (median discrepency 81s, range
70-110) and defibrillation timing (median 73 s). Please expand on the description of the accuracy of timings recorded in the
GWTG-R. Absolute time differences are likely to be less critical than those relative to each other for this analysis.
2) Prior to 2006 AHA guidelines recommended 3 stacked shocks initially, after which adrenaline was recommended. Berdowski
showed that it took 18 months to implement new CPR guidelines in their out of hospital setting. Is the registry able to
differentiate which set of guidelines were followed in individual cases? If it is not able to differentiate is it possible these
findings could be explained by differences in single versus stacked shocks (adrenaline being within 2 minutes for stacked
shocks)
3) 30% of patients were on a vasoactive drug infusion at the time of their cardiac arrest. Please clarify in the text if this was
adrenaline, other agent or unknown. Did it differ between groups?
4) It is unclear which time intervals are being compared. In some places it says < 2 minutes whilst in other places it says < 23 minutes. Soar et al (2006) indicates that 5 cycles of CPR takes 1 minute 45s. Therefore by 3 minutes 2-3 shocks would have
been likely to have been given. The correct analysis window would seem to be < 2 mins.
5) Were those who did not receive adrenaline grouped in with those who received later (guideline compliant) adrenaline? What
is the clinical rationale for this grouping as the logical grouping to me would seem to be (1) no adrenaline (2) early (< 2 min)
(3) late > 2 min? What are the findings if grouped in this way?
6) Which analyses (and data groupings i.e. < 2min, >2 min)) were defined a priori versus after exploring the data?

7) To a non-statistician figure 4 provides reassurance that the propensity matching has worked well. A thorough review by a
statistician will be critical to ensure what appears at face value to be valid stands up to rigorous statistical scrutiny.
Other comments:
1) Figure on page 28 - y axis label is unclear - do you mean < 2min rather than O min
2) Figure page 29 - epi versus no epi - Please clarify you mean early (< 2min) versus late (> 2min) rather than no epi
3) Table 2 - please check and correct the witnessed status number (%) for all patients (as it less than those in the epi / no epi
groups)
4) There seem to be more patients (2978) in Table e-1 than the 2974 reported in the CONSORT style diagram
