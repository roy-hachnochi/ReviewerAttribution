A very thorough investigation that shows that the situation is much more chaotic than I had thought. However, I am not
convinced that there is a way, given sufficient "head-to-head" comparisons, of finding one, or a few, superior risk-assessment
method(s) from among those available; this seems to be the unspoken belief driving the paper. I guess a lot of people have
their doubts about, eg QRISK2, despite its adoption in NICE guidelines, but at least it's a rough-and-ready, intuitively correct,
locally-acceptable approach (as ALL public-health measures can only be) to a national treatment protocol. (I am thus certainly
of the authors' opinion that no more time should be spent on refining existing models).
Is it worth publishing? Yes, if you want authoritative evidence for what most cardiologists (and a lot of patients) believe. No, if
you hope it will lead to a better, tidier, more rational, etc, future.
