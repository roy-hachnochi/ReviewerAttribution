Statistical Review
I have reviewed the revised manuscript. The data are generally well presented. Determining that
the increase in detection rates is driven by overdiagnosis is very hard to prove - no study design
does this robustly. What the authors present is a set of observations which describe the
characteristics of the additionally detected cases, which they interpret as being cases which did
not require treatment. I would suggest that they think more cautiously about the conclusions there are some groups where increases have occurred which do not quite fit with this
interpretation.
The article is based on data extracted from medical records for a sample of patients diagnosed
with thyroid cancer. Confidence intervals need to be used throughout the paper to describe the
uncertainty in the findings originating from the use of random sampling. Although they are
included in some of the tables, they are largely absent from the abstract, text, and figures.
Could you please reference the world standard of Segi?
A number of figures and tables are lacking full descriptions (e.g. details of all statistics plotted on
the box plot, denominators for the rates, etc). Please double check that all required details are
specified.
The depiction of mortality rates in Figure 1 is unreadable. The authors might consider using a
second scale on the graph given the low mortality rate.
What is the expected time between diagnosis and death for thyroid cancer? Any change in
mortality from early diagnosis would not be detectable until this time has passed.
