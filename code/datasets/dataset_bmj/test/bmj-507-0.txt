Comments from Nina F. Schor, MD, PhD:
This is a brief, descriptive manuscript that provides CT and limited MRI information on the brains of children putatively
exposed to Zika virus in utero, particularly during the first and, for some, second trimesters. It is most useful and
successful in its comparing and contrasting with such available information for other congenital infections and in its
inclusion of images from CTs and MRIs of these children. Like all currently available information about children putatively
infected with Zika virus prenatally, it is limited by the state of the diagnostic art for this virus. For none of the children is
there "definitive" information that there is a causal link between the brain abnormalities seen and maternal Zika virus
exposure. This is particularly difficult to ascertain because many, and perhaps most, pregnant women exposed to Zika
virus as determined immunologically have had no symptoms of infection.
For those infants whose mothers did have relevant symptoms during pregnancy, it would be useful to know whether
there is a correlation between the specific abnormalities seen in the brain and the gestational age at which the mothers'
symptoms occurred. Correlation between gestational age at putative exposure and age at which the abnormalities seen
would have occurred during embryogenesis would be more compelling than a simple cataloging of abnormalities when it
comes to ascribing causality.
