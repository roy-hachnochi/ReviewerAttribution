Summary
In this manuscript the authors present the imaging findings of cases with presumed ZIKV infection. Understanding the
neuroimaging features of ZIKV is of tremendously high interest and relevance to the international community at this
time. It is wonderful that these authors have had the ability to put this manuscript together so rapidly but there are
some issues that need to be clarified for this article to have the impact it deserves. English editing would be helpful. The
organization needs to be improved, a number of vague comments should be more specific, inclusion criteria should be
clearer and image interpretations need modification with inclusion of a more detailed discussion on differential diagnosis.
In particular the lack of specificity of the imaging findings needs to be clear.
Statement on what is know and what this study adds
This section is too vague and requires English editing. What cortical malformations have been reported? Was this one
report a case example? In this study what specifically are the primary findings in ZIKV? What are the radiological
criteria? If word count is an issue remove details on location.
Introduction
Organization is confusing but could be improved with English editing. For example the first paragraph is confusion as it
comments on the concerns due to the increased rates of microcephaly and then states that previously no relationship
between ZIKV and brain malformations have been observed. A simple restructuring so the paragraph reads something
like: “The ZIKV was first described in 1947 and although at that time no relationship between viral infections and
microcephaly were documented, the current epidemic in Brazil has raised concerns for a relationship. This concern is
fueled by the sudden astonishing rise in the number of cases of microcephaly observed in…..”
It is not clear what the epidemic is – the other diseases transmitted by these viruses or the viruses themselves. Why is
both the mosquito and the virus and epidemic – this is confusing.
The last paragraph states that 508 case have been confirmed but it is not clear what is confirmed – microcephaly or
ZIKV.
Table 1 – second to last entry Nov 24 – increased CNS malformations - why is this relevant? Was there increased
incidence of ZIKV at the same time?
Methods
Metabolic (ex respiratory chain) and genetic disorders (ex Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome) can also have calcifications as
can cases of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Calcification is neither 100% specific for infection. How were other
disorders ruled out?
Infections do not always have infection so calcification is not 1005 sensitive for infection.
Increased T1 signal and/or hypointensity on SWI is not specific for calcification. Phase data is needed for SWI and myelin
breakdown products, gliosis or hemorrhage can have similar signals.
At what age were subjects imaged?
What known causes of microcephaly were excluded?

Results
What are the protocol criteria for congenital infection presumably caused by ZIKV?
In the 3 with normal head circumference why were they referred initially? A T1 bright lesion in such an infant would be
nonspecific.
In the one that had only MRI, Ca++ cannot be confirmed.
If the inclusion criteria and the main findings are calcifications this seems expected….
Enlarged cisterna magna and DW spectrum are not the same. The vermis should be hypoplastic and dysmorphic for DW
spectrum. In these cases the vermis looked fully formed.
Table 2 – what type of calcification was observed? Punctate, globular? What types of malformations? Was vermis
normal?
Table 3 – what was the age at mri and gesational age at birth of subjects? If one patient was excluded due to lack of T1
and SWI, was there Ca on CT to include this subject?
Table 4 – the grading scheme for brain volume was not described in the methods. “n” likely means subject number. N =
1 what type of dysplasia. N=3 it is hard to understand a viral infection causing hemimegaloencephaly.
Discussion
Criteria for diagnosis are not clear.
It is not surprising that calcifications were a major finding is this was an inclusion criteria.
Normal cortical thickness is rarely seen in PMG. No prior mention was made of cortical thickness or how this was
assessed. Fig 3 looks like increased cortical thickness.
Enlargement of the posterior portions of the lateral ventricles is not colpocephaly – the shape is important. These cases
did not look like classic colpocephaly.
Criteria for assessment of delayed myelination were not described in the methods nor were findings provided in the
results.
No evidence of vermian hypoplasia and dysmorphic features to suggest Dandy Walker were provided.
Calcification is neither 100% sensitive nor 100% specific for infection.
Hyperintensity on T1 and hypointensity on SWI is not specific for calcification.
Cases provided in images do not look frontal specific but global.
CMV does not always have predominant anterior temporal lobe involvement.
In infants HSV does not involve predominantly temporal and insular regions.
Subcortical calcifications can be seen in CMV
These are not dandy walker spectrum – the vermis must be dysplastic and small for this diagnosis
Discussion of adult findings
As diagnosis is not confirmed in most cases, the specificity of these findings should be clarified. Findings listed should
raise concern in appropriate clinical context.
A full discussion of DDx including injury and metabolic etiologies is needed.
