Is the article important?
Yes, this is the first study I am aware of that compares the two leading LBC methods to each other and to
conventional cervical cytology for the detection of progressive CIN lesions. Further, the size of the study provides very
robust results.
Will it help our readers to make better decisions and, if so, how?
Yes, given the steadily increasing use of LBC, it is very important for clinicians involved in cervical screening to
understand that previous studies and meta-analyses demonstrating no significant difference in sensitivity between the
two leading LBC methods and between these methods and conventional cervical cytology were not correct so the
results of these tests can be properly interpreted.
Will the article add enough to existing knowledge?
Yes, this is the first study I am aware of that compares the two leading LBC methods to each other and to

conventional cervical cytology for the detection of progressive CIN lesions.
Does the article read well and make sense?
Yes.
Does it have a clear message?
Yes.
Originality — does the work add enough to what is already in the published literature? If so, what does it add? Please
cite relevant references to support your comments on originality.
Yes, this is the first study I am aware of that compares the two leading LBC methods to each other and to
conventional cervical cytology for the detection of progressive CIN lesions.
Importance of the work to general readers — does this work matter to clinicians, researchers, policymakers,
educators, or patients? Will it help our readers to make better decisions and, if so, how? Is a general medical journal
the right place for it?
Yes, given the steadily increasing use of LBC, it is very important for clinicians involved in cervical screening to
understand that previous studies and meta-analyses demonstrating no significant difference in sensitivity between the
two leading LBC methods and between these methods and conventional cervical cytology were not correct so the
results of these tests can be properly interpreted.
In addition, it is very important policymakers to understand the relative advantages of the two leading LBC methods
over conventional cervical cytology so they can make appropriate decisions regarding the implementation of LBC in
their countries.
Scientific reliability:
Research question — clearly defined and appropriately answered?
Yes, the research question is clearly defined and appropriately answered.
Overall design of study — appropriate and adequate to answer the research question?
Yes, the study design is appropriate and perfectly adequate to answer this research question.
Participants — adequately described, their conditions defined, inclusion and exclusion criteria described? How
representative were they of patients whom this evidence might affect?
Yes, the participants are well described and defined, and representative of the routine cervical screening (screen
negative) population in the Netherlands.
Methods:
Adequately described?
The methods are well described in the main body of the paper with additional descriptions provided in the
supplementary material.
Main outcome measure clear?
Yes.
Was the study ethical?
Yes.
Results — answer the research question? Credible? Well presented?
Yes, the results answer the research question in a robust, credible and well-presented fashion. Figure 1 is particularly
instructive.
Interpretation and conclusions — warranted by and sufficiently derived from/focused on the data? Discussed in the
light of previous evidence? Message clear?
The discussion of the results is clear and to the point. The discussion of the limitations of the study could perhaps be
shortened and moved to the end of this section as it now separates two parts that discuss the results – page 13 lines 7
to 44 and page 15 line 14 to page 17 line 25.
References — up to date and relevant? Any glaring omissions?
The references are up-to-date and complete.
Abstract/summary/key messages/what this paper adds — reflect accurately what the paper says?

The abstract is accurate and complete.
In the section ‘What is already known about this topic’ page 18 lines 14 to 16 should be moved to the section ‘What
this study adds.’
Documents in the supplemental files properly match what is in the manuscript? Do they contain information that
should be better reported in the manuscript, or raise questions about the work?
Yes. No. No.
