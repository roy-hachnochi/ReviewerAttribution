The authors have clarified in their response to reviewers for their choice of effect size –
which is clear enough. However, the change in the manuscript doesn’t full reflect this,
merely stating ‘The effect size of 13% was based on existing literature” is insufficient
without providing more details (including citations) as described in their response – their
response gives us all this information - transfer this to the paper.
I’m still uneasy/disagree with the conclusions ‘The findings do not support the
implementation of a freeze-all strategy in the broad IVF population’- the trial found doesn't
support this conclusion, the trial found there was no evidence of higher pregnancy rates in
the freeze-all strategy – that doesn’t imply there’s no support for it.
