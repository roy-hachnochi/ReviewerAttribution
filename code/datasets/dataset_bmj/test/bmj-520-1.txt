This is an important study. Since there is no publicly accessible list of medical devices in Europe, the investigators had to
search multiple databases and sources to identify new medical devices that received approval over a 6-year period; they
succeeded in retrieving data about more than 300.
They report, for the first time from a large series unlike previous anecdotal reports, the time lag between approval of
devices in the European Union and the USA. Crucially, they observed that a higher proportion of devices first approved in
Europe was withdrawn or subject to safety alerts, compared with devices first approved in the USA. This suggests that

European patients were indeed exposed to additional risks compared with American patients, as a consequence of the
regulatory system.
These observations are timely, given the current status of negotiations on the new Draft Regulation on medical devices
in the EU. The paramount need for transparency of clinical data relating to new medical devices is an essential message
for legislators in the European Council and Parliament. The finding that only 37% of pivotal trials are published within 5
years of approval, strongly emphasises the need for much tighter conditions for post-market surveillance and continued
market access.
The study appears to have been well designed, conducted, and reported. I have no concerns about the results, although
it would be interesting to know if the investigators collected the details of which notified bodies approved the devices
that they included – an analysis of recalls and alerts in relation to the size, location, and experience of the notified
bodies would be interesting (perhaps as the basis of a separate report?). The conclusions are entirely appropriate.
Specific comments:
Abstract/Setting (p 2, line 12): As I understand it, devices are not approved in Europe by getting the CE mark. Strictly
speaking, the application by the manufacturer is approved by a Notified Body, or in the case of some high-risk devices
after review of clinical trial data also by the national regulatory agency (in which case the national regulatory agency or
competent authority will also have approved the trial design). Approval by NB or CA then allows the manufacturer to
affix the CE mark. If this nuance is unclear it might be wise to have a regulator review the format of words in the
manuscript.
Page 3/Study snapshot: It is not true to state (as a blanket assertion) that in the EU “medical devices do not require
evidence of effectiveness”; some do. The general test is safety and performance, with positive risk/benefit, but
sometimes for high-risk devices, trials are expected. Pivotal trials, however, are more often performed in the US (as
stated).
Page 4/line 32: Reference 10 relating to PIP breast implants is not a good example of failure of requirements for
approval; it was a failure of regulatory surveillance to discover fraud on the part of an unscrupulous manufacturer. The
subsequent “Joint Action Plan” has led to much greater supervision of notified bodies and manufacturers. This could be
mentioned at the end of this paragraph together with a more specific comment (new draft regulation now in late stages
of negotiation; or something similar).
There is an official device database in Europe (“Eudamed”) but currently it seems not to function well or be used much.
One of the provisions in the new law is that this should be greatly developed. The name might be mentioned in the
manuscript (for example, paragraph 2 on page 11).
Page 16, box 1: The European summary is not entirely accurate. Notified Bodies are “notified” by their national
competent authority (regulatory agency) for specific sectors or legislation (for example, 16 for active implantable
medical devices), and supervised by them, so they are not in some senses totally independent. The number of NBs for
legislation in all industrial sectors is >2000, but those approved for medical devices is about 60 (after some were
“denotified” as a consequence of the Joint Action Plan). The paragraph as written implies that the 60 NBs evaluate
products from all sectors, which is almost certainly untrue. Competent authorities do apply some uniform standards, and
there will be many more following the new EU Regulation. Devices in Europe are evaluated according to their level of
risk, just as in the USA. The details of all NBs are available at the NANDO database maintained by the EU:

Page 22, appendix table 1: the term “Cardiac assist devices” is not very clear; it sounds as if it might include artificial
hearts or circulatory support. Could the offers clarify this?
Page 26, appendix protocol: this text reads as if it has been transferred from an application to perform the study, rather
than formulated as a report of the study. Please change “we propose to ..” etc to the past tense.
