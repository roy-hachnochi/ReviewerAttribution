It was my pleasure to review this interesting and well-written article on an important topic.
The methodology of the study is sound and I'm especially happy with the negative control analysis that was performed
and the inclusion of the restart rate in the calculation of the public health impact. Also the limitations clearly express the
fact that a causal relation cannot be confirmed with an interrupted time series, which I find very positive. The article is
easy to read and informative.
The quantification of the effect of media attention in the number of cessations and the time frame that this takes place
in, before cessations had returned to expected levels, is information that is very valuable.
Minor comment
- The phenomenom of stopping statin therapy after media attention has also been described for the Netherlands, in an
earlier period (2007). A study performed at the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre describes the effects of media
attention and drug cessation among patients, based on spontaneous ADR reports. Dutch pharmacy data after media
attention also described that the effect of cessation was temporary. This info could be referred to in the discussion when
describing the findings in the context of previous research, Please see van Hunsel F, Passier A, van Grootheest AC.

programme about the benefits and risks of statins as an example. Br J Clin Pharmacol 2009; 67(5):558-564.
