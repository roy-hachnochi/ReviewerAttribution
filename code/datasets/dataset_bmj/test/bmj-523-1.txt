The authors present a hugely important paper describing late mortality among long-term childhood
cancer survivors in arguably the largest population-based study of its kind. Emphasis on changing
risks of late mortality over the last 70 years or so in relation to treatment era are novel findings. I
believe the paper should be considered for publication, subject to minor revisions.
There were several comments I had pertaining to the manuscript:
- Methods, death ascertainment: it wasn't clear if the entire BCCSS cohort was successfully linked to
death registration records. This seems unlikely given the timespan of the study and no doubt minor
errors in cohort identifier fields. This point should be discussed in the Strengths and Weaknesses
section later on in the paper.

- Methods, statistical analyses/Table 3: Was the goodness-of-fit of the Poisson models assessed? For
example, was there any evidence of overdispersion? References to 'univariate' and 'multivariate'
models should be replaced by 'univariable' and 'multivariable', respectively.
- Results, study characteristics: Median summary measures probably preferable to means.
- Discussion, strengths and weaknesses, last sentence p.17: add 'likely to be' after 'and so the real
risks are'
