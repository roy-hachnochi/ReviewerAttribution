I am happy with the authors response. They now say, in their response to me, that missing data handled using multiple
imputation led to a similar result. However, I have been through the paper and they have not added this important finding to
the paper itself. Many critical readers will ask the same question as me: is the finding robust to the use of multiple imputation
rather than the missing indicator method? Therefore, my last recommendation is to ensure the authors add a few sentences to
the paper accordingly about the use of multiple imputation as a sensitivity analysis (in the methods), with subsequent results
briefly given at the end of the results.
