My view is that this is a profoundly important paper which it has been a privilege to read. I would
like to see it published as is. The discussion is intensely relevant to the immediate challenges of
clinical practice and will provide encouragement to all those clinicians who find current guidelines
largely unusable for all the reasons outlined in the paper.
