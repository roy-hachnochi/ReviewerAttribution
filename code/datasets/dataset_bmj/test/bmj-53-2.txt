This is a nice paper describing how influenza-like illness surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic
can provide a simple yet effective tool for monitoring the effectiveness of interventions to reduce
transmission, including social distancing measures. I agree this method would be particularly helpful
in low income settings, but even in high income countries would complement confirmed cases and
deaths data (which have their own challenges of interpretation) very well. However, while I think the
method has merits, one still have to be aware of biases, which I think can be made clearer
I have a few comments, most of which are minor, which I hope will help improve the manuscript:
Major comment:
-My main concern is that using established ILI surveillance systems based in primary care is that this
assumes that primary healthcare seeking behavior remains unchanged during a pandemic period.
There is major concern in the UK that people are not seeking healthcare for eg acute infections, even
in cases where they need to. Therefore, a fall in ILI rates may simply reflect people’s reluctance to
engage with health services during a pandemic (due to not wanting to burden the health service for
example). The authors need to comment on this in much more detail than the very brief points made
on page 5. Could ILI surveillance be augmented by syndromic surveillance (where available)? Or could
the total number of GP visits or phone consultations be monitored alongside ILI consultation rates?
The issue of potential changes in health care seeking behaviour (and indeed influenza testing practices
our emergency department visits) that are driven not by infection transmission is the main challenge
to interpreting results from ILI surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic and should be dealt with in
the discussion.
Other comments:
-Introduction: I feel we really should stop doing inter-country comparisons of COVID-19 case numbers
without accounting for the size of the underlying population. Can you present rates of COVID-19 cases
per population in HK instead of only the case count?
-page 6, line 47: ‘the winter influenza season was 63.2% shorter’: how do you define the length of
the flu season?
-page 6, line 49-50: is the confirmed influenza case counts due to less influenza testing due to
laboratories shifting to testing for COVID-19? Again this could be biased by testing practices changing
due to the pandemic and should be pointed out.

-page 6, line 52. I don’t understand the sentence starting ‘Notably, …’ about the start of the ILI
epidemic. It would be really helpful if you could define how the start, end and duration of ILI &
influenza epidemics are defined and calculated.
-page 7, line 2: can you clarify for an international audience what an outpatient ILI rate is? Is this ILI
cases presenting to an emergency department?
-page 7, line 19: I think it should be epidemic, not endemic
-I fully realise that there is particularly great time pressure during a pandemic but one more proof
read of the manuscript to clarify language and grammar would be very helpful.
