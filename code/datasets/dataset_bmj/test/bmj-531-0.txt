I see there is comment related to the use of either drug but specifically fenoterol as being the drug of
choice in reducing unnecessary cesarean sections in the United States because of it's efficacy and safety
(the researchers assume the benefits outweigh the risks) in using such a drug as a uterine relaxant.
I understand one of the weaknesses was the inability to blind both the investigator(s) and subjects or to
include the use of a placebo in addition to the two drugs being studied.
Interesting to note the differences in outcome between midwives and other practitioners. Was there a
difference in training between providers? Expectations? Or how midwives manage care (i.e. normal
physiological birth stance)?
This was a study primarily representing Caucasian women.
