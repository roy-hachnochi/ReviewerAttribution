This is a very important analysis deriving from a pivotal clinical trial. The study addresses outcomes of two important antithrombotic treatment regimens largely debated in clinical practice in the two key clinical presentations of patients with ACS:
STEACS and NSTEACS. The study expands upon previously reported insights from the main MATRIX trial. Thus, the information
in this manuscript is novel. The authors should be commended for their overall efforts towards this trial as well as this very
well balanced and objective predefined analysis evaluating outcomes according to patient clinical presentation. I have a few
minor comments:
1. The authors appear to be very cautious in their trial interpretation focusing on the key primary endpoints of the study.
Indeed, MATRIX as a whole as well as this predefined analysis does not show that bivalirudin reduces MACE or NACE. However,
in doing so the authors somewhat downplay the impact of bivalirudin on bleeding complications. While this reviewer
understands that this is an approach for the authors not be too heavily criticized on looking at secondary endpoints it is still
worthwhile emphasizing importance of reduction of bleeding complications. Therefore, I would recommend (if space allows)
that the authors provide some statement on the reduction of bleeding complications in the abstract as well as provide a few
additional comments to those already elaborated by the investigators in the discussion section showing how bivalirudin can still
be an important treatment strategy particularly in patients at high risk of bleeding.
2. In line with above, the MATRIX trial may also set the foundation for dedicated studies in patients at high risk of bleeding
complications which is an aspect worthy of mentioning in terms of what to make of a neutral trial, but with important insights.
3. The authors are also very cautious in how they interpret some of the interaction analysis. While this is a judicious approach,
one analysis which they do not mention is that according to the use of novel P2Y12 inhibitors in patients with NSTEACS. This
reviewer believes that this is important because an understanding of how bivalirudin behaves in patients treated with novel
P2Y12 inhibitors is something largely discussed and which we typically perform in clinical practice but for which there is very
limited data. This approach by many is considered a good “marriage” between antithrombotics but for which there is very
limited data to support this. MATRIX is the largest trial to provide these additional insights. This is a topic also elaborated in a
recent review on novel therapies by Franchi et al Nat Rev Cardiol. 2015 Jan;12(1):30-47, which the authors should consider
referencing.
4. In line with above, the lack of a similar finding in the STEACS population may be also reflective of what has been
encountered with the novel agents in subgroup analysis of STEMI patients in the pivotal trials, for which there is much debate
on their efficacy still to date, which is in contrast with the more clear outcome data in the NSTEACS settings.

Dear Editor:
Please find enclosed my comments to the manuscript by Leonardi et al. Overall, this is a pivotal predefined analysis from the
MATRIX trial. The study expands upon previously reported insights from the main MATRIX trial. Thus, the information in this

manuscript is novel. The data are original and very relevant to daily clinical practice. I endorse publication of this manuscript.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review for your journal.
Decision: Minor Review
