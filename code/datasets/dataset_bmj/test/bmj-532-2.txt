Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. The authors examined the relationship of bivalirudin vs unfractionated
heparin (with or without glycopprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors) among patients with acute coronary syndromes. In the reviewed
paper, the authors examined this relationship among ST-elevation ACS and non-ST-elevation ACS seperately. While this is an
important topic, these findings are not fundamentally different from what was presented in their 2015 NEJM paper. In that
NEJM paper, the authors presented, in supplemental form, this relationship among the different types of ACS, including NSTEACS with positive and negative cardiac enzymes. For example with STE-ACS, for MACE, bivalirudin vs. heparin (RR 0.90, 95 CI
0.70-1.16, p = 0.43) and for NACE (RR 0.84, 95 CI 0.67-1.05, p = 0.13). This is identical to the findings in the currently
reviewed paper. Accordingly, this paper significantly lacks novelty and does not add to what was provided in the NEJM paper.
