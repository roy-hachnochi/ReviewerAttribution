The authors have appropriately addressed the review comments and the article is well-written with potential public health
implications.
One remaining issue is the description of the finding for consumption of ≥ 14 alcohol servings per week (FR=0.82, 95% CI:
0.60 to 1.12). In the first submission, this led to some confusion because the authors sometimes referred to the estimate as
indicating “no association” while other times the authors presented it as “an inverse association”. In the first review round, I
did recommend to align the abstract with the conclusion and include a focus on the” ≥ 14 servings” result.
In the revised article, the authors now only refer to the result as “≥ 14 servings alcohol being associated with decreased
fecundability” thus ensuring alignment. However, I do think the authors could consider to offer a more “conservative”
interpretation of the estimate or to emphasize or at least state that the estimate is imprecise (95% CI: 0.60 to 1.12). I am
aware that putting too much emphasis on confidence intervals may be problematic. Still, because the confidence intervals are
included for all estimates I think the reader could be guided through the authors’ line of interpretation regarding this result.
Minor comments:
A reference could be made to table 1 when mentioning the descriptive results.
A description of Figure 1 could be added to both the data analysis and the results section.
