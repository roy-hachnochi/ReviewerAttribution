The present paper reports data relative to a large population-based cohort study, whose aim was
evaluating if the use of SUs in diabetic patients with renal impairment was associated with
hypoglycemic events. The control group was composed of metformin-only users.
SU-only users showed a 2.5-fold higher risk of hypoglycemia; this risk was higher in the presence of
an eGFR<30 ml/min/1.73m2, with higher SU doses, and with glibenclamide use. Gliclazide was not
superior to other SU drugs with inactive metabolites.
The manuscript is clear and well written. The topic is interesting, even if not novel. The most
interesting findings are those relative to gliclazide, which should be emphasized.
The definition of the hypoglycemic event (the outcome) in accordance to the Brudererâ€™s method
should be detailed.
Did the Authors have data relative to the presence of neuropathy (autonomic), which should be
considered as a potential confounder too?
The cohort studied was large, but the number of reported events was impressively low (among
92000 metformin-only users -900 events, and among 13224 SU-only users -500 events during about
4-y follow-up). I wonder if the reporting of hypoglycemic events was accurate.
Furthermore, it would be much more useful to know how many of these hypoglycemic events were
severe, i.e. requiring assistance.
Finally, SU-users were clearly a high-risk group when compared to metformin-users, as documented
by their higher HbA1c values, increased prevalence of renal impairment and under-weight, and
history of cardiovascular events and dementia.
