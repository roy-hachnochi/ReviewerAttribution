I thank the authors for their further revision. I do think this trial has important value.

It is good that the authors re-ran their analyses, and that the Bayesian and frequentist results now
agree more closely for the enterotomies analysis (although a little concerning that the p-value originally
presented to us was 0.99 and now it is 0.49).
The article is much improved by the additional sentences and changes in wording. My only remaining,
minor comment is that the abstract says: “Both robotic and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair have
similar 90-day postoperative hospital stays.” – is this a fair conclusion given the width of the CI is 0.37
to 2.19, and so is very wide? Better to say there was no evidence of a difference in 90-day hospital
stays. Please consider here and elsewhere (eg discussion, what this study adds)
With best wishes, Prof Richard Riley
