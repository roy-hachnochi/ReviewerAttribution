This is an interesting study assessing the association between the use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) and
erectile dysfunction (ED). Overall, the authors report null association with these drugs in both patients with BPH and

alopecia.
There are some items that the authors should consider:
1. Why did the study period start in 1992? Was it because of the availability of the first 5ARI? If so, it should be
specified.
2. The study period was limited to Dec 31 2011. This was because of concerns related to changes in the prescribing of
5ARIs and diagnosis of ED during the study period. However, it is unclear if these old data are still generalizable to the
current population using these drugs. While the authors' concerns are well founded, perhaps they should consider
censoring on Dec 31 2011 in a sensitivity analysis only.
3. The authors identified men who received a prescription for a 5ARI or AB plus a diagnosis of BPH. Was there a
requirement for the prescription and diagnosis to occur within a specific time period? How was cohort entry defined? This
is particularly important since this may have inadvertently introduce immortal time bias, i.e., the time between between
these two necessary conditions is immortal as no patient could have experienced the outcome. This may be a theoretical
issue, but nonetheless, the authors should use a more explicit cohort definition limited by time and define cohort entry
as the last event meeting the definition.
4. Why is the medical history in the CPRD 1 year for the alopecia cohort while 3 years in the BPH cohort?
5. In the alopecia cohort, only a diagnosis was necessary to be included. This contrasts with the BPH cohort where
prescriptions were also considered. Is there a reason for this more relaxed cohort definition?
6. It appears that the alopecia cohort may have included patients who used finasteride prior to a diagnosis. This would
have resulted in the inclusion of prevalent users. Can the authors confirm that this did not occur?
7. In the alopecia cohort, exposure seems to have been defined into ways. One was ITT in nature, i.e. once exposed, the
patient was considered exposed until the end of follow-up. The second was by recency of use. These two exposure
definitions are quick different. What was the rationale?
8. While the case ascertained was based on one of three criteria, ED remains an insidious outcome that is likely
associated with some diagnostic delays? This is an important point that was not directly considered in the analyses.
9. The authors excluded cases that had a diagnosis of cancer in the 2 years before index date. Such exclusions may
increase the risk of selection bias, since these patients are removed from the pool of controls. Alternatively, this could
have been considered an additional censoring criterion which would have allowed the use of the person-time contributed
by such patients, and thus avoid such issues. This would have also corrected this issue for the controls.
10. Can the authors clarify what they mean by index date? Was it the actual calendar date of the event , the duration of
follow-up at which the event occurred, or the time since registration in the CPRD?
11. The authors should explicitly state the ratio of controls to cases. It is implied that it was up to 4, but this should be
mentioned earlier on in the section.
12. It is unclear when the covariates were measured; was it at baseline or at index date? Table 3 implies that these were
measured at index date. This can raise concerns related to the adjustment of intermediate covariates?
13. It would be useful to present study flow charts to understand how the cohorts were constructed.
14. The manuscript can be shortened, and some tables can be placed in the online appendix
