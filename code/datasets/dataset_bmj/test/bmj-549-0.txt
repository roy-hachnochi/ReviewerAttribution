I would like to thank the authors for thoughtfully and thoroughly addressing my comments. I believe that this revised
manuscript is stronger and will be of great interest to BMJ readers. The only loose end that I found was my comment #7
re: diffusion of innovation and its effect on EHR implementation. Namely, that hospitals adopting EHRs in the study
period may have had a unique experience due to the insights gained by innovators and early adopters such that the
results of the present study may not be generalizable to a hospital implementing in 2016--at a much later stage in the
diffusion of innovation.
