Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to review this paper - indeed, the secondary effects of
COVID-19 alongside previous outbreaks are far reaching and need to be considered and addressed
through policy to mitigate against the side effects.
I have three main comments for ways to improve this paper - I think there is merit here, but it can be
more in depth.
1. I wonder if you are trying to cover too many bases within this review - addressing all of them in less
than 2000 words means that you are unable to do justice to each one to the extent that literature from
previous outbreaks allows. I would perhaps list each of the subtitles in the intro and then focus on one
or two in more depth that you think are most pressing. This will also advert the challenge of having

some which are only a few lines long (i.e social disorder - which would also benefit from references so it
is more robust). This would allow more nuance to come through in key domains.
2. This paper really needs to consider where most vulnerabilities lies as these are not uniform across
societies. Research has demonstrated that vulnerabilities to the secondary effects of outbreaks
disproportionately fall on women, and along intersectional lines of race, location, disability etc. I think
such concerns need to be considered when you are highlighting who is at risk.
3. This paper's title is "how can we protect" but I dont see any evidence of recommendations for policies
which could mitigate against some of the negative externalities that you highlight in this piece. I think
this is where the merit could lie - not just in demonstrating the problem, but the consideration of which
policies might reduce the tensions highlighted.
I hope these suggestions are helpful for a future revision of this analysis
