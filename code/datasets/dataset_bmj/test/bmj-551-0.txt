This paper, unlike another reviewed at the same time, at least acknowledges importance of sofosbuvir in
curing hepatitis C!
It presents the story of late purchase by Gilead of Pharmasset in some detail - but this is of limited
relevance for a general medical journal.
It rails against US patent and funding system â€“ but again its relevance for the BMJ is questionable.
The issues raised are important but to my mind it added little that was new.
I recommend its rejection.
