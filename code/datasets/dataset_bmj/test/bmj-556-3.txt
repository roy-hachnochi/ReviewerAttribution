This is a wide-ranging systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of AF on a spectrum of CVD, not
just stroke/thromboembolism.
In general, the review is well-conducted and well-reported.
Major comments
There is no reference in the entire manuscript to ris prediction of stroke/throbolembolism which is the focus of
management in AF using scores such as CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc. The derivation and validation studies for these
scores (which are widely used) suggest different absolute stroke rates based on baseline characteristics, which
seems to be in conflict with the conclusion of this study. What may have caused this difference?
What is the implication for future risk prediction in AF?
Minor Comments
The background section in the abstract states "a wide range of cardiovascular outcomes". Renal disease is not
classically included in CVD. Why is it included here?
Why are Congestive Heart Failure and Chronic Kidney Disease together in the results section? Please separate these
two unrelated categories.
