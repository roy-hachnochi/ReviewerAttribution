This review is written from the patient perspective.
This paper is exceptionally clear, well organized, and important in that it evaluates the critical question of additional
cardiovascular risk in patients with AF. I'll leave the methodology review to others more qualified to comment on
statistics. However, the underlying question goes straight to the heart of patients' needs. AF may be picked up as an
incidental finding on EKG in a patient with no other cardiovascular history - this has actually happened twice in my
family. The initial question, then, is what does this mean? What are the implications?
The clinicians' reflex is stroke prevention, as the authors clearly point out. I've seen variation in clinicians'
aggression in restoring sinus rhythm, the depth of their advice on the overall implications of the diagnosis, and
patients' willingness and ability to receive and understand counsel. More information is sometimes better and I
imagine usually doesn't hurt, and this study adds to that information.
The discussion of the implications for clinicians is excellent in that it addresses identifying the possibility of AF as a
prognostic marker for other conditions, and the importance of primary prevention and risk management. I could ask
for strengthening these statements by including clear recommendations for how to communicate this risk
information to patients and how to follow up - regular follow-up visits and testing protocols come to mind - but I
really think clinicians are going to understand the implications for their patients regardless. If the methodology is
deemed sound, I'd like to see this paper published.
Thanks for the opportunity to review.
