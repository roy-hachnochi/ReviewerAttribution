The authors have provided a very detailed and, on the whole, reasonable response to the
statistical concerns contained in my review, and the paper has been revised to take account of
most of the issues raised.
Specifically, more details of the harmonisation process have been provided, a more extensive
discussion of the limitations of the study, in particular potential bias and confounding concerns,
has been included and the Tables and Figures have been suitably modified.
There are some issues that remain, but these are not major blocks to publication as long as
acknowledgement of these concerns is made.
I still have some reservations about the pooling of data from moderately diverse databases and
the heterogeneity in health care provision between countries. However, there does seem a
precedence set for the harmonisation process used by the authors.
Also, I do not entirely agree with the argument used to support the omission of any adjustment
for multiple testing or any acknowledgment of the problem. A clear statement of the authorsâ€™
approach to this matter should be included in the paper.
