This is a straightforward and well-presented study that documents the experience in the Netherlands using noninvasive testing of maternal plasma to determine who would receive ante- and post- partum Rh immune globulin. This
is a very important study documenting assay performance and reliability.
General Comments
1. The introduction would benefit from a sentence on why cell free fetal DNA testing is feasible for determination of
RhD type of the fetus, i.e. referring to the common gene deletion as the genetic basis for most RhD negative women.
2. Please include details on length of sample storage and age of sample at time of extraction in the supplement 1. It
appears 36 samples are held and processed at one time.
3. Page 9, RhD determination would benefit from clarification. Is IAT testing of the RBCs done? RHD genotyping done
on samples with <2+ reaction strength should be mentioned here in the methods section. Although this interferes with
fetal testing, can the authors share the Netherlands policy on RhIG administration, or not, to these women in a
sentence or two in the discussion?
4. Page 10 follow-up for false negative cases “extra fetal markers”, can the authors name the targets? It is not clear
how the presence of fetal DNA was controlled. How was it determined no or low concentration of fetal DNA in the

failures described on page 13 and shown in the Table?
5. Is there follow up planned for the 9 women who did not get RhIG and had RhD positive fetus to determine anti-D
production? It could also be pointed out in the discussion about risk for anti-D that some women exposed will not be
responders.
6. The ethnic diversity of the population should be included to make the claim that the assay is suitable for testing in a
multi-ethnic population, page 18.
7. What was the actual reduction in RhIG usage during this 15 month study? Was it the same as was calculated preimplementation or where there more or less savings than were predicted?
Minor- Language usage suggestions

-consider eliminating “over a 15-month period”. It is potentially confusing and rather, the large cohort number is more
relevant than the length of time. The authors might consider adding the number of pregnancies that made up the
study here.
-“the uptake” is non-traditional English language usage. Throughout the manuscript, consider using the word
participation, application, or acceptance.
“to the programme” should be clarified as “in the antenatal screening programme”
Page 5, line 11. “RHD-positive typed” Since red cell and not genes are typed, suggest…who carry a child positive for
the RHD gene and are RhD positive. Throughout the manuscript “typing” should be restricted to typing red cells and
should not modify the RHD gene to avoid reader confusion. RHD gene determination or testing could be used.
Page 7, line 27 consider changing “improves” the use of this blood product to “optimizes” the use….
Line 40. DVI has not been found in Blacks in U.S. in >5,000 tests, but perhaps the authors have a different
experience, but if not, consider changing this sentence to most often in Caucasian population. Is reference 15 here
appropriate?
Line 53 remove “upon”
Line 54. “a positive advice was issued” change to “lead to recommendation for testing by the”
