1. This is an important study which directly compares the performance of thee established fracture risk scores (QFracture,
FRAX and Garvan) in an external populations from Israel. It is important since it represents not only the first study to directly
compare all three scores but also the first international validation of QFracture. The study has been done carefully and reported
well and overall I think the findings are likely to be of interest to the general medical, international BMJ reader and likely to
help with the evidence base to support the inclusion of these risk scores in international guidance and into clinical practice. The
BMJ has published both of the original QFracture papers(1, 2) and the external review in the UK population(3) so this paper
naturally builds on that. My comments below highlight areas where I think the paper can be improved and should all be
addressable by the authors should they wish to revise their paper.
2. Abstract – results states that the hip fracture rate was 7.% and major fracture rate was 2.7% although the major fractures
include hip fractures. I think the results have been transposed so hip fracture rate is 2.7% and major fracture is 2.7
3. The authors refer to ‘comparative’ analyses which include those undertaken on a single age range (50-90 years) and
‘external validation’ which refer to analyses undertaken using the age range used for the derivations of each score. It is good
that the authors have presented these different analyses. However, all the analyses presented are technically independent
external validation(4). They are external since the populations included in the analyses were separate from those used to
develop each of the 3 prediction scores. They are independent since the authors were not involved in developing the original
scores (as far as I can tell). Can the authors need to find another term to refer to their two types of analyses which doesn’t
imply that some of their analyses are not ‘external validations’
4. Abstract conclusion: they authors state that “the simpler FRAX performed almost as well as QFracture which may have
advantages if automatic computation using EHR is not available”. The ROC statistics are generally considered to be a crude
measure of performance across a population and some statisticians would argue that a difference of 0.1 in the ROC value is
important. However, for an individual who has some of the risk factors which are in QFracture and no in FRAX, then it is like ly
that FRAX would under-estimate their true risk by failing to take account of these factors – yet this may not be reflected in the
relatively crude ROC measurements. Can this be highlighted in the discussion

5. Introduction page 4 - line 43/44 “QFracture has been validated by three studies all in the UK” is inaccurate(1-3). QFracture
has been validated in the following studies in the UK(5) and in Ireland (6).
6. Introduction page 5 – the authors refer to the “old versions” of QFracture and FRAX(1). The updated Qfracture (2012) is
correctly cited elsewhere the paper(2) but I couldn’t find a clear reference to the updated FRAX score – can this be added so
the reader can understand the difference between old and the new FRAX and precisely what has changed between the two
versions. There is also reference to the ‘recalibration’ of FRAX – can more detail be given on how this recalibration has been
done to help the reader understand the context.
7. Methods page 6 - The Clalit Health Services (CHS) covers a population of 4.3 million which make up more than half of
Israel’s population. Can some information be given on how representative this population is of the population of Israel perhaps
in a supplementary table. Table one shows that over a 37% of the population has type 2 diabetes and approx. 29% have
cardiovascular disease – these are high rates and it would be useful to know if this reflects the Israeli population or whether
these conditions result in patients selectively being registered under CHS.
8. Methods page 7 – patients with missing values for BMI and smoking were excluded. To minimise bias, it would be preferable
for them to be included in the study population and techniques such as multiple imputation used to impute missing values for
these variables(7, 8).
9. Methods page 7 – the age range for FRAX given on the FRAX website is 40-90 years - can the authors give a reference to
support the range of 50-90 for FRAX?.

10. Analysis page 9 – ROC values are calculated yet this method doesn’t appear to take account of the survival nature of the
data. Can either the ROC adjusted for survival data or Royston’s D statistic(9) be considered. The latter would have the
advantage of also providing information on explained variation(10) which would enable comparisons with other papers.
11. It’s commendable that the authors have looked at both discrimination and calibration. Can the authors consider
undertaking an additional analysis to look at reclassification statistics? For example, identify the top 10% of patients using
each of the three scores and then determine what % of patients would be reclassified as high risk on one score but as low risk
on another and then check the observed risk in the re-classified patients.

12. Results - Please add total person years of follow up and median follow up (IQR) as well as the absolute and age/sex

standardised fracture rates to enable comparisons with other populations/studies. Please also add descriptive information on
the type of fracture (how many hip, wrist, humerus, spine).
13. Results – can the authors give a worked example of how the risk scores are applied to a few patients in a table so that the
reader can see, for an individual patient, what their score would be using each of the three scoring systems.
14. Results table 2 – it would be better for the results to be presented for men and women separately to aid comparisons with
previous studies ad for consistency with table 3. Please clarify what LIFT refers to by adding a footnote. Please check with the
statistical reviewer regarding the appropriateness of presenting measures such as sensitivity when considering survival data.

15. Discussion page 18 line 40. The authors re correct regarding the important of comparing validation statistics over different
age ranges. However their statement in line 40 is inaccurate since the QFracture papers(1, 2) presented results for different
age ranges.
