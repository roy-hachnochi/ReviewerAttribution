This is a well organized manuscript and the work done is important for correctly predicting the future possible fractures that
may be sustained by individuals with osteoporosis.
I recommend that this manuscript be published. It will be very good for the healthcare individual and the outcome of the
patient. It would be difficult to accurately predict outcomes in all individuals as there may be confounding factors in some that
influence their outcome
