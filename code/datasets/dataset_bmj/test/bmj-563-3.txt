This is a well written manuscript which aims to compare the performance of three tools for predicting osteoporotic fracture
using electronic health record (EHR) data. Secondary to this the authors performed an external validation of each tool
separately within their dataset, to examine the performance of the models outside of the development population. I have some
minor comments below mostly around the limitations caused by EHR data.
1. An introduction to the models in question may be useful within the manuscript, such as a brief description (perhaps in a
table) of the essential facts for each model. For example the type of model used, how the model is implemented currently, how
many patients the model was developed using, what type of study, at what time risk predictions can be made, how the model
is used to decide treatment strategy etc.
2. The authors needed to manipulate their EHR data to fit the models examined, for example;

a. The data used contained smoking status coded as non-smokers, former smokers or current smokers. However the authors
state that the QFracture tool uses three levels to define “current smoker” based on the number of cigarettes smoked per day.
The authors assigned those defined as “current smokers” in their EHR data to the “middle category” in the QFracture tool,
representing 10-19 cigarettes smoked daily. While this kind of manipulation is clearly necessary to enable comparison and
validation of the model in this dataset, the authors do not provide any rational for their choice of category.
b. Similarly the dataset did not contain information on alcohol consumption (a factor described as using five levels in the
QFracture tool). The authors created a dichotomous variable (yes/no) for alcohol consumption, based on diagnoses of
alcoholism or alcohol-induced chronic complications. They then assigned those coded as “yes” using this variable to the 4th
category level used in the QFracture tool relating to alcohol consumption of seven units per day. Again it is understandable
that such an assumption was necessary to allow computation of the QFracture model using the EHR dataset available, but no
rational has been provided for this choice of category – for example by assigning patients in the dataset to either “no alcohol
consumption”, or a potentially extreme “7 units a day” category, may lead to weaker discrimination if for example some
patients categorised as having no consumption, were actually moderate drinkers. Is it an appropriate assumption that many
patients in this dataset do not drink, as 98.9% of patients have been defined as such using the coding of this study?
3. Given these manipulations, the conclusions of this study are highly relevant to the intended population (Israel). The study
suggests that these tools could potentially be automatically implemented using CHS EHR data in the same way that the study
authors have performed their analyses, and the models would perform strongly with good discrimination. However, any future
application of these models using EHR data in different countries could potentially need to make different assumptions due to
the limitations of their own EHR data, and may not expect the same model performance statistics. The authors could discuss
the possible limitations of their results further.
4. It is difficult to discern if the calculation of the conversion factor for FRAX 10 year probabilities, into 5 year probabilities is
appropriate given the presented supplementary information. For example it may be helpful for the authors to overlay a scatter
plot in figure S1, of the data used in their linear regression analysis. It is unclear if data were used from all 120 months for
example, or only from months 0, 60 and 120 say. It seems difficult to believe that given all the variables which effect fracture
risk (as identified in the models included in this study), the trend for cumulative number of fractures over time is perfectly
linear with R-squared almost exactly equal to 1? i.e. follow-up months completely explains variation in cumulative fractures? Is
this potentially due to a small number of observations being used for this linear regression?
5. Also the analysis in supplement 2 appears to be based solely on the available data, not the FRAX model predictions, and so
even if the relationship between 5 year and 10 year cumulative fractures were linear in the data used, the FRAX model may
not have been built using data in which this relationship holds, and therefore may make different predictions at 5 years, had
these been provided for use by the FRAX authors. For example if the FRAX tool were based on a cox model then the baseline
hazard may be very different at 5 years and thus predictions may differ in a non-linear way.
