The authors have responded appropriately to reviewer comments, strengthening what was
already a fine paper.
I have two additional minor comments. I frame these as advisory suggestions, since I do not
believe that acceptance of the paper should depend on the suggested edits.
In my view, the issue with OTC availability of aspirin and certain NSAIDs is not only that
patients may purchase them OTC after prescriptions for these drugs were discontinued by their
doctors, but that the ability to measure use of these agents is incomplete both before and after
the intervention. It would be helpful to note this limitation.
In the “what this paper adds” box, the third paragraph does not describe what the intervention
was intended to do (i.e., reduce high-risk prescribing). It would be helpful to state this.
As before, it was my pleasure to review this manuscript.
