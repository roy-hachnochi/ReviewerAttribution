BMJ.2016.033864
Thank you for inviting me to review this study. As a reviewer, my main tasks are to judge the
scientific quality of the study and its relevance for the journal. I am, however, puzzled as to how
to interpret the quality and its relevance in its current form. Let me try to explain.
Main issue:
This study is a systematic review that aims to summarize inter-rater agreement of disability
evaluations. In itself, a subject of enormous relevance for societies and this journal as well. The
study question is clear-cut and there are ample examples of how a systematic review can (or
should be) performed and reported from adjacent fields of medicine. The authors, however,
focus their study not only on inter-rater reliability, but also on trustworthiness, which is a
concept that is strictly taken different from inter-rater reliability. I agree with the authors, that
at the end, interpretation of inter-rater reliability studies are related to the issues they raised.
However, these issues, including its operationalizations, are considered validity issues, or at the
least in this gray area in between. The authors refer to references 17 and 19 when they
introduced trustworthiness. I checked these references, but while there was reference to this
concept, especially in ref 19, there was no mention of adding this with inter-rater agreement
into one measure. Again, I am not stating that their concept is irrelevant. However, when
introducing and elaborating this ‘new’ concept within the context of inter-rater reliability raises
some serious doubts, because they are mixing reliability and validity issues. This is not helpful,
not even within the specific context of disability evaluations. And there is an existing and well
established alternative developed by the COSMIN group. My suggestion is that the authors

reorganize their work into established concepts (reliability, validity (and sub constructs),
preferably within the COSMIN framework, or convince me that my issues are invalid and that
their framework and conceptualizations are better.
Other issues:
P3 l39: reproducibility or inter-rater reliability?
P5 Eligibility – why was FCE literature not included? There are studies that I know of that are
performed in an insurance stetting and do come up with a global rating (eg. Gross et al).
P5 search strategy – how come they did not find non-english studies? (eg Dutch: Brouwer et al,
TBV 2003).
P7: of the included papers, 2 were authored by the reviewers. How was it ensured that they did
not judge the quality of their own papers?
Has the results of the reviews of the trustworthiness been displayed? This is needed, so the
critical reader can make an attempt to reproduce this process (not the end score, but the
reports by trustworthiness subconstruct.
P9. Why was ICC not mentioned, including its interpretations?
P26. These sources of variations are very relevant and it is puzzling why these are not
elaborated upon in this study (within the reliability construct, not validity)
