This paper reports logistic regression analysis of the HFEA data to 2008, and predicts a couple's
chances of a life birth when compared to the 1999-2008 recorded population.
The motivation and analyses are sound (a minor point: it's become more common to report the
coefficient of discrimination (Tjur 2012) than other estimates of model variation such as
Nagelkerke's r squared), but there are important issues with the paper as submitted.
First is the non-use of the HFEA data up to 2013. There was a change in the HFEA's collection
method after 2008, but there have also been substantial improvements in assisted conception
live birth rates (as evidenced by the Figure on page 29), so there is a real possibility that a
couple's pre- and post-statistics in 2016 are not suitable for comparison with couples from at
least 8-17 years ago.
The second is the choice of predictor variables. It seems that candidate variables were chosen
from the results of a review (the 2010 Hum Rep paper) rather than identified as part of the
analysis of the specific HFEA data used. So it's entirely possible that the best predictors
identified by the Dutch group in general are not the best predictors for these specific data.
There are contradictory statements regarding validation. Line 30 of page 14 has the statement
about internal not being relevant; line 30 of page 43 states that internal validation was
performed using bootstrapping.
Donor eggs are not mentioned in the study, although these are known to vary the chances of a
live birth after analysis of the same data (doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000386). In fact, it's hard
to identify the contribution of the manuscript under review when compared to
doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1000386. Here logistic regression was used on the same data set to
produce a method for estimating the chances of a live birth given a couple's characteristics.
