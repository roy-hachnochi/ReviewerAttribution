Outstanding research manuscript on an exceptionally important and controversial topic - TRT. Consider adding
additional information that may link a pathophysiological mechanism for VTE due to TRT, or elevated T levels. Methods
and statistics are sound without obvious flaw. Major limitations are acknowledged, specifically this study being an
observational study (not sure there's any other ethical way to do this...). Please explain weighting process of
comorbidity variables, and if these had any impact on the final OR/HR that you report.
