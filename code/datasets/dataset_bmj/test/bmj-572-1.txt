* Originality - does the work add enough to what is already in the published literature? If so, what does it add? If not,
please cite relevant references.
This paper tackles an important topic, that is not well understood, i.e., the role of exogenous testosterone in
cardiovascular disease, here specifically VTE. The previous two observational studies on the topic have found null
results (PMID: 26205547) quoted in the text and PMID 27179907 that should be added to the text, whilst the previous
meta-analysis of RCTs found a higher risk of venous thrombosis PMID: 2564133 on testosterone, which should also be
quoted. Please also explain why these different studies got different results and why an additional study is needed.
* Importance of work to general readers - does this work matter to clinicians, patients, teachers, or policymakers? Is a
general journal the right place for it?
Given millions of men are taking testosterone at considerable expense, it is very important to know the effects of
testosterone on health, particularly as the FDA have said there are no benefits and there might be harms. However,
given they are using existing data with most likely many other cardiovascular outcomes, it would make the paper
much more interesting if they added all cardiovascular events as an outcome, and major sub-types of cardiovascular
disease, i.e., stroke, ischemic heart disease, etc, as outcomes.
* Scientific reliability Research Question - clearly defined and appropriately answered?
The question is clear, but it could be more clearly stated in the last paragraph of the introduction. In the absence of
large randomized controlled trials, this observational case-control study is a reasonable approach but is open to
confounding by indication and possibly “immortal time” bias.
It would greatly strengthen the paper to add a control outcome to show that in this study exogenous testosterone
does have expected effects. Is there any known effect of testosterone that could be checked for as well?
The subgroup analysis by mode of administration and prior VTE risk factors should be justified as part of the research
question in the introduction, because it strengthens the paper
The introduction could be clearer. In the 2nd paragraph please distinguish between levels of evidence when
summarizing what is known about the effect on testosterone cardiovascular outcomes, i.e.,
-Observationally endogenous testosterone is associated with a lower risk of CVD
-Observationally exogenous testosterone is associated with neutral or higher risk of CVD
-Almost all 7 meta-analyses of RCTs of the effects of testosterone on CVD have found an OR greater than 1, but have
wide confidences because of the low number of RCTs and participants in these RCTs.
-A small meta-analysis of testosterone RCTs found testosterone associated with a higher risk of venous thrombosis
Overall design of study - adequate?
I just wonder whether the self-comparison design, as implemented by Finkle et al. (PMID: 24489673), to answer a
similar question might not be a better design because it avoids the bias by indication. Maybe a self-comparison could
be added as a sensitivity analysis.
Participants studied - adequately described and their conditions defined?
A clearer description of UK CPRD would be helpful, particularly for readers outside the UK. For example, how does UK
CPRD relate to the UK population? What does the qualification “satisfying the quality standard of research mean”?
Could the selection into UK CPRD have generated selection for this particular research question?
Methods - adequately described? Complies with relevant reporting standard - Eg CONSORT for randomised trials ?
Ethical?

Please clarify the design of the study to be explicit about how immortal time bias was avoided and give the exact type
of case-control, i.e.,
- Was time handled in exactly the same way for cases and controls?
- Do you use incident density sampling?
Matching and Covariates
Confounders in observational studies are now understood as common causes of exposure and outcome, please add
justification of the confounders as causing testosterone prescription and VTE, because adjusting for a non-confounder,
such as mediator or collider, may add bias.
Matching variables in a case-control study should be confounders, i.e., factors that cause the exposure and outcome,
so please justify that the matching variables have this role.
Please clarify when they were identified, because conditions identified after testosterone prescription are not
confounders, for example when was polycythemia identified?
Exposures
Please explain why the middle exposure group are not subject to immortal time bias, which might bias in favour of
testosterone. I may be wrong but I worry that the middle group (recent exposure) have to survive testosterone
treatment to be in that group, which could generate immortal time bias and a misleadingly low estimate.
Please describe all the exposures in one place, i.e., move the description of the length of treatment to the exposures
section and again explain why the >6 months treatment group are not subject to immortal time bias. My worry is that
they have to survive 6 months of treatment to get into that group. My worry may be unfounded, but other readers
may have the same worry so please explain.
Please formally test whether the associations vary by prior VTE risk factors
Results - answer the research question? Credible? Well presented?
The results clearly relate to the research question.
Given testosterone raises estrogen and estrogen causes VTE these results have some credibility.
Interpretation and conclusions - warranted by and sufficiently derived from/focused on the data? Message clear?
Please review after checking about immortal time bias and confounding.
It is incorrect to imply that the study shows the risk to be transient, because it is an observational study.
Please point out that this study is consistent with meta-analysis of RCTs
Please give some idea of the mechanism, for example does testosterone affect anything in the clotting pathway? Why
might this be a transient effect?
References - up to date and relevant? Any glaring omissions?
Two previously noted.
Abstract/summary/key messages/What this paper adds – reflect accurately what the paper says?
In the abstract say what confounders have been adjusted for, both by design and in the analysis
The conclusion of the abstract should be more nuanced because it is an observational study.
The 2nd point of the "what this paper adds" section should be clarified. Observational studies of endogenous and
exogenous testosterone have had mixed results, but meta-analyses of RCTs of exogenous testosterone have all given
an estimate in the direction of higher risk for cardiovascular disease although the CIs often include the null because of
the low amount of RCT evidence. However meta-analysis of RCTs of testosterone suggests a higher risk of venous
thrombosis
The 3rd point should be clarified because there are other reasons, not just timing, as to why previous observational
studies had different answers it could be design issues etc.
The "what this study adds" section should avoid causal language because its writing about an observational study
