This is a case-control study which used the UK CPRD with linkage to the hospital episode statistics (HES) and Office of
National Statistics (ONS) data to evaluate the association between testosterone use and risk of VTE in men. This is an
important question, as there has been an increase in testosterone prescribing in the United States and Canada over
the last decade. In contrast, in the UK (source of the CPRD data) there is relatively little testosterone use. Thus,
despite the 1.8 million men at risk for VTE identified in the study population, <1% of cases and controls were current
or recent users of testosterone. It must therefore be noted that the large size of the CPRD did not guarantee a large
number of exposed and informant cases.
The authors highlight the analysis of a subgroup of idiopathic VTE cases (those without other proximate causes for
VTE) and their matched controls as the main principal finding of this study. However, this subgroup was not a main
focus of the methods or results sections. If estimates based on this subgroup are to be presented as the main finding
of the paper, the authors need to revise the methods, results, and discussion section to be consistent and to describe
why the estimates from this subgroup are of upmost importance to their study question.
In general, this paper is not well written and thus it is difficult to follow. The methods and results are not well
communicated to the reader. The entire article would benefit from revision with an eye toward simplicity and clarity.
The authors should keep in mind that the BMJ audience is largely comprised of clinicians, not statisticians and
epidemiologists.
Here are some specific points that the authors should consider:
Abstract:
1. This was a case-control study; however the authors present incidence rates and incidence rate ratios in the results
section of the abstract. Please clarify.
2. The overall risk estimate presented in the results was 1.25 (95%CI 0.94 to 1.66), which suggests that testosterone
use is not associated with an elevated risk of VTE. However, the main conclusions highlighted in the abstract are based
on the results of the stratified analysis that evaluated idiopathic VTE cases (n=37 exposed cases) where the risk was
elevated (1.57, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.32). The authors should report the results consistently between the results and
conclusion sections of the abstract.
Introduction:
1. The language in the introduction is perhaps a bit grandiose (for example, the use of “dramatic upsurge”). Further,
the authors discuss large changes in prescribing in the US and Canada. This sets the stage for the reader to expect a
large study, with a lot of data on testosterone exposure for an outcome with a large absolute risk. In contrast, in the
UK (source of the data) there is relatively little testosterone use, and consequently there are only a total of 69
testosterone exposed cases in the study, and a generally low absolute risk of VTE (reported in this study to be 15.8
per 10,000 man-years). The authors might consider revising the introduction to present the problem in a more
moderate, straightforward manner.
Methods:
1. The Herrett study referenced for the statement “CPRD has been validated in VTE research” (methods, Study Setting
and design, page 5) provides a detailed description of the origin and uses of the CPRD data, but this article did not
seek to validate recorded VTE diagnoses. Perhaps there is another article describing the validity of VTE diagnoses in
the CPRD that the authors meant to reference?
2. Source Population Identification: HES data linkage is not available for all general practices / patients in the CPRD.

Was the source population restricted to the subset of GPs in the CPRD where HES is linkable?
3. VTE Case Definition:
a. I suggest that the authors expand on their methods to describe in detail the algorithm used to identify VTE cases,
rather than referencing an article published elsewhere. The BMJ offers a generous word limit, thus the authors have
plenty of room to provide detailed descriptions of all of the important aspects of their methods.
b. As part of the comment above, the authors should describe how the three data sources were used to identify VTE
cases. How did the authors handle patients with multiple VTE diagnoses across multiple data sources? Were the
diagnoses in one data source prioritized over those in another data source? How many cases had VTE diagnoses
recorded in multiple data sources?
c. Please provide details of the “index VTE” definition. It would also be helpful if the definitions of the index date and
exclusion criteria were moved earlier in the case identification paragraph, before the authors discuss classifying
patients based on the presence or absence of risk factors.
d. The authors classified patients by the presence of known risk factors and other proximate causes of VTE (such as
cancer, surgery, trauma, and ‘medical condition’) recorded in the 90 day period before the VTE date, as well as by
whether the patients had a history of cancer more than 90 days prior to the VTE.
i. Risk factors and other proximate causes for VTE are different. Surgery, trauma, and fractures are other proximate
causes for the VTE event.
ii. Which diagnoses comprised “medical condition”?
iii. It would be useful to understand if and how all three data sources were used to identify all risk factors (see
comment 3b).
iv. Unlike in medical claims data, where the indication for billing is repeatedly recorded, in the CPRD GPs often record
a diagnosis only once, though the condition may be chronic and ongoing. How did the authors take this into
consideration when determining whether or not patients had prevalent chronic disease risk factors within the 90 days
prior to the index date?
e. Validation of VTE diagnoses: The authors cite another study indicating that the sensitivity and specificity of VTE is
quite good, however it is possible to use other codes to evaluate the validity of the VTE cases identified in this study.
The authors could assess the presence of the VTE diagnosis in multiple data sources (CPRD, HES, and ONS, or
multiple). Anticoagulant prescriptions recorded shortly after the index date should be used to validate the VTE
diagnosis because patients with a confirmed VTE should receive anticoagulation. Anticoagulation codes provide
evidence that the VTE diagnosis was a true diagnosis (true case). This is particularly important where there was no
HES or ONS data for a particular patient.
4. Matching of controls: The authors matched up to 50 controls to each case on calendar time (case’s index date),
year of birth, history of primary or secondary hypogonadism, and presence of all known risk factors (surgery, trauma,
‘medical illness’, active cancer) in the 90 days, and history of cancer 91 days or more before the index date.
a. The authors should justify why a ratio of 50 controls:1 case was used. Although it is common to match more
controls than cases to increase statistical power in studies with uncommon outcomes, the gain in power diminishes as
the ratio increases beyond 4 controls:1 case. Also, the authors should state the ratio of controls successfully matched
to cases, as, based on the number of controls in the analysis, the authors were not able to identify 50 controls for
each case.
b. There may be a concern about correlated data in this study. Cases were eligible to be controls up until the index
date (risk set sampling). How many times were cases identified as controls and included in the data set? How many
times was a patient identified as a control and matched to different cases? How did the authors evaluate this and
handle this in the analysis?
c. Please provide details about how controls were matched based on surgery, trauma, and ‘medical illness’ within 90
days prior to the case’s index date? If a case had surgery in the 90 days prior to the index date, was the control also
required to have had surgery, or were they required to have one of the risk factors (surgery, trauma, or ‘medical
illness’)? Is the baseline risk of VTE different for each of these?
d. In the section describing matching, the authors should provide the definition of primary and secondary
hypogonadism and clarify that they matched on hypogonadism status (primary, secondary, or none).
5. Exposures: The exposure definition section is confusing as written. It would be helpful if the authors presented how
the testosterone prescription duration was calculated earlier in the paragraph, as this information was used to define
current exposure, recent exposure, and not exposed. For example: We considered a person to be exposed for the
length of a prescription plus a 30 day grace period. A person was considered currently exposed if they had a
prescription whose use (prescription length + 30 days) extended to or beyond the index date. Recent use was use
(prescription length + 30 days) that extended to the time from 2 years before to 1 day before the index date. Not
exposed was all use that ended more than 2 years before the index date plus those who never received testosterone.
6. Covariates
a. Which of the data sources were used to identify covariates of interest?
b. How were smoking and drinking status defined?
c. For megestrol, systemic corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and antiplatelets – were these identified based on the presence of
a prescription record within 90 days, or the calculated duration of a prescription (based on quantity prescribed and
prescribing instructions) carrying over into the 90 day period before the index date?
d. Were anticoagulant prescriptions considered as a covariate? Repeated anticoagulant prescriptions recorded before
the index date may indicate that the patient had a history of VTE and should be excluded.
e. Were other covariates evaluated for identifying, or as a proxy for, the indication for testosterone use? For example,
Klinefelter syndrome diagnoses, or testosterone lab values, where repeated low lab values may indicate a testosterone
deficiency. Erectile dysfunction and impotence are likely to have been under-recorded during the study period. The
authors might consider evaluating prescriptions for phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (PDE-5s, which include
sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) where the strength and quantity are indicated for treatment of erectile dysfunction
as an additional method to identify men with treated sexual dysfunction where no diagnosis is recorded.
f. Were benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostate cancer, or elevated prostatic specific antigen levels considered as
covariates? These are contraindications for testosterone use, and therefore may bias exposure status among cases

and controls.
7. Statistical Analyses: This was a case-control study, thus the authors used conditional logistic regression to estimate
crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR). Because risk set sampling was employed, the resulting ORs estimate incidence
rate ratios. The authors should be clear that ORs were calculated, but that they referred to the resulting estimates as
rate ratios throughout the paper.
Results:
1. The title and methods indicate that this was a case-control study; however the authors present incidence rates.
Figure 1 also suggests that a cohort approach was used. The authors should update the methods section to describe
the methods used for the cohort portion of this study.
2. Figure 1: Can the authors clarify how the 1,103,997 men were excluded for having a history of VTE, <2 years of
recorded history, or were outside of the specified age range? Specifically, it is not clear “as of when” the criteria for
these exclusion criteria were evaluated.
3. How many of the VTE cases were identified based on information recorded in the CPRD, HES, ONS, or multiple data
sources?
4. Did the authors assess the presence of other codes in the data that would provide evidence that the VTE diagnosis
was a true diagnosis? Were there diagnostic tests recorded in the HES data that would support the VTE diagnosis?
How many cases had anticoagulant prescriptions recorded in the CPRD after the index date?
5. The authors state that the proportion of cases and controls with polycythemia chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes,
congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease were “notably” different, however some of these proportions
are quite similar.
6. Table 1 presents the use of megestrol, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and antiplatelet prescriptions recorded at any time
before the index date. This differs from the approach described in the covariates section of the methods, where it
states that use of these drugs within 90 days prior to the index date would be assessed.
7. The tables would be clearer if the results stratified by hypogonadism status, as well as stratified by VTE risk factor
status, were presented as separate tables.
8. The overall rate ratio was null (1.25, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.66). This is likely because the overall analysis includes nonidiopathic cases (those with surgery, trauma, or other proximate causes within 90 days before the index date), which
would bias the results to the null. In fact, in the analysis stratified by presence of other proximate causes of VTE, the
rate ratio is higher among cases and matched controls with no risk factors or other proximate causes for VTE (rate
ratio= 1.57, 95% CI 1.06-2.32). This is the main finding of the paper. In fact, the authors highlight this finding in the
discussion; however they only briefly mentioned it in the second to last paragraph of the results (Table 3). Also, the
distribution of characteristics among this subset of patients is likely to be very different from that of the overall
population provided in Table 1.
9. The authors report an elevated rate ratio of VTE among currently exposed men without hypogonadism (RR=1.69,
95% CI 1.09-2.63), whereas the estimates were not elevated among men who had recorded diagnoses of primary or
secondary hypogonadism. In other words, there was effect modification by indication for testosterone use. There is
concern about potential misclassification of hypogonadism status in the group of men without a recorded diagnosis of
primary or secondary hypogonadism, as these diagnoses may be under-recorded by GPs (see Methods Covariates
comment E, above). If there were a disproportionate number of men with unrecorded primary or secondary
hypogonadism in the cases compared to the controls, then this may explain the observed elevation in risk. It would be
useful to evaluate the characteristics of cases and controls in this restricted analysis to evaluate whether differences in
comorbidities, other proximate causes, and risk factors between cases and controls may explain the increased risk
observed among current users of testosterone who do not have a recorded diagnosis of primary or secondary
hypogonadism.
Discussion:
1. The principal finding highlighted in the discussion (that for the subset with idiopathic VTE, RR=1.57) is inconsistent
with the results section, where the authors led with the overall rate ratio (1.25) and the idiopathic VTE subset were
only briefly mentioned in a few sentences and not until Table 3 (almost as an afterthought). I agree that the result
based on the idiopathic subset is the most interesting finding of the study, but the paper should be revised for
consistency between all sections.
2. In the statement of principal findings, the authors state that the findings of the study “reveals an association”. It
would be appropriate to have a more conservative conclusion due to the small number of exposed men upon which
this estimate was based (n=37) and the relatively small magnitude of the effect measure.
3. A consistent finding of this study was that the risk of VTE was elevated among those who imitated treatment within
6 months before the index date, however the authors chose to highlight a “63% increase” from the main analysis
(n=36). This estimate is based on a different group of patients than the principal finding (see comment 1) presented
earlier in the paragraph. It would be sufficient to simply state that the risk of VTE was elevated within the first six
months after initiation of testosterone use.
4. In the limitation section the authors state that they matched on a history of polycythemia, however this was not
specified in the methods.
5. Discussion, limitations, page 12: “Stratification by presence and absence of known risk factors for VTE showed
similar results in those without known risk factors” – It is not clear what these results are similar to, or why this is
being mentioned in the limitation section.
6. The other case-control study (reference 13) is mentioned in multiple places in the discussion, but never described in
detail. The authors should provide details of this study and discuss in comparison with their results.
7. In the UK, there is relatively little testosterone use. It would be prudent to remind the reader that the results should
be interpreted cautiously in light of the small number of exposed cases identified in this study. Additional studies using
data from countries with more testosterone use would be useful for further evaluating the association between
testosterone use and risk of VTE in men.
Other comments:

1. Please define all acronyms the first time they appear. For example, ‘UK’ in the introduction on page 4, and “T” in
the results section (page 10)
2. There is a typo for the confidence interval for the men without hypogonadism on page 10 of the results needs
decimal points instead of dashes.
