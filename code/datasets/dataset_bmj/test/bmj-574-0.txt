The authors have done a good job revising the document. I only have a few additional (minor) comments to make:

I could not find the estimate for tau in the NMA in the paper or the supplement. Please give the estimate for
heterogeneity in NMA along with its 95% CrI on the main paper, and commend on this value.
Regarding inconsistency: authors say in the main text that no inconsistency was found, but do not refer to the actual
results presented in the Supplement. I suggest adding a line in the main text, referring to tables 12 A-C for the actual
results, so as to help the reader.
Page 18: The authors give the DIC for the random effects model. DIC is a model selection criterion, i.e. it is used to
compare models. Mentioning the value of DIC for a single model is meaningless, if it is not compared to something else.
I suggest either mentioning the DIC for fixed effects, or deleting it.
The total residual deviance should in general approximate the number of unconstrained points (as the authors mention),
but there are no rules on what “approximate” exactly means. So I would suggest to rephrase slightly the wording,
instead of writing “Model fit was appropriate with total residual deviance approximating the number of unconstrained
data points” the authors could write something less strong, e.g. that “The total residual deviance was found to be
[…],implying a good model fit”
In the online supplement, statistical analyses, it writes: “For the prior distribution of between-trial standard deviation,
we used a uniform distribution with a mean of 0 and large variance (5)”. This doesn’t make sense for many reasons (a
uniform distribution is usually described by the lower and upper limits, not the mean and variance. The standard
deviation is a positive number, the distribution the authors describe also gets negative values). The authors probably
mean “a uniform distribution U(0,5)” , which means a uniform distribution from 0 to 5, not one with mean 0 and
variance 5
You use the abbreviation mITT without first defining it. Please define the term in page 10 (where you say about modified
ITT analysis).
