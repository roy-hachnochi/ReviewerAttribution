While I understand the motivations of the authors to try and develop a risk score for prediction of postpartum VTE, I
remain unconvinced that they have achieved this goal. I am unable to comment on whether the statistical methods they
used are valid; I am not a statistician but the statistically methodology presented is impenetrable to this seasoned
clinician.
One of my concerns about using the cohorts to develop the risk score is that it appears that there is no information as to
which women in each large cohort was given thromboprophylaxis. This makes the model flawed. Presumably those with
the most strongly recognised risk factors would have received it thereby downgrading the apparent strength of said risk
factor and this would introduce bias into the model.
Also by using discharge coding data to assess risk factors the reader is left in the uncertain position of knowing more
about said risk factors - what severity of cardiac disease, renal disease or inflammatory bowel disease is important? Is
diabetes gestational, type 1 or type 2? What is the relevance of the infant birth? When you look at the definition tables
the severity of these individual diseases is very variable. These definitions are just too loose.
How do women with a history of VTE fit into the model? Why use the pre-pregnancy weight and not the current weight?
There are a number of other risk factors for VTE that don't make it into the model. What about a family history of VTE?
What sort of VTE are we considering superficial or deep vein thrombosis and PE. There just doesn't seem to be enough
information for me to feel confident that using this model will put me in a more certain position regarding the risk of VTE
and a decision re thromboprophylaxis. Also what duration of thromboprophylaxis is the model recommending - 5
days,10 days, 14 days or 6 weeks?
Also I am not convinced that the model has been validated by applying it to another population of postpartum women
who have been studied retrospectively and where the same degree of bias will be present. Surely a prospective
validation would be required to apply to model to a population of postpartum women who did not receive
thromboprophylaxis and assessing which of those women developed VTE would be true validation?
