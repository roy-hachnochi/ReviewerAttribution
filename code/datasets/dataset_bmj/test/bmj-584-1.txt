GENERAL COMMENTS
In this work, the authors compare two groups of patients with type 1 diabetes, managed respectively with insulin pumps and
multiple daily injections (MDI), who received equal training in flexible insulin therapy. Moreover, they analyze a number of
psychological measures, to gain further insight information on treatment satisfaction and quality of life. The results of the
psychological measures analyzed may be of interest to both patients and clinicians, and their discussion should be improved.
METHODS/CONCLUSIONS
Out of a total number of 1278 invited patients, respondents were 885 (69.2%), but 523 (59%) denied being interested in
participating. As a result, participants were 362, i.e. 28.3% of those invited, accounting for those who were interested. Since in
the Discussion the authors state “A common reason given by patients for not wanting to participate in REPOSE was reluctance
to use an insulin pump”, this could determine a selection bias.
The authors also write: “Our hypothesis was that much of the benefit of pump therapy may come from the re-training and
education in insulin use given to enable patients to use pumps safely”. Since the trial assessed treatment efficacy both in
patients using pump therapy and in those using MDI, who received equal training in the two methods of insulin administration,
both sets of participants should be taken into consideration in the conclusions.
Moreover, can the authors explain in the Discussion, why the trial was not suspended after a year, given that interim analysis
found that the intervention was ineffective (tables 2-5, figure 1)?
The authors also report that “most episodes of ketoacidosis were due to infections”. Which infections?
RESULTS/DISCUSSION
The “Quantitative psychosocial outcomes” are perhaps the most interesting findings of the study, but they are given little
prominence in the Discussion. These data are highly relevant for patients as well as clinical practice and should be discussed.
