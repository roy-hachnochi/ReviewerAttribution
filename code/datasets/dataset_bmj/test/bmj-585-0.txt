Title:
Prognosis after surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients
with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis: Systematic review of observational studies
First author: Reed Siemieniuk
This is a systematic review of observational studies reporting on the rate of death, stroke, atrial
fibrillation, structural valve deterioration (SVD) and the length of in-hospital stay with bioprosthetic
surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and the frequency of SVD with transcatheter aortic valve
implantation (TAVI). According to the authors, this study was conducted to inform recommendations for
the first
in a series of BMJ Rapidrecs, a new BMJ series of recommendations published in
response to potentially practice-changing evidence. For such recommendations, the Rapidrecs
panel requires estimates of absolute risk obtained by applying relative risk estimates from
randomized trials to current best baseline risks.
Searches were performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,
and Cochrane CENTRAL from 2002 to June 2016.
The investigators were able to select 97 original studies that included 54,496 patients with severe aortic
stenosis undergoing aortic valve replacement.
From a statistical standpoint, the authors Used an algorithm established by Guyot et al., which estimated
and pooled individual patient data to obtain an overall estimate of survival and freedom from SVD. Due

to the lack of Kaplan Meier curves for stroke and atrial fibrillation, the authors estimated incidence rates
per 100 patient-years post-intervention for each outcome using Dersimonian and Laird random effects.
The authors found that from the time of surgery, the approximate median survival in patients undergoing
SAVR was 16 years in those â‰¤65 years, 12 years in patients between the ages of 65 and 75, 7 years in
patients 75 and 85, and 6 years in patients greater than 85 years of age
In addition, patients undergoing SAVR and participating in these studies experienced, over the
decade following their surgery, a risk of stroke of under 3%, a risk of atrial fibrillation under
30%, and a risk of SVD of under 10%. They therefore concluded that long-term survival of SAVR is very
close to that of general populations of the same age.
Finally, investigators looked at SVD after TAVI, which was an uncommon finding.
The extensive and detailed analyses conducted by the authors is impressive. The manuscript is really well
written and fluent. Tables look to me appropriate in number and content.
I have a few questions and concerns, however, that the authors need to address.
- I have some concerns regarding the analysis on SVD for two reasons: First, the estimate of SVD using
the Kaplan-Meier method is fundamentally incorrect, as it does not consider the issue of competing risk.
Indeed a competing risk event (death) may preclude the onset of the event of interest, or may modify
the probability of the onset of the event of interest (SVD). I recognize that this is an issue that affect the
source studies, but I wonder if there exist a way to correct this important limitation. Second, the
definition of SVD may be different access studies. The authors should provide the definition of SVD used
in the studies reporting this outcomes in table 1. In the case of remarkable heterogeneity, this should be
stated in the limitations
- Considering the focus of the study, I would consider to omit the analysis on SVD after TAVI. Also, the
title of the paper may be misleading. In fact, no clinical outcomes on TAVI have been reported in the
study.
- The DerSimonian & Laird random-effects estimator, while simple to compute, performs very poorly
when the number of studies is less than 18 or 20. While the number of total studies may support the use
of the DL estimator, this is clearly the case for the analysis of stroke and atrial fibrillation. In fact, these
outcomes are reported in 7 and 2 studies, respectively. I would tend to recommend that authors use
more robust methods or omit this analysis. However, I would like abide with a statistical reviewer
regarding this important point.
