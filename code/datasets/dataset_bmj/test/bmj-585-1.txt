This is a systematic review of observational data on SAVR and TAVI. In fact, the review is mainly about
biological SAVR. As this field has been changing in recent years, mainly related to the introduction of
TAVI and recent study findings, it is a timely and important topic. Given the fact that patients with severe
aortic stenosis are usually at advanced age, the topic is not only relevant for specialists, but also for a
broader public. The methodology of the review is sound and the results are interesting. There are,
however, important shortcomings that the authors should address. In its present form, the article is not
sufficiently focused and it is difficult for the reader to see the added value that may help them in clinical

decision making.
It is not really understandable to me why there is no comparison in any way between SAVR and TAVI. I
understand that follow-up is much short studies are few for TAVI and I also understand the rational of
investigating the risk for the “standard” procedure at present. Still, the authors claim to investigate the
difference as the main reason for conducting the systematic review (at least when reading the title and
the objectives of the abstract). Even if long-term comparison is not yet possible, shorter term
comparisons on survival/complications might be feasible also for observational studies. If the authors feel
that data are not sufficiently strong for TAVI, the whole set-up of this review should be different and
focus only on SVAR (with some comments on TAVI, mainly as discussion). In this case, the authors may
consider to not only include biological valves, but also mechanical valves. The latter might be interesting
with regard to the extension of the indication of TAVI with the recent findings from the PARTNER 2 trial
and the expected broadening of indication for TAVI to even lower-risk and younger patients. This may be
important in the light of possible patients’ preferences. It seems that the authors could provide the data
as they report on interaction of biological and mechanical valves regarding stroke although no other
findings regarding mechanical valves are reported.
Accordingly, I find the main conclusions what this study adds not compelling. In particular, it is important
to make some comments about (potential) differences between SAVR and TAVI. This is particularly true
as the authors state in their objectives of the abstract that considerations in deciding between the two
procedures are important. It should also made clear that SVAR refers to biological valves only (this latter
point also applies to the title of the manuscript) or that they change the focus as discussed above. I
personally would suggest to include mechanical valves.
The authors should refrain from repeating the results in the discussion, but rather put the findings into
perspective. This is particularly true to interpret the findings with respect to the meaning regarding
indication / selection for TAVI. Moreover, the authors should briefly discuss how their findings from
observational studies compare to the randomized controlled trials (not only regarding TAVI) and what the
potential impact of this comparison is. Right now, I find the discussion rather limited and not really
helping the reader to interpret the findings.
Minor comments
Please provide the actual references instead of writing (refs).
Some of the forest plots are almost impossible to read.
Taken together, there is potential interest in the data that could help making decision regarding
indication for intervention of aortic valve and SAVR versus TAVI. It could add significantly to current
knowledge. However, there is no clear message of the manuscript right now and the potential
implications are not well emphasised.
