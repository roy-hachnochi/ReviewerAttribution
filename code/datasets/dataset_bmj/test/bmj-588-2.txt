First of all, I have to acknowledge that I limited knowledge in genetics, so I think that my view here should be regarded
as that of a researcher with expertise in drug safety in pregnancy but otherwise representing a general reader of the BMJ
(who I believe could easily misunderstand the setup and method of this type of study). Therefore, I think it would be
essential that it is reviewed by someone with particular expertise in genetic association studies.
While I, as a drug safety researcher, do think that this is a very interesting and important subject and study and indeed
believe that studies such as these may help move the field of drug safety in pregnancy forward, as a general reader, I
find one thing hard to grasp:
When assessing and reporting relative risks, as reported in e.g. Table 3 (and the main results presented in the abstract),
it appears as a comparison is made between genotype distributions within the groups of SSRI users and non-users,
respectively, such that for instance in the SHMT1 analysis the relative risk associated with having GG and AG genotypes,
respectively, is compared with AA genotype. As this within-SSRI-user analysis is for the association with cardiac
malformations, I fail to understand why the total N (e.g. for the SHMT1 analysis, it is 243 among SSRI users) far
exceeds the stated number of CHD cases exposed to SSRIs (n=57) and controls exposed to SSRIs (n=54).
Further, again from a general reader perspective, I think that the paper might benefit from a bit more explicit
statements about the actual comparison being made, so that it is clearer whether or not the reported associations are
actually isolated to SSRI-exposure (and can be disentangled from SSRI-unexposed CHD). I think that at least the
abstract would benefit from this clarification.
