1. Are the study's aims and the issue and questions that the paper addresses relevant and
important to you as a patient? Do you think it would be relevant to other patients like you? What
about carers?
Addressing patient concerns about the risks of additional radiation exposure due to lung cancer
screening is essential to make screening more attractive to those at high risk for developing lung
cancer. I’ve heard patients express concern about this increased risk; I can’t say I’ve heard a lot
of carers express this concern, but then carers rarely go to support forums before a patient has
been diagnosed with cancer.
2. Are there any areas that you find relevant as a patient or carer that are missing or should be
highlighted?
Some parts of the paper were difficult for me to understand due to choice of wording and use of
several different ways of expressing risk (e.g., both ratios and percentages).
The paper did a good job of achieving its first objective of assessing cumulative radiation exposure.

Whether it assessed lifetime attributable risk of cancer incidence is less clear. I need a clearer
statement of how baseline risk for cancer incidence is determine for people who have NOT had lung
cancer screening--does it take into consideration body types, age, sex, past exposures, lifestyles?
Is there some widely-accepted calculation of cancer incidence for patients with a 20-pack-year
history of smoking? Without understanding the baseline, I can’t see how the estimated radiation
exposure from LDCT and PET-CT scans increases the risk of future cancers. This study would have
the most impact for me if I get a clearly understood statement of (1) my risk for future cancers
WITHOUT screening, AND (2) my risk for future cancers WITH screening.
Found myself wondering how much radiation exposure could be contributed by the radioactive
glucose tracer (FDG) used with PET scans. Its contribution to overall radiation exposure should be
calculated before it is dismissed as insignificant.
3. From your perspective as a patient, would the treatment, intervention studied, or guidance
given actually work in practice? Is it feasible? What challenges might patients face that should be
considered?
The conclusions of this study could be used during shared decision making as patient and provider
discuss whether lung cancer screening is appropriate. However, the conclusions would have to be
presented in a form more understandable to patients.
I am concerned that the paper states (p. 11) “…further studies may consider a higher starting age
for screening in high-risk women.” This seems to ignore the fact that lung cancer incidence over
the past two decades have been INCREASING in women, especially in younger women.
4. Are the outcomes that are being measured in the study or described in the paper the same as
the outcomes that are important to you as a patient? Are there others that should have been
considered?
Yes, the outcome (whether radiation from lung cancer screening increases my lifetime risk of
developing cancer) is important to me as a lung cancer patient/advocate.
5. Do you have any suggestions that might help the author(s) strengthen their paper to make it
more useful for doctors to share and discuss with patients?
Need a bit more background in the abstract about how radiation exposure puts patients at
increased risk of future cancers.
Find a more concrete way to express how much radiation exposure from low-dose lung cancer
screening increases my risk of developing future cancers. Example:
Without lung cancer screening, a 50-year-old woman has an AA% chance of developing cancer in
the next 20 years. If that 50-year-old woman undergoes lung cancer screening for 10 years, her
risk of developing a new cancer increases to BB%.
At several points in the paper, statements are made as apparent fact without providing the
reasoning. Example (from page 12): “…BEIR VII Report is the correct way to proceed to perform
risk estimates for the individuals [31] ….” This statement does cite a paper that addresses the
topic, but does not explain what conclusion in that paper causes the authors to believe this
statement to be true. Rather than just using an endnote citation, please state the authors and their
conclusions that support the statement in the text--those of us not intimately familiar with the
topic need more background to help us understand why this statement is true.
6. The level of patient involvement in the research described, and if and how it could have been
improved. Authors are now required to state if and how they involved patients in setting the
research agenda and the design and implementation of the study and include this information in a
box within the manuscript. If there was no patient involvement we would welcome your ideas on
how this could have been done. We hope this will help authors think of the best ways to include
patients in their future research and further progressive patient involvement in the research
enterprise.
Patients were not involved in this study. If the researchers had involved patients prior to writing
this paper, they might have gained a better concept of specific patient concerns about increased
cancer risk due to lung cancer screening radiation exposure, as well as language that could
effectively communicate the increased risk to patients.
