The revisions made by the authors have greatly improved the clarity and readability of the manuscript. The revisions
made to the introduction set the stage for the study objective in a much more compelling and tempered fashion.
Importantly, the authors have added or expanded the descriptions of many of the critical methodological details,
specifically those relating to VTE case identification and exposure definitions, that were previously lacking or unclear.
Finally, the authors have also improved the consistency in reporting across the sections, which has now made it clear
that the objective of the study was focused on the timing of testosterone initiation in relation to risk of VTE.
I have a few remaining comments:
1. The authors have defined “medical illness”, as requested; however, this description should be moved to the ‘Case
Definition’ section where the term is first referenced.
2. The authors responded “Of the 909,530 controls, 20,829 (2.3%) developed a VTE later, and 192,704 controls were
matched to more than 1 case (285,929 controls were matched to one case only)…”. If I have interpreted the response
correctly, out of the 2.92 million men in the source population eligible to be matched as controls, 192,704 controls
were matched to an average of ~3 cases each. Were these repeated controls those with pathological hypogonadism or
known risk factors, where identifying eligible controls with these conditions may have been more difficult to find? I
agree with the rest of the authors’ response regarding the issues related to avoiding bias through matching with
replacement; however it may be useful to consider a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of this.
3. Thank you for clarifying in your comment that matching was done based on pathological hypogonadism defined as
the presence of primary or secondary hypogonadism. There remain some inconsistencies with how this is referred to
throughout text and tables.
4. It remains unclear to me ‘as of when’ the exclusion criteria were applied. The authors’ response indicates that these
were assessed at the start of the study period (1 January 2001), however it is does not appear that all men under
consideration were required to be enrolled and considered up-to-standard and have at least 2 years of recorded
history in the CPRD on this date. Please clarify when a patient was eligible for evaluation to be included in the study
population.
5. In the discussion, the authors state “Stratification by presence and absence of known risk factors for VTE showed
similar and non-significantly different results in those with vs. those without the known VTE risk factor” (page 14). The
way this sentence is worded leads the reader to think that there is no difference in the RRs for those with known risk
factors compared to those without known risk factors for VTE. While the RRs were not statistically different, the
magnitudes of effect are clinically different (1.91 vs 1.41). Perhaps consider editing this sentence to be clear and
consistent with your main finding that, in relation to timing of use, the risk of VTE was elevated in the 6 months after
testosterone initiation for both of these groups.
Minor comments:
1. Please define the acronym “INR” in the text of the ‘Case Definition’ section.

2. Does the term “were flagged” (in Case Definition section) mean the cases were classified on presence or absence of
these known risk factors?
3. Thank you for clarifying that megestrol, corticosteroid, NSAID, and antiplatelet use were based on having a record
for a prescription within 90 days of the index date. For clarity, please add this to the text of the covariate section and
footnote.
4. Please define “FT” in Figure 1. Does this refer to free text?
