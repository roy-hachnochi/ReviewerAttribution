This is an extremely interesting study which includes the largest cohort yet reported on.
Issues which I think should be included/addressed in the discussion/results are
(1) What proportion of infants included in the study had a gestation which was not determined by gold
standard methods? What impact, if any, do the authors feel this will have had on their outcome data?
(2) Is it possible to split the cohort into those delivering spontaneously and those delivering iatrogenically
and if so does this impact on their results?
(3) Do they know if all units were able to offer same standard of care to extremely pre-term infants and if
not could this have impacted on results.
(4) Given the increasing body of evidence regarding the possible negative impacts of repeat steroid courses
it would perhaps be good to expand on possible impact of not collecting data on this.
