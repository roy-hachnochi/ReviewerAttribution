The authors undertake a careful analysis on a subject of great importance for US and UK workforce policy--namely the quality
of care provided by physicians of foreign origin in the United States. The analysis focuses on hospitalists and the outcomes-mortality and readmission rates--are well-respected quality measures for the hospital medicine field. The authors take great
care to risk adjust their findings and evaluate the level of acuity. Their finding that quality is stable across both foreign and US
trained physicians is an important one, worthy of the pages of the British Medical Journal.
The paper's discussion could be strengthened in the following ways:
1) More explicitly discuss the xenophobia and bias against physicians who have trained abroad and take on the implicit
assumption in the paper about the quality of medical training in the US versus abroad
2) More explicitly discuss a significant limitation of the paper--which is that it looks at quality of care provided by international
medical graduates, but it does not acknowledge the incredible heterogeneity that exists within the broader cohort
"international medical graduates." There are international medical graduates who grow up abroad and migrate to the US and
there are US residents who go abroad for medical training and return to the US. These groups are typically viewed quite
differently and the authors should acknowledge that there may be different results if they further stratified their analyses.
3) The paper should more explicitly discuss the caveat that while 30-day mortality and readmission rates are accepted
measures of quality for hospital medicine, there are other aspects of clinical care that may not be captured by those measures-patient satisfaction; effective use of evidence-based practice guidelines; etc.
Overally, this is a great topic--and a well executed paper. With some minor revisions to the discussion, I would recommend
that the editors accept it for publication.
