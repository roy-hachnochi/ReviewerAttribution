This paper is interesting, well done, based on validated methods, and assesses a very few explored questions about the links

between quality of care place of physiciansâ€™ initial training.
The assessment criteria (30 day mortality and readmission rate) is not unusual and due to the use of large database, authors
were able to take into account a lot of confusing variables in the main analyses as well as in sensitivity analyses and/or for
specific clinical conditions and/or for some specific medical exercises.
The results are consistent with the data and statistical methods and lead to discussion and conclusion congruent with these
results.
However, on the discussion section, the authors should take care to two factors:
- The IMG are younger than USMG, that is closer to their initial training and to best practices (that are more recently teach)
- The IMG may have a different strategy about continuous training: as they are foreigner they may be more cautious not to fail
and, this way, more interested in continuous training and willing to apply any new skill in their current practice
