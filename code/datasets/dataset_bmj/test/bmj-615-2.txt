The authors have made a very thorough reply to the reviewer comments and have revised the manuscript accordingly.
Clearly, the pragmatic approach on one hand limits the amount of data available, but on the other hand it makes the
study more clinically relevant. The revised paper is much clearer with more balanced conclusions.
I clearly recommend to accept the manuscript.
