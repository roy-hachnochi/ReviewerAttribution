This is a useful descriptive study which adds to the expanding literature on off-label prescribing and it contains the
largest cohort of prescriptions investigated so far using a database which includes the indication for prescribing. Off-label
prescribing (OLP) is legal and commonly practised and this paper gives us a better feel for the rates of such prescribing
than do earlier studies. As all the data are derived from a database there is little consideration of the determinants of
such prescribing or of what should be the consequences of revealing the extent and nature of OFP as it relates to
antidepressants. More context could briefly be added. For example do the practitioners use any clinical prescribing aids
in their practice? If so do these aids have a secure evidence-base comparable to that of "Drugdex" .Are such resources
kept up to date? How does the prescriber know that s/he is prescribing off-label?.
I think some reference to the clinical context would throw more light on how and why OFP occurs but this need only be a
brief section..
Overall the paper is rather long for its content and some of the data really do not contribute overall. Table 1 is a case in
point and might be dropped with the major items set in the text.
With a few modifications I think this paper is suitable for publication
