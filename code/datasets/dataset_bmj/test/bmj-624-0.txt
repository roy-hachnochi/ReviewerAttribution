Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting work. My comments are organized into major
points followed by suggested edits (e.g., grammar, wording).
Major points:
Throughout the manuscript the score is described as both a “healthy lifestyle score” and an “unhealthy
lifestyle score”. It should be consistent in the title, abstract, manuscript text and in tables and figures.
For example, in the methods p. 5 for the description of “healthy lifestyle score” higher values are more
favorable. However, the figure “Multivariate RR of Type 2 Diabetes According to Joint Categories of
Birthweight and Unhealthy Lifestyle” higher scores are intended to mean “less healthy”. This
inconsistency continues throughout the paper and makes it more difficult for the reader to follow.

Similarly the reference category used in eTable 2 is the lowest birthweight category rather than the
middle category as described in the methods (Page 6, line 34) and used in Table 2.
Methods
1. Why did the authors decide not to include waist circumference in the healthy living score?
2. Page 4, line 36-38. Provide references for the criteria used.
3. Page 5, first paragraph. Please confirm that reference 16 is the correct one. The sentence refers to
women but the reference is for men.
4. Page 5, line 32. Reference 14 is for men. Is there a similar reference for women?
5. Page 7. “Lifestyle factors were updated at each questionnaire cycle to reflect the most recent
information.” How were repeated measures of lifestyle factors handled in your analyses?
6. P. 6. Line 35: The middle category of birth weight was used as the reference group. How was the
linear trend across birthweight categories done (next sentence). Similar question for non-linear trends.
7. Meta-analysis: Is there an I2 or other statistic to report which assesses the consistency between the
study results for the three cohorts (e.g., Table 2, eTable1, eTable2)?
Discussion
8. Page 10, lines 44-46. What is it the gender difference that has been previously reported?
9. Page 10, lines 52-55. Do you mean that the older participants were more likely to be tested and
diagnosed with the disease? Or that follow-up time was longer?
10. Page 12, lines 37-40. The sentence about loci from genome-wide significant associations of
birthweight is not clear.
11. Table 1
Are the numbers for continuous variables means or medians?
12. Table 2
What is your interpretation of the RR of 0.69 95% CI 0.55-0.85 for men of high birthweight in the HPFS?
This finding was not discussed.
Please describe how p-linear trend and p nonlinear trend were assessed in the footnote.
Overall edits
There are a number of issues with grammar, wording and awkward phrases throughout which require
careful editing. For example:
Abstract
Page 2, line 30. % is missing
“with per score of unhealthy lifestyle” is awkward phrasing
Background
Page 3, lines 38-40. Sentence should be rewritten. Were focused on the individual lifestyle factors….
In addition this sentence is vague – what individual lifestyle factors?
Page 3, line 49. Analyses that are…..Our analyses are
Methods
Page 4, line 49. Missing the word “were”
Page 5, line 15. Were asked
Page 7, line 27. “hypertension” should be type 2 diabetes
Page 7, lines 25-28. Awkward sentence – “by decreasing of per kg birth”
Page 7, lines 51-52. The detailed equation can be found in
Page 9, lines 8-10. Participants with birth weights
Results
