The authors assess the association of birth weight and selected adult risk factors with onset of diabetes.
The authors attribute the effects to birth weight only, to lifestyle only, and to their interaction. The
largest contributor is adult lifestyle factors, but pre- and post natal factors also could contribute to
prevention of diabetes.
The healthy lifestyle score has already been evaluated, and a role of birth weight previously documented.
The main focus here is on the pattern of joint effects of birth weight and the healthy lifestyle score.
Overall, this is a strong manuscript. I have three reservations which, if addressed, could strengthen the
manuscript. My first reservation reflects a couple of statistical issues. The authors don’t state whether
they assessed the proportional hazards assumption. The PH assumption is potentially important, and it is
normally assessed. Similarly, it would be of interest to investigate a bit more an effect measure
modifying role of age, if any. They do allude to its possible importance in the discussion already in
discussing the difference between cohorts. Further, I am assuming that the time axis is calendar time,
but they could clarify.
My second reservation arises because the ideas at issue in the manuscript are causal ones as evidenced
by the discussion of potentially preventable deaths, and population attributable risk. Yet, the authors
have no mention of confounders, possible residual confounding or discussion of caveats about potential
lack of exchangeability. They do adjust for certain factors like age or ethnicity, but do not explicitly state
why. This is easily corrected by noting that these are suspect confounders, if indeed that was the case.
Also, some caution that there could be some residual confounding which, if present, would suggest some
error in the estimate of preventable deaths could help the reader to interpret appropriately and more
explicitly recognize that the issues are causal ones.
My final reservation is also related to the paper’s focus on the pattern of effects and causal issues. I am
uncertain about the possible roles of selection and time-since-first-exposure. Specifically, in Table 1, the
cohorts appear to be 36 to 51 on average at baseline. Selection is thus indirectly based on some effects
of exposures, some pre-existing, and other unmeasured factors - as the cohorts were disease-free, etc
initially. Is it possible that, had follow-up started earlier (nearer the time of first exposure) or had timesince-first-exposures been addressed, a different overall incidence pattern might have been observed?
For example, one of the lessons learned from the WHI suggested that time-since-first-exposure to HRT
can be important. In that situation, epidemiological studies suggested benefit of HRT on CHD risk,
whereas the clinical trial (WHI) results suggested the opposite. In assessing differences between the RCT
and epidemiologic studies, one author concluded: “The analyses presented here indicate that adjustment
for confounding factors and time from hormone therapy initiation can bring estrogen-plus-progestin
hazard ratios from the WHI observational study into fairly close agreement with those from the clinical
trial for coronary heart disease and venous thromboembolism and, to a lesser extent, for stroke.”

question about whether patterns of effects (additive or not) might be as sensitive or more so than are
“main effects” to these kinds of issues. Some cautionary note about the possible roles of selection and
time-since-first exposure vis a vis the pattern of effects might be useful.
