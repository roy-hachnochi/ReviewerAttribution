Spicy foods are widely consumed in China and many other countries. In this very large prospective study,

the authorsâ€˜ study addressed an important question of whether spicy foods are benefit to health. The
study provided important evidence for the recommendation of spicy foods, particular fresh spicy foods.
This is a well-designed and conducted study, and the article is well-written.
Major comments
1. According to their published study protocol, they included 56% rural participants (ref. 14). A large
proportion of the rural residents were not covered by the national health insurance (HI) system in the
early stage of the study (e.g., 2004-2008) in China. The cover rate may increase in recent several years
(about 5 years). However, even those covered by the HI system, a large number of whom may die in
their home without known the cause of death, particularly in the elderly population (>70 or >75 y). The
authors need to describe the more details how did they ascertain the vital status and the causes of death
for these participants and those of emigrants in their study. They may also need to discuss the potential
limitation for this problem if any. Since the vital data might be more valid in urban residents than in the
rural residents, stratified results by urban and rural regions would provided some useful information.
2. There is a potential reverse causal relationship between spicy foods and mortality even they had
excluded participants with cancer, heart disease and stroke. In generally, individuals with diseases
tended to be advised to consume less spicy foods by their doctor, and they had high risk of death. To
determine whether there is the possibility of reverse causality, it is needed to conduct some sensitive
analysis by excluding the death cases obtained within the first 1 or 2 years of follow-up, or conducting
the stratified analysis by follow-up duration (e.g., < or, >= median).
