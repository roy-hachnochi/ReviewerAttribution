Thank you for asking me to rapidly review this analysis manuscript.
Overall, it is an excellent analysis paper with a timely and important public health
message in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.
I have some additional suggestions that the authors/editors might wish to
consider:
1. Greater description of the "Germ Defence" intervention- I have just run through
the intervention website. It is very useful. Is there a way in which a summary box
could be used in this article to show the key ingredients more clearly that the text
description?
2. A recent paper in JAMA suggests rates of co-infection with other respiratory
pathogens is high. It might be that the "Germ Defence" intervention works well in
terms of reducing not just viral load of CORID-19 but also mitigates against
co-infection with other respiratory pathogens, which in turn are prognostically
important in terms of severity of illness.[1].
