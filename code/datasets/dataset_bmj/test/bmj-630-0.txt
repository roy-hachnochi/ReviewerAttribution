Diagnosis of miscarriage is an important topic as bleeding in early pregnancy is around a common
presentation to the emergency service affecting around 10,000 women in England and wales each year.
This means that early pregnancy units have to provide high through-put services to met patient demand.

High through-put services are subject to error rates and this paper is important as it details methods of
reducing error rates. The clear criteria to diagnose miscarriage described in this paper are of great clinical
importance.
In general the manuscript is clear written contains original research that is analyzed in a through and
robust fashion.
However this manuscript seem to be aimed that the specialist early pregnancy sonographer. As the BMJ is
a generalist journal I recommend some further clarifications are added to the manuscript:
1. Most gestation sacs are not spherical but oval, sausage or heart shaped, hence a clear definition of mean
sac diameter is needed. A diagram would help.
2. The quality of ultrasound measurement is affected by factors such as obesity, ultrasound equipment,
ultrasound couch, darkness of ultrasound room, operator training, operator experience. These would all
affect accuracy of MSD and CRL measurements.
3. The fetal heart in a 7mm fetus is very small and detection movement of a line <1mm is dependent on
the angle between the scan probe and heart .
4. There if no mention of the use to colour ultrasound to ensure absence of heart beat is correctly
diagnosed.
5. There is no mention of the use of two observers to ensure absence of heart beat as practiced in many
units. Ie the issue of human error in measurement and observation of heartbeat is not discussed.
6. Whilst the authors point out that some women do not know the first date of their last menstrual period
they often know the date their pregnancy test was first positive. Hence time since positive pregnancy test
is a clinical variable not mentioned in the manuscript.
7. The concept of uncertain viability is distressing to patients thus sensitive communications of this issue
should be mentioned.
