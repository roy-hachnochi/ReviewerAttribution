Thank you for asking me to review this paper. This is a very interesting study with large numbers of
participants. There are some really important messages here.
It will be extremely helpful to have some clear guidance and timelines on the diagnosis of miscarriage.
Please could the authors clarify if all women were followed expectantly until 11 to 14 weeks’ gestation. If
not, I have some concerns that different centres are using different criteria for the diagnosis of miscarriage
and that these criteria change during the course of study. In which case, I would suggest that the data
using the smaller criteria (crown rump length less than 6 mm and mean sac diameter less than 20 mm)
should be excluded from the analysis.
Lines 20-24
Until recently … the American College of Radiology used criteria
In contrast the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) used MSD ≥20mm or an embryo
with CRL ≥6mm with no heartbeat2
I have checked the RCOG guidance. The RCOG used an empty gestation sac (mean sac diameter > 20mm)
containing no yolk sac or embryo or crown rump length > 6mm with no heart activity until 2011.
Lines 55-56
The authors suggest that the ACR was the first to change its guidance (Lane et al 2013). The RCOG issued
revised guidance in 2011 that the criteria for the diagnosis of miscarriage should be changed to an empty
gestation sac (mean sac diameter > 25mm) containing no yolk sac or embryo, or, crown rump length >
7mm without heart activity (Addendum to RCOG guidance 19th October 2011 & Reference number 10 in
this paper). For pregnancies with measurements below these cut-offs, the scan should be repeated after a
minimum of seven days.
NICE adopted the revised RCOG guidance and included these criteria in their guidance on Miscarriage &
Ectopic Pregnancy December 2012. In addition NICE advise that a second observer should confirm the
findings.
The ACR guidance changed and was published in 2013.
Suggest change order of wording and change order of references to follow chronology.

A recent review in the New England Journal of Medicine was two years ago in 2013

Between September 2010 & March 2011
August 2011 – May 2013
The criteria for the diagnosis of miscarriage changed from empty gestational sac > 20mm with or without a
yolk sac or embryo crown rump length > 6mm in December 2011, to empty gestational sac > 25mm with
or without a yolk sac or embryo crown rump length > 7mm. Please would the authors clarify if they
followed NICE guidance that a second observer should confirm the diagnosis of non-viable pregnancy
during the period of study.

Please would the authors comment on the age of the Ultrasound machines. There are standards that
recommend that Ultrasound machines should be replaced after five years.

Line 28-43
I do not understand the following paragraph
We have not replaced missing values but have continued with complete cases.
Please clarify - does this mean that the authors have excluded women with missing data?
After internal investigation, we strongly believe that missing data regarding gestational age, MSD, CRL,
second scan, and the interval between scans are not systematic with respect to the associations
investigated in this study.
What does this mean please?
The only exceptions are cases that were lost to follow-up, these are commented on in the discussion. I
could not find any discussion about cases lost to follow up in the discussion.
In addition, because we focus on cut-offs that lead to near perfect specificity (to avoid a misdiagnosis of
miscarriage with viable pregnancies), we felt that it was most appropriate to analyze observed data. What
does this mean please?

The numbers in the non-viable group are small. (0/12 for mean sac diameter more than 25mm)
In the discussion, there should be mention that the diagnosis of miscarriage based on the failure to
visualise an embryo or cardiac activity (“negative diagnosis”) is generally less safe than a diagnosis based
on positive findings.
Examiners should avoid making a diagnosis of miscarriage on a single ultrasound scan in clinically stable
women with suspected miscarriage due to the presence of an empty gestational sac or due to the inability
to document embryonic cardiac activity. In all these women, the findings should be confirmed by a second
examiner or a follow up examination should be arranged at least 7 days later and in the case of smaller
pregnancies at least 14 days later.
Particular care should be taken in women with large uterine fibroids and congenital uterine anomalies,
which increase the risk of diagnostic errors. In women with a history of previous Caesarean section, the
uterus may be located high in the pelvis due to adhesions. In all these cases transabdominal scans should
also be considered to minimise the risk of diagnostic errors.
Conclusion
If I have understood the results correctly, I would simplify the “take home messages”
The criteria of empty gestation sac without yolk sac or embryo more than 25mm mean sac diameter or
embryo more than 7mm crown rump length should be adopted for the diagnosis of miscarriage.
The diagnosis of miscarriage should always be confirmed by a second observer or the scan repeated after
no less than 7 days.
In pregnancies of uncertain viability, a repeat scan should be arranged
If there is an embryo present, the scan should be repeated in no less than 7 days.
If the sac is small and there is a yolk sac – the scan should be repeated in no less than 14 days.
If the sac is small and a yolk sac has appeared on the second scan 14 days later, the scan should be
repeated in no less than 7 days.

I would suggest that the date of the first positive pregnancy test should be studied as well as gestational
age. Many women can’t remember their LMP, have irregular cycles which make LMP unreliable, or conceive
following a miscarriage without having a period, but all have in common a positive pregnancy test.
Recommend publication with clarification of the above points.
