I found this to be a strong, well-executed study/meta-analysis.
There are a few grammatical/spelling errors:
Line one of abstract - I would change to "clinical utility of CERVICAL visual inspection
with acetic acid...."
In the abstract, the authors could potentially strengthen the conclusion statement by
highlighting that VILI had a higher sensitivity than the other tests (i.e. For primary
screening of cervical cancer in SSA, VILI is a simple and affordable alternative to
cytology that demonstrates higher sensitivity than VIA or HPV testing. Confirmatory
studies comparing to histology from random cervical biopsies are still needed).
In the discussion, on page 12, 2nd paragraph, "colposcope" is misspelled. The
authors, in highlighting the benefits of VILI over VIA, discuss the lack of a time gap
with application of iodine. The next sentence discussion need for repeat soaking of
the cervix, I assume, is meant to say repeated soaking of the cervix with acetic acid
rather than iodine. Further discussion of VILI in pre versus postmenopausal women
would be an interesting addition.
