The authors have performed a thoughtful and detailed analysis of an important question -- does
discretionary day-of-surgery transfusion have an impact. By excluding patients that receive 5+ units
over the hospital admission, or receive PRBCs on later postoperative days, the impact of procedurerelated anemia transfusion is more clearly identified.
Methods
- there is a multitude of testing performed. most of it appears to have been predefined. was a protocol
submitted or registered that documents the various and many subgroup and sensitivity analyses
- it is unclear to me whether all documented discharge diagnoses were available for the elixhauser
comorbidity scoring -- how many diagnoses were the min/max/median?. the methods suggest primary
and secondary were used. unclear if secondary includes comorbidity codes as opposed to pure
"secondary" codes
- why is the non-mixed model logistic regression presented or used at all? we know that there is
clustering of patients at the hospital level and that fixed hospital covariates do not incorporate all of the
unmeasured hospital-level effects. The authors are to be commended for using a mixed effects model,
but I would recommend for simplicity and readability, that the mixed effects model, with hospital as a
random effect, is the primary analyses presented. although it is described as the "primary logistic
regression model", the methods section seems to describe a very iterative process where different
pieces are added/removed. I presume the authors did not retain variables that were predictors in the
standard model but eliminated in the mixed effects. However, the "manual iterative forward technique"
leaves it unclear if the same thresholds were applied through all phases (fixed and mixed)
- correct "compliment" to "complement"
- the propensity score analysis is concerning given how poor the ROC for that regression is.
Results
- the term "packed red blood cells" should not be introduced in the results section. either use pRBC
throughout, or stay with RBC. it makes the reader wonder
- the obesity % in table 1 seem very underreported. is this purely ICD9 data, or are actual BMIs used?
- is table 2 the mixed effects model results, or standard fixed effects logistic regression only?
- I think univariate odds ratios are not helpful in table 2 and make it harder to read. thank you for the
transparency, but it comes at the expense of readability
- table 2: by orthopedic, you mean joint replacement, correct?
- the title of the paper and the data presented are inconsistent..the title is regarding "single unit" while
patients up to 4 units are included. maybe discretionary transfusion is a better title?
Discussion
- I think the discussion is divergent from the actual data presented and their unique value. instead of
summarizing the known literature, I think the authors should be more focused on their data: that even 1
unit of PRBC confers risk. the dose dependent relationship they have demonstrated is also impressive.
The authors should focus on the "discretionary" transfusions aspect of their data.
- other limitations include the absence of hemodynamic data. it remains unclear whether the alternatives
to transfusion (crystalloid?) are preferable. the absence of any clinical data prevents us from knowing
that the patients had similar hemodynamic profiles prior to transfusion
