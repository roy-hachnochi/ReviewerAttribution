Arthroscopic surgery for the degenerative knee: A systematic review and meta-analysis of
benefits and harms
The authors have submitted a strong response to the comments made with an appropriately
revised manuscript. They have updated the analysis as I suggested, and their key findings
remain strong (if not stronger) than in the original manuscript.
I have one comment that I would like them to address:
1) The conversion of the effect size to the VAS scale difference is not fully described. It must be
made based upon some presumed value of the standard deviation of the VAS scale. As an ES of
0.14 corresponds to a VAS difference of 2.4mm, so I presume that the sd is about 17mm). It
would be appropriate to fully explain this in the paper and explain where the value of 17mm
has arisen from
