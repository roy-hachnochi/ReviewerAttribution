BMJ â€“ Stats Review
This Systematic review evaluates the evidence for hospital hygiene promotion with particular emphasis on that
identified for WHO-5 (System change, Education, Feedback, Reminders, and institutional safety climate). Reduced
evidence was identified from RCTs but the inclusion of other study designs, in particular Interrupted Time Series,
provides more information about the comparative effectiveness of several strategies. There is a major issue in
that the current use of Network Meta-analysis given the sparse data is not adequate. This is highlighted by the
estimate obtained for T8 (obtained from a double indirect comparison: T8 vs T3, T3 vs T11, T11 vs T1).
One potential solution is to drop altogether the NMA and focus only on the direct pairwise comparisons while an
alternative is to restructure the current network and reclassify the interventions into 4 categories:T1, T2 to T6,
T7, T7+. This way, a complete network could be created (leaving nodes not in the network out, such as T4, T5,
and T8) and a comparison of WHO5 vs. None, WHO-5 vs WHO-5+ could be made. From the Introduction and the
Discussion, this appears to be the main focus of the paper. The choice will clearly depend on the coherence of this
grouping. If not appropriate, please drop the attempt to use NMA and just report pairwise comparisons. Clearly
this change will mean a readjustment of the rest of the paper.
