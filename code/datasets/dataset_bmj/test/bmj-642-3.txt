The authors seek to describe the impact of PPI on post-MI bleeding associated with anti-thrombotic drug use and
NSAIDS. This is a complex question, involving three drug exposures and MI hospitalizations, and the authors
employed a flexible, time-varying treatment approach to categorize periods of drug exposure time. I generally agree
with the overall study design to answer this question, but there are some clarifications required to give a full
understanding of the study design, and some suggestions which appear below:
Commendations:
1. I appreciate the thoughtful sensitivity analyses which addressed important questions such as over-the-counter
NSAID use, individual medication formulation subgroups rather than simply class effects, age, etc.
Substantive comments:
1. The authors require survival for 30 days post-discharge: when does the follow-up begin for the time-to-event
analyses? It should begin after the 30-day quarantine period to not include immortal person-time, and I don’t see
that explicitly stated anywhere in the manuscript.
2. Presumably, some patients could be followed for almost 14 years—while an impressive ability in the database, at
some point these patients could not be classified as immediate post-MI patients. Would it make sense to censor
follow-up sooner after MI discharge rather than follow each patient to the maximum ability of the dataset? At some
point, the risks of the immediate post-MI period will be decreased, and the patients’ indications for the drugs may
change. An analysis with a limited follow-up (maybe 1 or 2 years post-MI) may be informative and the results more
relevant to the question of post-MI antithrombotic drug bleeding.
Minor comments:
1. The authors spend a substantial portion of the “Antithrombotic, PPI and NSAID Treatment” section (Page 8)
discussing calculating daily dosage, which gives the impression that an analysis of medication dosage will be
performed. But rather, it appears that these are simply ways of defining periods of binary (yes/no) drug exposure.
It would be very helpful if this was stated outright.
2. On page 7, line 49-52, the authors state that “patients were included if they were on antithrombotic therapy at
discharge.” How was the definition of “at discharge” operationalized? If the database contained pharmacy-dispensed
prescriptions, does “at discharge” mean filled prescriptions within the 30 days post-discharge (or some other
window)?
Editorial comments:
1. I am not entirely positive of the meaning of the line (page 8, line 49): “Each patient´s exposure group at
inclusion defined baseline treatment.” Does this simply refer to the initial treatment is what is used to show the
covariate distributions in Table 1?
2. A figure showing the baseline periods, quarantine periods, follow-up, and drug exposure windows would be very
helpful in understanding the cohort design.
3. The figure 1 flowchart seems to be missing some lines connecting the PPI and PPI+NSAID groups to the other
treatment groups.
