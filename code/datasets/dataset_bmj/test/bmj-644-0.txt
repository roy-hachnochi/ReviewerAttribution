There are very few papers in which I have no major changes to propose. This is one of them. The
authors investigated the prognosis of patients in the USA with AF who had a stroke and were

discharged on oral anticoagulation versus those who were not treated with warfarin. The study is
based on a prospective registry (get-with-the –guidelines) which collects prospectively data from
about 1/3 of stroke patients admitted to a hospital in the USA. The authors used Medicare claims
to identify vascular endpoints and “time at home”. As far as I can see this is the first study of its
kind with data from USA hospitals. The strengths of the study are
1. Prospective design with publication of the methods
2. Application of patient centred outcomes (e.g. time at home)
3. Propensity matching
4. Sensitivity analyses in patients with and without NIHSS recorded
5. Extensive discussion of the possible shortcomings of the study
The authors might want to mention that the majority of population based studies are from the
Danish Health Registry and (1) and that the rate of anticoagulation after stroke in AF patients has
improved dramatically in the last 10 years (2).
