This study examines the issue of chronic benzodiazepine use and risk for AD, all-cause dementia and
cognitive decline in the population-based ACT cohort. The article is well-written and the design is wellconceptualized and thorough in the inclusion of covariates. A particular strength is the use of electronic
pharmacy records and integration of health history with self-report and medical records. Additionally, the
examination of “reverse causality,” where benzodiazepines may be prescribed for the treatment of
prodromal symptoms (by modifying the exposure window relative to the diagnosis of dementia) is a
strength. The authors acknowledge the limitations of the CASI, and employ an IRT approach. A minor
suggestion is to add a sentence or two explaining how that approach might absolve a concern about
ceiling effects or relative insensitivity of the CASI to detect cognitive decline in this relatively welleducated population. A comment in the Discussion related to this issue is also suggested.
