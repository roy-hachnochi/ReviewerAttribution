Methods
1. The electronic linkage with the national health insurance (HI) claim
databases started in 2011, the authors may need to clearly describe the methods of "Ascertainment of
deaths".
2. The quality of assessments of death causes in rural and urban regions is quite different in China,
subgroup analysis will be helpful to address if the associations are consistent in rural and urban regions.
3. For the cause-specific death, the favorable associations were significant only for ischaemic heart
diseases and respiratory system diseases. These two types of diseases typically have long course of
disease. Subjects with these diseases might stop to consume spicy food in their early time. It is unlikely to
fullly excude the possibility of the potential reverse causal relationship even excluding the deaths during
the first two years. Stratified-analysis by follow-up duration will address if these is a potential reverse
causal relationship.
