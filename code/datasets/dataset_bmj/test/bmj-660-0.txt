The most cost-effective diagnostic approach to the assessment of any underlying structural
('macrovascular') lesion in acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is an ongoing clinical dilemma,
with most of the evidence related to indirect (ie CTA or MRA) versus direct (ie DSA) angiography
being based on small single center retrospective series of selected patient groups. Thus, this large,
prospective, multicentre, Dutch study is an important addition in producing reliable data to guide
clinical practice.
Key strengths of this study is the pragmatic nature of targetted sequencing of investigations within a
standardised protocol, with central blinded expert neuroradiological diagnosis of the underlying
cerebral lesions, based on a priori sample size estimates to allow good estimates of prevalence and
diagnostic accuracy of tests, and multivariable analysis to produce a preditive diagnostic algorithm.
Although the study has purposefully excluded those patients with deep ICH and a clear history of
hypertension, as well as those who are elderly (>70 years), which explains the lower PPV for CTA
(74%) than previous studies, this is unlikely to have produced such selection bias to have
compromised the internatl and external validity of these data. Moreover, not all patients with
negative CTA (or MRA) went on to have DSA, so we do not know exactly how many structural lesions
were missed, or of MRA alone as the inital diagnostic test. Again, however, this is not a major
criticism of the study and reflects the reality of undertaking this type of research and the relevance
of these data to contemporary clinical practice in most medium-high resource settings.
It is difficult to be critical of this manuscript. The background and rationale are cleraly defined, the
methods and data reporting are of the highest epidemiological quality, and there is high
generalisability of these data. Further, the manuscript is writing with a high degree of style and
presentation.
