This is a very important paper examining a large U.S. (in this case, New York State) based population
results of hip fracture length of stay effect on mortality, with comparison that to a European (in this case
Sweden) hip fracture length of stay study results.
That said, the authors should emphasize, in addition to their conclusions, one important takeaway point:
that different health systems in varying geographic locations (i.e. Europe v. Asia v. North America. etc.)
can have a profound effect on how patients fare after a hip fracture, therefore conclusions by the reader of
these study results from these locations should take these differences into account. In this case, results
from a large Swedish population cannot be generalized to a US population, and vice versa.
In regards to the above, one question for the author's is: Have you looked at similar studies from other
countries (i.e. Britain, Germany, Japan, etc) to see if similar discrepancies also exist when compared to the
U.S. New York State population you studied?
And Also: Have you considered looking at not just the New York State population, but other states in the
U.S. to see how they have compared to each other?
For Page 6, Line 21: You mentioned that "healthcare systems in Europe and the United States differ in both
LOS and usual discharge destination." Can you provide more detail as to how they exactly differ?
And similarly for Page 11, line 56: You mention that " interpretation of their results would require
knowledge of the average time to surgery for Swedish hip fracture patients." Have you considered
contacting the author's of that Swedish study to see if they could provide that information? Having that
information would make for a stronger comparison difference that your paper suggests exists between US
and European healthcare systems.
