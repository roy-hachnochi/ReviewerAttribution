In this original research paper, Dr Cai et al provide the results of a meta-analysis on the association
between prediabetes and increased risk of all-cause mortality and adverse cardiovascular events in the
general population and in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), over a median
8.8-year follow-up. The present study is comprehensive, well-conducted and needs to be commended
for the use of the robust statistical analysis, which has provided a nuanced insight into the risk imparted
by various definitions of prediabetes.
My comments regarding the meta-analysis are the following:
1) In the methods, it would be valuable to provide a more detailed definition of prediabetes (with a table
showing definitions proposed by various Associations and WHO). This would be particularly important
considering that the authors have analysed the association between different definitions of diabetes and
outcomes.
2) Also in the methods, it would be valuable to provide the definition of the CVD as an outcome (and
how it differs rom CHD)?
3) Some of the studies including “general population” have also included patients with probable or
established CVD, which could have modified the influence of prediabetes on outcomes. It would be
valuable to extract those studies from the general that have included only patients without known CVD,
as a subgroup analysis.
4) A more detailed discussion on a difference in the risk conferred by prediabetes in Asians vs.
non-Asians would be of significant interest.
5) Also, similar risks across subgroups according to age, gender and follow-up duration should be
discussed in more detail.
