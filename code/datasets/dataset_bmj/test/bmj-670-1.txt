Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting manuscript on the topic of 5-year
change in alcohol intake and risk of breast cancer and coronary heart disease (CHD). I commend
the authors on having tried to tackle an important research question and have some questions
and observations that may help Dam and colleagues to improve their paper further. However, I
also hold reservations about the novelty of this study (particularly with respect to the analyses
with CHD as an outcome) and in light of this, its overall contribution to the existing evidence
base to further our understanding of the role of changes in alcohol intake in relation to breast
cancer and CHD. A general issue is that throughout the manuscript a lot of decisions are not
appropriately justified, including choosing the outcome of breast cancer (had another alcoholrelated cancer been chosen it would have also been possible to assess the relationship between
changes in alcohol consumption in males as data was also available for men). I am also not
entirely convinced that the methodology implemented (a change score/transition between
categories of alcohol intake measures taken 5-years apart) can necessarily be used to examine
“causality” as the authors claim.
I have structured my report (generally) in chronological order. While there are many positives to
this paper, I have only focussed on areas I feel could be improved and expand upon the
concerns I have noted above. Specific comments I have on this manuscript are as follows:
1. In the abstract, the conclusion that “[…] alcohol is positively associated with breast cancer
and inversely associated with coronary heart disease” (page 3, lines 9-11) should perhaps be
reworded – as the term ‘positively’ could be misinterpreted to indicate ‘protective’; I think it
would help to be more explicit by stating increased/decreased risk for breast cancer/CHD,
respectively.
2. In the first paragraph of the introduction it is stated that the association between alcohol
consumption and CHD is “inverse” (page 4, line 13), while it is clarified that this refers to
light/moderate drinkers having a lower risk of compared to non-drinkers, it is not strictly true – I
think it would be more appropriate to describe the association as curvilinear (meta-analyses,
including the Roerecke & Rehm. 2012. Addiction, 107: 1246–1260. doi: 10.1111/j.13600443.2012.03780.x study cited, typically show U/J/L shaped relationships).
3. In the same paragraph work is cited RE: mechanisms underlying the dose-response
association between alcohol intake and breast cancer as well as CHD for which it is argued that
this is evidence in favour of a causal association. However, at least for outcomes such as CHD
where there is slightly more scepticism surrounding the alleged protective effects, this is a
rather one-sided presentation of the evidence base. Others have noted that for multiple
mechanisms cited, including those from the meta-analysis of small-scale interventional studies
(e.g. increases in HDL cholesterol and adiponectin, as well as lower levels of fibrinogen, etc Brien et al. 2011. BMJ 342: d636), the evidence for them being associated with a lower risk of
CHD is not always convincing (this is covered in, for example, Chikritzhs et al. 2015. Addiction
110: 726-727, doi: 10.1111/add.12828, and Holmes et al. 2014. BMJ. 349: g4164, doi:
10.1136/bmj.g4164). I would suggest this side of the story is also incorporated to provide a
more balanced discussion of the current evidence base. This argument is also made in your
discussion section on page 19, lines 22-29.

4. In the next paragraph it is argued that long-term randomised trials are unlikely to be
conducted in the near future – this is then used as a platform to justify examining change in
alcohol consumption between two occasions as a means of assessing causality. I have two
comments at this stage.
Firstly, I think you could at this point cite and comment briefly on the most recent large-scale
Mendelian randomisation study (sometimes referred to as natures randomised trial) of alcohol
consumption and CHD (Holmes et al. 2014. BMJ. 349: g4164, doi: 10.1136/bmj.g4164) which
demonstrated that carriers of the A-allele of ADH1B (rs1229984) had lower odds of CHD.
Secondly, the argument RE: change in an exposure being associated with a change in risk if the
hypothesised direction seems underdeveloped. I appreciate that Grønbæk et al. 2004
Epidemiology, 15: 222-228, doi: 10.1097/01.ede.0000112219.01955.56 is cited, where this
argument is also made, but it might help to note that a change in consumption may not
necessarily result in a change in the risk as hypothesised, given that this change may not be
sufficient to offset previous cumulative exposure (or lack of). I also think in the case of alcohol
intake the point noted RE: former drinkers (page 4, lines 26-30) further complicates this
methodological stance (see Fillmore and Chikritzhs. 2010, Addiction, 105: 646–647. doi:
10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02895.x).
5. It is not until the discussion section (page 28, lines 8-44) that you actually go on to describe
existing work looking at changes in consumption and disease; noting that you are not aware of
any studies examining this issue for breast cancer as an outcome (making that part of your
study novel) but note multiple studies that have examined changes in alcohol consumption and
CHD and alleged intermediates (fibrinogen, etc). Given this work already exists (including
computing differences in risk on the basis of 5-year changes in consumption in Danish
participants for both men and women; Grønbæk et al. 2004 Epidemiology, 15: 222-228, doi:
10.1097/01.ede.0000112219.01955.56) why did you choose to replicate this in the current
analyses? What does your analysis for CHD add to the existing literature? (i.e. what is novel in
terms of the CHD side of the paper?)
The manuscript is also missing some studies that have explicitly examined the association
between changes in alcohol intake and CHD, these include: 1. Britton A, Marmot MG, Shipley MJ.
How does variability in alcohol consumption over time affect the relationship with mortality and
coronary heart disease? Addiction. 2010;105(4):639–645; Emberson JR, Shaper AG,

Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality: Accounting for Intake Variation over Time. American
Journal of Epidemiology. 2005 May 1;161(9):856–863; and 3. Mukamal KJ, Conigrave KM,
Mittleman MA, et al. Roles of Drinking Pattern and Type of Alcohol Consumed in Coronary Heart
Disease in Men. N Engl J Med. 2003 Jan 9;348(2):109–118. As well as others looking at changes
and intermediates, e.g. Mozaffarian D, Hao T, Rimm EB, Willett WC, Hu FB. Changes in Diet and
Lifestyle and Long-Term Weight Gain in Women and Men. N Engl J Med. 2011 Jun
22;364(25):2392–2404;
Furthermore, there are several studies that have attempted to look at life time alcohol intake in
relation to both breast cancer (Chen et al. 2011, JAMA, 306: 1884-1890,
doi:10.1001/jama.2011.1590; Terry et al. 2006, Annals of Epidemiol, 16: 230-240; Longnecker
et al. 1995, Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev, 4:721-725) and CHD (e.g. Bergmann et al. IJE.
2013, 42:1772–1790; Ferrari et al. 2014, BMJ Open, 4:e005245 doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014005245; Kerr and Ye. (2010). J Stud Alc Drug, 71: 515–525, doi: 10.15288/jsad.2010.71.515).
While these are briefly touched upon (only Chen et al. 2011 cited) in the discussion section, it
might help to mention them in the introduction section and describe how the approach you have
used (e.g. change between two occasions ~5 years apart) is more useful than them/adds
sufficient additional information. You already note in your discussion section on page 19, lines
31-35, that a 5 year period may be less than ideal due to the timescale/process leading to
cancer manifesting [do the same limitations not also apply to CHD?], so wouldn’t accounting for
life-time/long-term changes in alcohol intake be more appropriate?
6. Under the methodology section it is stated that both men and women were invited to
participate in the Diet, Cancer and Health study – so why did you choose to focus only on
women? I appreciate that the paper is written with breast cancer as one of the outcomes (and
cases of breast cancer in men in the cohort are likely to be far too rare to be able to analyse) –
but this is not justified. There are several cancers that you could have chosen to study that have
been demonstrated to have a dose-response association with alcohol (e.g. oral cavity and
pharynx, oesophagus, colorectum, liver and larynx; Bagnardi et al. 2015, Br J Cancer, 112: 58093. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2014.579) which would have allowed you to also include men.
7. You do well to describe how the sample was constructed based on those who were excluded
due to missing data, etc. However, is it possible to conduct an analysis to determine whether
those who did not agree to take part were different to those who agreed to participate? I know
you make the case in your discussion section that you do not feel that selective participation is
likely to have biased findings substantially (page 20, lines 42-56, and page 21, lines 3-6),
however, recent studies (based on Danish data) seem to indicate that non-responders have
higher rates of alcohol (as well as drug- and smoking-) related mortality and morbidity (see
Christensen et al. 2015. Addiction, doi: 10.1111/add.12939) which directly contradicts your
argument.

Furthermore, were there differences in the characteristics of those who took part at the baseline
survey but did not attend the follow-up (1999-2003) compared to those who remained in the
study? This is another source of bias that is not discussed in the manuscript. You could account
for this in your analysis by using inverse probability weighting (see Hernan et al. 2004.
Epidemiology, doi: 10.1097/01.ede.0000135174.63482.43).
I do not think this necessarily needs to be included in the paper, but perhaps available as an
online supplement.
8. In terms of covariate choice – how did you decide which variables you wished to include? It
appears that some variables (e.g. BMI, hypertension and elevated cholesterol [which kind of
cholesterol?]) could be considered “mediators” in the relationship between alcohol intake and
CHD – therefore adjusting for them is likely to have biased your effect estimates (Schisterman
et al. 2009, Epidemiology, 20:488–495, doi: 10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181a819a1). Although I
appreciate in sensitivity analyses you estimated models without adjustment for hypertension,
elevated cholesterol and diabetes [type 2 only?]. Furthermore, why did you not adjust the
breast cancer estimates for smoking status which has been found to increase the risk of breast
cancer (see, for example, Gaudet et al. 2013, J Natl Cancer Inst, 105: 515-525. doi:
10.1093/jnci/djt023).
9. Your description of how missing data was handled could be improved. Firstly, it is not clear
why education was handled differently from other variables (or how age was used to predict the
most likely category). Secondly, were all variables in your models (e.g. use of HRT, parity,
smoking status, physical activity, etc) also included in your imputation model? Upon first reading
I am not sure whether only age, sex, education, health status and breast cancer/CHD were
included. Why did you only include this limited set of variables? I assume that substantially more
data was available for you to use to construct your imputation model.
10. The standard practice in survival analysis is that an individual who has not experienced a
particular event of interest by the end of follow-up is considered censored, under the assumption
that censoring itself is not associated with the probability of experiencing an event at any time
during follow-up. In the analyses presented in this manuscript, taking CHD as an example, this
assumption could be violated as those who did not go on to experience a CHD event may not do
so because they died from other causes (therefore their chance developing CHD is now zero
following this). Others have noted that part of the protective effect of alcohol consumption on
CHD risk may be explained by competing risks (see Bergmann et al. IJE. 2013, 42:1772–1790).
See Wolkewitz et al. 2014. BMJ, 349: g5060, DOI: 10.1136/bmj.g5060 for a non-technical
description of interpreting and comparing risks in the presence of competing events, and
Andersen et al. 2012. Int J Epidemiol 41:861-870, DOI: 10.1093/ije/dyr213; and Putter et al.
2006. Statist Med, 26: 2389-2430, DOI: 10.1002/sim.2712 for slightly more mathematical
descriptions.
Can you clarify whether you accounted for competing risks in your analysis? (I do not think so).
While it would be preferable to do so – at the very least, if you did not (and are unwilling to do
so), you should state the limitations of the current analytic approach and appropriately caveat
the interpretation (i.e. that it should be interpreted as the probability of an event occurring in a
hypothetical world whereby the competing events do not exist).
11. On page 8, line 8 – why did you choose these thresholds (<7, 7-13 and 14+ drinks per
week) to categorise alcohol consumption? (especially as by doing this you have combined
current non-drinkers, consisting of both former drinkers and life-long non-drinkers, with
occasional drinkers and very low consumers – which is known to introduce bias: see Stockwell et
al. 2012. BMJ, 344: e2276). Similarly, why did you choose to categorise the change score
between alcohol intake at baseline and follow-up into 7 categories (line 31) and what led to you
choosing those thresholds? Is it necessary to present the categorised version when you also
model the association using restricted cubic splines? (you can present the HRs for given values
of change in consumption using the command -xblc- in Stata to do this; see Orsini and
Greenland. 2011, Stata Journal, 11: 1-29). What is the benefit of presenting analyses for both
the transition between drinking categories between study phases (Tables 2-3) and change
scores (Figures 1-2)? They seem to come to the same conclusion and your tests for interaction
between baseline level of consumption and change in drinking are both non-significant (page 14,
line 6 and page 16, line 17).
12. On page 9, lines 20-22 – you state a “sick-quitter analysis” was done, however, exactly
what this entailed is not defined until the results section on page 14, lines 24-26. I would
suggest that this is described under the sensitivity analysis section first. I assume each of these
sensitivity analyses were carried out separately (that is, you did not run a model that
simultaneously removed all abstainers AND addressed sick-quitting using the method you
chose). Some of the other sensitivity analyses were also poorly justified, for example, why did
you look for a differential association by smoking status?
13. I was somewhat confused by your decision to use a categorical version of change in alcohol
intake that was not included in your final models to test for statistical interactions, especially as
the categories were so broad (only 36% of the sample remained stable drinkers, 34% fell in the
category of reducing their intake [at any level] and 30% increased it [at any level]). Can you
please explain the rationale behind this and comment on/justify whether you think it is sound to

do so?
14. In terms of the results section, I know that rates of non-drinking are generally low in
Denmark, but was surprised that only 2% of the baseline sample were non-drinkers – a figure
rising to 5% at follow-up (150% increase in ~5 years), is this consistent with published national
figures?
15. Tables 2-3 are difficult to absorb – is there any way that they could be made more reader
friendly? Even if that involves splitting the table up or using more columns/rows.
16. I do not agree with the statement that for women who decreased their alcohol intake that
their findings for breast cancer or CHD were ambiguous – from what I understand of Table 1-2,
amongst women who were heavy drinkers at baseline, those who reduced their alcohol intake
between occasions were more likely to develop cancer/CHD – especially those who declined into
the lowest category (e.g. HR 1.2, CI 0.79-1.83 for breast cancer and 1.3, CI 0.90-1.81). This is
in keeping with the sick-quitting hypothesis. Moderate drinkers (7-13 drinks per week) who
reduced their drinking down to lower levels (<7 drinks per week) also lowered their risk of
developing both breast cancer and CHD (which is consistent with the argument that limiting
alcohol intake is associated with better health outcomes across the board). However, it is true
that you did find lower risks for developing CHD across all categories that increased their
drinking, even amongst those who move on to exceed current Danish recommendations for
weekly drinking in women (high risk from 168g/week
[https://sundhedsstyrelsen.dk/en/health/alcohol], which is 14 drinks per week, equivalent to 21
UK units) – in fact, their estimated risk was much lower. Why do you think this was? It’s
especially weird that the moderate drinking group at baseline who increased their drinking
further actually had the lowest estimated risk of CHD (lower than those who remained heavy
drinkers throughout, which is counterintuitive if you’re arguing sustained higher dose is likely to
lead to better CHD outcomes) – I think this falls under the limitations of the change score
methodology [offset critique], as outlined under point #4 above.
17. Stemming from this, it might be worth commenting on your finding that increasing alcohol
consumption was associated with a reduced risk of CHD – even when the changes extended
beyond current Danish guidelines [both Table 1 and Figure 2] – perhaps under the section RE:
public health recommendations with respect to drinking on page 22 of the manuscript.
18. The statement on page 16, line 37 that you performed a sick-quitting analysis for CHD that
caused a small change in estimates is ambiguous. Can you clarify what a small change is? Was
this for the categorical and continuous change score models?
19. I am not sure what you mean by “independent of type of alcohol” when commenting on
drinking pattern; surely beverage type is a separate issue?
20. It might be worth noting that while the effect of change seemed “independent” of
consumption at baseline, you did not have information on lifetime alcohol consumption, and also
did not/were unable to account for changes in consumption/covariates during follow-up for
breast cancer/CHD events.
21. In the penultimate paragraph of the discussion, the argument regarding weighing the “pros
and cons” of drinking on health seems a little confused and counter to the typical public health
advice given which is to limit alcohol consumption, should you choose to drink. See: Nichols et
al. 2012. BMJ Open, 2: e000957, doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2012-000957. I would advise that you
consider rewording it.
22. As a reader, the conclusion “[…] it is not possible to make any recommendations concerning
alcohol intake on the basis of this study. It would have required performing an analysis for
overall mortality as the outcome […]” leaves me thinking two things; 1) what new assertions can
be made on the basis of your findings (again, coming back to the point of what your study adds
to the evidence base that is not already documented, and the potential public health utility of
this), and 2) if that is the case, why didn’t you carry out analysis for all-cause mortality as an
endpoint if the information was available to you?
Some other minor points for you to consider
1. You might consider citing “Allen NE, Beral V, Casabonne D, et al. Moderate Alcohol Intake and
Cancer Incidence in Women. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2009;101(5):296–305” in your introduction
section – it is the largest study (1.28 million women) on the topic of alcohol consumption and
cancer that I am aware of and shows a 12% increase in breast cancer risk per 10g increase in
alcohol per day.
2. On page 7, line 37 – it’s Stata not STATA.
3. On page 8, lines 37-44 – the description of how the sample was “trimmed” could do with
being reworded as it is confusing (and shouldn’t it be less than the 0.5% percentile? As
everything between 0.5 up to 99.5% is above the 0.5 percentile). It would also help if the exact
number dropped from the analysis on the basis of these decisions was stated explicitly (I could
calculate it from the figure captions).

4. You present a follow-up range for CHD but not breast cancer (page 10, line 6-9) – and by
average, are you referring to the mean or median?
5. Page 13, line 40 – it would help if you explicitly stated “change of -1 to <1 drinks per week”.
6. In the “What this study adds” box, I would consider toning down the statement that alcohol is
“causally associated” with breast cancer and coronary heart disease.
Thank you again for the opportunity to review this manuscript, I hope that my comments have
been constructive and will help to enhance the manuscript.
