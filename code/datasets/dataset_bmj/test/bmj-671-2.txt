This 24-week RCT examined the effect of adding liraglutide on top of basal bolus insulin therapy in
patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control. The results of this study suggest a new
treatment option when the most intensive form of insulin therapy fails. Nonetheless, I have some
comments on this paper.
Major comments
Long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists tend to increase the heart rate. Were there any changes in heart
rates with liraglutide?
Total daily meal and basal insulin doses were significantly reduced with liraglutide treatment. Please
provide the data separately by basal or meal insulin doses.
Page 15, 2nd paragraph: What would be the role of the glucagonostatic effect of GLP-1 in T2D patients
with severely compromised beta cell function? Plus, what if liraglutide were used in T1D patients with
MDI or CSI?
If possible, it would be worthwhile to comment on the cost effectiveness of adding liraglutide in this
clinical context.
Two relevant studies (Lane W, Weinrib S, Rappaport J, Hale C. Diabetes Obes Metab. 2014
Sep;16(9):827-32 and Eng C, Kramer CK, Zinman B, Retnakaran R. Lancet. 2014 Dec
20;384(9961):2228-34) seem to be missing and need to be discussed in the manuscript.
Minor comments
“Total insulin doses” need to be replaced with “total daily insulin doses” throughout the manuscript.
Product information including manufacturer, city, and country for the CGM should be described.
What time of the day was the liraglutide injected?
