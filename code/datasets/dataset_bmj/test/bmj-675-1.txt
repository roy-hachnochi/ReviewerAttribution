The authors are treading a well-worn path having developed numerous risk scores from the QRESEARCH database.
Risk scores for blindness and lower limb amputation have been developed , internally validated and externally
validated on very large datasets.
The methodology is strong and the authors adhering to recommended practices in developing and validating risk
scores. The authors have also carefeully followed the TRIPOD reporting guidelines for prediction models.
My comments are minor.
Abstract. Make it clear that the patients come from the UK.
Page 9/Page 10: Multiple imputation. Some more information would be useful, whether in the main paper or in
supplementary material, that includes what variables were included, any transformations etc.
Page 10. Confirm that the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve has been calculated for survival
data (and not for binary outcomes).
Page 10. Why are thresholds of 10% and 20% chosen? Is this for illustrative purposes only? If these are thresholds
recommended by the authors then some rationale would be needed. Alternatively, the authors could produce net
benefit curves (decision curve analysis, Vickers et al 2006; Med Decis Making) to examine this.
Page 11. Whilst missing data is mentioned for particular variables, how many of the cohort had complete data (or
conversely how many had at least 1 missing variable) in the development cohort.
Page 12. Whilst missing data is mentioned for particular variables, how many of the cohort had complete data (or
conversely how many had at least 1 missing variable) in the validation cohort.
Page 12. Whilst the authors mention the availability of the risk score at the start of the manuscript. It would also
seem a natural place to discuss this in the Results section, preferably with a brief explanation as to why the model is
not published in the paper. I know the reasons as to why this is the case, but the average reader wonâ€™t. The authors
are one of the few teams I am aware that actively maintain and update their models on an annual basis, and this
should be highlighted as it is a particular strength of these models/group.
