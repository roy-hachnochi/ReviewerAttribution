Review: Benzodiazepine use and risk of incident dementia or cognitive decline
To the authors
As mentioned in my first review of this article: (i) the present study focuses on the relationship between
benzodiazepine use and the risk of dementia and benefits from well-documented data for both dementia
diagnosis and benzodiazepine exposure as well as from a long follow-up (ii) even if the topic is not novel,
the study provides quite interesting findings, an extensive and well-balanced discussion and opens up
new perspectives about the nature of the relationship found by previous studies.
The manuscript has been significantly altered and the methodology used by the authors appears more
clearly described. Nevertheless, some methodological options remain questionable and should be justified
or at least discussed since they might have led to underestimating the association:
First, as mentioned in my previous review, the exposure definition used was not optimal for capturing
true “long term users” since the highest exposure category, i.e. 121 TSDDs and over, could include a
significant part of short-term users or, at least, of “regular” short-term users. Indeed 121 TSDDs
corresponds to a cumulative exposed time of about 4 months over a 10-year time window; a rather short
density of exposure. Moreover, these 4 months could be made of several exposure periods of some
weeks, individual or cumulative exposures being too short to be considered as putatively at risk. Even if
the statistical power was limited, it would have been interesting to quantify the strength of the
association for subjects exposed during at least, let’s say, 365 TSDDs.
Second, an immortal time bias and/or depletion of susceptible bias may also account for a significant,
although not measurable, part of the results and are still insufficiently discussed.
Taking these points into account is probably easy for the authors and seems of major importance since
this well-conducted study concludes in the absence of any association between chronic use of
benzodiazepines and dementia (the 30% increase in risk being explained by short-term users only), and
therefore has the great interest of challenging the conclusions of most of the studies conducted so far on
the topic. Considering its potential impact on public health, the appropriateness of the message delivered
to prescribers is crucial. For example, concluding, in contradiction with current international
recommendations, that no excess risk is to be feared for long-term treatments would require checking
the above-mentioned points and/or a more balanced statement even if the authors have mitigated their
previous conclusion in that sense.
The remaining points are detailed below:
MAIN COMMENTS
1. The study design has been clarified but some methodological options remain to be discussed in order
to avoid putative misinterpretations:
- Figure 2 suggests that the starting point for measuring exposure was defined from the date of outcome
(i.e. beginning 11 years before the event and ending one year before). In the Result Section, page 10
lines 30 to 32, the authors state that, “table 2 provides participants characteristics by cumulative
exposure in the 10 years prior to study entry”. These two definitions seem to be contradictory. The 10year window considered (start and ending date) should be clarified since a time-window exposure
starting from the date of the outcome would a priori make reference to a retrospective design (e.g. a
case-control study) while the study is presented as a cohort follow-up and the statistical model used for
analyses is typical of a prospective design. This apparent contradiction could ensue from my
misinterpretation of the protocol used by the authors. However, in both events, a clearer definition
should be provided.
- In the event exposure was measured for individuals with and without the outcome, the period used for
measuring exposure is not described for individuals without dementia. Were these persons censored by
death, or when leaving the Group Health insurance system, or 10 years after inclusion? In the present
form of the manuscript, it is hard to state that the period used for measuring exposure was not longer for
individuals without dementia than for persons with dementia.
- The T0 date considered for the survival analysis is not mentioned (inclusion date?, start of exposure?).
2. Possible immortal and depletion of susceptible biases.
2.1 I still believe that observing exposure in the 5-10 years preceding inclusion (for a non-mentioned
part of individuals), and only in individuals free of dementia at inclusion in ATC, was too conservative and
could convey a sort of immortal time bias. This bias (e.g. selection of individuals with a higher resistance
to side effects of benzodiazepines since individuals diagnosed with dementia before inclusion were
excluded) could, at least in part, explain the results observed in “long-term” users.

2.2 A depletion of susceptible bias could also be possible if benzodiazepines were withdrawn before
inclusion in patients who were the most sensitive to their side effects; short-term users and non-users
categories may have included a significant part of these individuals.
The “prevalent user design” made these biases more likely since one can assume that a significant
proportion of users started their treatment before the T0 of the observation period. I do appreciate the
paragraph about the “new user design” added in the discussion in reply to my previous suggestion and I
fully agree with the authors. Nevertheless, the possibility for an immortal time and/or depletion of
susceptible bias remains and should be discussed further. In that sense, the conclusion of the abstract
(page 3) and the general discussion (page 17, see comment 5) should be toned down.
3. Definition of chronic users still does not seem optimal. I maintain the comment from my previous
review as this point could potentially explain the absence of association found in the group defined as
“chronic users”. I am aware of the limitations of the database used when intending to perform
sophisticated analyses but I still believe that the cut-off chosen to define exposure might not capture or
focus on exposure profiles suspected to be at risk of developing a dementia. Indeed, the cut-off chosen
by the authors to define chronic use (i.e. >120 TSDD cumulative use during the 10-year observation
period) is too low and likely to mix chronic users (supposed to be at risk) and sporadic users (not
supposed to be at risk). This cut-off was adequately chosen by Olfson et al.1 in their recent study to
define chronic use but it was within a one-year and not a 10-year observation period. Keeping the same
threshold for a 10-year period is questionable since >120 TSDDs may also correspond to sporadic uses.
For example, an above suspicion use of 2 weeks per year during 10 years would exceed this threshold.
4. About time measurement of confounders. By definition, confounders should be ideally measured at or
before the start of exposure in order to rightly balance the probability of exposure between the groups
compared. This rule is not always followed, particularly when the follow-up includes prevalent users. In
the present case, measuring most of putative confounders at study entry seems not appropriate since
exposure can start 10 years before this date. De facto, the measurement should be made earlier, ideally
at the start of exposure. I am aware that it could not be feasible but this point should at least be evoked
in the discussion since it may have influenced the validity of the conclusions.
5. Points related to the discussion section:
- Not considering anxiety and insomnia should at least be discussed as it may have an influence on the
results. Again, these symptoms are highly correlated to both exposure and dementia (prodromes and/or
risk factors of the disease).
- As mentioned above, the possibility of an immortal time or depletion of susceptible bias should be at
least evoked in the discussion section.
- In conclusion I think that the final sentence line 11 to 16 “Although benzodiazepines have been
associated with many adverse health outcomes in older adults, our findings suggest that increased
dementia risk may not be one of them” should be toned down regarding remaining limitations precluding
clear-cut conclusions and the observational nature of the design.
