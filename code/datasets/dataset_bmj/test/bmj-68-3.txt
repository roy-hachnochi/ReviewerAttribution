The paper is an analysis of the ethics of reallocating ventilators in the COVID-19 pandemic directed to
UK and US audiences.
The topic is relevant to a general readership though the focus on reallocation is of more specialist
interest. The paper is well written and generally easy to follow and the attention given to vulnerable
groups and emotional aspects is a strength.
General comments
1) Timing. The paper states the US and the UK face stockpile shortfalls of ventilators. Whilst this threat
looked real 1 month, or even 2 weeks ago, in the UK, due to recent expansion, there is actually likely to
be a significant stockpile surplus creating resource allocation difficulties of its own kind. The COVID-19
situation is highly fast moving and this development makes the analysis read as already quite dated.
2) Clarity. The title of the paper is reallocation and on p 4 restricts to re-allocation in non-COVID-19
cases. But it references both acute illness and chronic disability non-COVID-19 cases. Elsewhere in the
paper allocation in general, or withholding, is referred to. Is the focus just withdrawal, just withdrawal in
non-COVID or just withdrawal in non-COVID with certain kinds of clinical or vulnerability features? I
wasn’t always clear what the focus of the analysis was.
3) Relevance. There are quite a few ethical analysis of ITU decision making in the literature (including
for this recent pandemic), e.g. the BMA paper. What seems most relevant now are detailed guidelines
which combine defensible prognostic and ethical variables into something practicable and broadly
endorsed. The paper gives ethical analysis only without reference to prognostic variables. There are no
detailed guidelines.
Specific comments
1) p3, second paragraph. The text states that the consequentialist principle to ‘maximise the number of
patients that survive treatment with reasonable life expectancy’ can conflict with the duty to care. It’s
not clear to me why that conflict should ever arise as the duty to care is supraordinate to the triage
principle to steward ventilators and is compatible with it. For example medical care, palliative care, etc.
for patients not ventilated remains care and there is a duty to provide it.
2) p 4/5. The text suggests that broadly endorsed allocation frameworks make no assumptions about
post treatment quality of life and that quality of life is a poor guide to resource allocation. But this is
missing the fact that most frameworks build in advance decisions which do relate to quality of life as
defined by the patient themselves. Also many broadly endorsed frameworks build in ‘lifecycle’
considerations.
3) p 6. The point about some triage protocols excluding severe cognitive disabilities is well made though
there needs to be engagement with the fact that many of these protocols are quite broadly endorsed
and that debate is likely to occur here.
4) p 6/7. There is a tension between objective prognostication, impersonal triage and individualised
assessment, patient advocacy. It wasn’t clear to me how this tension was going to be practically
managed/balanced in the triage recommendations made.
5) p 7 line 22 – the text states that “reallocation of ventilators from long-term care facilities might result
in more lives saved, but such actions “[conflict’ with the societal norm of defending vulnerable
individuals and communities””. On its face this sentence contradicts the statement made on p4, line 112
“the ethical duty to steward scarce resources requires heath care systems to adopt allocation
frameworks that maximise the number of patients who survive treatment.”. Perhaps the emotions of
reallocation versus allocation is what matters but this is not clarified.
