Comments from Peter Nordström
In general I would say that the authors have done a good job in responding to my comments and
questions, and I feel that the manuscript has improved. I have a few new comments in response to the

changes made.
I’m not sure about the authors’ intention concerning the supplemental Tables and what I believe is a
supplemental Figure. These are not referenced to in the Results, the supplemental Tables are marked
“Tables” and some of the Figures are not marked at all.
For me supplemental Table 1A-L could be removed since most of the information of interest is presented in
supplemental table 1M, and also graphically in what I believe is supplemental Figure 1. Please ad also LOS
1-5, that probably is the reference, for the supplemental Tables.
In a sensitivity analysis presented in the statistics section the authors suggest that: “To control for a
greater proportion of early discharges in New York State patients, a sensitivity analysis was performed by
evaluating the odds of mortality between 15 and 45 days after hospital admission in all patients alive at 14
days post-admission, which created a theoretical LOS of 14 days for all patients in the cohort…”
I do not understand this, and I could be wrong. We clearly have two different systems in the USA and in
Sweden. In USA 90% of all patients are discharged to rehabilitations centres with a much shorter LOS in
hospital than in Sweden. From the Table I can see that 82.1% of the patients have a LOS of less than 11
days. For me that means that most of the patients with a longer LOS have complications or are generally
frail with more comorbid conditions (as also evident from Table 1). This is important, because in our
Swedish cohort the number of comorbid conditions did not clearly increase with longer LOS, and dementia
clearly decreased. So in a model where those that die before a LOS of 14 days are removed, but those with
longer LOS (e.g. 11-14 days) due to complications or more comorbidities will still be at higher risk of death
after 14 days. Also, in general the risk of death is highest the first days after surgery. Thus, I do not
understand how this analysis could adjust for the different systems, and that healthier patients are
discharged early in the USA. In my mind this analysis will control for the generally increased risk of death
early after surgery. I suggest that you remove the text “To control for a greater proportion of early
discharges in New York State patients”, or remove this sensitivity analysis if there is no other purpose.
In the BMJ paper we could not analyse whether the discharge location influenced the risk of death. The
authors have also commented this. However, in a recent published study in JAMDA, in a similar material,
we did also have that information available. I encourage the authors to study the paper.
What is most important/interesting with this article is if we could learn from the different systems to
increase our knowledge concerning how hip fractures patients should be optimally cared for in the period
after the fracture. This question is of increasing importance with an increasing number of elderly and tight
economic situations in many countries. To give some examples from Table 1 it is clear that a significant
portion of the patients is given “non-surgical” treatment. In Sweden basically all patients are surgically
treated, since we know that death is much higher in those not surgically treated. As of now the second
paragraph in the Discussion is discussing the fact that we did no subgroup analysis of those not surgically
treated. This simply relates to the fact that there were basically no such patients. This is no criticism
towards the current manuscript given that the actual number of patients not operated in Sweden is not
easily found in published papers. Furthermore, in Sweden there are guidelines stating that all patients
should be operated within 24 hours (and almost all are), while in this material the mean time to surgery is
1.8 days. In the analyses performed both non-surgical treatment and longer time to surgery was also
associated with higher risk of death. It is also of interest that the 30 day post-discharge mortality was only
5.1%, whereas 3.9% died in hospital. This should be compared to our 30 day post-discharge mortality that
was 5.8%, whereas 5.0% died in hospital. In summary I feel that the Discussion is well balanced but the
different systems compared to in Sweden could perhaps be further emphasized in an Editorial with a more
in-depth evaluation of the differences, and perhaps especially how optimal care after a hip fracture should
be organized.
Please emphasize throughout the manuscript that you have analysed 30 day post-discharge mortality.
