This study reports on a likely case of nosocomial transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9), whereby no
indication of a common avian source has been detected. This is a novel finding, and a reminder to remain
aware of the potential of H2H spread, even if rare at present. Whether this single report signals an
'alarming increased transmission capability', as suggested in line 14 of the introduction, remains to be
confirmed and seems a bit overstated at present.
In essence, this article is a case report of two patients, therefore I do not understand that the authors state
under 'patient involvement' that no patients were involved. Indeed, the authors need to be able to declare
that the relatives of the two patients have agreed to publication.
Furthermore, this case report is rather long and detailed. The main findings and conclusions could be
reported in a more concise way, with many of the details included in a webappendix.
It remains unclear why environmental samples were collected from the homes of the patients, but not from
any of the hospital rooms. Only in the discussion of weaknesses of the study it is mentioned that sampling
of the shared hospital room was not done, without an explanation why not. This needs to be included in the
methods.
Only in the discussion, mention is made about the limited value of serology. If the authors want to include
serology, its use and limitations in particular in a small study need to be discussed more clearly earlier in
the paper (methods), and should not be included in the abstract as a relevant finding.
While further evidence of transmission of avian A/H7 from birds to humans might support closing of live
bird markets to stop transmission, and potentially even a more active screening policy, such
recommendations might be a bit premature based on this single case report. A more obvious although less
groundbreaking implication seems to be that hospital hygiene could be strenthened to reduce the risk of
nosocomial (airborne) infections.
Minor comments: in Figure 1, it needs to be indicated when pt 1 was started on oseltamivir. There are still
a few typo's to be corrected.
