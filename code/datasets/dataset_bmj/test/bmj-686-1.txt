The authors have done an excellent job in revising what was already a good manuscript. I have 2
comments. (1) Could the authors mention they have reported according to TRIPOD (and cite) in the
manuscript, they completed the checklist. (2) The calibration plots, the authors have added a lowess
smoother (at my request), but I'm suspicious as to whether this has been implemented correctly. The
sample size isn't huge, yet the line goes exactly (or appears to) through all points. I wouldn't expect this,
unless the author have fit a smoother to the 10 points - which is incorrect, as it should be on the individual
patients predictions/outcome.
