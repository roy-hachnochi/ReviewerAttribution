Thank you for the opportunity to review this Christmas BMJ edition paper analysing 3 different statistical
theories about 'the curse of the rainbow jersey' and why many cyclists are perceived to perform at a lower
level after a championship race winning season. This analysis of some stories of misfortune (& better
fortune) have been popularised in a book of the same name.
The paper is well written and easy to read and offers performance analysis insight for 48 years of elite level
cycling. It is a fun analysis of performance using different statistical methods to dispel a myth. The final
comments are well written, fun and very appropriate for a Christmas BMJ edition.
The introduction starts well and takes the reader through the perceived popularist notion amongst cycling
that there exists a 'curse of the rainbow jersey'. The introduction is critical to set the scene and in my
opinion could do with some more work. For example, I am not sure that Tom Simpson is the best story to
include because his post mortem found a diuretic mix of alcohol and several amphetamines, which were
used in a race in heat and whilst he was reported to have had a stomach complaint. Some may argue this
was not a curse but ill judged or ill advised, as are many of the 'cursed' rainbow jersey stories, some which
reflect bad luck, sports psychology issues and injuries both self inflicted and less fortunate.
Perhaps the main issue readers will question relate to doping and whether it is possible in cycling to
compare riders, many of whom have been tainted with anti-doping violations. I recall reading this article in
the 2013 New York Times spanning 15 years in question relating to the Tour de France and it appears that
most of the riders were performing well because of doping. Having read this submitted article several
times, I feel that this limitation should be clearer from the outset, as there be other theories, such that
doping has played as role in dips after championship seasons and fear of being 'found out' aligned with
lucrative sponsorship that comes with being a world champion. Perhaps if performance regresses to the
mean after success then anti-doping is effective? Who knows?!

Is there a method to cope with doping concerns the reader may have? Should riders such as Simpson,
Brochard and Armstrong all be excluded from the data analysis?

For this paper to really work, I think statistical analysis should seek to address this major issue or the
paper should allay reader fears of this confounder being addressed more clearly in the introduction. Antidoping has evolved through the period in question and seems to have become very sophisticated, such that
some believe it is possible to still dope and not get caught.
The hypotheses are sound and fit the paper and analyses well. The methods are clear and well presented.
The comments are fun and a brief clear discussion relating to 'curses'.

I must add to these comments that I am not a statistical expert such that the methods used in this paper
are ones with which I am completely familiar. Peer review on this aspect needs to be covered by additional
reviewers. I was not fully aware of this on accepting the offer to review this paper and apologise if this
adversely affects the quality of my review.
