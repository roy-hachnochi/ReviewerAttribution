Estimated population-wide benefits and risks in China of lowering sodium through
potassium-enriched salt substitution.

Marklund et al
This is a well written paper with potentially important policy messages.
However, it is likely to be carefully scrutinised by industry opponents, and therefore needs
to be made as solid as possible. That includes pre-emptively acknowledging realities about
precision, and about the limits of CRA modelling methodology, as detailed below.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
line 22:
Better to say “we estimated” rather than “we found” (it was not an empirical study)
Results section in the ABSTRACT and in the paper currently state:
“Nationwide implementation of potassium-enriched salt substitution would prevent
an estimated 460,693 (95% uncertainty interval: 196,339 to 704,438) CVD deaths/year….”
That estimate could be made much more solid and bullet-proof if rephrased as
“460,000 (95% uncertainty interval: 196,339 to 704,438) CVD deaths/year….”
Quoting the more detailed 460,693 signals a precision which is spurious; whereas rounding
to the nearest thousand (460,693) more realistically acknowledges the wide 95% UIs.
Likewise, it would be sensible to add “approximately” or synonyms to each of the key
results estimates:
“Nationwide implementation of potassium-enriched salt substitution COULD prevent
APPROXIMATELY 460,000 (95% uncertainty interval: 196,339 to 704,438) CVD
deaths/year, corresponding to SOME 11% (4.7% to 16.8%) of annual CVD deaths in
China; APPROXIMATELY 743,000 (305,803 to 1,273,098) nonfatal CVD events/year; and
SOME 8 (3.3 to 12.9) million CVD-related
DALYs/year. The intervention could potentially produce an estimated 10,000 (6,422 to
16,562) additional hyperkalemia-related deaths in individuals with CKD. The net effect
would be APPROXIMATELY 449,000 (183,699 to 697,084) fewer CVD deaths/year in the
overall population, and SOME 21,000 (1,928 to 42,926) fewer CVD deaths/year in the CKD
population.”
The same comment applies to the Results section in the main paper.
INTRODUCTION
Generally good.
METHODS
The dependence on the (imperfect) GBD estimates is acknowledged in the Limitations para
of the Discussion.
Page 8, line 161
“In the primary model, we anticipated that the dose-response relationship observed in CKD
stage…”
Probably better to say
“In the primary model, we ASSUMED that the dose-response relationship observed in CKD
stage…”
Indeed, the modelling is dependent on multiple assumptions, which means that the
uncertainty increases in a multiplicative fashion.
This is acknowledged later.
Page 11, line 263

I like the "hypothetical extreme scenario". That is a key strength of a good modelling
approach.
RESULTS
Please see comments above regarding the need to liberally use the word “approximately”
DISCUSSION
page 13, line 339 onwards.
These are modelling based estimates, not empirical measurements.
The first sentence might therefore better say “COULD prevent around 460,000 CVD
deaths…”,
rather than “would”.
Line 341: ditto
Page 14, line 357-361.
The “J-shape“ fallacy basically comes from one single research group, amplified by industry
supporters
The rebuttal might therefore use clearer language, along the lines of:
“We also recognize that A FEW observational studies have SUGGESTED J-shaped
associations of sodium intake with CVD.[26] HOWEVER, such relationships are due to
measurement errors in sodium intake estimation.[27] FURTHERMORE, EVEN IF THEY
WERE TRUE, SUCH STUDIES WOULD NOT BE relevant to China where mean sodium intake
is much higher than any putative nadir of risk.”
Page 15, line 377. This could reference a salt reformulation policy success, such as in the
UK:
He FJ, Pombo-Rodrigues S, MacGregor GA. Salt reduction in England from 2003 to 2011:
its relationship to blood pressure, stroke and ischaemic heart disease mortality. BMJ Open
2014;4:e004549.

Page 16, lines 421-428.
This paragraph appears tangential to the main thrust, and could be deleted if the
wordcount needs to be reduced.
Page 16, line 429 onwards.
The limitations paragraph is mostly OK.
However, as discussed earlier, it will be important to pre-empt anticipated attacks from
industry critics. It might therefore be wise to add a couple more sentences to acknowledge
that CRA modelling has a number of recognised limitations, and list them.
Nil else.
