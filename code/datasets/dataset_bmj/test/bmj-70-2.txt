The authors describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Nembro, Italy, using the
all-cause mortality over time. The manuscript is well written and provides very helpful
insight into not only the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in a small community, but also the
possibility of under-estimation in death toll of the disease. However, there are some
aspects of the manuscript that could be made clearer and I hope this suggestion make this
manuscript to have the highest impact.
[Major comments]
1. I totally agree with the authors that the total impact of COVID-19 can be
under-estimated, if we use only COVID-19 related mortality for quantifying the impact of
the outbreak. However, as the authors mentioned, mortality not related with COVID-19 can
be dramatically increased in this emergency situation due to the shortage of capacity and
massive patient influx in hospitals, especially in a community with small medical capacity.
Thus, quantifying the impact of COVID-19, using all-cause mortality can be biased depends
on the medical capacity in each region. I would be inclined to mention this issue in the
Conclusion part.
[Minor comments]
1. I suggest authors use the same case for coronavirus disease in the manuscript (i.e.,
Covid-19, COVID-19).
2. P7L41: Does the number of COVID-19 related deaths published on Nembro mayor’s
office website match with that in the dataset provided by ISTAT? Is there any discrepancy?
In addition, since four data were descripted in Method part, naïve readers might be little
confused. It would be great if authors can clearly distinguish used data by analysis.
3. P12L27: I would inclined that author can provide what kind of similar results were shown
in the report. In addition, this paragraph can be united with previous paragraph.
