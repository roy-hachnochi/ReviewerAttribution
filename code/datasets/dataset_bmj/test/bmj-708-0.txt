The response to my comments is generally well detailed. There are still a few areas for concern, in a generally well
written and clear paper.
1) I still feel the adjustment factors are quite few. For example, for breast cancer there are only about 6 adjustment
factors in the main analyses. Therefore residual confounding is a big concern. But also confusingly, the breast cancer
analyses do not adjust for smoking until the sensitivity analyses and yet the CVD analyses do. This seems entirely
unjustified, as the methods says that all known risk factors were included as adjustment factors. Am I missing
something? Surely this is a serious omission in the main analyses and it does not make sense to include additional
confounders only in the sensitivity analysis. Why not include all potential confounders in the main analysis? This needs
to be clarified. Also, perhaps I missed it, but where are the breast cancer results when smoking is included? I donâ€™t
think these are presented.
2) Why was education imputed using simple imputation and not multiple imputation itself? I do not understand the
rationale for this, unless it is obvious based on the age what the missing education would be? Please clarify.
3) Under the tables and in the results, can the authors clarify that when they looked at linear and non-linear (U)
shaped trends, that they did this using the actual difference in alcohol intake, and not based on the categorical
classification?
4) Table 3 heading says HRs are presented, but that is not true for the first set of rows
5) I do not see a discussion on potential for residual confounding in the abstract or discussion. Again, this is a crucial
omission given the limited number of confounders.
