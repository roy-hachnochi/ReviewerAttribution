This is an interesting topic and policy relevant for population health promotion. However, many major
concerns should be addressed. First, Intervention costs and effectiveness of interventions are
questionable. Obviously, one framework of planning-development-partial implementation-full
implementation should not work for all the countries. If the full-implementation stage begins in year 6,
the intervention effects should likely start thereafter. This nature on sodium reduction and
hypertension/CVD should be considered in the model. How can the intervention costs and effects on
sodium intake in each country aggregated into country groups by income level and/or geographic
regions? This is highly problematic. Secondly, it was not clear why the 10-year period is chosen for the
analysis. What will be the cost-effectiveness results if using 5-year or 15-year as the time horizon?
Because Sodium intake affects hypertension immediately and CVD in longer run, are these facts
considered in the model? Third, again coming back to area variations, because the current sodium
intake levels as well as hypertension/CVD prevalence levels differ across countries and regions, the
effectiveness of intervention on sodium intake as well as on hypertension/CVD prevalence should differ.
I don't believe the model can handle these issues well. For example, in high sodium intake countries
with high prevalence of hypertension/CVD, a 10% reduction in sodium intake may be highly clinically
effective. In such regions, 15% sodium reduction may be a reasonable or feasible target. Could the
model use different sodium reduction targets for the analysis? Finally, two minor issues: Why don't use
U.S. $ directly. Few people understand the international $. And what is standardized population?
