This article is very clear, detailed, and discussing very important subjects. The sample size is sufficient to answer to
sub-questions that are discussed. The lenght of follow-up is reasonnable.
I have some concerns about the method and the answer to one question.
-the method : the question that emerges immediately is "if some subjects are carrying known risks of CV events, GP
will prescribe them the most secure drug, that will appear as the most associated with events, because of these
prescription biases". The answer provided could be bettered : only adjusting on some covariables will not provide the
good correction about precription biases : it would be probably better to use propensity scores for prescription of each
drug, in association with risk factors for CHD, stroke and sudden death.
-the question : atrial fibrillation is rarely a cause of sudden death, and is due tu ectopic pace makers. Torsades de
pointes (TdP) are very frequently inducing sudden death and are linked to an excessive QT length : so I am not sure
wether the observation of new atrial fibrillation (which is very interesting per se) could predict TdP and sudden death.
Regarding this outcome, the propensity score associated with prescription of each drug could include other factors
linked to QT length : basal QT, hypokaliemia and hypokaliemiant drugs, history of familial sudden deaths.
If this is impossible, conclusion should be changed regarding the reproaches done to Citalopram which are not ruled
out by this study as written.
However, if those remarks could be taken into account by modifying analyses or conclusion as proposed, the study
appears of great interest.
