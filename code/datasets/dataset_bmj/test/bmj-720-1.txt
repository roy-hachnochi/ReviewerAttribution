This paper presents a cohort study about the relationship of the use of antidepressants (AD) with aryhtmia, myocardial
infarction, and stroke/TIA among 238 963 patients with a first depression. The study fine-tunes earlier publications on
this topic, focussing on young adults only (20-64), individual drugs, and dose and duration of use. The study is based
on a very large database and it is written well. Yet, the paper suffers from a lack of focus, the subsequent great
number of results, and a number of methodological limitations. I explain in more detail below.
Major limitations
In the introduction the authors present a number of interesting research questions. Instead of choosing one and
working it out well, the authors set out to test all. For instance, the authors might have hypothesized why there is a
significant association between SSRIs and stroke in elderly but not in younger adults (Shin 2014). Is it not weird that
SSRIs are generally known to induce bleeding disorders, but apparently increase the risk of hemorrhagic AND ischemic
stroke? Was history of stroke accounted for in all included studies? Were the age groups similar in case-control and
cohort studies? Likewise, the authors refer to a number of observational studies reporting discrepant findings about
the association between AD and arrhythmias, but again they do not give a potential interesting and testable
explanation for these discrepancies. The authors do not explain either why they might want to test the association
between AD and myocardial infarction. As a result it remains unclear what the clinical and scientific relevance of this
study is.
The general design and analytic approach are customary for this type of pharmaco-epidemiological studies. However,
the authors used the same confounding factors for all three outcomes, even though it is unlikely that they are the
same. Moreover, their definition of a confounding factor (i.e. affects the risk of the exposure OR outcome) is not in line
with that in the literature (i.e affects exposure AND outcome) (Hernan 2002). Consequently, they list a long list of
potential confounders. Over-adjusting might lead to bias just like under-adjustment.
The exclusion of patients with a history of arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and stroke/TIA seems an omission
because the results of the study are not generalizable to these patients. Yet, physicians will be extra keen on
information about cardiovascular risk of AD in these patients (much less in young patients without such a history).
The authors thoroughly discuss residual confounding and information bias. What is not mentioned is that many strokes
and myocardial infarction (esp. in women) go unnoticed. Could silent stroke and MI prior to depression have
confounded the results? Could stroke and MI have been missed during follow-up and decreased the power of the
study? In addition, selection bias needs to be discussed. It is possible that the study outcomes have been missed in
patients that died even though death certificates were used.
Minor limitations/ questions
The standard comparison group is not described. What is it when non-users were excluded?
Why were the monoamine oxidase inhibitors not included in the group ‘other AD’?
Were the proportional hazard assumptions confirmed?
Could selective preference explain the fluoxetine findings as well? Is it not prescribed to the very fit/ young
specifically?
I do not understand the suggestion to test the cardio-preventive effect of fluoxetine in a trial. A large population at
risk of cardiovascular disease and with depression would need to be included. Fluoxetine is generally avoided in elderly
patients due to its long half time.
The abstract and text seem too long, and the number of tables and figures seems too large for a BMJ article (not

taking supplementary content into account).
There are some textual mistakes.
