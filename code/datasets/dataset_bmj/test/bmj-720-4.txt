This is a very well written and organized paper by Coupland et al. that examined the association between different
antidepressant prescriptions and 3 cardiovascular outomes within a large UK primary care database. The principal
finding is that there there is no overall significant association between different antidepressant classes and the onset
of MI, stroke or TIA, or arrhythmia.
There are a number of strengths:
1. Clinically relevant question. The regulatory warnings had a clear effect on comfort level in prescribing
antidepressants in general and at particular dosages, therefore the findings have clinical application.
2. Very large dataset
3. The authors have tried to address the main limitations to the data (e.g. validity of primary outcomes.
4. Excellent analytic plan.

Main issues:
1. The precision of the key aims. The mechanism by which antidepressants may raise the risk of arrhythmias is very
different than the mechanism that may impact rates of stroke, TIAs and MIs. Furthermore, the time frame for the
effect is vastly different. The impact on arrhythmia being much shorter than the others. Lumping them together
without adequate consideration of these issues is problematic.
2. The paper focuses on differences between antidepressants, yet the primary analyses use comparisons with periods
of no antidepressant treatment. This complicates the interpretation of results, since there are many additional factors
that influence prescribing of any antidepressant and which could impact the primary outcomes. The authors are
encouraged to clarify why they did not select on antidepressant or class as the reference, and then compare others to
this reference. This would have decreased the potential bias.
3. The results are important and meaningful, but are ultimately more confirmatory than new.
Minor issues:
4. It is unclear why the authors selected to only focus on patients with depression. Couldn't the results have included
all antidepressant prescriptions? A sensitivity analysis could then examine whether there are unique results for the
depression group. The explanation on page 12 that "....depression itself is an established risk factor for cardiovascular
outcomes..." is unconvincing, since this same statement could be made for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.
5. Related to this, it is unclear why the authors selected cohort from patients with a first recorded diagnosis of
depression.
6. A rationale for the duration of follow-up should be provided.
7. A rationale for the age restriction of 25-64 should be provided.
8. Page 6: the wording regarding ages 20-64 is unclear. Is this current age or age at time of first diagnosis of
depression?
