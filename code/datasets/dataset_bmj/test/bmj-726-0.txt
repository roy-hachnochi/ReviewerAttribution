BMJ review
Manuscript ID BMJ.2015.029745 entitled "Whole grain consumption and the risk of cardiovascular disease,
cancer, and all-cause mortality – a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies"
Thank you for the opportunity to review this very relevant meta-analysis on whole grains and risk/mortality of
several chronic diseases. I believe that the overall aim of the study is highly relevant, and that BMJ is a very
suitable journal for publishing such a paper on a topic which could have a very broad public health impact.
I have the following major and minor comments for the authors to consider.
Major:
Overall, the methodological quality of the study is very high, and the PRISMA checklist is followed in a systematic
way. However, the presentation of the results is a bit unstructured and the inclusion criteria (which diseases
under study, incidence or mortality) and overall aim is not completely clear.
1. Endpoints
- Abstract: In the “study selection” part it is stated that prospective studies of whole grains in relation to
cardiovascular disease, total cancer and all-cause mortality are included. In the “results” part, there is reported
on cardiovascular disease, total cancer, all-cause mortality AND respiratory diseases, infectious diseases and
diabetes. Why this discrepancy?
- It is, thought out the manuscript, not clear when RISK (incidence) and MORTALITY is investigated. This needs to
be very clearly stated, also in the presented Figures.
- In the flow chart, it would be very helpful if an extra level in the bottom could be added with information about
how many studies (and publications) are available for each disease endpoint, and whether the endpoint is
incidence or mortality.
2. Whole-grain assessment
- Whole-grain intake is given as whole-grain products rather than as g/day. It is recommended to use g/day
because this eases comparability between studies. It might be that it is not possible to calculate the intake in
g/day in this meta-analysis since many of the study simply state the intake in whole-grain products/day. It is,
however, important that this is mentioned and discussed. See this reference for more information: Ross, A. B., et
al. (2015). "Recommendations for reporting whole-grain intake in observational and intervention studies." Am J
Clin Nutr. 2015 May;101(5):903-7.
- 7-7.5 servings is set to the recommended level. It is not clear how and why this cut-off is chosen?
- In Scandinavia, the recommended level is 75 g/dag, which roughly is equal up to 250 g whole-grain products.
In the Scandinavian EPIC cohorts, where the whole-grain intake is among this highest in observational studies,
only participants in the highest quartile comply with this recommendation. (ref. Kyro, C., et al. (2012). "Intake of
whole grain in Scandinavia: intake, sources and compliance with new national recommendations." Scand.J.Public
Health 40(1): 76-84.). In other cohort studies, very few comply with the recommendation. Thus, it can be
relevant to discuss whether it is from both a statistical and a public health viewpoint relevant to calculate the
“population attributable risk (PAR)” based on this recommendation. It may be relevant to calculate what impact it
will have if people just consumed half of the recommended level. PAR could be shown for both 7 servings per day
and for 3,5 servings per day.
- It is assumed that the proportion of brown rice is 25% of total rice consumed. Even though a reference is added
on this, it is not completely clear how the authors came to the conclusion that 25% of the rice consumption must
be brown rice?
Minor:
- In the results section, it is mentioned that the strongest reduction is observed in at lower whole-grain intakes.
Is this due to statistical power, since the majority of the participants in observational studies are in this range? Or
do you believe that it has a biological plausible explanation? If the latter is this case, this can be mentioned more
in the discussion. From a public health point of view it would then have a great impact, if especially people with a
very low whole-grain intake increased their intake. This group might especially be a difficult group to reach with

nutritional campaigns etc.
- Page 10, bottom. “and checked by (DCG) for accuracy”. Who is DCG? Is it the co-author Darren Greenwood? It
is not completely clear from the abbreviation.
I would be happy to review the revised manuscript.
