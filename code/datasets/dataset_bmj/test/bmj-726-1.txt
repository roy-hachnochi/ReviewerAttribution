This is an excellent and comprehensive meta-analysis of whole grain intake and risk of CVD, cancer, and all-cause
mortality. I have the following minor comments.
1. How comparable of the serving sizes across studies? The authors used 3 servings per day of whole grain intake
(about median across studies) as the basis for their main results. As a reader, it is hard to link 3 servings/d to
actual amounts of, for example, bread or bowl of breakfast cereal. Please make this serving size more
understandable in the abstract.
2. The premature death estimates were based on if whole grain intake was increased to 7 servings per day.
Would the authors please provide more information on this? I basically would like to know whether this amount is
realistic.
3. What is the rationale for choosing 3 knots for the splines analyses? Often times based on my personal
experience, the shape might have changed dramatically if using different number of knots. How robust were the
results presented in this paper?
4. Why excluding one study at a time for the influence analyses. This seems too exploratory to me, and better to
have a priori hypothesis for such sensitivity analyses. For example, which dietary assessment tools used to
measure grain intake and associated validation studies are important for many studies conducted worldwide.
