I find this review about whole grains in relation to risk/mortality of several major diseases of high relevance. I
further think that this paper is highly suitable for BMJ, because it is important that e.g. general practitioners and
other health professionals are aware of the role of whole grains in prevention of especially non-communicable
diseases.
The study is of very high analytical quality in relation to the applied methods. I, however, have concerns
regarding the identification of included studies, and I also think that difficulties in whole-grain assessment needs
to be addressed further. Below please find detailed comments:
Major comments:
- It is unclear to me when incidence or mortality is investigated? And in all studies of both incidence and mortality
are included, or is it a priori is decided to focus on specially mortality. If so, why are incidence studies also
included. I think that it would be fair to include both, but it is of outmost importance that it clearly is described in
the text and tables/figures, whether the study is on incidence or mortality.
- In is not clear which diseases that it a priori was decided to include. In the abstract for instance, T2D is not
mentioned in the study selection, but T2D is investigated. This needs to be more clear.
- Whole-grain assessment: It is important that difficulties in assessing the whole-grain intake is discussed
including the reason for not reporting the whole-grain intake in g/day.
- It needs to be addressed why seven servings were set as optimal reference. Please add a reference and argue
for choosing this cut-off. For instance, in Norway, Sweden and Denmark the recommendation is 75 g/day. These
Scandinavian recommendations could be mentioned.
If the above mentioned comments are addressed, I definitely think that the study would be suitable for
publication in BMJ.
