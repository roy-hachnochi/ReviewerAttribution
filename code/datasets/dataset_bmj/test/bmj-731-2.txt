the research takes an econmic cost/benefit approach to low risk patients of DTC. It assumes such patients would

benefit little from regular diagnostic imaging depending on age or post diagnosis of recurrence as key determinants of
survival given exposure to radiation and heightened anxiety of patients exposed to further tests that might be false
positives.
I am not sure the data confirms all this. It appears the research makes an economic argument that misses out the
patients needs or views, preferring a medical assessment of survival rates based on large data sets from hospitals.
the article is very apposite and should be given serious consideration
