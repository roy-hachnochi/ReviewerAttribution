The authors have responded positively to all my suggestions. I have two further comments.
1. Having reduced the percentages in the Abstract to whole numbers they precede them with '~' to indicate
'approximately'. I'm not sure why they feel this is necessary, as few readers will care whether it is (say)
26.5%, 27% or 27.5%. In any case if they are that interested, they can delve into the Results and
calculate the percentages themselves to full accuracy.
2. In response to my point 5 the authors have tried redoing Figure 1 to show the smoothed curves for each
journal separately, but without success. What is needed is the interaction of the spline smoother with
journal, but I accept that this is not straightforward to obtain and am happy that they stick with the current
Figure 1. I suggest though that they make the mean curve thicker than the others, to ensure it stands out.
