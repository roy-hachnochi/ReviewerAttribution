In the revised paper, the authors have provided a more detailed description of the search methodology and
have clarified satisfactorily some of the raised issues.
The fact that the majority of the trials were assessed by just one reviewer remains a problem. However,
given that over 4000 trials needed to be reviewed, I acknowledge that having two independent reviewers
for each trial would have been difficult. The check on quality/consistency (the lead investigator reviewing
the first 50 trials assigned to each reviewer plus the 5% random sample) does go some way to overcome
the potential bias. Therefore, it is probably acceptable. However, it would be useful to add more details of
the results of this check in the main paper.
