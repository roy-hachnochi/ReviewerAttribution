This manuscript describes the largest series of COVID-19 in pregnancy using the well established UK
Obstetric Surveillance System and a protocol developed specifically for pandemics. The inclusion of data
from all 194 maternity units in the UK provides a Nationwide picture of the impact of the virus on
pregnant women, their offspring and maternity services. The authors used a historical control cohort
from a previous study of influenza A /H1N1 thereby allowing them to determine risk factors for
admission to hospital with COVID -19 using odds ratios. Further, a sensitivity analysis excluding urban
areas with the highest prevalence of the virus demonstrated that the increased risks in BAME, obese and
older women remained excluding confounding by geography as an explanation for the significant
associations.
The study is unique in its size, its scientific robustness and its National relevance. The manuscript is well
written, with one clear table summarising the results
I have 2 major comments and one minor:
Major comments:
1. I would suggest that the risk factors of increased maternal age, obesity BAME, comorbidies are
referred to specifically in the section on 'what this study adds' as now but perhaps with the addition of
some figures / OR (particularly the 4.49 for BAME)
2. The authors found that the OR for black ethnicity was > 10. This is not mentioned in the text and I
think is worthy of comment, particularly as the significance remained after sensitivity analysis.
Minor comments:
