Thank you for the opportunity to review your article describing the public health response to
ultra-processed food and drinks. Whilst the concept of ultra-processed foods seems simpler to interpret
and apply than other food categorisation systems, it has many nuances, and the policy options to reduce
their dietary and health impact are complex.
My first main comment relates to the description of ultra-processed foods provided by the authors (e.g.
lines 89-90 and Table 1), specifically the references to marketing and to being long-life/shelf-stable.

Marketing is a really broad term that encompasses a wide range of practices. When the concept of
NOVA was first described, reference to ultra-processed foods being highly marketed was
unsubstantiated. There are now three studies (to my knowledge, including one that I authored) that
have evaluated the prevalence of marketing techniques and claims on packaging of ultra-processed
foods (listed below). I am not aware of any studies that have evaluated use of any other marketing
practices (e.g. price promotions, advertising, etc.) or studies that have specifically shown
ultra-processed foods to be aspirational or appealing to children.

The content of Table 1 is a good summary of the first three NOVA food groups, however the description
used for group 4 ultra-processed foods does not align with my interpretation. I understood that
inclusion of cosmetic ingredients (e.g. colours, flavours, emulsifiers, etc.) in an ingredients list would
mean the product is classified as ultra-processed. In which case, products could contain large
proportions of whole foods and small amounts of these cosmetic ingredients, which means that
describing them as “made from refined substances…” is inaccurate. For example, chilled ready meals in
Australia commonly list foods such as meat, fish, vegetables, pasta as the main ingredients, but also
include colours, flavours, emulsifiers and other processing aids. If the authors agree these foods are
ultra-processed it also challenges the statement “Group 1 foods are present in small amounts or
absent”.
Ultra-processed foods have been described as “shelf-stable” (lines 126, 133) but no further definition is
provided. My understanding of shelf-stable is that temperature control is not needed therefore
ultra-processed foods cannot be frozen or chilled, and the product lasts at least one month before
spoilage occurs. However, I have previously classified the following foods as ultra-processed: ice cream,
frozen desserts, fruit yogurt, dairy desserts, processed cheese (e.g. cheese spread, slices, grated
cheese), fresh and frozen ready meals including pizza and pies, vegan meat replacements including
quorn. Highly processed sliced bread, rolls, cakes do not require temperature control, but are not
typically referred to as shelf-stable as they only last for a few days before spoilage occurs.
My second main comment relates to the concept of hand-prepared food (lines 202-218) which is
currently poorly defined. Would the example of Australian ready meals used above, which are produced
in food factories, be classified as hand-prepared if the factory relied on people to batch cook all of the
composite ingredients (similar to a large food service kitchen) for hand assembly into the finished
product, even if cosmetic ingredients are added? Many food factories are automated and rely on
technological solutions to producing identical ultra-processed food products, but smaller scale factories
that rely on skilled labour can also produce ultra-processed foods.
Fardet A, Rock E. Ultra-processed foods: A new holistic paradigm? Trends in Food Science & Technology.
2019;93:174-84 provides an interesting food science perspective that may assist in further defining
hand-prepared food.
Other comments:
• First key message: Suggest changing “formulations made of refined substances and additives” to
“formulations which include refined substances or cosmetic additives”.
• Third key message: Suggest adding poor diet quality.
• Lines 98-99: The Coca-Cola product portfolio includes bottled plain water, tea and coffee which are not
classified as ultra-processed. How much of their sales are from SSBs and other ultra-processed foods?

• Lines 125-126: Unclear why the poor nutritional characteristics of ultra-processed foods would
encourage consumption. Do the authors mean use of processing techniques and ingredients to make
the foods hyper palatable makes them appealing?
• Lines 130-132: The article by Cairns et al (ref 17) does not refer to level of food processing or
ultra-processed foods. The article states that there is only modest evidence to suggest that food
promotion can influence food preference. However, Hastings describes the impact of marketing more
forcefully in Hastings G. Why corporate power is a public health priority. BMJ. 2012;345.
• Lines 137-138: Please include evidence of market concentration, such as: Vidler A-C, Stoneham M,
Edmunds M, Sartori A. The illusion of choice: an exploratory study looking at the top 10 food companies
in Australia and their brand connections. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health.

• Line 138: Branding is part of marketing. Branding is a marketing technique used to engage with
consumers on an emotional level, which goes beyond product attributes (see Kotler and Armstrong).
• Line 140: Meaning is unclear, how does the political economy of ultra-processed foods drive
marketing?
• Lines 141-142: Evidence for marketing practices which focus on convenience, aspiration and
affordability is needed.
• Lines 154-157: Isn’t the point of strategies to encourage reformulation such as the example provided
supposed to limit marketing of unhealthy foods?
• Lines 169-171: Unclear what is meant by interventions via the political economy of ultra-processed
food manufacturing.
• Lines 175: As there is a lack of literature describing marketing practices used to encourage
consumption of ultra-processed foods, suggest changing from “aggressive marketing” to “marketing
practices”.
• Line 180: I agree that food-based reformulation makes sense, and to be successful affordability and
accessibility need to be addressed.
• Lines 225-229: Whilst meal-kits may have potential for making home cooking easier, the cited article
refers to the high cost and states the Australian meals reviewed need improvements before they could
be described as healthy (high fat and salt, low fibre). They were described as better options compared
with traditional takeaway meals.
• Lines 230-232: Working hours are referred to, but commonly accepted employment conditions
whereby people in countries such as the UK, US and Australia have zero-hours casual contracts with a
weekly roster, or are regarded as self-employed, e.g. delivery drivers, means fragile and unstable
working conditions lead to lack of ability to plan meals. The increasing prevalence of working
households relying on charities for food provision also highlights the insufficiency of basic incomes and
the lack of resources available to many low-paid workers (See
https://www.ids.ac.uk/publications/banking-on-food-the-state-of-food-banks-in-high-income-countries/)
.
• Lines 244-245: How should supermarkets be incentivised to stock less ultra-processed food? In the
absence of government incentives, voluntary action could be encouraged. The world’s largest global
supermarkets have a range of voluntary policies but few address public health nutrition. In a review of
their policies, I recommended that they should introduce initiatives to make healthful foods more
affordable, and report healthful food sales as a proportion of total food sales using transparent criteria.
• Conclusion: A paradigm shift is needed, with a move away from the reductionist nutrient approach to a
more holistic food-based approach. Is there anything we can learn from the countries that have
incorporated the advice to reduce consumption of ultra-processed foods on how this can be done
effectively?
