This is a very compelling article outlining the numerous times the concept of risk compensation has been
debunked in the scientific literature. This is a well-researched article and the concepts are clearly
explained with the help of the figures and tables. I have very minimal comments.
Overall, the way the “zombie” analogy is introduced is confusing mostly because I assumed the authors
meant it is a zombie in that it has been “killed” numerous times in research yet it lives on. However, the
authors kept describing it as something that exists and lives “despite compelling evidence for its

existence.” This would assume that there are people who are arguing that zombies currently exist. Living
despite compelling evidence for existence would be a bit more clear to the reader if the analogy was
about big foot, aliens, or the Loch Ness Monster. If the point the authors are trying to make is that this
is a zombie because it lives on despite being “killed” numerous times by researchers across the world,
they may want to update the wording in page 1 line 21 and page 6 line 28 to reflect that sentiment
(although, of course, the exact wording I used above does not necessarily need to be used, it would just
be helpful to clarify).
It may help the authors to make their point if they show that countries with widespread adoption of
mask wearing have lower COVID-19 infection rates. Because the concept of risk compensation is often
used by people who are against engaging in the protective behavior (e.g. it is touted widely by the
anti-vaccine movement in an attempt to reduce HPV vaccinations) it is helpful to point out that it does,
in fact, work. Therefore, even if there were risk compensation (which there isn’t), there is still benefit to
wearing masks.
