This paper compares the NHS mental health responses to the terrorist attack in London in
2005 to the more recent outreach program implemented in Manchester in 2017 and
identifies developments and barriers in providing adequate services.
The authors point at extremely important challenges in responding to terror attacks in
modern societies across the world. The identified ongoing barriers in England are
equivalent to challenges in European societies and I recommend the paper to be accepted
in BMJ to inform clinicians, researchers, decision makers and authorities.
The paper is well structured and easy to read and understand.
I have some comments and suggestions for the authors to consider in revising the
manuscript.
1.
Introduction:
After describing the two terror attack events in the UK, the authors sum up possible
impacts of terror attacks as follows:
"The majority of people may experience short-term distress, but generally cope well,
however, some may have more persistent distress, and a sizeable minority may develop
difficulties consistent with psychiatric diagnoses.(4,6)
The latter is particularly common for people with past mental health difficulties.(4)"

In a scientific paper I would prefer references from original sources in regard to these
estimates, and preferably from studies on populations being exposed to terror attacks or
comparable events. The event in Manchester comprised of 27% children and young adults,
so this could also be considered in choosing sources.
I agree with the authors that some studies have concluded that past mental health
difficulties predict development of psychiatric diagnoses in disaster survivors, but the
evidence of this statement in young terror survivors is questionable. At least, the authors
should refer to original research papers making the sources of evidence more accessible to
the readers.
2. The London Bombing and the Manchester Arena 2017 attack
I am well familiar with the outreach program implemented after the London Bombing in
2005. This work set new standards for planning and implementing support and health
services to exposed populations after terror attacks across Europe. Unfortunately, terrorist
attacks account for increasing and substantial numbers of deaths and disability. Also,
European societies are experiencing a dramatic and continuing increase in number and
catchment of terrorist attacks and related deaths, accompanied by a substantial increase
of terrorism-related costs. This trend is expected to continue as home-grown right-wing
and jihadist extremists, lone-wolfs, and returned foreign fighters from conflict zones are
considered to pose a substantial security threat in Europe in the years to come.
Hence, European societies need to raise their standards on how to identify victims and
reach out to affected populations. In this paper the authors both demonstrate what has
been implemented since 2005 and important issues that are still unsolved.
Regarding the description of the Manchester Arena 2017 attack, I have the following
comments;
1.
Being a non-UK reader, I have some difficulties understanding the health care
system in the UK and what exactly "Strategic clinical network" and "Improving Access to
Psychological Therapies" actually means. Please describe for international readers.
2.
The authors describe tremendous efforts made to identify victims for registration
in a database. Still, I understand that only 3200 persons were identified compared to 19
500 persons present at the attack. This demonstrates the need for improvements. Do the
authors through their work see unused potentials for identifying affected citizens, e.g. by
mobile phone or other measures?
3.
Line 50-54 on page 3: I understand the hub got responses based on their needs.
Can the author describe in more detail what kind of responses this was and how they
selected out those in need of more than automatic email responses? Referrals were made
to evidence-based services close to where they lived. How do the authors know that the
services provided evidence based services - also to children and young adults in the
population? Please make a reference to evidence of the statement that the access to
evidence based therapy has vastly improved since 2005.
3. Barriers and addressing challenges
The first barriers to care for civilians being hit by terror and suffering from posttraumatic
stress reactions are distressing reading; funding and identifying suffers. These are barriers
for politicians and other authorities to address and solve, and I complement the authors
for addressing these issues.
These barriers needs to be solved to succeed in implementing outreach programs and
provide adequate services.
Implementing care pathways for all victims, regardless of age or where they live, and
designed for the specific events, is challenging. To continuously update our knowledge on
the potential psychosocial, mental and somatic impact of these events, more
documentation is needed, both from outreach programs and clinical experiences and from
rigorous research studies. This paper addresses important issues in these ongoing
challenges.

4. Suggested addition sources
From the terror attack in Oslo, I allow myself to recommend the authors to look into the
experiences made from the 2011 outreach program in Norway, as this may be useful
additional knowledge.
