Page 4, line 20: The entire first section of the paper makes the case why clear
quantification of financing needs is challenging. The logical link between the inconsistency
and incompleteness of the current NCD financing data that is available and the need for
investment cases needs a bit more explanation - state clearly how an NCD investment
case methodology and approach is able to circumvent the data availability challenges, and
how the quantitative and qualitative methods used in NCD investment cases work to build
the case in a convincing manner, and where the ICA fits in. It seems like the key link is
the methodological approach of the investment case, as opposed to only looking at
financing, costs, and burden of disease (which is stated later in the paper, but in terms of
economics as opposed to NCD investment case - the conflation of economics and
investment case is confusing, and dilutes the message of the paper).
Page 4, line 42: This list of countries for which NCD investment cases have been
completed does not include the 2 examples that are highlighted in this paper (Jamaica,
Peru). This makes me think that this list is not accurate or complete, and makes me
question what the statement below, that there is evidence that these NCD investment
cases help ministries of health, is based on.
Page 5, line 6: I would have liked to see more examples of this - more evidence- from
more of the 6 experiences of developing investment cases cited above. For example, I am
aware that Cambodia is now including diabetes, hypertension, and cervical cancer into
their basic health service package - was this decision related to the investment case and
ICA exercises?

Page 5, line 26: I find this a disingenuous statement that detracts from the message that
the authors want to convey. Just state that economics provides a useful means to build
bridges between public health and non-health sectors to advance multisectoral NCD
action.
