Review comments:
The manuscript has been extensively revised to address the raised questions and concerns.
However, there are a few minor comments for consideration.
Methods:
Data collection, page 6: last paragraph: delete the repetitive sentences, ‘The dietary records
used in…. (e.g., sugar in coffee, water during meal)’.
Page 7: Biological sampling and clinical examination: a note on the calculation of visceral fat
index may be preferred.
Page 8: Expansion of MICE
Tables and Figures:
Table 1: It is surprising to note that the sugary drink consumers had a relatively lower
visceral adiposity index as compared to non-consumers. However, a direct association was
observed after accounting for potential confounders.
Table 1: ‘median (Q1, Q3)’ format is preferred over ‘median (Q3 minus Q1)’ to understand
the spread of skewed dietary data (ie., 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles).
Table 1. Please check the median (interquartile range) values for artificially sweetened
beverage intake. They are less likely to be 0.0(0) across the sex-specific tertiles among
consumers.
Table 2: Footnote. Authors have used sex specific cut-offs for tertiles of sugary drinks
intake. The lines “In premenopausal women, cut-offs were …. and in postmenopausal
women… 153.3 mL” can be removed unless the authors have used different cut-offs for
pre-and postmenopausal women.
Appendix 7b: Provide the unit for X-axis (for both sugary drinks and sugar from sugary
drinks).
Appendix 12: Please include ‘n’ and SD to maintain uniformity across the tables.
