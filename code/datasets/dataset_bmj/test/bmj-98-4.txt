The authors have addressed all comments adequately, providing the requested additional
information on methodology, conducting additional sensitivity analyses, and writing a more
balanced discussion of findings with respect to the state of knowledge and to the limitations
of this observational study.
The manuscript has however become somewhat lengthy. Therefore, the editors will need to
decide whether parts of the methods should be presented as supplementary material.
