Abstract
Background: A randomised controlled trial of participatory women's groups in rural Nepal previously
showed reductions in maternal and newborn mortality. In addition to the outcome data we also collected
previously unreported information from the subgroup of women who had been pregnant prior to study
commencement and conceived during the trial period. To determine the mechanisms via which the
intervention worked we here examine the changes in perinatal care of these women. In particular we use
the information to study factors affecting positive behaviour change in pregnancy, childbirth and newborn
care.
Methods: Women's groups focusing on perinatal care were introduced into 12 of 24 study clusters
(average cluster population 7000). A total of 5400 women of reproductive age enrolled in the trial had
previously been pregnant and conceived during the trial period.
For each of four outcomes (attendance at antenatal care; use of a boiled blade to cut the cord; appropriate
dressing of the cord; not discarding colostrum) each of these women was classified as BETTER, GOOD,
BAD or WORSE to describe whether and how she changed her pre-trial practice. Multilevel multinomial
models were used to identify women most responsive to intervention.
Results: Among those not initially following good practice, women in intervention areas were significantly
more likely to do so later for all four outcomes (OR 1.92 to 3.13). Within intervention clusters, women
who attended groups were more likely to show a positive change than non-group members with regard
to antenatal care utilisation and not discarding colostrum, but non-group members also benefited.
Conclusion: Women's groups promoted significant behaviour change for perinatal care amongst women
not previously following good practice. Positive changes attributable to intervention were not restricted
to specific demographic subgroups.
Background
Maternal and newborn mortality rates remain unacceptably
high in the developing world. Most births and newborn
deaths occur outside health facilities, so behaviour
change in relation to home care practices and care-seeking
behaviour is an essential component of any strategy to
reduce deaths. We reported previously a cluster randomised
controlled trial of the effects of participatory
women's groups on neonatal outcomes in rural Nepal[1].
The trial intervention was a woman facilitator (who was
not a trained health worker) within each area paid to instigate
and guide women's groups focused on care in the
perinatal period. The trial showed significant falls in neonatal
(30%) and maternal mortality (78%), and appeared
to be cost effective[2].
Married women of reproductive age (15–49 years) living
in the study areas at the time of study inception were eligible.
Before the trial started, each eligible woman was
asked about her most recent pregnancy. If this resulted in
a stillbirth, infant care practices were asked in respect of
the most recent live birth. Information as to who was
present at the birth and whether it took place in an institution
was recorded. In particular it was ascertained
whether there was a skilled attendant at the birth. The
woman was asked whether she had attended antenatal
care, which implement was used to cut the cord, what was
applied to the cord after it was cut (the criterion for cleanliness
was that either nothing or antiseptic was used) and
whether or not she had discarded colostrum before starting
to breastfeed, a practice distinct from discarding the
foremilk at each feed. The evidence base for deciding
which care practices are beneficial for good perinatal outcome
is limited[3]. However, the practices recorded
within the trial (antenatal care, skilled birth attendance,
measures of cleanliness and good breastfeeding practice)
have long been accepted as important[4-8].
After the baseline interview each woman became a member
of the closed cohort who were randomised within village
development committee areas (VDCs) and followed
prospectively. In the original trial the efficacy of women's
groups was measured for all women living within intervention
areas (compared with control areas), even though
many did not attend groups. The use of pre-trial pregnancy
data allowed us to investigate the precise patterns of
behaviour change within individual women and subgroups
of women. Some women, in both arms of the trial,
did not have the capacity for positive change attributable
to intervention because they followed good practice in a
pre-trial pregnancy. For women who did not follow good
practice before the trial, our study gives us greater insight
into factors affecting positive behaviour change, such as
group membership, socioeconomic status, ethnicity and
maternal age. The subset of women used for these analyses
had by definition a pre-trial pregnancy and the results
are not necessarily generalisable to women whose first
pregnancy occurred in the trial.
Methods
Details of the original trial are reported elsewhere[9,10].
Briefly, 24 cluster units comprising village development
committee areas (VDCs) – existing geopolitical units of
population about 7000 – were placed into 12 matched
pairings of similar topography, ethnicity and population
densities. One VDC area of each matched pair was randomly
assigned to receive the intervention and the other
formed a control. All eligible women were identified and
details of pregnancies, births and deaths were recorded
prospectively for 33 months.
The analysis includes women who had reported a previous
pregnancy and who had a subsequent pregnancy during
the surveillance period. Twin pregnancies were
included only once in the dataset as the process outcomes
under consideration mostly related to the delivery or
woman at that time rather than the individual child.
Repeated pregnancies were included in the analysis with
the appropriate clustering to account for within-woman
correlation of outcomes and responses.
Statistical analysis
The practices undertaken in each trial pregnancy were
compared with those practices a woman had reported in
her pre-trial pregnancy. Each practice was classified for
each pregnancy as:
1) BETTER – lack of good practice in the preceding pregnancy
followed by good practice in the trial pregnancy.
2) GOOD – good practice in both preceding and trial
pregnancies.
3) BAD – lack of good practice in both preceding and trial
pregnancies.
4) WORSE – good practice in the preceding pregnancy but
not in the trial pregnancy.
We fitted multilevel multinomial models, taking into
account the pairing of VDC area clusters, the clustering of
women within VDC areas and households, and the correspondence
between repeat prospective pregnancies in the
same woman, to the 4-category outcomes. Multinomial
models were preferred to logistic regressions of the trial
practices corrected for pre-trial behaviour since they distinguished
between changes from bad to good or from
good to bad practice.
Multinomial models are extensions of logistic models.
Associations between the outcomes and various features
of the women are quantified and presented as coefficients
for the ratios falling into the BETTER category relative to
the other categories. This representation of the model
results was chosen as being the easiest to interpret clinically.
For all 3 ratios thus obtained, larger values were
associated with more favourable outcome. All coefficients
are presented with 95% confidence intervals adjusted for
the clustered nature of the data. For each feature, separate
coefficients are given to quantify the ratios:
1) BETTER relative to GOOD – quantifies the extent to
which women following good practice in the trial pregnancy
were doing so as a result of positive change (as
opposed to continuing the good practices they had
adopted pre-trial).
2) BETTER relative to BAD – quantifies the extent to which
women who were following bad practice in the pre-trial
pregnancy improved their practice within the trial. This
coefficient is of particular interest as it describes the extent
to which opportunities for positive change were taken.
3) BETTER relative to WORSE – quantifies the extent to
which those women who changed practice made a positive,
as opposed to negative, change.
A series of multilevel multinomial models were fitted to
each of the process variables. Firstly, models were used to
quantify differences in patterns of change between control
and intervention clusters and the additional effect of
attending a women's group for women within intervention
clusters.
Secondly, a series of models were fitted to investigate
whether the effect of intervention varied between women
of differing ages, literacy levels and education, or between
those living within households of differing ethnicity,
assets or food sufficiency. For each of these demographic
variables, a model which incorporated the demographic
variable, a variable representing intervention status, and a
term for the interaction between these two variables was
used. The intervention and demographic variables were
independently significantly associated with outcomes in
all models. The coefficients for the fitted interaction terms
showed which groups of women were most likely to
respond to intervention and these are presented. Coefficients
greater than 1 indicate that the women in the intervention
clusters within that demographic subgroup had a
more favourable distribution compared to the baseline
category which was over and above any increase in favourable
practices that could be attributed to intervention
across all subgroups. Coefficients less than 1 are associated
with a less favourable response for that demographic
subgroup of women in the intervention compared with
control clusters.
Ethics and consent
The study was registered as an International Standard Randomised
Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN31137309. It
was approved by the Nepal Health Research Council and
the ethical committee of the Institute of Child Health and
Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, and was conducted
in collaboration with His Majesty's Government
Ministry of Health, Nepal. The aims and design of the trial
were discussed at both national and local meetings, after
which consent to cluster involvement was given by chairpersons
of VDC areas and the Makwanpur district development
committee. Women who chose to participate in
the study gave oral consent, were free to decline to be
interviewed at any time, and the information they provided
remained confidential.
Results
Of the women for whom information regarding a previous
pregnancy had been recorded, 4929 had one further
pregnancy during the trial surveillance period, 228 had 2
pregnancies and 5 had 3 pregnancies. Hence, there were a
total of 5400 within-trial pregnancies from women with
retrospectively recorded information.
Most women delivered at home (93%), without a trained
attendant (92%) or any government health personnel
present (90%), in either the preceding or study pregnancy.
The sentinel care practices of antenatal care uptake, use of
a clean blade to cut the umbilical cord, appropriate dressing
of the cord and feeding of colostrum to the baby were
more variably followed. Table 1 shows the demographic
breakdown of the women and the extent to which good
practice was being followed prior to commencement of
the study.
Approximately three quarters of the women were appropriately
dressing the cord initially and this proportion was
fairly constant across demographic subgroups. Attendance
at antenatal care, boiling of the blade and not discarding
colostrum were all more prevalent amongst the
more highly educated and literate women from wealthier
households.
The effect of being in an intervention VDC
Table 2 shows the percentages of pregnancy pairings falling
into each of the 4 categories (BETTER, GOOD, BAD,
WORSE) for the 4 outcomes for women in intervention
and control arms of the trial.
The percentage of women who were following good practice
during their trial pregnancies can be obtained by adding
together the percentages falling into the BETTER and
GOOD categories. For each of the 4 outcomes a greater
percentage of the women in the intervention clusters followed
good practice during the trial.
Combining the BETTER and BAD categories gives the percentage
of women who were following bad practice pretrial
(and hence had the capacity to change for the better).
For all outcomes apart from the discarding of colostrum,
control clusters had more women with that capacity than
intervention clusters. The percentages of women who
recalled discarding colostrum in their preceding births
were approximately equal between control and intervention
clusters. The percentages lying within the BAD category
represent missed opportunities for positive change
and there were consistently fewer women within intervention
clusters falling into this category for each of the 4 outcomes.
Women who changed their practice between preceding
and study pregnancies fell into the BETTER and WORSE
categories. The percentage of women in the intervention
clusters falling into the BETTER category was greater than
the percentage in the WORSE category, showing that
women were more likely to make a positive, as opposed
to detrimental, change for all outcomes. Women in the
control clusters were more likely to stop, as opposed to

Note: Numbers are less than 5400 for each outcome since some women did not have pregnancies that progressed to the stage for that outcome to
be appropriate. For example, 280 of the eligible pregnancies did not result in a live birth of a surviving mother and hence the discarding of
colostrum was only appropriate as an outcome for 5120 women.
start, appropriate dressing of the cord, but otherwise their
changes were similarly more likely to be in a positive
direction.
The differences between women in the intervention and
control VDCs are further quantified by the fitting of multinomial
models to the 4 outcomes with intervention status
as a predictor. The coefficients and confidence intervals
are given for the BETTER/BAD and BETTER/WORSE
ratios. These are all significantly different to 1. For all four
practices women who were initially following bad practice
were significantly more likely to change to good practice
if they lived in an intervention VDC (BETTER/BAD ratios).
For example, women who did not attend antenatal care in
preceding pregnancies were more than twice as likely to
do so during the study period if they lived in an intervention
area (odds ratio 2.04 95% ci (1.82, 2.27 times)). Of
the women who changed practice these changes were significantly
more likely to be in a positive direction for all
outcomes except antenatal care attendance (BETTER/
WORSE ratio).
Women attending antenatal care and/or using a boiled
blade to cut the cord in pregnancies falling within the
study period were significantly less likely to be doing so as
a result of a positive change in practice if they lived in an
intervention VDC (BETTER/GOOD ratios). These results
are not unexpected given the larger percentages of women
within the intervention VDCs following good practice for
these outcomes pre-trial.
The independent effect of attending a women's group
About one in twelve married women of reproductive age,
and about one third of newly pregnant women in intervention
clusters attended the women's groups. There were
few differences between the percentages of women who
did and did not attend women's groups falling into each
of the 4 categories.
The effect of attending a group over and above the
improvements attributable to living within an intervention
area was greatest for antenatal care attendance. The
percentages of women who attended the groups falling

into the BETTER, GOOD, BAD and WORSE categories
were 22.3, 37.3, 33.7 and 6.7 respectively, compared to
17.8, 34.9, 38.9 and 9.1 of those within intervention
VDCs who did not attend groups. Hence, a larger percentage
of those attending the women's groups improved their
practice (22.3 vs 17.8%) or maintained previous good
practice (37.3 vs 34.9%). The significantly lower odds of
making a positive as opposed to negative change (BETTER/
WORSE ratio) in the intervention VDCs were counter-
acted in the subgroup who attended the women's
groups. The women who attended the groups were significantly
more likely to make positive changes than nonattending
women within intervention VDCs (BETTER/
WORSE ratio 1.77 (1.30, 2.40)). Similarly, the women
within intervention VDCs who attended the groups but
did not attend antenatal care in their previous pregnancies
were significantly more likely to start doing so than the
women within those same VDCs who did not attend
(BETTER/BAD ratio 1.51 (1.28, 1.79)). This difference
was additional to the 2.04 fold increase seen in the intervention
VDCs overall. The BETTER/GOOD ratio for
attenders vs non-attenders was also significant (1.22
(1.04, 1.45)). Women attending the groups were significantly
more likely to make positive changes compared to
non-attending women in the same VDCs with respect to
discarding colostrum (BETTER/WORSE ratio 1.03 (1.01,
1.06)) and there was some evidence that if they were discarding
colostrum previously they were more likely to
stop doing so (BETTER/BAD ratio 1.02 (1.00, 1.04)).
There were no other significant differences.
Were specific subgroups of women with the capacity for
positive change more likely to respond to intervention?
Table 3 shows the increase in the BETTER/BAD ratios for
the intervention group compared to the women in control
areas. Values greater than 1 indicate that the intervention
was more successful in those subgroups of women relative
to the baseline demographic category. Significant differences
in the effects of intervention on the four process outcomes
were not consistent across demographic
subgroups.
Were women who changed practice more likely to do so
positively if they were from specific subgroups?
The extent to which women made positive, as opposed to
negative, changes in practice is quantified by the BETTER/
WORSE model coefficients. Patterns were not consistent
(Table 4) but they were based on the smallest groups
(Table 2). Women from households with more assets
within intervention VDCs were significantly more likely
to make a positive change to dressing the cord but a negative
change with respect to the treatment of colostrum. It
was the older women, those who were less literate and the
less well educated who were significantly more likely to
have stopped, as opposed to started, discarding colostrum
if they lived in intervention, as opposed to control, VDCs.
Were women from specific subgroups who followed good
practice during the trial more likely to be doing so as a
result of a positive change?
These differences are quantified in Table 5 (BETTER/
GOOD ratios). This table is presented for completeness.
However, it is of the least clinical interest due to the
dependence on the variability between groups of the percentages
who show no changes but continue good practice
throughout.
Discussion
Within a large scale trial of a community group intervention,
women were followed prospectively to document
patterns of behaviour change for perinatal care. This helps
to understand how primary trial outcomes may be
explained by changes in the practices of individuals
within the communities. Of the 6380 women who
became pregnant and were included in the main trial
analyses, a subset of 5162 (77.3%) had a pregnancy pretrial
with which to compare their trial pregnancy behaviour.
Within this subgroup we have investigated the
changes for women undergoing their second or subsequent
pregnancies. The findings cannot be extrapolated to
women in their first pregnancies.
As expected, there were strong relationships between past
and present behaviour. Those who followed good practice
in previous pregnancies were likely to do so again, regardless
of whether they were allocated to the intervention or
control arm of the trial. Having a skilled birth attendant is
known to be an important indicator of outcome. Less
than 1 in 12 of the women had such a person present at
either their pre-trial or any trial pregnancy. The numbers
therefore were too low to investigate any impact the intervention
may have had on improving skilled birth attendance.
However, it was possible to investigate changes in
other factors known to be important: antenatal care,
cleanliness of blade and cord, and discarding of colostrum.
The intervention effectively promoted significant
change in all four care behaviours amongst the group of
women not previously following good practice (Table 2).
Positive changes in antenatal care attendance and the discarding
of colostrum were more likely to be made by
women who attended the groups, but behaviour change
in hygienic cutting and dressing is observed generally in
the intervention areas. The lack of uniform relationship
between group attendance and outcome was expected.
The presence of groups in an area has a wider impact than
merely on the women who attend. In our study only 8%
of married women of reproductive age joined our groups,
but 37% of newly pregnant women attended at least once.
Whilst group members showed a greater tendency to posBMC
itive behaviour change than non-group members, this
effect is unlikely to explain the overall improved behaviour
change in intervention versus control clusters. Our
data provides evidence that the activities and existence of
the group stimulate wider behaviour change in their communities.
The group intervention is a dynamic process
that is uniform only in its participatory method, thus further
study is necessary to explore these processes of behaviour
change. We hoped to bring about behaviour change
by giving women and grandmothers the knowledge they
need to make informed choices, and by creating favourable
social conditions, and an enabling environment in
which they could take these decisions[11-13]. Preliminary
analysis of qualitative data, and the data presented here
suggest that this has been the case in the intervention
areas.
Most of the responses to intervention were positive. Significantly
greater percentages of women in intervention
VDCs who were following bad practice pre-trial stopped
doing so after the commencement of the women's groups.
It was surprising that significantly more of the intervention
area women stopped as opposed to started attending
antenatal care compared to the women within control
VDCs. This difference was mostly attributable to the
greater proportion of women in intervention VDCs who
stopped attending. For the other 3 practices a greater percentage
of control women stopped previous good practice
and for all 4 practices there was a lower percentage who
started. It is possible that the women in the intervention
VDCs saw women's groups as a replacement for antenatal
care. This potentially detrimental effect of the intervention
requires further investigation, perhaps via the use of
focus groups in similar future initiatives.
Since allocation was random, we would not expect baseline
differences between women in control and intervention
VDCs. Despite similar mortality rates at baseline[1],
some differences in practices were found in the subgroup
with a previous pregnancy reported here. In particular,
women within intervention VDCs were more likely to
have attended antenatal care (44.2% intervention, 17.7%

intervention VDCs were significantly more likely to continue
or begin good practices after accounting for baseline
differences. These significant differences in behaviour
within this subgroup of just over three-quarters of the
women who fell pregnant within the trial period are compatible
with the reductions in major outcomes found
within the trial.
We have presented secondary analyses of the dataset.
Many comparisons are presented and these are meant to
be interpreted in unison and with the main outcome analyses.
The study was not originally designed to detect subgroup
differences and the results should not be
interpreted as though they were primary objectives. What
we have aimed to do is to identify patterns that might be
clinically relevant and informative to future studies. We
have not identified any major consistent patterns, a finding
which is itself of interest. Having identified significant
differences which could be attributed to the intervention[
1], this analysis investigates the modes via which
those differences may have been achieved. We would
expect to observe differences in process outcomes since
these are known to be related to mortality outcomes. The
finding that the intervention was associated with
increased uptake of good practices in those previously not
following them is both important and as expected: in this
paper we attempt to quantify the degree of difference. It is
also important to note that no tendency for the intervention
to target only subgroups of privileged or non-privileged
women was found. Prior to performing these
analyses we had no notion of the direction that any intervention
bias might fall.
If women were already following good practice, the capacity
for the women's groups to effect positive change was
limited. It was important that those following good practices
continued to do so. Therefore, we have considered all
patterns of change and how they related to features of the
mother, the household in which she lived and whether or
not she resided in an intervention area. Four pre-trial practices
were found to have a large capacity for positive
change and for there to have been significant alterations
during the study period. The women's groups discussed

control VDCs, within different demographic subgroups were more (or less) likely to make positive as opposed to negative changes,

the prevention of neonatal deaths, home care practices
that might help, and the use of health services for either
routine or emergency care. The issues of antenatal care,
the use of clean cord-cutting implements, avoidance of
unhygienic dressings and the benefits of colostrum feeding
arose as subjects of discussion on many occasions.
These issues could, and were, easily translated into specific
actions.
It was clear that the less educated and illiterate women
were less likely to be following good practice initially.
Although these women were significantly targeted by the
intervention for some outcomes, the differences were not
uniform. There were benefits across all of the demographic
subgroups of women.
Conclusion
In conclusion, peer-education and empowerment of
women through women's groups has positive effects on
perinatal care practices for women in their second or subsequent
pregnancies. Both group members and nongroup
members in the locality benefit from this intervention.
