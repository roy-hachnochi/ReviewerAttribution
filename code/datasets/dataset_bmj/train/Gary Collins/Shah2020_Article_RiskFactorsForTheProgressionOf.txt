Risk factors for the progression of fnger interphalangeal joint
osteoarthritis: a systematic review
Abstract
Progressive hand interphalangeal joint (IPJ) osteoarthritis is associated with pain, reduced function and impaired quality of
life. However, the evidence surrounding risk factors for IPJ osteoarthritis progression is unclear. Identifying risk factors for
IPJ osteoarthritis progression may inform preventative strategies and early interventions to improve long-term outcomes for
individuals at risk of IPJ osteoarthritis progression. The objectives of the study were to describe methods used to measure the
progression of IPJ osteoarthritis and identify risk factors for IPJ osteoarthritis progression. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus,
and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 19th February 2020 (PROSPERO CRD42019121034). Eligible
studies assessed potential risk factor/s associated with IPJ osteoarthritis progression. Risk of bias was assessed using a modifed QUIPS Tool, and a best evidence synthesis was performed. Of eight eligible studies, all measured osteoarthritis progression radiographically, and none considered symptoms. Eighteen potential risk factors were assessed. Diabetes (adjusted
mean diference between 2.06 and 7.78), and larger fnger epiphyseal index in males (regression coefcient β=0.202) and
females (β=0.325) were identifed as risk factors (limited evidence). Older age in men and women showed mixed results;
13 variables were not risk factors (all limited evidence). Patients with diabetes and larger fnger epiphyseal index might
be at higher risk of radiographic IPJ osteoarthritis progression, though evidence is limited and studies are biased. Studies
assessing symptomatic IPJ osteoarthritis progression are lacking.

Introduction
Osteoarthritis is one of the leading causes of worldwide disability [1], and, in the USA alone, carries a cost of $10 billion just from economic loss [2]. Hand osteoarthritis is one
of the most common types of radiographic osteoarthritis [1].
Hand osteoarthritis also presents in a younger population
than osteoarthritis at other joints, with a prevalence of 3% in
men and 8% in women aged 45–64 years [3, 4]. It is considered a chronic disease, with some cases progressing and the
prevalence increasing to 5% in men and 9% in women aged
65–74 years [5]. Symptomatic treatment for progressive
hand osteoarthritis is limited, with patients often requiring
surgical management, such as arthrodesis or arthroplasty [6].
Measuring progressive hand osteoarthritis is difcult,
with no consensus for defning or quantifying worsening
of disease [7]. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2006 Task Force described hand osteoarthritis progression as being joint specifc, whereby osteoarthritis
in one hand joint evolves independently from other hand
joints [8]. However, analysis from a large cohort study suggests there are patterns of symmetry, osteoarthritis clustering
by row (across distal interphalangeal joints (DIPJs) or across
proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPJs)), and clustering by
ray (within a fnger) also exist [9]. There is also poor correlation between radiographic and symptomatic disease [10, 11].

The aetiology for the progression of hand osteoarthritis
is also poorly understood, and therefore identifying patients
at highest risk for needing surgical management is limited.
When managing hip and knee osteoarthritis surgically,
shared decision making between clinicians and patients has
been shown to be benefcial [12]. In the hand, a better understanding of whether a patient is at increased risk of progressive disease would help to inform shared decision making. In
particular, it would enable earlier investigations, more personalised treatment pathways, and targeted interventions for
prevention and treatment. These priorities have been highlighted by the recent Commission on the Future of Surgery
[13]. Similarly, being able to identify patients with osteoarthritis who will not progress will prevent the over-investigation and excessive medical treatment of these patients. A
review has found that abnormal scintigraphy scans, higher
Australian/Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index (AUSCAN)
scores, number of osteoarthritis joints at baseline, more pain,
and nodal osteoarthritis were risk factors for the progression
of radiographic or clinical hand osteoarthritis [14]. However,
this review combined interphalangeal joint (IPJ) and base of
thumb [frst carpometacarpal joint (CMCJ)] osteoarthritis
under the umbrella of ‘hand osteoarthritis.’ Finger IPJ and
frst CMCJ osteoarthritis are now thought to be diferent
subsets of the disease, with diferent risk factors, pathophysiology and patterns of progression [15].
Therefore, the primary aim of this systematic review is to
identify risk factors for the progression of fnger IPJ osteoarthritis. The secondary aim is to describe the measurements
used to defne the progression of IPJ osteoarthritis.
Methods
The reporting of this systematic review followed the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement [16]. The protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO [17]
(CRD42019121034).
Search strategy
The search strategy was constructed with the assistance
of a specialist health-care librarian. The search was conducted in four electronic databases: (1) Medline by Ovid,
(2) Embase by Ovid, (3) Scopus, (4) the Cochrane library.
The search string included a range of search terms for (1)
hands and fngers, (2) osteoarthritis, and (3) progression,
and was amended for each database (Electronic Supplementary Material 1). The PICOS tool [18] was used to
frame the search strategy as follows: population: adults
with IPJ osteoarthritis, intervention/prognostic factor:
potential risk factor(s) for IPJ osteoarthritis progression,
comparison: no exposure to the risk factor(s), outcome:
progression of IPJ osteoarthritis, study type: quantitative
methodology. The search was conducted on 17th October 2018 and duplicates were removed. The search was
updated on 19th February 2020. The reference lists of all
eligible articles were manually assessed for additional
studies. Rayyan QCRI Tool was used to import all papers
[19].
Two groups of reviewers (Group 1: KS, Group 2: XY and
JCEL) independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. Any articles with insufcient title or abstract information were referred for full text review. Articles for which the
full text was not available were requested directly from the
authors. Any disagreements in eligibility assessment was
resolved at a consensus meeting by a third reviewer (SRF).
Study eligibility criteria
Studies were considered eligible if they (a) included participants with evidence of radiographic or clinical IPJ osteoarthritis at baseline; (b) the participants were followed up
for at least 1 year (as it has been shown that progression
of radiographic hand osteoarthritis can be detected over
a 1 year time frame [20]); (c) IPJ osteoarthritis (separate
from frst CMCJ osteoarthritis) progression was measured
at follow-up, using radiographic and/or symptomatic criteria
(IPJ osteoarthritis progression was defned as an increase
in radiographic or symptomatic criteria/score at follow-up
compared to baseline); (d) the association between a potential risk factor and the progression of IPJ osteoarthritis was
investigated at follow-up.
Case reports were excluded. Letters to editors might
contain important information about studies, such as new
information or discussions of further weaknesses of original studies [21]. Therefore, letters to editors which exist in
the context of original studies, included in our review, were
examined to inform the risk of bias assessment and as additional sources of information [22]. Conference abstracts are
considered to have high variability in terms of data reliability, accuracy and detail, and therefore these were excluded
[21, 23].
Studies of infammatory arthritis, erosive arthritis, with
participants under the age of 18 years (to avoid confounding
by juvenile arthritis), and studies where IPJ osteoarthritis
results could not be separated from other joints including
the frst CMCJ, and were not provided on request of the
corresponding author within 2 months were excluded. Animal, cadaver, and cell studies were excluded. Articles not
in English, and articles which lacked accessible full texts
(online or in paper copy throughout the UK, or after requesting them from the corresponding author with no reply within
2 months) were excluded.

Data extraction
One reviewer (KS) independently extracted participant
demographics (e.g. age and sex), study characteristics
(e.g. study design), the potential risk factor/s assessed,
effect measure and size/s and the definition/s used to
measure osteoarthritis progression. A potential risk factor
was defined as any factor investigated for an association
with IPJ osteoarthritis progression.
If data was reported at multiple time points, results
from all time points were extracted. If articles or supplementary material did not contain sufficient data, the
corresponding author was contacted to request additional
data, with a 2 month turnaround policy. For any articles
which reported data from a study described in detail
elsewhere, the source of the data was retrieved and data
extracted as appropriate. Data extraction was input into a
Microsoft Excel file and cross-checked by a second independent reviewer (XY).
Risk of bias assessment
Two independent reviewers (KS and XY) rated the risk of
bias of included studies using a modified version of the
Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) risk of bias tool
[24] (Electronic Supplementary Material 2). The following five domains were assessed: (1) study participation,
(2) study attrition, (3) prognostic factor measurement, (4)
outcome measurement, (5) statistical analysis and reporting [24]. We excluded the domain assessing ‘Confounding
factors’, as confounders can themselves be considered to
be prognostic factors, and thus the term ‘confounders’ is
a misnomer in prognostic factor studies [25]. As there is
currently limited established literature in the field of IPJ
osteoarthritis progression, any ‘confounder’ identified in
the literature was treated as a potential risk factor for this
review. Each domain was given an overall score of ‘low’,
‘moderate’ or ‘high’ risk of bias (Electronic Supplementary Material 2). The overall risk of bias of a study was
classified by examining the risk of bias in each of the
five domains. If one or more domains were classified as
having high risk of bias, then this study was classified as
having an overall high risk of bias [24, 26–28]. If three or
more domains were classified as having a moderate risk
of bias, then this study was classified as having an overall
moderate risk of bias [24, 26, 27, 29]. If all domains were
classified as having a low risk of bias, or less than three
domains had a moderate risk of bias, then this study was
classified as having an overall low risk of bias [28, 30].
Any disagreement between reviewers was discussed at a
consensus meeting with a third reviewer (SRF).
Analysis and best evidence synthesis
Risk factors for all defnitions of IPJ osteoarthritis progression were identifed, followed by a subgroup analysis for
DIPJ and PIPJ separately. If studies were homogenous with
regard to study populations, potential risk factors assessed,
efect measures used, and measurements of IPJ osteoarthritis progression, a pooled meta-analysis was considered
using Review Manager software [31], and the Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality
of evidence [32].
If studies were heterogeneous, we chose not to report
effect measures of different types and instead used a
qualitative narrative summary. The association between
a potential risk factor and IPJ osteoarthritis progression
was categorised as:
(a) A risk factor: positive efect measure.
(b) Not a risk factor: negative efect measure; or, no statistical association.
(c) Conficting evidence: efect measures not in the same
direction.
A best evidence synthesis was used to summarise the
data for each potential risk factor assessed [33–36]. The
criteria were applied sequentially. If multiple analyses
were performed within one study, the consistent fndings
approach described below was applied to the study to
decide whether it showed consistent or mixed evidence.
This was then used to calculate the overall best evidence
synthesis across studies.
(a) Consistent evidence:≥ 75% of studies reported the
same direction of efect (either positive or negative/no
association).
(b) Mixed evidence:<75% of analyses reported the same
direction of efect.
If consistent evidence was found, the strength of evidence was assessed:
(i) Strong evidence:>2 studies with low risk of bias.
(ii) Moderate evidence: 1 study with low risk of bias. and
1 other study; or:>2 studies with moderate or high
risk of bias.
(iii) Limited evidence with low risk of bias: 1 study with
low risk of bias.
(iv) Limited evidence:≤2 studies with moderate or high
risk of bias.

Results
Studies included
Combining results from the search in October 2018 and
the updated search in February 2020, 25, 739 titles were
identifed through the search strategy, with 13,346 remaining after removal of duplicates. After screening titles and
abstracts, the full text of 32 articles was evaluated, and eight
articles met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). No additional articles were found by reviewing the reference lists of eligible
studies.
Study characteristics
Eight prospective cohort studies were included [37–44]
(Table 1). Five studies included men and women [40–44],
whilst three studies included only men [37–39]. The smallest
study included 177 participants [37], whilst the largest study
included 5560 participants [40]. The shortest follow-up
period was a mean of 2.28 years [39] and the longest followup was reported as a mean (standard deviation) of 23.5 (3.3)
years [37].
Risk of bias
Seven studies were rated as having overall high risk of bias
[37–39, 41–44], and one study was of moderate risk of bias
[40] (Table 2). ‘Study participation’ was of high risk of
bias in four studies due to studies not adequately reporting
recruitment periods and places of recruitment [37, 39, 41,
44]. In the ‘Study attrition’ domain, Plato et al. and Kallman
et al. did not clearly report response rates and reasons for
participants with loss to follow-up [37, 39], whilst Haugen
et al. and Marshall et al. had less than 80% response rates
and also did not report reasons for loss to follow-up [41,
42]. When assessing the ‘Statistical analysis and reporting’ domain, it was found that Plato et al., Busby et al., and
Kalichman et al. did not provide efect measures, but only
reported p values or stated whether results were ‘signifcant
or not signifcant’ [38, 39, 43].

Measurements for the progression of fnger
interphalangeal joint osteoarthritis
All studies assessed osteoarthritis radiographically, using
a version of the Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) classifcation
[45, 46] (Table 1). Three studies measured IPJ osteoarthritis progression as a≥1 grade increase from the highest KL
grade at baseline [37–39]; three studies measured it as an
increase in the total number of IPJs with KL grade≥2 [38,
42, 43]; one study measured progression as a≥1 grade KL
increase in a≥1 IPJ [40]; and three studies measured it as≥1
grade increase in a cumulative KL sum score [41, 42, 44].
No studies measured osteoarthritis progression through a
deterioration in symptomatic scoring.
Risk factors for the progression of fnger
interphalangeal joint osteoarthritis
Eighteen potential risk factors were assessed, most commonly in one study only (efect measures shown in Electronic Supplementary Material 3). For potential risk factors
assessed by more than one study, due to heterogeneity in the
defnitions of the risk factor/s, statistical tests, and osteoarthritis defnitions, a best evidence synthesis was performed.
Three risk factors were identifed: diabetes type 2/impaired
fasting glucose (IFG) [42]; and larger epiphyseal index (EI)
in males [44], and in females [44] (all with limited evidence)
(Table 3). Older age in men [37–39, 43] and in women [43]
showed mixed results (Table 3).
Diabetes type 2/impaired fasting glucose
(IFG)
Marshall et al. assessed diabetes type 2/IFG compared to not
having these conditions in a total of 474 participants [42]
(efect measures shown in Electronic Supplementary Material 3). In a complete case analysis, these conditions were
associated with an increase by≥1 grade in a cumulative KL
[47] sum score for all IPJs [adjusted mean diference (95% confdence interval) 7.78 (1.13–14.43)] [42]. However, there was
no association following multiple imputation [4.50 (− 0.26
to 9.25)] [42]. Diabetes type 2/IFG was associated with an
increase in the number of IPJs with KL [47] grade≥2 following multiple imputation and complete case analysis [2.06
(0.25–3.87) and 3.35 (1.08–5.62), respectively] [42].
Large fnger epiphyseal index (EI)
Kalichman et al. investigated larger EI in 177 participants
[44] (Electronic Supplementary Material 3). A positive
association was found in both males (multiple regression
coefcient, β=0.202; 95% CI not reported) and females
(β=0.325; 95% CI not reported), between larger EI and IPJ
osteoarthritis progression (measured as an increase by≥1
grade in a cumulative KL [38] sum score for PIPJs in the
assessed digits).
DIPJ and PIPJ subgroup analysis
In the DIPJ subgroup analysis, eight potential risk factors
were assessed, and only older age in women was found to be
a risk factor (correlation coefcient 0.20) [43] (limited evidence) (Table 3). In the PIPJ subgroup analysis, 11 potential
risk factors were assessed, and larger EI in males (β=0.202;
95% CI not reported) and females (β=0.325; 95% CI not
reported) were identifed as risk factors [44] (limited evidence for both) (Table 3).
Discussion
Osteoarthritis is one of the largest health-care burdens, and
radiographic hand osteoarthritis is highly prevalent, afecting
more than one out of fve adult Americans [48]. Osteoarthritis is considered to be progressive in some cases. However,

there is no unifed method to measure the progression of
hand osteoarthritis, and IPJ osteoarthritis is now considered
to be a diferent disease subset from frst CMCJ osteoarthritis. As IPJ osteoarthritis progresses, it can be treated surgically, and there are currently no disease-modifying drugs.
Risk factors which increase the chance of IPJ osteoarthritis
progression in patients have been studied in the literature.
We identifed eight studies (seven high risk of bias) investigating potential risk factors for the progression of fnger IPJ
osteoarthritis [37–44]. All studies measured osteoarthritis
progression radiographically, using a version of the KL classifcation system [45, 46]. Our review found that patients
with diabetes/IFG [42], and both male and females with a
larger fnger EI [44], are at increased risk of IPJ osteoarthritis progression (limited evidence), whilst older age in men
[37–39, 43] and in women [43] showed mixed evidence.
Results were largely similar when DIPJ and PIPJ osteoarthritis when assessed separately.
The KL classifcation system [45, 46] was used to measure osteoarthritis progression by all studies [37–44, 49]. The
KL classifcation system [45, 46] is a sensitive method for
measuring the progression of radiographic hand osteoarthritis over a 1-year time frame [20]. All of the studies included
in this review were longitudinal studies, and the shortest
follow-up period had a mean of 2.28 years [39]. Therefore,
all studies would have adequately detected any radiographic
IPJ osteoarthritis progression. However, the defnitions of
each measure of progression varied across studies. Some
studies measured an increase in KL grade [37–40], whilst
others measured it as an increase in the number of joints
with a particular KL grade [38, 40, 42, 43] and still other
studies measured it as an increase in a cumulative KL sum
score [41, 42, 44] (which is dependent on either an increase
in KL grade of already afected joints, or an increase in the
number of joints with a particular KL grade). The sensitivity of the KL classifcation system [45, 46] in detecting IPJ
osteoarthritis progression measured in these diferent ways
has not yet been investigated. Additionally, potential risk
factors that occur at a localised joint level (such as joint
trauma) could also be risk factors for isolated IPJ osteoarthritis progression. However, localised risk factors were
not assessed by studies in this review. Further research is
required to understand whether there are any joint-specifc
risk factors for IPJ osteoarthritis progression, and whether
these might cause osteoarthritis to progress at one joint independently of other IPJs.
Diabetes/IFG was found to be a risk factor for IPJ osteoarthritis progression [42]. Marshall et al. suggest diabetes/
IFG might be a risk factor for the progression of osteoarthritis due to hyperglycaemia [42]. Hyperglycaemia has been
shown to induce reactive oxygen species and the production
of cytokines, which result in joint infammation and in the
production of proteolytic enzymes that degrade cartilage
[50]. However, in a Delphi study consisting of a panel of
hand surgeons, the use of diabetic medication and abnormal
fasting glucose were not identifed as risk factors for fnger
IPJ osteoarthritis progression [51]. This suggests that though
diabetes/IFG might have a relationship with IPJ osteoarthritis on a molecular level, in a clinical context the efect is not
yet well recognised. Our results also found that larger fnger
EI is a risk factor for IPJ osteoarthritis progression [44].
In hip and knee osteoarthritis, larger cross-sectional areas
in the femoral neck and proximal femoral shaft and in the
tibial plateau, respectively, have also been described [52,
53]. Additionally, in knee osteoarthritis, a loss of articular
cartilage coupled with larger bone epiphyseal area results
in a change of loading and force across a joint, further contributing to the progression of osteoarthritis [54]. However,
in the hands, and particularly the fnger IPJs, the load across
the joint is much lower, suggesting that there might be other
mechanisms which contribute to the relationship between
EI and IPJ osteoarthritis progression. Given the limited evidence reported in our systematic review, further high-quality
studies are needed to assess this relationship.
