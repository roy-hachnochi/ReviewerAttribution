NAT2 variants and toxicity related to anti-tuberculosis agents: a
systematic review and meta-analysis

BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) patients receiving
anti-tuberculosis treatment may experience serious
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) such as hepatotoxicity.
Variants of the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene may
increase the risk of experiencing such toxicity events.
OBJECTIVE : To provide a comprehensive evaluation of
the evidence base for associations between NAT2
variants and anti-tuberculosis drug-related toxicity.
METHOD: This was a systematic review and metaanalysis.
We searched for studies in Medline, PubMed,
EMBASE, BIOSIS andWeb of Science.We included data
from 41 articles (39 distinct cohorts of patients). We
pooled effect estimates for each genotype on each
outcome using meta-analyses stratified by country.
RESULT S : We assessed the quality of the included
studies, which was variable, with many areas of
concern. Slow/intermediate NAT2 acetylators were
statistically significantly more likely to experience
hepatotoxicity than rapid acetylators (OR 1.59,
95%CI 1.26–2.01). Heterogeneity was not detected
in the overall pooled analysis (I2 ¼ 0%). NAT2
acetylator status was significantly associated with
the likelihood of experiencing anti-tuberculosis drugrelated
hepatotoxicity.
CONCLUS ION: We encountered several challenges in
performing robust syntheses of data from pharmacogenetic
studies, and we outline recommendations for the
future reporting of pharmacogenetic studies to enable
high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses to be
performed.
KEY WORDS : tuberculosis; pharmacogenetics; adverse
events; evidence synthesis
TUBERCULOSIS (TB) is one of the most important
challenges in global health. There were an estimated
1.3 million TB deaths in 2016 among human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative people and
374 000 deaths among HIV-positive people.1 The
World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a
combination of four first-line drugs for individuals
with drug-susceptible TB: isoniazid (INH), rifampicin
(RMP), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide
(PZA).1
TB patients receiving a combination of these drugs
may experience adverse drug reactions (ADRs), the
most serious of which is anti-tuberculosis druginduced
hepatotoxicity (ATDH). Reported incidence
rates of ATDH among patients treated with standard
multidrug treatment vary from 2% to 28%, depending
on the regimen given, definition of ATDH and
patient characteristics such as age, race and sex.2
ATDH can be fatal, with reported mortality rates of
6–12% if drugs are not promptly stopped.3 ATDH
and other anti-tuberculosis drug-related adverse
effects also contribute to non-adherence, eventually
leading to treatment failure, relapse and the emergence
of drug resistance.2
The proposed genetic risk factors for ATDH
include polymorphisms of the N-acetyltransferase 2
(NAT2) gene, which codes for the drug-metabolising
enzyme, NAT2.4,5 NAT2 polymorphisms may affect
the activity of the NAT2 enzyme, altering the
chemical modification of anti-tuberculosis drugs
and their metabolites in the liver, leading to hepatic
adverse reactions.6 Toxic metabolites may also cause
other toxicity events, such as peripheral neuropathy
and maculopapular eruption, although the majority
of evidence on the pharmacogenetics of anti-tuberculosis
drugs focuses on hepatotoxicity.
INH is the anti-tuberculosis drug for which the
genetic contribution to ATDH has been most widely
studied and is best understood. Specifically, it is
thought that NAT2 acetylator status may be associated
with INH-related hepatotoxicity because NAT2
is one of the main enzymes involved in INH
metabolism in the liver. There are three phenotypes
of acetylator status. Individuals who are slow NAT2
acetylators have higher plasma drug concentrations.
This may be beneficial for treatment efficacy, but may
also cause an accumulation of toxic metabolites as
part of the metabolic activation of acetylhydrazine to
harmless diacetylhydrazine. INH suppresses the
acetylation of acetylhydrazine to produce more toxic
metabolites, which contributes to the increased risk
of hepatitis.7 Fast acetylators have lower plasma drug
concentrations, and so treatment may be less effective,
but also less toxic. Intermediate acetylators fall
between these two extremes.
RMP and PZA have also been reported to be
hepatotoxic;8 however, the mechanisms for RMPand
PZA-induced hepatotoxicity are not known.9
The OATP1B1*15 haplotype has been reported to be
a predictor of RMP-induced liver injury;10 no
research into the genetic predictors of PZA-induced
hepatotoxicity has been reported.11 No hepatotoxicity
has been described for EMB.8
The objective of this systematic review and metaanalysis
was to evaluate evidence on the effect of
NAT2 on anti-tuberculosis drug-related toxicity in
TB patients receiving anti-tuberculosis treatment.
Meta-analyses investigating the effect of NAT2 on
toxicity outcomes have been published,6,12–15 but the
conclusions from these have been conflicting. Our
review and meta-analysis updates and adds to the
evidence base on associations between NAT2 and
anti-tuberculosis drug-related toxicity.
METHODS
This review was conducted in line with the methods
outlined in our protocol (PROSPERO registration
number: CRD42017068448).16 A search strategy
and study selection process enabled identification of
studies that investigated the association between any
genetic variant and anti-tuberculosis drug-related
toxicity. However, in this article, we focus only on
the subset of studies that considered NAT2 variants.
Studies investigating associations between other
genetic variants and anti-tuberculosis drug-related
toxicity will be reported separately.
Selection criteria
Types of studies
We included cohort studies, case-control studies and
randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We did not
include studies on case series because this type of
study design would be inappropriate to investigate
the effect of genetic variants on anti-tuberculosis
drug-related toxicity. We did not require a minimum
number of enrolled patients for a study to be included
in our review.
Types of participants
We included studies that recruited TB patients who
were either already established on anti-tuberculosis
treatment or commencing treatment (at least one of
INH, RMP, PZA or EMB), and who were genotyped
to investigate the effect of genetic variants on antituberculosis
drug-related toxicity. We only included
studies where .50% of included patients were TB
patients receiving anti-tuberculosis treatment.
Types of outcomes
We included studies that measured any drug-related
toxicity outcomes.
Search strategy
An information specialist (EK) designed the search
strategy (Appendix Tables A.1* and A.2), and
searched for relevant studies in Medline, PubMed,
EMBASE, BIOSIS andWeb of Science (date of search:
3 March 2016). We searched reference lists from
relevant studies manually, and contacted experts to
identify eligible studies. We included studies published
in English only. We did not restrict by year of
publication or publication status.
Study selection
The search results were imported to Covidence.17 We
removed duplicates, and one author (MR) scanned
the study abstracts to remove irrelevant studies. A
second author (AJ, JK or KD) independently screened
a sample of 10% of studies.
We obtained the full text for each potentially
relevant study. One reviewer (MR) assessed eligibility
based on the selection criteria. A second author (AJ,
JK or KD) independently assessed a sample of 10% of
studies for eligibility. Disagreements between the two
reviewers at the abstract and full-text screening stages
were resolved through discussion, and by consulting a
third author if necessary.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of this review was hepatotoxicity
by any definition used by the original investigators.
The secondary outcomes were all other toxicity
outcomes.
Data collection
We designed and piloted a data extraction form. We
collected data on study design, participant characteristics,
and treatment regimen and outcomes. One
author (MR) extracted data in accordance with the
methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook18 and
The HuGENet HuGE Review Handbook.19 A
second author (AJ, JK or KD) independently
extracted all outcome data. Disagreements between
the two reviewers were resolved through discussion,
and by consulting a third author if necessary. We
contacted study authors if outcome data necessary
for inclusion in a meta-analysis were not published
in the paper.
We contacted individuals who were listed as
authors of multiple included articles to enquire
whether there was overlap between articles in terms
of the patient cohorts. We examined locations, dates
of recruitment and other study characteristics to
identify articles that reported outcomes for the same
patient cohort. If an author confirmed that multiple
articles reported outcomes for the same patient
cohort, or if we suspected this based on reported
study characteristics, we assigned a group identifier
(GI) to these articles, and ensured that no data for the
same patient cohort were included more than once in
any meta-analysis.
Quality assessment
One author applied criteria for the quality assessment
of pharmacogenetic studies20 to each study. A second
author (AJ) independently assessed the quality of a
sample of 10% of studies. Disagreements between the
two reviewers were resolved through discussion. We
obtained the number of studies meeting each criterion
and summarised this information in the text.
Data synthesis
We performed meta-analyses for associations between
NAT2 and any anti-tuberculosis drug-related
toxicity outcome that were investigated by at least
two studies. The effects of both NAT2 acetylator
status (as predicted using genotyping methods) and
individual NAT2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were investigated.
Primary analysis
The primary analysis compared risk of hepatotoxicity
for slow/intermediate acetylators in comparison with
rapid acetylators. Data were pooled from studies that
reported data for each acetylator group separately
together with data from studies that combined slow
and intermediate acetylator groups.
Two sensitivity analyses were conducted. The first
was pairwise comparisons of slow vs. rapid acetylator
status, and intermediate vs. rapid acetylator status.
Here, it was only possible to include data from studies
that reported on each acetylator group separately.
The second was comparison of slow vs. rapid/
intermediate acetylator status. Here, data were
pooled from studies that combined data for intermediate
and rapid acetylator groups, and from studies
that reported data for each acetylator group separately.
Secondary analysis
The secondary analysis compared the risk of hepatotoxicity
between genotype groups for NAT2 SNPs.
For each SNP, two pairwise comparisons were
undertaken: heterozygous genotype vs. homozygous
wild-type (wt), and homozygous mutant-type vs.
homozygous wt. For SNPs investigated by one study
only, odds ratios (ORs) comparing genotype groups
were calculated and summarised in a table, together
with the pooled estimates from the meta-analyses.
There were insufficient data to perform metaanalyses
for an association between NAT2 (acetylator
status and individual SNPs) and other toxicity
outcomes; ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
for each pairwise comparison were calculated and
reported in a table.
Meta-analyses were performed using Stata v 14
(metan package) (StataCorp, College Station, TX,
USA);21 ORs with 95%CIs were the chosen measure
of effect. We used the random-effects model because
we anticipated heterogeneity between studies due to
differences in study design, methodological quality,
ethnicity of participants and outcome definitions. The
random-effects model used the method of DerSimonian
and Laird,22 with the estimate of heterogeneity
being taken from the Mantel-Haenszel model.23 If
zero events were observed in one of the genotype
groups, a continuity correction of 0.5 was used. Data
were excluded from the analysis if there were no
patients in one of the genotype groups in a
comparison.
The HuGENet HuGE Review Handbook recommends
that meta-analyses of genetic association
studies be stratified by ethnicity, and that metaanalyses
should only be performed if effect estimates
for different ethnic groups appear sufficiently similar.
19 However, information on participants’ ethnicity
was sparsely reported in the studies included in our
review. We therefore performed analyses stratified by
the countries in which studies were conducted as a
proxy for ethnicity.
Investigation of heterogeneity
We assessed heterogeneity by visually examining
forest plots, and by referring to the I2 statistic. If
substantial heterogeneity had been observed
(.50%),18 we planned to undertake subgroup
analyses according to study design, outcome definitions,
treatment regimens and date of study publication.
Selective reporting
We assessed the possibility of selective reporting as
part of the quality assessment. Potential sources of
selective reporting considered were genetic variants,
outcomes and modes of inheritance.20
Publication bias
We produced a funnel plot for the primary analysis to
assess the risk of publication bias.

RESULTS
Included and excluded studies
A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow chart showing
the selection of studies during the literature search is
provided in Figure 1 (for more information, visit
www.prisma-statement.org).24 The initial search
identified 77 articles investigating the association
between any genetic variant and anti-tuberculosis
drug-related toxicity, from which 52 distinct cohorts
of patients were identified (Figure 1).
Forty-six articles reported data for the association
between NAT2 variants and anti-tuberculosis drugrelated
toxicity; from these articles, 40 distinct
patient cohorts were identified. In this review, we
include data from 40 articles (39 distinct patient
cohorts).25–64 We did not include data from the
remaining six articles.65–70 Of those six articles, five
reported data for patient cohorts for whom data were
also reported in other articles (or we suspected that
this was the case); for the sixth article,70 the numbers
of patients in each genotype group were not reported,
and we were unable to obtain this information from
the authors. The characteristics of studies included in
this review are provided in Appendix Table A.3.
Quality assessment
Choosing which genes and SNPs to genotype
Twenty-seven articles reported the reasons for choosing
all genes and SNPs investigated. For the 13
articles28,31,33,37,48,51,53,57,59,60,62–64 that did not report
this information, no articles limited their
reporting to only statistically significant associations.
Therefore, there was no evidence to suggest that
selective reporting of genes and SNPs had occurred.
Sample size
The median sample size was 170 (interquartile range
108.5–285). Only two articles26,63 provided details of
the a priori power to detect pre-specified effect sizes.
Study design
Eleven articles described case-control studies, 27
articles described prospective cohorts, one article
described a retrospective cohort and one article
described an RCT. For one case-control study,33 the
case and control groups were not clearly defined. No
articles describing case-control studies reported that
the two groups were genotyped in mixed batches.
Reliability of genotypes
Only three articles26,32,46 mentioned genotype
quality control procedures, and only 12 articles26,33,35,37,38,41,45,49–
51,53,55 compared the genotype
frequencies of all investigated SNPs to those
previously published for the same population. Of
the articles describing case-control studies and
retrospective cohorts, only two45,46 mentioned that
genotyping personnel were blinded to outcome
status.
Missing genotype data
For most articles (29/40), on comparison of the
number of participants included in the analyses with
the study sample size, it was apparent there were no
missing genotype data. For the remaining 11
articles,32,33,42–44,53,56,58,60,63,64 only five articles32,56,58,63,64
summarised the extent of missing
data for all the genes and SNPs analysed. None of
these articles described checking whether missing
data were randomly distributed.
Population stratification
One article mentioned undertaking tests for population
stratification;53 no population stratification was
identified. One article used a study design that
ensured that the included patients were from a nondiverse
ethnic group.48 All other studies were at
potential risk from confounding due to population
stratification.
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
Twenty-three articles30,32,34–39,41–43,46-49,53,57,58,60–64
reported testing for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE) for all investigated SNPs, and a further
three25,51,56 tested for HWE for a subset of SNPs.
The remaining 14 articles reported no testing for
HWE.

Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA).24 NAT2 ¼ N-acetyltransferase 2.
Mode of inheritance
Nineteen articles made a specific assumption regarding
the underlying mode of inheri -
tance.25,29,31,34,35,40,43,44,48,50,53,55–57,59–61,63,64 Of
these, only two provided justification;29,60 for the
remaining 17 articles, there was a risk of selective
reporting under different modes of inheritance. Two
articles42,58 applied models assuming different modes
of inheritance to the genotype data, although only
one of these articles42 adjusted these analyses for
multiplicity of testing.
Choice and definition of outcomes
There was large variation in the definition of
hepatotoxicity (Appendix Table A.4). Of the 37
articles reporting hepatotoxicity data, one did not
provide a definition,62 one provided a vague definition,
30 and the remaining 35 articles provided 31
different definitions. Definitions of other toxicity
outcomes were generally not sufficiently detailed
(Appendix Table A.5).
Nine articles did not provide justification for the
choice of outcomes, but outcomes were in line with
the main study aim as conveyed in the Introduction
section of the article.27,32,38,49,50,52,56,57,63 The remaining
articles all provided justification for the
choice of outcomes. There was therefore no evidence
to suggest that selective reporting of outcomes had
occurred.
Treatment adherence
Six articles31,32,43,45,50,57 mentioned assessing treatment
adherence. One article48 reported that treatment
was administered under DOTS; it was therefore
not necessary to measure adherence. Of the six
articles that reported assessing adherence, one did
not report adjusting the analyses for adherence.50 It
was not necessary to adjust for adherence in the
analyses of two articles because patients were
reported to have good treatment adherence.31,32
Association between NAT2 variants and antituberculosis
drug-related toxicity
NAT2 acetylator status and hepatotoxicity
A forest plot displaying the results of the primary
analysis is given in Figure 2. Slow/intermediate
acetylators were significantly more likely to experience
hepatotoxicity than rapid acetylators (OR 1.59,
95%CI 1.26–2.01). No heterogeneity was detected in
this analysis (I2 ¼ 0%).
Results of the sensitivity analyses are provided in
Appendix Figures A.1–A.3. Results from the pairwise
comparisons suggested that slow acetylators
were significantly more likely to experience hepatotoxicity
than rapid acetylators (OR 3.68, 95%CI
2.23–6.09, I2 ¼ 60.0%), but there were no significant
differences between intermediate and rapid
acetylators (OR 1.12, 95%CI 0.87–1.45, I2 ¼ 0%).
The sensitivity analysis that compared slow acetylators
with rapid/intermediate acetylators suggested
that slow acetylator status significantly increased the
risk of hepatotoxicity (OR 3.12, 95%CI 2.45–3.97,
I2 ¼ 59.0%).
Moderate heterogeneity was observed in the
sensitivity analyses of slow vs. rapid acetylator status,
and slow vs. rapid/intermediate acetylator status.
Such moderate heterogeneity may have been due to
the variable distribution of genotypes in different
geographic areas.
The funnel plot for the primary analysis (Appendix
Figure A.4) provided no evidence of publication bias.
NAT2 SNPs and hepatotoxicity
The included studies reported data for 12 NAT2
SNPs. A summary of all data for the association
between NAT2 SNPs and hepatotoxicity is provided
in Table 1. There were sufficient data to perform
meta-analyses for six SNPs. Forest plots showing the
results of these meta-analyses are provided in Figure
2. The four main findings from these meta-analyses
are shown below.
1 For 590G-A and 857G-A, both heterozygous
genotype and homozygous mutant-type significantly
increased hepatotoxicity risk compared
with homozygous wt (590G-A: GA vs. GG, OR
1.30, 95%CI 1.06–1.59, I2¼0%; AA vs. GG, OR
2.05, 95%CI 1.24–3.40, I2¼47.7%; 857G-A: GA
vs. GG, OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.03–1.64, I2 ¼ 0.9%;
AA vs. GG, OR 1.99, 95%CI 1.02–3.91, I2 ¼
11.3%).
2 For 282C-T, homozygous mutant-type significantly
increased hepatotoxicity risk compared with homozygous
wt (OR 3.95, 95%CI 2.21–7.05, I2 ¼
5.5%); however, no significant difference was
observed for heterozygous genotype compared
with homozygous wt (OR 1.27, 95%CI 0.80–
2.02, I2 ¼ 0%).
3 For 481C-T, heterozygous genotype significantly
increased hepatotoxicity risk compared with homozygous
wt (OR 1.48, 95%CI 1.12–1.97, I2 ¼
0%); however, no significant difference was observed
for homozygous mutant-type compared
with homozygous wt (OR 1.91, 95%CI 0.93–
3.92, I2 ¼ 34.1%). The lack of statistical significance
for the latter comparison may have been
caused by the relatively small number of homozygous
mutant-type patients (n ¼ 162) among the
patients contributing data to this analysis (n ¼
3604)
4 For 341T-C and 803A-G, no significant differences
were observed for either pairwise comparison
(341T-C: TC vs. TT, OR 1.15, 95%CI 0.72–1.82,
I2¼0%; CC vs. TT, OR 1.54, 95%CI 0.58–4.04, I2
¼0%; 803A-G: AG vs. AA, OR 1.14, 95%CI 0.67–
1.96, I2¼0%; GG vs. AA, OR 1.90, 95%CI 0.66–
5.52, I2 ¼ 0%).
Results were relatively homogeneous between
studies for most comparisons, except for the comparison
between homozygous mutant-type and homozygous
wt for the 590G-A SNP (I2¼47.7%). This
moderate heterogeneity may have been due to the
variable distribution of genotypes in different geographic
areas (Table 1; Appendix Figure A.5).
NAT2 variants and other toxicity outcomes
A summary of all data for the association between
NAT2 variants and toxicity outcomes (other than
hepatotoxicity) is provided in Table 2. Each reported
result is based on data from a single study because
Figure 2 Slow/intermediate vs. rapid acetylator status for the outcome of hepatotoxicity. * Conducted in LTBI populations.
†Caucasian: 38 (43%), Hispanic: 8 (9%), African: 22 (25%), South American: 15 (17%), Asian: 5 (6%), Middle Eastern: 1 (1%).

there were no comparisons where more than one
study provided data (Table 2).
For peripheral neuropathy, no significant associations
were reported for either of the pairwise
comparisons conducted for acetylator status, 191GA
or 341T-C. Similarly, for skin rash and eosinophilia,
the pairwise comparisons for acetylator status
demonstrated no significant effects. None of the SNPs
investigated by Kim et al. had a significant effect on
anti-tuberculosis drug-induced maculopapular eruption.
43 Slow acetylators were significantly more likely
to experience adverse drug-induced hepatotoxicity
outcomes (definition unclear; OR 3.31, 95%CI 1.03–
10.62), and ADRs (defined as at least one of the
following: gastric, joint, neuromuscular or skin
reactions, hepatotoxicity; OR 3.20, 95%CI 1.31–
7.80) compared with rapid or intermediate acetylators.
However, slow acetylator status was not found
to increase the risk of gastrointestinal ADRs.
DISCUSSION
There is substantial evidence for the association
between NAT2 variants and anti-tuberculosis drugrelated
toxicity outcomes, as previously identified
and as our systematic review confirmed. However, we
established that performing robust synthesis of this
evidence is challenging due to the variability between
studies in terms of how participants are classified
according to genotype; choice and definition of
outcomes and variants to investigate; ethnicity of
participants; and methodological quality. In conducting
our review, we carefully considered these challenges,
stratifying meta-analyses by genetic variants,
genotype contrasts and outcomes. We also stratified
further by the country where the study was conducted
as a proxy for ethnicity, which has not been widely
reported. We supplemented our data synthesis with a
rigorous assessment of the methodological quality of
included studies.
Meta-analyses
Where possible, meta-analyses were undertaken to
improve the power to estimate genetic effects. We
found that slow/intermediate acetylators were significantly
more likely to experience hepatotoxicity than
rapid acetylators. This result is consistent with the
findings of several meta-analyses,12–15 but not consistent
with the meta-analysis reported by Sun et al.,6
who did not identify a significant association between
slow acetylator status and hepatotoxicity. However,
the search date for Sun et al.6 (May 2007) is several
years earlier than the search dates for the other metaanalyses,
and many relevant studies have been
published in recent years. As more studies are
published, the power to detect a statistically significant
association increases.
Meta-analyses on individual SNPs of the NAT2
gene have not been published, so our results add to
the existing knowledge of the association between
NAT2 variants and hepatotoxicity.
INH remains an essential drug in the treatment of
active TB and is the mainstay of chemoprophylaxis in
latent tuberculous infection (LTBI), an intervention
that is being rapidly expanded in recent strategies to
eliminate TB as a public health problem. The global
use of INH will therefore greatly increase worldwide
in the coming decade. While transaminase testing is a
readily available biomarker of possible ATDH,
baseline values have modest predictive value and
routine monitoring is not generally recommended.
Where slow acetylator status is common, pharmacogenetic
testing could make a clinically useful contribution
to risk stratification for ATDH. However, the
need for testing of a relatively large panel of SNPs and
the current lack of a clear substitute to INH for LTBI
chemoprophylaxis mean that such a strategy may not
be cost-effective or feasible. Studies investigating the
cost-effectiveness and/or feasibility of such a strategy
would be beneficial. Nevertheless, based on the
nearly three-fold increased risk of ATDH in slow
acetylators observed in this review, pharmacogenetic
epidemiology should certainly be a factor in national
policymaking on the need for transaminase monitoring
during treatment of active TB and LTBI locally.
Quality assessment
The quality of included studies varied, with some areas
of concern. Most studies were significantly smaller
than typically required to provide sufficient power,20
and the reader was left unaware of the likelihood of
false-negatives in all studies due to the lack of reported
a priori power calculations. The fact that no studies
described checking that missing data were missing at
random is also a concern; missing genotype data are
unlikely to be missing at random because heterozygotes
are notoriously more difficult to call than
homozygotes.20 Few studies reported testing of
HWE, which can highlight genotyping errors, population
stratification and other problems.20 Furthermore,
in studies that did not adjust for treatment
adherence, the proportion of variability explained by
genetic variants may have been underestimated.20
As the quality assessment was qualitative rather
than quantitative, it was not possible to exclude
studies from meta-analyses based on a single summary
score. Although we identified issues of concern
relating to some of the quality criteria, we did not
identify any studies that were thought to be of
particularly poor quality overall, so we did not deem
it necessary to exclude any single study in sensitivity
analyses.
Limitations
Most included studies did not report the ethnic
background of participants. We therefore performed

analyses stratified by the country in which the study
was conducted as a proxy variable for ethnicity. It is
clear that this approach is not ideal as the population
of any given country is often ethnically diverse.
However, stratifying by country was deemed the most
suitable approach in the absence of definitive
information on ethnicity.
An additional challenge was identifying distinct
patient cohorts from the included articles. If multiple
articles report data for the same patient cohort, data
for this patient cohort must only be included in metaanalysis
once, otherwise a unit-of-analysis error
occurs.18 We found that it was often not possible to
determine from the articles alone whether the patient
cohorts were identical. We contacted several study
authors for clarification. For two articles,51,68 we did
not receive a response and, consequently, data from
the older article68 were excluded from a metaanalysis
to which both articles contributed data. If
the two articles reported data for two distinct
cohorts, then information would have been lost by
excluding one article. Furthermore, there may have
been cases of multiple articles reporting outcomes for
the same cohorts that we did not identify; if this was
the case, some patients may have been doublecounted
in the meta-analyses.
There was considerable variability in the definitions
of hepatotoxicity in the included studies, which
introduced heterogeneity into the meta-analyses.
Jorgensen et al.71 and Contopoulos-Ioannidis et
al.72 made similar observations about the variability
of definitions of outcomes across pharmacogenetics
studies. If outcome definitions were more consistent
between pharmacogenetic studies, the amount of
heterogeneity observed in meta-analyses would have
been reduced.
Finally, an important limitation of the systematic
review was a lack of evidence from studies conducted

in Africa. There is a great deal of NAT2 diversity
across Africa,73 where TB is endemic, but there has
been little mapping of pharmacogenomic polymorphisms
in African populations. Only four studies
included in this review were conducted in Africa. The
vast majority of evidence included in this review is
therefore not representative of the global population
most affected by TB.
Recommendations for authors of pharmacogenetic
studies
We made several recommendations regarding the
reporting of future pharmacogenetic studies to
facilitate the conduct of high-quality systematic
reviews and meta-analyses, and thus improve the
power to detect genetic associations.
1 Report the number of patients in each genotype
group;
2 Report outcomes for each genotype group separately
(i.e., number of events for dichotomous
outcomes, and mean and standard deviation values
for continuous outcomes);
3 Report the rs number of each genotyped SNP;
4 Report the ethnicity of included patients;
5 If a study includes more than one ethnic group,
provide the summary data specified in 1) and 2) per
ethnic group;
6 Provide the reference to the published protocol;
7 Provide information on patient cohort overlap;
8 Report full details of all variants and outcomes
investigated, and of all analyses undertaken;
9 Consensus should be reached between experts in
specific areas of research on the definitions of
outcomes that are commonly reported in pharmacogenetic
studies of a particular treatment.
We also recommend that articles adhere to the
criteria of the quality assessment tool20 as improvement
in the methodological quality of studies
included in meta-analyses would in turn improve
the strength of the evidence synthesised in metaanalyses.
Furthermore, we recommend that STREGA
reporting guidelines are referred to, which provide
guidance on the reporting of genetic association
studies in general.74
CONCLUSION
This review showed that slow/intermediate acetylators
were significantly more likely to experience
hepatotoxicity than rapid acetylators. Therefore,
pharmacogenetic testing may be useful in clinical
practice in terms of risk stratification for ATDH
during treatment of TB. However, more studies are
needed to overcome the reported methodological
limitations and to assess if this strategy might be
feasible and cost-effective.
