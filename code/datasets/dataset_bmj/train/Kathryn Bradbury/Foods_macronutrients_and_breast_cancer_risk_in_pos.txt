Foods, macronutrients and breast cancer risk in
postmenopausal women: a large UK cohort
Abstract
Background: The role of diet in breast cancer aetiology is unclear; recent studies have
suggested associations may differ by estrogen receptor status.
Methods: Baseline diet was assessed in 2000–04 using a validated questionnaire in 691 571
postmenopausal UK women without previous cancer, who had not changed their diet recently. They were followed by record linkage to national cancer and death databases. Cox
regression yielded adjusted relative risks for breast cancer for 10 food items and eight macronutrients, subdivided mostly into five categories of baseline intake. Trends in risk across
the baseline categories were calculated, assigning re-measured intakes to allow for measurement error and changes in intake over time; P-values allowed for multiple testing.
Results: Women aged 59.9 (standard deviation (SD 4.9)) years at baseline were followed
for 12 (SD 3) years; 29 005 were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Alcohol intake
had the strongest association with breast cancer incidence: relative risk (RR) 1.08 [99%
confidence interval (CI) 1.05–1.11] per 10 g/day higher intake, P ¼ 5.8  1014. There were
inverse associations with fruit: RR 0.94 (99% CI 0.92–0.97) per 100 g/day higher intake,
P ¼ 1.1  106
, and dietary fibre: RR 0.91 (99% CI 0.87–0.96) per 5 g/day increase,
P ¼ 1.1  104
. Fruit and fibre intakes were correlated (q ¼ 0.62) and were greater among
women who were not overweight, so residual confounding cannot be excluded. There
was no heterogeneity for any association by estrogen receptor status.
Conclusions: By far the strongest association was between alcohol intake and an increased risk of breast cancer. Of the other 17 intakes examined, higher intakes of fruit
and fibre were associated with lower risks of breast cancer, but it is unclear whether or
not these associations are causal.
Introduction
Breast cancer incidence is generally greater in high-income
than low-income countries.1,2 Much of this variation is
due to reproductive factors such as parity and breastfeeding, together with variations in screening and diagnosis,2,3
but other risk factors might be involved. Many studies
have explored the possible role of diet, with the main hypotheses being that risk may be increased by high intakes
of alcohol, fat, meat and dairy products, and that risk may
be decreased by high intakes of fibre, fruits and vegetables.4 There is now convincing evidence that alcohol
increases the risk of breast cancer.5 A recent systematic
review of prospective studies concluded that there was no
definite evidence that any other dietary factors were associated with the risk of developing breast cancer, although
there was limited evidence that relatively high intakes of
vegetables might decrease the risk of estrogen receptornegative (ER-ve) breast cancer.6 Another recent review
concluded that high intakes of red and processed meat
intake may be risk factors for breast cancer.7
We report here results from an analysis of the relation
between intakes of a wide range of foods and macronutrients and breast cancer incidence among postmenopausal
women in the Million Women Study, a large prospective
study in the UK. To cover the most prominent hypotheses
for effects of diet on breast cancer risk,4 we examined risk
in relation to 18 dietary items and macronutrients (meat
type and quantity, fish, milk, cheese, yogurt, eggs, fruit,
vegetables, alcohol, energy, percentage of energy from
protein, dairy protein, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, free sugars and dietary fibre). Associations were examined overall for any invasive breast cancer, and
separately by ER status.
Methods
Study population
Participants in the Million Women Study were recruited
from women invited to the National Health Service (NHS)
Breast Screening Programme in England and Scotland between 1996 and 2001. A total of 1.3 million women aged
56 years [standard deviation (SD) 6] on average joined the
study by completing the recruitment questionnaire, which
asked about social, demographic and lifestyle factors.
Postal re-surveys have been done every 3–5 years and
online questionnaires about dietary intake have been
administered since 2010. The study was approved by
the Oxford and Anglia Multi-Centre Research Ethics
Committee, and all women gave written consent. Further
details are on the study website.8,9
Assessment of diet
An average of 3.3 years after recruitment, women were
sent a questionnaire which updated information collected
at recruitment and collected new information on diet. This
3-year re-survey, which asked for the first time about
dietary intakes, was completed in 2000–04 and is the baseline for the analyses reported here. Participants were asked
about their usual diet during a typical week, including
about 130 quantitative or semi-quantitative questions (see:
http://www.millionwomenstudy.org/files/mws-web2.pdf).
Nutrient intakes were calculated by multiplying the frequency of consumption of each food by the specified portion size and the nutrient composition of that item. The
short-term repeatability of most of the diet questions was
good, and in comparison with intakes of nine macronutrients estimated from 7-day food diaries (with portion
sizes weighed or assessed by comparison with photographs), the median energy-adjusted correlation coefficient
was 0.55 (range from 0.27 for polyunsaturated fat to 0.75
for alcohol).10
For these analyses we categorized reported intakes at
baseline into five groups except for fish, where three categories were used: no fish; any fatty fish (salmon, sardines,
kippers/herring, trout, and mackerel]; and non-fatty fish
only [tuna, cod/haddock, ‘fish & chips’ and other seafood).
For meat, the five categories were of the type of meat
consumed: never ate meat; ate poultry but no red meat
Key Messages
• In this large prospective study, we systematically examined associations of 10 foods and eight macronutrients with
breast cancer risk, overall and by estrogen receptor status.
• The strongest finding was a positive association of alcohol consumption with breast cancer risk, in line with previous
evidence.
• None of the 17 other foods and macronutrients examined was strongly associated with breast cancer risk; both fruit and
fibre intakes, which are correlated, showed inverse associations with risk, but it is unclear if these associations are causal.
• For none of the dietary items examined was there evidence of heterogeneity by estrogen receptor status.

(with red meat comprising beef, lamb, pork, beefburger/
hamburger, kidney, and liver/pate´); consumers of red meat
but no processed meat; consumers of red meat and at least
one type of processed meat (bacon, ham or sausages); and
consumers of red meat and at least two types of processed
meat. For other foods the categories were selected to provide substantial numbers in each of the five groups, while
respecting the integer nature of some of the data (e.g. items
of fruit consumed per day). Vegetables comprised cooked
vegetables (except potatoes) and salad items/raw vegetables; and fruit comprised fresh fruit, dried fruit and stewed
or tinned fruit. For the eight macronutrients studied here,
the cut-points for the five groups were quintiles of intake.
In supplementary analyses we examined breast cancer risk:
by types of fruit and sources of fibre (for sources of dietary
fibre, the mean intakes were from the baseline questionnaire because the coding of food subgroups and composite
foods was not directly comparable to that in the 24-h dietary assessment data); by intakes of alcohol, stratified by
intakes of fruit and fibre; and by intakes of soya foods and
types of vegetables.
Repeat measures of intake in each baseline category
were derived from a web-based 24-h dietary assessment
tool, the Oxford WebQ,11 completed by 19 478 women on
average 10 years after baseline and before the end of follow-up.
Ascertainment of breast cancer
Participants were followed by record linkage to the UK
NHS databases on cancer registrations and deaths.
Data for England were provided by NHS Digital and the
Office for National Statistics, and for Scotland by the
Information Services Division, NHS Scotland. Information
on estrogen receptor (ER) status of the incident breast
tumours was provided by Public Health England/National
Cancer Registration and Analysis Service; this information
is incomplete, particularly during the early years of followup. Overall 1% (n ¼ 7647) of the cohort has been lost to
follow-up. and individuals contributed person-years until
they were lost. Diagnoses were coded to the International
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The
endpoint for this study was incident invasive breast cancer
(ICD-10 C50).
Statistical analysis
The dietary factors examined were consumption of 10
food groups including alcohol, and eight macronutrients or
subtypes of macronutrients. Associations between intakes
of food groups and macronutrients were examined by
calculating Spearman non-parametric correlation coefficients. For analyses of relative risk of breast cancer, women
were generally divided into five baseline categories of food
or nutrient intake. For estimating trends in risk, the food
and nutrient intakes assigned to each baseline category
were the means in each baseline category re-measured in
the 24-h dietary recall (for women with more than one
24-h dietary recall, data were used just from the first). This
non-parametric approach reduces the impact of regression
dilution bias and other forms of measurement error.12
Woman-years were calculated from the date the baseline dietary questionnaire was completed up to whichever
came first: diagnosis of cancer, emigration, death, loss to
follow-up or the last date when cancer incidence data were
complete. The last date of follow-up was 31 December
2014. Cox regression models with time in study as the underlying time variable were used to estimate rate ratios
(RRs) and 99% confidence intervals (99% CIs) of breast
cancer by dietary factors. Analyses were stratified by year
of birth, region of residence (10 geographical regions in
England, and Scotland) and calendar year of completion of
the dietary questionnaire, and adjusted for dietary energy
intake (fifths), socioeconomic group (fifths, based on the
Townsend score13), body mass index (<25, 25–29.9,
30 kg/m2
), height (<160, 160–164.9, 165 cm), alcohol
consumption (except for the analysis of alcohol and risk;
none, 1–2, 3–6, 7–14, 15 drinks per week), smoking
(never, past, current <15, current 15 cigarettes per day),
age at menarche (11, 12–13, 14–15, 16 years), strenuous exercise (none, 1 per week, >1 per week), parity and
age at first birth (parity 0, 1–2, 3 cross-classified by age
at first birth <25, 25–29, 30 years), highest education
(none, technical, secondary, tertiary) and ever use of hormonal therapy for menopause (no, yes). The non-dietary
data were from the 3-year re-survey, except for socioeconomic group, strenuous exercise and height, which were
from the recruitment questionnaire. To ensure that the
same women were being compared in all analyses, the
small number with a missing value for each particular variable were assigned to a separate category for that variable.
In analyses of factors with more than two categories,
RRs were treated as floating absolute risks, allowing estimation of group-specific confidence intervals for all categories including the reference group.14 This method allows
any two exposure groups to be compared. Most dietary
variables considered here have no natural baseline category, so the middle category was used as the reference
group. For trends in breast cancer risk per specified increment in dietary intake, conventional CIs are used (for alcohol, the estimates of linear trend were in drinkers only,
because non-drinkers may have different characteristics).

Heterogeneity in the associations between women with
ERþve and ER-ve breast cancer was assessed with likelihood ratio tests calculated from case-only models in which
the outcome was defined as ERþ or ER- disease.
We examined trends in breast cancer risk overall and
subdivided by ER status. Many tests for trend and
hundreds of relative risks and confidence intervals are presented here, and there is no agreed convention for dealing
with this extent of multiple testing. When examining
trends in breast cancer risk for the 18 dietary items examined, we used the magnitudes of v2 statistics to assess the
strengths of associations and applied a Bonferroni correction to nominal P-values by multiplying the values by 18.
Some allowance for the hundreds of individual RR estimates in the tables and plots was made by quoting their
99% confidence intervals. In supplementary analyses, we
examined risk by subtypes of fruit and sources of fibre, by
intakes of alcohol stratified by intakes of fruit and
fibre (because it has been suggested that high intakes of
dietary fibre may attenuate the increase in risk caused by
alcohol15) and by intakes of soya foods and types of vegetables. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata
statistical software, release 15.1 (StataCorp., College
Station, TX).
Results
The baseline diet questionnaire was completed by 861 918
women. We excluded 47 212 with previous cancer (other
than non-melanoma skin cancer) at baseline and 123 099
who reported at baseline that they had changed their diet
in the previous 5 years due to illness. Women with energy
intakes <2100 kJ/day (d) (500 kcal/d) or more than
14 700 kJ/d (3500 kcal/d) were excluded. After these exclusions, 691 571 women were eligible for these analyses.
Table 1 shows their characteristics and average intakes of
food groups, alcohol and macronutrients at baseline, together with details of follow-up. Table 2 shows the intakes
of foods, alcohol and macronutrients in relation to nondietary characteristics; intakes of alcohol, fruit and fibre
all tended to be greater among women who were taller,
were not overweight or obese, had fewer children and were
of higher socioeconomic status. Compared with women
reporting being in excellent or good health, women in fair
or poor health reported markedly lower intakes of fruit,
vegetables, alcohol and dietary fibre (Table S1, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). Table S2, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online, shows the correlations
between the food groups, alcohol and macronutrients at
baseline (the latter expressed as percentage of energy intake), and Table S3, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online, shows the mean intakes estimated from 24-h
dietary assessments 10 years after baseline, which confirm
the rankings at baseline.
After 12 (SD 3) years of follow-up, 29 005 women were
diagnosed with incident invasive breast cancer, among
whom information on ER status was available for 10 838
ERþve and 1658 ER-ve breast cancers. Figure 1 shows the
RRs for breast cancer in relation to the intakes of eight
food items. There was a positive association with alcohol,
with an RR of 1.08 (99% CI 1.05–1.11, X1
2 for
trend ¼ 62.1; P ¼ 5.8  1014) per 10 g/d higher intake
(trend in drinkers only). There was also an inverse association of risk with fruit intake, with a RR of 0.94 (99% CI
0.92–0.97, X1
2 for trend ¼ 29.4; P¼ 1.1 106
) per 100 g/d
higher intake (further results for Figure 1 are in Table S4,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online). Figure 2
shows the associations of intakes of these seven food
groups and alcohol separately for ERþve and ER-ve breast
cancer; there was no significant heterogeneity in associations by ER status (Table S4, available as Supplementary

data at IJE online). Not all women had information available on ER status, but findings in these women did not differ materially from those with available information
(results not shown). Breast cancer risk was not associated
with the types of meat and fish consumed (Table 3). Breast
cancer risk was inversely associated with intake of fresh
fruit [RR of 0.95 (99% CI 0.92–0.98) per 100 g/d higher
intake, X1
2 for trend ¼ 19.5] and dried fruit [RR of 0.95
(99% CI 0.90–1.00) per 10 g/d higher intake, X1
2 for
trend ¼ 7.10], but not with tinned/stewed fruit or fruit
juice (Table S5, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). After allowing for multiple testing, breast cancer risk
was not associated with consumption of soya foods or
types of vegetables (Tables S6 and S7, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Figure 3 shows RRs for breast cancer in relation to
intakes of eight macronutrients. There was an inverse association of risk with intake of dietary fibre, with RR¼ 0.91
(99% CI 0.87–0.96, X1
2 for trend ¼ 20.5; P¼ 1.1 104
)
per 5 g/d higher intake (detailed results for Figure 3 are in
Table S8, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Figure 4 shows the associations of intake of these eight macronutrients with risk of ERþve and ER-ve breast cancer;
there was no heterogeneity in associations by ER status
(Table S8, available as Supplementary data at IJE online); in
women without information on ER status, results were similar (results not shown). Breast cancer risk was inversely associated with the intake of fibre from fruit but not from
other sources (Table S9, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online).
Associations of fruit and fibre intake with breast cancer
risk were found separately at five levels of alcohol consumption, and associations of alcohol intake with breast
cancer risk were similar at three levels of intake of fruit
and at five levels of intake of dietary fibre (Table S10,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Discussion
We report the results from systematic analyses in a large prospective study of the associations between intakes of 18 dietary factors and the incidence of breast cancer. The positive
association with alcohol consumption (P¼ 5.8 1014) is
expected, given that alcohol is an established cause of breast
cancer.5 The other statistically significant associations, inverse relationships with fruit and dietary fibre intakes, were
considerably weaker than for alcohol (P¼ 1.1 106 and
1.1 104
, respectively, after correction for multiple testing).
Intakes of fruit and dietary fibre were strongly correlated
with each other (correlation coefficient 0.62), therefore the
associations of these two dietary items with breast cancer
risk are not independent. In a recent meta-analysis,6 the
intakes of fruit and dietary fibre were also both associated
with a small reduction in breast cancer risk; whereas these
small associations might be causal, it is also possible that
they are largely or wholly due to residual confounding.

In our data, examination of whether there was heterogeneity in dietary associations between ERþve and ER-ve
breast cancers showed no clear evidence for such heterogeneity. Previous studies found no heterogeneity by ER status
in the associations of alcohol16 or fruit6,17–19 with breast
cancer risk, similar to our results. Previous studies suggested that vegetable intakes were inversely associated
with risk for ER-ve but not ERþve breast cancer6,16,19; but
we found no significant association of breast cancer risk
with intake of vegetables, and no heterogeneity by ER status. For dietary fibre, results by ER status from previous
studies are inconsistent.20–24 Overall, the currently available evidence shows no consistent differences in associations of dietary factors with breast cancer risk by ER
status, but more data are required, especially for ER-ve
disease.
Chhim et al.15 suggested that a high intake of dietary
fibre might attenuate the adverse effect of alcohol on

age as the underlying time variable and adjusted for socioeconomic status, body mass index, height, smoking, current use of hormonal therapy for

squares (with their 99% confidence intervals as lines), each with area inversely proportional to the variance of the log RR, thereby indicating the
amount of statistical information for that particular RR.

breast cancer risk, and a subsequent examination of this
hypothesis in the EPIC study showed some evidence of
an interaction between the associations of alcohol and
fibre with risk, with a higher relative risk for breast
cancer associated with alcohol in women with a low
fibre intake25; however, our results do not support this
hypothesis.
With 29 000 incident breast cancers in a cohort of almost 700 000 women, this is as far as we are aware the
largest single prospective study of diet and breast cancer
risk. Nutritional epidemiology may be subject to selective
reporting biases,26 and therefore we used a systematic approach, assessing the relationships of breast cancer risk
with 18 pre-specified dietary factors and allowing for multiple testing in the interpretation of the findings. Other
strengths of this study include the virtually complete
follow-up for cancer over 12 years, the comprehensive assessment of confounders and the use of re-measured

intakes to allow for changes in diet over time and measurement error. Diet at baseline was assessed with a questionnaire which has been validated with reference to 7-day
food diaries11 and shown to predict risks of other conditions.27 Tests for trend across groups categorised by their
baseline intakes of foods and nutrients mean re-measured
intakes for each category from 24-h dietary assessments a
decade later, to provide estimates of usual dietary intake
within each baseline category.11,12 The re-measured dietary intakes confirmed the rankings of categories of intake
at baseline, generally with substantial narrowing in the
ranges of intakes across categories, as would be expected
from regression to the mean due to measurement error and
changes over time.28
The study has some limitations. Like other observational studies, the results may be influenced by residual
confounding and reverse causation. Also, for some dietary
factors in this population, such as for energy from protein,
dairy protein and fat, the range of re-measured intakes between the lowest and highest intakes at baseline was so

as the underlying time variable and adjusted for socioeconomic status, body mass index, height, smoking, current use of hormonal therapy for menopause, dietary energy intake and alcohol consumption. Relative risks (RRs) are represented by squares (with their 99% confidence intervals as lines),
each with area inversely proportional to the variance of the log RR, thereby indicating the amount of statistical information for that particular RR.

narrow that it limits the power to detect associations with
these factors. The study was also conducted among predominantly White women in the UK.
This study showed a strong positive association of
alcohol consumption with breast cancer risk, in line with
previous studies. None of the other foods and nutrients
examined was strongly associated with breast cancer
risk; both fruit and fibre showed modest inverse associations with risk, but it is unclear if these associations are
causal.
