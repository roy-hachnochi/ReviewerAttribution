Background
This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2006.
Otitis media with effusion (OME) or ’glue ear’ is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or
infection. It is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of ’grommets’. Potential
treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. Autoinflation devices have been proposed as a
simple mechanical means of improving ’glue ear’.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of autoinflation compared with no treatment in children and adults with otitis media with effusion.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and
additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 12 April 2013.
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials that compared any form of autoinflation to no autoinflation in individuals with ’glue ear’.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included studies.
Main results
Eight studies, with a total of 702 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the studies were predominantly assessed as being at
low or unclear risk of bias; unclear risk was mainly due lack of information. There was no evidence of selective reporting.
Pooled estimates favoured the intervention, but did not show a significant effect on tympanometry (type C2 and B) at less than
one month, nor at more than one month. Similarly, there were no significant changes for discrete pure-tone audiometry and non-
discrete audiometry. Pooled estimates favoured, but not significantly, the intervention for the composite measure of tympanogram or
audiometry at less than one month; at more than one month the result became significant (RRI 1.74, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.50). Subgroup
analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device under one month (RRI 7.07, 95% CI 3.70
to 13.51) and over one month (RRI 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.04).
None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions.
Authors’ conclusions
All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow-up. However, because of the low cost and absence
of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. Primary
care could prove a beneficial place to evaluate such interventions and there is ongoing research in this area. Further research should
also consider the duration of treatment, the long-term impact on developmental outcomes in children and additional quality of life
outcome measures for children and families.

Autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (glue ear)
Otitis media with effusion (OME) or ’glue ear’ is very common in children and the hearing loss and discomfort, especially where
the effusion is bilateral and long-lasting, may lead to problems with language, development and behaviour. There are a number of
treatment options including steroids, antibiotics, decongestants, antihistamines and surgery (the insertion of grommets (ventilation
tubes)). Grommet insertion is one of the commonest operations of childhood. The best treatment strategy remains controversial,
however, as glue ear often resolves spontaneously within a few months.
Autoinflation is a technique whereby the Eustachian tube (the tube that connects the middle ear and the back of the nose) is reopened
by raising pressure in the nose. This can be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose, blowing up a balloon through
each nostril or using an anaesthetic mask. The aim is to introduce air into the middle ear, via the Eustachian tube, equalising the
pressures and allowing better drainage of the fluid.
This review included eight randomised controlled trials of autoinflation for glue ear. All of the studies were small, of limited treatment
duration and had short follow-up.
The reviewauthors used a combined outcomemeasurewhich included any outcome signifying improvement (as defined in the individual
studies) and measured outcomes at the time points ’up to one month’ and ’more than one month’. Improvement was demonstrated
only in ’more than one month’ analyses. Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer
device at both under one month and over one month. None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of
side effects between interventions.
The authors conclude that the evidence for the use of autoinflation in the short term appears favourable. Given the small number of
studies and the lack of long-term follow-up, the long-term effects associated with the use of these devices cannot be determined.
B A C K G R O U N D
This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The
Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2006.
Otitismedia with effusion (OME) or ’glue ear’ is an accumulation
of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation
or infection. It is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in
childhood (Rovers 1999). It is common in children between the
ages of one and three years and in seasons when there is a high incidence
of the common cold, with a prevalence of OME between
10% and 30%. The cumulative incidence to the age of four years
is 80% (Zielhuis 1990) and at age seven the prevalence is still 3%
to 8% (Fiellau 1977; Fiellau 1983; Lous 1981; Teele 1989). The
aetiology of ’glue ear’ is uncertain, but low-grade infection, poor
Eustachian tube function and adenoidal infection or hypertrophy
have all been implicated (Bluestone 1988). Otitis media with effusion
often resolves spontaneously within a few months (Fiellau
1979).
Otitismedia with effusion (OME)may be associated with ear ache
(otalgia), infection and/or hearing loss.Hearing lossmay be significant
(20 dB to 30 dB), particularly when the disorder is bilateral
and has lasted for more than a month (Fiellau 1983). However,
some children have nearly normal hearing despite the presence of
fluid within the middle ear. The hearing loss and discomfort may
have linguistic, developmental, behavioural and other social consequences,
particularly if the effusion is bilateral and of long duration
(Lous 1995). Some studies have shown that children with
unilateral or bilateral otitismedia with effusion have balance problems
(Golz 1998; Grace 1990).
For its diagnosis, tympanometry in combination with otomicroscopy
or pneumatic otoscopy is the recommended technique
(Bluestone 1988). Tympanometry is performed with a handheld
device inserted in the ear canal andmeasures the eardrumresponses
to the sound and different pressures. Diagnostic tympanometry
results in a flat curve (relative gradient less than 0.1, type B) or in
a curve with amiddle ear pressure between -399 to -200 daPa (C2
curve) (Jerger 1970; Zielhuis 1989) or when mobility of the tympanic
membrane is absent or reduced, or fluid and/or air bubbles
are evident behind the eardrum (Browning 2010). Type A and C1
tympanograms are considered not to represent otitis media with
effusion. The presence of a significant (10 dB) air-bone gap on
pure-tone audiometry correlates well with the presence of fluid in
the middle ear.
Management options
OME usually resolves spontaneously (20% will resolve in one
month and 40% at three months (Fiellau 1979)) and many childrenwill
require no specific treatment.Themost commonmedical
treatment options include the use of decongestants (Griffin 2011),
mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines (Griffin 2011) and antibiotics
(van Zon 2012). Of these options, only steroids have been shown
effective and only for short-term resolution (Simpson 2011). Surgical
treatment is more widely used and better researched, with
options including grommet insertion (Browning 2010), myringotomy
tympanocentesis (surgical incision of the eardrum, with or
without aspiration of fluid from the middle ear cavity) and adenoidectomy
(van den Aardweg 2010). The optimal treatment
strategy remains controversial, with wide international variability
in clinical practice.
’Autoinflation’ refers to the opening of, and forcing of air through,
the Eustachian tube by the raising of intranasal pressure. This may
be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose,
blowing up a balloon through each nostril, use of an anaesthetic
mask or a Politzer device. The aim of these procedures is to introduce
air into the middle ear, via the Eustachian tube, to equilibrate
the pressures. This is most likely to help in ’Eustachian tube
dysfunction’ and has been proposed as a treatment for otitis media
with effusion (Hunt-Williams 1968). This systematic review aims
to assess the effectiveness of autoinflation devices in children and
adults with otitis media with effusion.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials of an autoinflation device
- designed to force air into the middle ear - in children or
adults with clinically diagnosed serous otitis media.
Types of participants
Children and adults with unilateral or bilateral otitis media with
effusion and a clinical diagnosis by primary care physicians or
specialists using tympanometry (type B or C2), either alone or in
combination with simple or pneumatic otoscopy or audiometry.
The type of diagnosis used in each trial is presented in the table
Characteristics of included studies.
Types of interventions
We included trials that studied any form of autoinflation (a technique
to increase intranasal pressure repeatedly either through a
nasal balloon or by other methods) compared to no autoinflation
and which were unconfounded. By unconfounded, we mean
studies where the two groups were treated equally, except for the
provision of the intervention to one group. Other treatments (e.g.
analgesia, decongestants or short courses of antibiotics) were permitted
provided these were provided equally. Autoinflation interventions
were classified into similar groups by an ENT surgeon,
based on the description of the intervention whilst blinded to the
outcomes of the study (see Appendix 1 for a brief description of
the interventions).
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Improvement in tympanogram (to type C1 or A
tympanogram)
• Differences in hearing level on pure-tone audiogram
(average 10 dB improvement over the frequencies 250 Hz to
2000 Hz)
• Improvement measured as a composite of change in
tympanogram and/or audiometry (post hoc)
Secondary outcomes
• Adverse effects of autoinflation
• Presence or absence of fluid in middle ear cavity
Time points of outcome assessment
• Up to and including one month from commencement of
autoinflation
• More than one month from commencement of
autoinflation
We were unable to analyse the following secondary outcomes due
to a lack of trial data:
1. Developmental test results
2. Behavioural test results
3. Language and speech development
4. Quality of life
5. Family function
Search methods for identification of studies
We conducted systematic searches for randomised controlled trials.
There were no language, publication year or publication status
restrictions. The date of the last search was 12 April 2013.
Electronic searches
We searched the following databases fromtheir inception for published,
unpublished and ongoing trials: the Cochrane Ear, Nose
andThroatDisordersGroupTrialsRegister; theCochraneCentral
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library
2013, Issue 3); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; LILACS; KoreaMed;
IndMed; PakMediNet; CAB Abstracts;Web of Science; ISRCTN;
ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP; Google Scholar and Google.
We modelled subject strategies for databases on the search strategy
designed for CENTRAL. Where appropriate, we combined
subject strategies with adaptations of the highly sensitive search
strategy designed by The Cochrane Collaboration for identifying
randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials (as
described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
Version 5.1.0, Box 6.4.b. (Handbook 2011)). Search
strategies for major databases including CENTRAL are provided
in Appendix 2.
Searching other resources
We scanned the reference lists of identified publications for additional
trials and contacted trial authors where necessary. In addition,
we searched PubMed, TRIPdatabase, The Cochrane Library
and Google to retrieve existing systematic reviews relevant to this
systematic review, so that we could scan their reference lists for
additional trials. We searched for conference abstracts using the
Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
The Trials Search Co-ordinator of the Cochrane Ear, Nose and
Throat Disorders Group assessed abstracts of all studies identified
by the initial search and excluded clearly irrelevant studies. One
review author assessed abstracts for relevance and we obtained
full texts for these. Two review authors independently assessed all
full-text articles. Differences in opinion about inclusion of studies
were resolved by discussion with a third review author. The review
authors were not blind to the journal of origin, the authors, the
institutions or the magnitude of results.
Data extraction and management
Two reviewauthors independently extracted study data using standardised
forms. We entered data into RevMan 5 (RevMan 2012)
and a second review author checked the data. Data extracted and
presented included: author, publication year, journal, participants
(numbers, duration of illness, demographics, characteristics of the
disease, etc.), intervention (type of intervention and duration) and
results (outcome measures, effect size, statistical significance, adverse
effects).We contacted trial authors formissing or incomplete
data.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in all
included trials.Differenceswere resolved by discussionwith a third
review author. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane ’Risk
of bias’ tool where types of bias are rated as low, high or unclear.
1. Randomisation/selection bias: selection generation
2. Randomisation/selection bias: allocation concealment
3. Detection bias: blinding of outcome assessment
4. Attrition bias: incomplete outcome data, losses to follow-up
and whether analysis was intention-to-treat
5. Blinding of outcome assessors
6. Selective reporting
7. Other bias: we also used this section to assess whether the
groups were comparable at the start of the study for prognostic
characteristics
We assessed the quality of the studies separately:
1. that the groups were equally provided of care, except for the
treatment; and
2. adherence to study procedure.
Data synthesis
We carried out analysis on the basis of intention-to-treat. Where
possible we combined data to give a summary measure of effect.
When outcome data obtained were binary - recovered or improved
glue ear or audiometry improvement - we used relative risks of
improvement to compare interventions. The data reported in the
trials mainly used ’ears’ as their analysis unit despite using individuals
as randomisation units. To correct for this and to give
adequate weight to the studies we adjusted the outcomes using
the ’design effect’, which takes into consideration the association
found in using both ears from the same individual (Deeks 2005).
We estimated the ’design effects’ fromthe Blanshard data (full data
set provided by author) at one month and three months for participants
with either types B or C2 tympanograms or only type
B tympanograms. Minor differences in correlation between intervention
and control groups (smaller at three months) were found,
but an average was used, as differences could be due to sampling
variation. For participants with type B or C2 tympanograms the
design effect at one month was 1.25, while at three months it was
1.51. For participants with only type B tympanograms the design
effect was 1.3 for both one and three months follow-up.
We used the appropriate design effect (for less than one month or
more than one month by tympanogram type at entry) to obtain
adjusted risk ratios (RR) for all studies that provided data for
the outcome. We calculated and then entered the log(RR) and
the SE(log(RR)) into RevMan 5 (RevMan 2012). As the focus of
the review is on recovery/improvement we emphasise the use of
a positive outcome and refer to the RR obtained as the ’relative
risk of improvement’ or RRI; instead of using the term risk ratio
which is normally associated with a negative outcome (e.g. death).
When data were continuous, we used mean differences to compare
interventions. We used the GIV (generic inverse variance)
method with a random-effects model to pool studies together and
examined heterogeneity using theChi2 test and I2 statistic. Funnel
plots were not used as the number of studies found was too small
for these to provide relevant information. We carried out analyses
using RevMan 5.
Subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses had been planned on the basis of the diagnosis
of otitis media with effusion and the extent of the hearing loss
measured on audiometry. However, insufficient studies were identified
to allow these analyses. We also planned subgroups according
to age (under three years, three to 12 years and over 12 years).
However, we could not identify any papers of sufficient quality
including children aged under three years and only one paper included
children over 12 years (Lesinskas 2003).

Description of studies
Results of the search
From the 2013 update searches, we retrieved a total of 401 references.
Following first-level screening (i.e. removal of duplicates
and clearly irrelevant references) by the Cochrane ENT Group
Trials Search Co-ordinator we were left with 127 references for
further consideration. Following sifting by the authors two more
duplicates were removed and 105 discarded following screening
of titles and abstracts, leaving 20 reports for consideration. Two
were studies which we have included in the updated review (De
Nobili 2008; Ercan 2005). Sixteen further studies were excluded
from the review, with reasons (Costantino 2010; Dalchow 2011;
Ducla-Soares 2007; El Hachem 2012; Hidir 2011; Jumah 2010;
Karahatay 2008; Kawase 2008; Laina 2006; Leach 2008; Pau
2009; Poe 2011; Prabhakar 2007; Shim 2010; Talmon 2010;
Toros 2010). Two were identified as ongoing studies (Tel-Aviv
Med Center 2006; Williamson 2011).
From the original searches (2006 publication of this review), 418
abstracts were obtained from the search, with 62 selected as possibly
relevant.These were screened for relevance and we obtained 24
full-text articles. Of these full-text articles two review authors (JH
and RP) filtered out 16 as duplicates or rejected them for not fulfilling
the inclusion criteria. Two further reports were awaiting assessment
in the original review and remain so (Niebuhr-Jorgensen
1996; Scadding 2002) (see Characteristics of studies awaiting
classification). Limited available information has meant that these
studies cannot yet be excluded from meeting the review criteria.
There have been no published data following on from either of
the abstracts for these studies. Contact with one of the authors has
indicated that one of the studies may be published in the future
(Scadding 2002), whilst the other author has not been contactable
(Niebuhr-Jorgensen 1996). Six studies were included in the original
(2006) version of the review.
It is hoped that the two ongoing studies will be able to contribute
their results to this review in the future. The Tel-AvivMed Center
2006 study commenced in October 2006. The authors confirmed
in 2010 that their results would be released shortly; unfortunately
this has been delayed and a new date has not been announced.
The Williamson 2011 study started in September 2011 and it is
hoped that results will be available during winter of 2013-14. (See
Characteristics of ongoing studies).
A total of eight papers therefore met the eligibility criteria for
inclusion in the current 2012 update of the review (Arick 2005;
Blanshard 1993; Brooker 1992; De Nobili 2008; Ercan 2005;
Fraser 1977; Lesinskas 2003; Stangerup 1992).
Included studies
See Characteristics of included studies table.
Participants
Two trials included only participants with bilateral OME confirmed
by tympanometry (Blanshard 1993; Fraser 1977). Six trials
(Arick 2005; Brooker 1992; De Nobili 2008; Ercan 2005;
Lesinskas 2003; Stangerup 1992) included participants with both
unilateral and bilateral OME. Diagnosis of OME was confirmed
by tympanometry alone in two studies (DeNobili 2008; Stangerup
1992), tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry in one study
(Lesinskas 2003), tympanometry and otoscopy in one study
(Ercan 2005), tympanometry, otoscopy and audiometry in one
study (Brooker 1992) and audiometry and otoscopy in one study
(Arick 2005). Stangerup and Blanshard only included participants
with a diagnosis of bilateral OME of at least three months duration.
The diagnosis of OME by tympanogram varied from study
to study, with some defining types B and C2 as OME (Blanshard
1993; Stangerup 1992)while others only included typeB(Brooker
1992; Ercan 2005).
Seven of the eight trials studied children aged between three
and 16 years (Arick 2005; Blanshard 1993; Brooker 1992; De
Nobili 2008; Ercan 2005; Fraser 1977; Stangerup 1992).One trial
included participants aged between 16 and 75 years (Lesinskas
2003).
Interventions
The included studies used a range of interventions and outcome
measures. Of the eight studies included, three (Blanshard
1993; Ercan 2005; Stangerup 1992) used a classic Otovent®, two
(Brooker 1992; Fraser 1977) used a carnival blower + balloon and
three (Arick 2005; De Nobili 2008; Lesinskas 2003) used Politzer
devices. Seven out of the eight studies used observation without
treatment as their control; the exception was Ercan who maintained
nasal saline irrigation in the control. The duration of the
intervention was variable, with a minimum of 10 days (Lesinskas
2003) to amaximum of seven weeks (Arick 2005). The number of
times per day the autoinflation procedure was designed to be carried
out was relatively consistent: three times per day (Blanshard
1993; Brooker 1992; Ercan 2005; Stangerup 1992) or two times
per day (Arick 2005; Lesinskas 2003). Duration and intensity
of intervention specific to each trial can be obtained from the
Characteristics of included studies table. One study (Fraser 1977)
used a three-factorial design to compare autoinflation, ephedrine
drops andDimotapp® elixir to treatOME. In one study (Lesinskas
2003) the intervention was carried out by a physician, not the
patient or a carer.
Outcomes and follow-up
Tympanometry was the most commonly used outcome and was
reported in four trials, as a dichotomous variable (improvement
yes/no) (Blanshard 1993; De Nobili 2008; Stangerup 1992) and
as a continuous variable (difference in mean middle ear compliance)
(Fraser 1977). Three trials (Brooker 1992; Ercan 2005;
Lesinskas 2003) reported dichotomous, composite measures obtained
fromtympanometry combinedwith other outcomes. Lesinskas
reported a total score that combined pneumotoscopic appearance,
tympanometry, patient complaint and audiometry. Brooker
reported improvement in both tympanometry and audiometry as
a single, combined outcome measure. Audiometry was reported as
a separate outcome in three trials. One of these (Blanshard 1993)
reported a dichotomous change in pure-tone audiometry threshold
at frequencies between 250 Hz and 4000 Hz, while the other
two trials reported it as a continuous outcome (mean change in
pure-tone audiometry thresholds at frequencies between 500 Hz
to 4000 Hz (Arick 2005) or 500 Hz to 2000 Hz (Fraser 1977)).
Other outcomes reported were tympanic membrane mobility on
otoscopy (Arick 2005) and clearance of fluid from the middle
ear (Blanshard 1993). Six studies recorded outcomes at the end
of treatment (Blanshard 1993; Brooker 1992; De Nobili 2008;
Fraser 1977; Lesinskas 2003; Stangerup 1992). One trial (Arick
2005) recorded outcomes four weeks after the end of seven weeks
of treatment. Three trials (Ercan 2005; Lesinskas 2003; Stangerup
1992) reported longer follow-up times after treatment had finished.
Excluded studies
See Characteristics of excluded studies table.
A total of 30 studies were excluded for the following reasons:
• 18 were not randomised trials (Alper 1999; Arick 2000;
Blanshard 1995; Costantino 2010; Gottschalk 1966; Gottschalk
1991; Havas 1995; Kaneko 1997; Karahatay 2008; Kutácová
2005; Laina 2006; Leunig 1995; Luntz 1991; Ogawa 2003; Poe
2011; Prabhakar 2007; Talmon 2010; Yu 2003);
• six studies did not have participants with otitis media with
effusion (Dalchow 2011; Ducla-Soares 2007; Hidir 2011; Jumah
2010; Kawase 2008; Pau 2009);
• four studies did not assess autoinflation as the intervention
(El Hachem 2012; Kouwen 2005; Leach 2008; Shim 2010;
Toros 2010);
• one study did not assess hearing loss by either
tympanometry and/or audiometry (Chan 1989); and
• one study considered two different autoinflation
techniques, but not against a control (Hanner 1997).
Risk of bias in included studies
We assessed studies for risk of bias in four areas: random sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment,
incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. We also
assessed the quality of the intervention in terms of equal provision
of care for all groups and treatment adherence. We deemed none
of the included studies to be of high quality (see individual entries
in the Characteristics of included studies table, Table 1 and Figure
1).
Figure 1. ’Risk of bias’ summary: review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item for each included
study.
Randomisation (sequence generation) was reported and deemed
low risk in three of the trials (Arick 2005; Blanshard 1993;
Lesinskas 2003); the remaining trials were unclear risk.
Only one study fully commented on allocation concealment and
we classed this as low risk (Lesinskas 2003). The remaining studies
made no comment and so we classified them as unclear risk.
Four studies presented data showing the different arms of the study
to be comparable on prognostic characteristics (Arick 2005; De
Nobili 2008; Fraser 1977; Stangerup 1992). One study described
distribution of age and sex as being similar between arms at baseline
(Ercan 2005). One study (Blanshard 1993) commented that
groups showed significance only in age distribution and exposure
to smoking, while two studies (Brooker 1992; Lesinskas 2003)
described as randomised controlled trials did not present data on
the baseline characteristics. Confounding was not an issue in any
trial.
Only one trial (Arick 2005) reported that the participating doctors
and the outcome assessorswere blinded, althoughwith patients not
blinded it is likely the patient’s status could have become known
to the assessors.
Follow-up was predominantly low risk: four studies had no attrition
(Arick 2005; Brooker 1992;DeNobili 2008; Lesinskas 2003)
and three further studies had less than 15% attrition (Blanshard
1993; Ercan 2005; Fraser 1977). We assessed only one study
(Stangerup 1992) as high risk, with 42% attrition in the experimental
arm and 67% attrition in the control arm.
No trials showed any evidence of selective reporting.
Reported adherence to the use of autoinflation was variable; one
trial reported 98% compliance (Arick 2005) while another reported
45% of participants as having high compliance, 43% low
compliance and 12% being unable to use the autoinflation device
(Blanshard 1993).
Effects of interventions
Eight studies met the inclusion criteria for this review and compared
autoinflation with control.
Combining data proved difficult due to a lack of consistent reporting
of a common single outcome measure. Hence, post hoc,
we also analysed a composite measure of any outcome signifying
improvement (as defined in the individual studies). We analysed
the data in two time frames: up to one month and more than one
month.
Improvement in tympanogram (to type C1 or A
tympanogram)
Of the five studies that included tympanometry as a discrete outcome
at less than onemonth, three favoured treatment (Blanshard
1993; Ercan 2005; Stangerup 1992) and two favoured control
(Brooker 1992; De Nobili 2008). Within these five studies, at
less than one month, autoinflation showed a non-significant improvement
in tympanometry as defined by type C2 and B tympanograms
(relative risk of improvement (RRI) 1.47, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.69 to 3.13), with substantial heterogeneity
(I2 = 89%). See Analysis 1.1.1. Subgroup analyses suggested that
autoinflation is beneficial in children with either initial type B
tympanogram, relative to a type C1 or A tympanogram (RRI 2.15,
95% CI 1.41 to 3.28, I2 = 0%), or type C2 tympanograms (RRI
3.84, 95%CI 1.94 to 7.59, I2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.1). This anomaly
was due to the fact that the Brooker 1992 trial did not report the
baseline tympanometry level of the participants in the study, while
De Nobili 2008 reported these as percentages at different stages
(not tracked by ear) and therefore neither could be included in
the subgroup analyses. As these are the two trials where the effect
of the intervention is negative, their exclusion from the subgroup
analyses changed the size of the estimated effect.
A sixth study (Fraser 1977) used mean change in middle ear pressure
as the tympanometry outcome and was not included in the
pooled estimates. Fraser found no significant difference between
control and intervention groups.
Four studies followed participants for longer than a month
(Blanshard 1993; De Nobili 2008; Ercan 2005; Stangerup 1992).
In these studies autoinflation produced a non-significant change
in tympanometry compared to control (RRI 1.22, 95% CI 1.00
to 1.49, I2 = 0%).
Differences in hearing level on pure-tone audiogram
(average 10 dB improvement over the frequencies
250 Hz to 2000 Hz)
Two studies included an average improvement of 10 dB ormore in
the threshold for pure-tone audiometry in a range of frequencies
from250Hz to 2000Hz as a discrete outcomemeasure (Blanshard
1993; Brooker 1992). The estimated recovery was worse in the
autoinflation group (RRI 0.80, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.88, I2 = 63%)
(Analysis 2.1). Two studies reported audiometry improvement as
continuous (Arick 2005; Fraser 1977), with the pooled estimate
showing a non-significant improvement in the autoinflation group
(mean difference (MD) 7.02 dB, 95% CI -6.92 to 20.96, I2 =
95%) (Analysis 2.2). In both cases significant heterogeneity was
found in the combined studies.
Improvement measured as a composite of change in
tympanogram and/or audiometry (post hoc)
We combined seven studies using a dichotomous outcome of ’improvement’
in either tympanogram or audiometry (less than one
month: Blanshard 1993; Brooker 1992; De Nobili 2008; Ercan
2005; Lesinskas 2003; Stangerup 1992; and over onemonth:Arick
2005; Blanshard 1993; De Nobili 2008; Ercan 2005; Lesinskas
2003; Stangerup 1992).The relative risk of improvementwas 1.89
(95% CI 0.83 to 4.31, I2 = 93%, Analysis 3.1) at less than one
month and 1.74 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.50, I2 = 69%, Analysis 3.2) at
more than onemonth.The type of interventionwas categorised by
an independent rater and information on two types was obtained:
a) Politzerisation and b) Otovent® or carnival blower + balloon.
Subgroup analysis: type of intervention
We carried out a subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention
judged by blinded assessment. Five studies (Blanshard 1993;
Brooker 1992; De Nobili 2008; Ercan 2005; Stangerup 1992)
provided information on type A interventions (classic Otovent®
or carnival blower with balloon) and two (Arick 2005; Lesinskas
2003) provided information on type C interventions (Politzer and
modified Politzer). Analyses showed a positive, statistically significant
effect using a Politzer device under one month (RRI 7.07,
95% CI 3.70 to 13.51) (Analysis 3.3) and over one month (RRI
2.25, 95%CI 1.67 to 3.04, I2 = 21.1%) (Analysis 3.4). A non-significant
effect was found when using Otovent®or carnival blower
+ balloon under one month (RRI 1.47, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.13 I2
= 89%) (Analysis 3.3) and over one month (RRI 1.22, 95% CI
1.00 to 1.49, I2 = 0%) (Analysis 3.4).
Adverse effects of autoinflation and compliance
None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence
of side effects between the control or intervention groups.
The side effects/complications studied included incidence of middle
ear infection, eardrum perforation, attacks of otitis media, upper
respiratory tract infections, tonsillitis, use of antibiotics, middle
ear effusion, insertion of grommets and enlarged adenoids.
One study (Lesinskas 2003) reported that one patient stopped the
treatment due to the pain caused by the procedure.
Six of the eight trials reported compliance. Four studies assessed
the adherence to the intervention as ’high compliance’ (as defined
by the study authors) ranging from45%to 100%. Two studies reported
’good’ or ’satisfactory’ compliance. One study commented
that “some children withOME found doing the Valsalvamanoeuvre
painful” (Blanshard 1993), but other than Lesinskas 2003 no
other study made any comment.
Data on reported side effects and compliance for each individual
trial can be found in the table of ’Side effects and compliance’
(Table 1).
Presence or absence of fluid in middle ear cavity
One study reported otoscopy findings (Blanshard 1993) and
demonstrated significantly higher clearance of free fluid from the
middle ear at one and two, but not at three months, in the intervention
group compared to the control group (P < 0.05).
Other outcomes
Lesinskas 2003 presented outcomes as a pooled score of pneumotoscopy,
tympanometry, patient complaint and audiometry. At
day 10 and day 60 a significant overall improvement was demonstrated
in the autoinflation group compared to the control group
(P < 0.001). We were unable to obtain data on individual outcomes.
Blanshard 1993 analysed low compliance and high compliance
subgroups within the intervention. Arick 2005 reported
improvement in tympanometric peak pressure (TPP) and hearing
recovery (used as primary outcome of improvement in the pooled
estimate).
None of the studies reported developmental test results, behavioural
test results, language and speech development, quality
of life or family function.
D I S C U S S I O N
Overall autoinflation appears to have a beneficial effect on the
resolution of glue ear, with a low incidence of adverse side effects
(Table 1). Six of the eight studies showed beneficial effects at least
in the short term(maximumduration of follow-up in the included
studies was three months), while one of the two that reported
a negative effect in the short term reported a positive effect in
the long term (two months). This is in keeping with a previous
systematic review on the use of autoinflation (Reidpath 1999).
This reviewconcludes that the evidence for the use of autoinflation
in the treatment of glue ear in children is conflicting but suggests
that it may be of clinical benefit in the short term.
There are several limitations in the collection and interpretation
of the findings. The type of device used may be critical in determining
the benefits of autoinflation. Pooled effect estimates suggest
Politzerisation to be more effective than the classic Otovent®
device or carnival blower with a balloon attached. However, both
papers that used Politzerisation as themethod of autoinflation had
slightly different entry criteria to the rest. They were deemed suitable
for inclusion in this review as they both used multiple criteria
to make the diagnosis of otitis media with effusion (OME) (hearing
loss, tympanometry and, in one paper, otoscopy). Information
in this area is sparse. A study (Hanner 1997, not part of this review)
comparing two differentmethods of autoinflation (Valsalva versus
Otovent®) did not identify a difference between them, however
a reanalysis of their data showed a significant difference in favour
of Otovent® (relative risk of improvement (RRI) 1.70, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.08 to 2.69).
Duration of treatment and follow-up also appear to be factors
in determining the effects of autoinflation. Autoinflation seems
more beneficial in the short term (one month or less of treatment)
than in the longer term. Paradoxically the meta-analysis of composite
outcomes shows the relative risk of improvement at one
month or less to be non-significant (RRI 1.89, 95% CI 0.83 to
4.31) whilst the relative risk of improvement at more than one
month is significant (RRI 1.74, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.50). The results
are affected by the two studies that found autoinflation to be
markedly worse than control at least in the short term (Brooker
1992; De Nobili 2008), leading to significant heterogeneity (I2 =
89%). The study by Brooker 1992 did not continue follow-up for
longer than one month, therefore it was not included in the composite
outcomes at longer time frames. The study by De Nobili
2008 reported percentage of ears at different tympanogram levels
(B, C2, C1 and A) at baseline, 12 days and two months. For our
calculations we have assumed that all ears in the category B and
C2 are included and ears in categories A and C1 will not revert
to worse tympanograms. De Nobili 2008 reports a positive difference
(in favour of autoinflation) for the two-month follow-up.
A final important difference is that for this study most OMEs are
resolved within the two months of follow-up; five out of 60 ears
remain as C2 or B. Several differences were noted in the duration
of the intervention (range 10 days to threemonths) and also in the
duration of follow-up, ranging from cessation of the intervention
to two months after the intervention. Only three studies continued
to follow up participants after the intervention had ceased
(Arick 2005; Lesinskas 2003; Stangerup 1992). For these reasons
it is difficult to determine whether the benefits of autoinflation are
sustained after treatment.
The combined effects show a mixed pattern of autoinflation, with
both statistical and clinical heterogeneity. Considerable heterogeneity
may be due to the populations, the intervention or the
outcome definitions. One study (Brooker 1992) found autoinflation
to be worse than control; another (DeNobili 2008) showed it
to be worse in the short term (12 days) but better in the long term
(two months). The children in Brooker’s study are comparable to
those in other studies in terms of age, but there are few data with
which to compare the prognostic characteristics of the control and
intervention groups in this study with the other studies. For De
Nobili 2008 it is difficult to assess if the assumption made about
the change in tympanogram for ears is potentially affecting the
results (no data on improvement at ear or individual level are provided).
Brooker’s populations may be different to those of other studies
in that the proportion of controls recovering in this trial was
much higher than in any other studies. A possible reason for this
is the outcome reported, which is a composite of improvement
in pure-tone audiogram and tympanogram. Another difference
is that it is suggested in the paper that only children with type
B tympanograms were included, but this was not clearly stated.
Hence, heterogeneity could be explained if autoinflation is helpful
to children with type C2 but not type B tympanograms. Subgroup
analyses of the Blanshard 1993 and Stangerup 1992 papers
suggest that this might be the case (although the effect size is not
statistically significant in either subgroup). Finally, Brooker did
not use a standardised Otovent® device, instead using a carnival
blower and balloon. This may be a less effective or even harmful
method of autoinflation, however the independent rater classified
this intervention to be equivalent to Otovent®.
The studies mainly gave information on tympanometry and composite
outcomes. Autoinflation does not appear to improve puretone
audiometry thresholds. Only one study reported otoscopy
findings so it is difficult to comment on this outcome. Reduction
of hearing loss is an important outcome for children and parents,
but there was little evidence within the included studies to address
the impact of hearing loss. The development of a quality of
life questionnaire specifically for children with hearing loss means
that the impact of hearing loss could be assessed in future studies
(Umansky 2011).
However, it appeared that autoinflation was beneficial at one and
twomonths. A large primary care study is in progress (Williamson
2011) which will report on one and three-month outcomes.
Adverse events do not appear to differ significantly between intervention
and control groups. Data for compliance were variable.
There is some anecdotal evidence that some children, possibly in
selected groups, do get pain when undertaking autoinflation and
that continued enthusiasm for the procedure over time can wane.
Blanshard 1993 comments that “significant improvementwas seen
only in those who used the treatment with a high compliance for
the duration of the study”. More details on adverse events and
compliance are needed from trials, along with evidence on how to
achieve good compliance.
Limitations
The heterogeneity of trial designs, inclusion criteria, interventions,
outcome reporting and time scalesmakes it difficult to drawrobust
conclusions. Another factor that affects validity is the variation in
the level of data analysis. Most studies used ears as their data analysis
unit, but some used patients. To overcome this problem we
estimated thewithin-patient correlation. Furthermore, some studies
reported their outcomes as continuous variables and some as
dichotomous variables. Definitions of improvement varied in the
studies that reported dichotomous outcomes. The quality of the
trials was variable, in particular none of the studies used blinding
of participants or assessors and some studies used inferior methods
of randomisation.
One of the major concerns in children with glue ear is possible
developmental sequelae; none of the included papers looked
at this issue. Currently there are no proven treatments that
affect speech and language development, including grommets
(Browning 2010). Therefore, it is not possible to say whether the
statistically significant improvements in tympanometry translate
into clinically significant benefits. This is an important consideration
when reviewing treatments for a self limiting condition
such as otitis media with effusion; there is a real possibility that
watchful waiting without interventionmay have similar long-term
outcomes to other interventions.
A U T H O R S ’ C O N C L U S I O N S
Implications for practice
Although this analysis does not enable us to make any firm conclusions,
the evidence appears favourable at least in the short term.
Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst
awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion (OME).
One particular concern is the level of adherence: are the child and
parent willing to tolerate the inconvenience of the procedure? A
recent Cochrane review has concluded that the benefits of grommets
for OME compared to watchful waiting are small and then
diminish over time (Browning 2010). Currently most autoinflation
interventions are instigated in secondary care.With increased
awareness and the ability to instruct and educate parents and children
in their use, this intervention would be well suited to primary
care and there is ongoing research in this area (Williamson
2011). The use of a Politzer device appears promising, however
due to the limited amount of information available it is difficult
to make any definitive recommendation. None of these trials provided
data on long-term sequelae such as language development.
However, the trials of ventilation tubes suggest there is little longterm
impact achieved through treatment of otitis media with effusion
(Browning 2010).
Implications for research
All of the studies we included were small and of limited duration
of treatment and follow-up. Further studies with larger numbers
of participants and longer duration of intervention, completed in
primary care, are much needed. Studies need to provided further
evidence on adverse events and treatment compliance. Further
studies should also consider the impact of autoinflation on both
developmental and hearing loss outcomes in children with otitis
media with effusion. The heterogeneity suggests that the method
of autoinflation, including the device used, may be important and
thismerits further investigation. Studies looking at factors predicting
which children may benefit from autoinflation would help in
identifying subgroups of children for whom autoinflation could
be recommended. Future work could also include the possibility
of investigating whether autoinflation is effective in preventing
disease relapses in children prone to OME.
