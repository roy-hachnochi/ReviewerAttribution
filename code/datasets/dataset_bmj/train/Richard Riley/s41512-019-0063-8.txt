A study protocol for the development and
internal validation of a multivariable
prognostic model to determine lower
extremity muscle injury risk in elite football
(soccer) players, with further exploration of
prognostic factors
Abstract
Background: Indirect muscle injuries (IMIs) are a considerable burden to elite football (soccer) teams, and
prevention of these injuries offers many benefits. Preseason medical, musculoskeletal and performance screening
(termed periodic health examination (PHE)) can be used to help determine players at risk of injuries such as IMIs,
where identification of PHE-derived prognostic factors (PF) may inform IMI prevention strategies. Furthermore, using
several PFs in combination within a multivariable prognostic model may allow individualised IMI risk estimation and
specific targeting of prevention strategies, based upon an individual’s PF profile. No such models have been
developed in elite football and the current IMI prognostic factor evidence is limited. This study aims to (1) develop
and internally validate a prognostic model for individualised IMI risk prediction within a season in elite footballers,
using the extent of the prognostic evidence and clinical reasoning; and (2) explore potential PHE-derived PFs
associated with IMI outcomes in elite footballers, using available PHE data from a professional team.
Methods: This is a protocol for a retrospective cohort study. PHE and injury data were routinely collected over 5
seasons (1 July 2013 to 19 May 2018), from a population of elite male players aged 16–40 years old. Of 60
candidate PFs, 15 were excluded. Twelve variables (derived from 10 PFs) will be included in model development
that were identified from a systematic review, missing data assessment, measurement reliability evaluation and
clinical reasoning. A full multivariable logistic regression model will be fitted, to ensure adjustment before backward
elimination. The performance and internal validation of the model will be assessed. The remaining 35 candidate PFs
are eligible for further exploration, using univariable logistic regression to obtain unadjusted risk estimates.
Exploratory PFs will also be incorporated into multivariable logistic regression models to determine risk estimates
whilst adjusting for age, height and body weight.

Background
Indirect muscle injuries (IMIs) are the most common injury type in elite football (soccer), predominantly affecting lower extremity muscle groups [1, 2]. Such injuries
occur in the absence of direct impact-related trauma
(during sprinting for example) [3, 4] and are subclassified into functional disorders without macroscopic structural tissue muscle damage, or structural injuries with
clear evidence of muscle disruption [3, 4].
IMIs are problematic for elite teams in terms of both incidence and severity [5], accounting for 30.3% to 47.9% of
all injuries that result in time lost to both training and
competition [1, 6–9], with the mean and median absence
duration reported as 14.4 [1] and 15 days respectively [8].
Player availability is crucial to team prosperity, with vast
commercial and financial rewards on offer to successful
teams and players [10, 11]. Conversely, player absences
through injury negatively affect team performance [12,
13], increase demand on medical services and carry a significant financial burden. As an illustration, for each first
team player missing through injury, the daily cost to a participating team in the UEFA Champions League is approximately €17,000 to €20,000 [14, 15].
Periodic health examination (PHE) is used by 94% of
elite teams and typically consists of medical examination, musculoskeletal assessment, functional movement
evaluation and performance tests, conducted during preseason and in-season periods [16]. PHE is considered
important because its intended purposes are to: (1) allow
regular health monitoring for underlying but asymptomatic pathology [17]; (2) establish baseline measures for
setting rehabilitation or training targets [18]; and (3)
identify individuals who are susceptible to common or
severe injury types (such as IMIs) [19]. For the latter
function, PHE cannot detect causes of injury, but can
highlight factors that may be associated with an injury
outcome (prognostic factors) and therefore help explain
differences in injury risk across individuals within the
team [18]. Several prognostic factors could also be used
in combination within a multivariable prognostic model
to predict an individual’s absolute injury risk [20, 21].
Importantly, both prognostic models and prognostic factors (PFs) can be used to inform management approaches designed to modify an individual’s absolute risk
[21]. Despite the potential benefits of prognostic models
for shaping injury prevention strategies aimed at
clinically important injuries such as IMIs, none have
been developed in elite football [22]. In addition, there
are significant methodological limitations in the evidence
base relating to PHE-derived PFs [22].
Therefore, this study will consist of two primary objectives: (1) to develop and internally validate a prognostic
model for individualised IMI risk prediction during a
season in elite footballers, using a small number of PHEderived candidate PFs selected from a previous systematic review [22] and clinical reasoning; and (2) to explore
potential PFs associated with IMI outcomes during a
season in this elite cohort, using available PHE data from
a professional team.
Methods
Study design
This study will be of retrospective cohort design, using a
population of elite male football players aged 16–40 years
old who were employed on a full-time basis at an English
Premier League club. The first objective will be conducted
in accordance with existing guidelines for model development and internal validation [23, 24] and reported in accordance with the Transparent Reporting of a
Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis
or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement [25, 26]. The second
objective will be conducted in accordance with existing
guidelines [27] and reported in accordance with the
REporting recommendations for MARKer prognostic
studies [28, 29].
Data sources
This study will use routinely collected data that was obtained over five seasons (from 1 July 2013 to 19 May
2018). Data collected from the musculoskeletal and performance test components of the club’s PHE will be used
to identify candidate PFs. Injury outcome data will also be
used to establish the available number of IMI outcomes.
Preseason PHE data collection
Each new season commenced from July 1st. Available
players completed a mandatory PHE on one of 3 days during the first week of the season. Typically, the musculoskeletal and performance components of the PHE
included the following: (1) anthropometric measurements;
(2) medical history review (i.e. previous injury history); (3)
musculoskeletal examination tests; (4) functional
Hughes et al. Diagnostic and Prognostic Research (2019) 3:19 Page 2 of 13
movement and balance tests; and (5) strength and power
tests. Detailed descriptions of all tests are provided in
Additional file 1.
The PHE test order was self-selected by each player. A
standardised warm up was not implemented, although
players could undertake their own warm up procedures
if they wished. Each component of the PHE test battery
was standardised according to a written protocol and
conducted by physiotherapists, sports scientists or club
medical doctors. To avoid inter-tester variability, the
same examiners performed the same test every season
and throughout the 5-year data collection period, no
examiner attrition occurred.
If a participant was injured at the time of PHE, a risk
assessment was completed by medical staff. In such instances, participants only completed tests that were
deemed appropriate and safe for the participant’s condition; examiners were therefore not blinded to the injury
status of participants.
Participant follow-up and injury data collection
Participants were followed up to the last day of each
competitive domestic season (defined as the date of the
last first team game of the season) irrespective of
whether they had completed the PHE procedure or not.
Participants completed their routine training and match
programmes throughout. For every player in the squad,
any injuries that occurred during the season were
assessed and electronically documented within 24 h by a
club medical doctor or physiotherapist in accordance
with the Consensus Statement on Injury Definitions and
Data Collection Procedures in Studies of Football Injuries [30]. Musculoskeletal assessments were dependent
on the clinical presentation, although typically consisted
of observation, effusion, range of movement, muscle
length and resisted muscle tests, palpation and special
diagnostic manual tests. Radiological imaging was used
to assist diagnosis as required. Ultrasound scans were
performed by the club medical doctor using a Toshiba
Aplio 500 or 1900 machine (Toshiba Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was
performed as appropriate, using a Canon Vantage Titan
3 T Scanner (Canon Medical Systems, Otowara, Japan)
according to sequences determined by the club medical
doctor. Images were evaluated by a club medical doctor
and an independent musculoskeletal radiologist.
The medical professionals were not blinded to PHE
data at the time of diagnosis. These data were not routinely used to inform diagnoses, but instead used to
identify functional rehabilitation targets and for
benchmarking purposes. Following injury, players
completed a rehabilitation programme as directed by
club medical staff to enable them to return to training
and match participation.
Participants and eligibility criteria
Eligible participants were identified from a review of the
PHE database entries during the dates stated above. During any season, participants were eligible for inclusion
into the analysis if they: (1) had an outfield position (i.e.
not a goalkeeper); and (2) participated in PHE testing for
the relevant season. Participants were excluded from the
analysis for any season if they were a triallist player or
not contracted to the club at the time of PHE.
Ethics and data use
Because all data were captured from the mandatory PHE
procedure completed through the participants’ employment, informed consent was not required. The anonymity and rights of all participants were protected. The
football club granted permission to use these data, and
the use of the data for this study was approved by the
Research Ethics service at the University of Manchester.
This study has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov,
with registered number as NCT03782389.
Data extraction
All PHE records from eligible participants were extracted and placed into a separate database. Using the
club’s electronic medical records system, a further database was generated of all recorded injuries for each season and a manual review of each eligible participant’s
medical record was undertaken to ensure accuracy. Each
injury was categorised according to the following: (1)
contact or non-contact mechanism of injury; (2) injured
side; (3) affected body area; (4) injury type, i.e. IMI/ligament/tendon/cartilage/contusion or laceration/bone/
concussion/other musculoskeletal injury; and (5) muscle
group and diagnostic classification if recorded as an IMI.
This process allowed an in-house audit of injury incidence and absolute risk evaluation for each injury type
for the squad overall and for those who underwent PHE.
All IMIs were then extracted and merged with the PHE
database of included participants, for each season in
which they remained eligible.
Outcome measures
For this study, the primary outcome measure will be the
occurrence of an initial (index) lower extremity IMI sustained by a participant during a season. Only time-loss
injuries will be included; that is, any index lower extremity IMI that occurred during match play or training that
resulted in the player being unable to take full part in future match play or training [30]. An IMI was confirmed
during the injury assessment procedure outlined above
and graded by the club medical doctor or physiotherapist according to the Munich Consensus Statement for
the Classification of Muscle Injuries in Sport [4]. This
diagnostic classification system was the primary method
Hughes et al. Diagnostic and Prognostic Research (2019) 3:19 Page 3 of 13
of muscle injury classification used by the club and has
been validated previously [31].
Each participant-season will be treated as independent.
If an index lower extremity IMI occurred, the participant’s outcome for the season will be determined and
that participant will no longer be considered at risk beyond the time of IMI occurrence. In these circumstances, participants will be included for further analysis
at the start of the consecutive season, providing they remain eligible. If participants sustained any upper limb
IMI, trunk IMI or non-IMI injury type, these will be ignored and the participant will still be considered at risk
of a lower extremity index IMI.
Eligible participants who were loaned out or transferred to another club throughout that season, but had
not sustained an index IMI prior to the loan or transfer,
will still be considered in the risk set. Participants who
sustained an index IMI whilst on loan will be included
for analysis, as outlined above. Any participants who
were permanently transferred during a season (but had
not sustained an index IMI prior to the transfer) will be
recorded as not having an IMI event during the relevant
season, and they will exit the cohort at this point. A sensitivity analysis may be conducted to evaluate the effect
of player loans or transfers on the results.
Sample size
To maximise statistical power, we have elected to use all
data from the 5-season period. This approach agrees
with methodological recommendations that data splitting should be avoided, and all available data should be
used for model validation [32]. The extracted injury data
were audited in parallel with the development of this
protocol to determine the number of available index IMI
events in the dataset. This was essential to allow calculation of the maximum number of candidate PFs that
could be included in model development in order to
limit the effects of statistical overfitting [33].
The number of candidate PFs for inclusion in model
development will be restricted to a minimum of 10
events per variable (EPV), which is recommended to reduce overfitting and optimism during the development
of a logistic regression model [34]. Note that ‘variable’
here means a parameter included (or considered for
inclusion) in the model that corresponds to one of
the PFs.
Following the audit, the number of independent
participant-seasons that will be included for analysis is
317, with 138 index IMI events recorded during the 5-
season period. Therefore, we have chosen to restrict the
number of parameters (variables) for inclusion in model
development to 12, which corresponds to having >10
EPV and thus above the minimum recommendation
of 10. We also checked if this met the criteria to
minimise overfitting recently proposed by Riley et al.
[33]. Assuming the model will have a modest Nagelkerke R-squared of 25%, then with an outcome proportion of 0.435, our 12 candidate PF variables
correspond to targeting an approximate shrinkage factor of 0.85, and thus a relatively small amount of
overfitting (15%) [33]. We deemed this a suitable
compromise between increasing the number of PF parameters and minimising the overfitting.
Candidate prognostic factors
The extracted PHE data were audited as per current
methodological recommendations [23], to establish data
quality and quantify missing values. This process was
also conducted in parallel with the development of this
protocol, to assist selection of candidate PFs to be included in either model development or exploration a
priori and to inform strategies for handling missing data
in the final analysis.
A complete list of all 60 candidate PFs extracted from
the PHE dataset is presented in Table 1, with quantitative analysis of missing values for each PF.
Missing data
As presented in Table 1, all medical history and age
factors were complete (23 factors). Of the 37
remaining candidate PFs, the proportion of missingness ranged from 5.68% (for height and weight) to
76.34% (for body fat). Eleven of these had > 15%
missing observations (which included body fat, toe
touch in standing, sacroiliac kinematic function, all Y
Balance Test and upper body peak power variables).
For these factors, the large degree of missingness was
because of procedural changes in the PHE process,
which meant that these tests were not conducted
across all seasons.
For candidate PFs with < 15% missing observations, all
tests were conducted consistently across all 5 seasons.
For these factors, the sample characteristics of cases with
complete PF data were compared to incomplete cases
which had at least one missing observation (Table 2).
For complete cases, the mean values of all characteristics were less than incomplete cases, with the largest
differences observed in age (20.83 and 23.55 years, respectively) and weight (74.15 and 77.86 kg, respectively). Therefore, a complete case only analysis was
not appropriate and we will rather assume that the
mechanism of missingness can be considered as missing at random (MAR), where the distribution of missing values is related to values of observed variables
[26], to allow imputation and so inclusion of individuals with missing data.

Model development and internal validation
We have chosen to conduct the model development before the PF exploration because of the restrictions on the
number of PFs permitted to limit potential overfitting of
the model.
Because only 12 PF variables will be used in model building, we have defined these candidate PFs a priori (Table 3).
Three candidate PFs have known importance based on the
results of our previous systematic review so were selected
for inclusion [22]. All other PFs listed in Table 1 were eligible unless there were > 15% missing observations or if reliability (where applicable) was classed as fair to poor (ICC
< 0.70) [35]. In these cases, the relevant candidate PFs were
excluded (Table 4). This was to ensure that only the highest
quality data will be used in the analysis, with PFs that would
generally be available and routinely measured.
Co-linearity amongst factors within a logistic regression model can cause inaccuracies in standard error and

confidence interval estimates [45], so a scatterplot
matrix was used to informally assess between-factor correlations for eligible PFs. If PFs were highly correlated,
one of the PFs was dropped or new composite PFs were
generated and replaced the original factors (highlighted
in Tables 3, 4 and 5). Typically, this occurred where
measurements examined both right and left limbs separately; composite factor variables were therefore created
for both between-limb measurement differences and the
mean of the measurements for both limbs.
Of the remaining eligible PFs, 9 further candidate factor variables were selected for inclusion, through use of
clinical reasoning to identify those with a biologically
plausible association with IMI development. The final
set of 12 PF variables is shown in Table 3.
Prognostic factor exploration
Candidate PFs that were that were not selected for use in
model development (but not excluded) will be eligible for
further exploratory analysis (Table 5). This will allow identification of other potentially useful associations which
may assist future analyses or updating of the model created under the first objective of this investigation.
Statistical analysis
Model development and internal validation
Multivariable logistic regression will be used for the analysis as this is an appropriate method where outcomes
are binary [26] and independent variables (PFs) are continuous, categorical or a combination [45]. Initially, we
will fit a full multivariable model containing all 12 candidate PF variables to ensure a fully adjusted model prior
to the potential elimination of unimportant candidate
factors [23]. Backward elimination will then be used to
successively remove non-significant factors with p values
of greater than 0.157. This threshold was set to approximate equivalence with Akaike’s Information Criterion
[48]. Using backward elimination in this way may deliver
a more parsimonious model which is therefore easier to
implement in clinical practice than a full model. Where
possible, we will retain continuous candidate PFs in their
continuous form to avoid statistical power loss [49].
Because the missing data mechanism is considered as
missing at random (MAR), multiple imputation (MI) will
be implemented, using 50 imputations. We have chosen
to utilise MI because it avoids excluding participants
from the analysis, is an effective method of handling
missing prognostic factor information and can be used
to account for uncertainty in missing data [50].
The apparent performance of the developed model will
be summarised in the development datasets (averaged
over imputation datasets), via calibration and discrimination. Model calibration determines performance in terms
of the agreement between predicted outcome risks and
those actually observed [51]. Graphical plots are useful to
assess calibration [23], so will be produced and utilised in
the analysis. We will calculate calibration-in-the-large
(CITL, ideal value of 0), which quantifies the systematic
error in model predictions (overall agreement). A related
measure is E/O (ideal value of 1), which gives the ratio of
the mean of the predicted (expected (E)) risks against the
mean of the observed risks (O) [51, 52]. A calibration
slope will also be calculated, where a value of 1 equals perfect calibration [26]. Models demonstrate perfect calibration within development data, but in new data, the slope
may be < 1 due to overfitting in the model development
dataset (see below for how this will be handled) [52].
Discrimination performance is a measure of a model’s
ability to separate participants who have experienced an
outcome compared to those who have not, quantified
using the C (concordance) statistic (equivalent to the
area under the ROC curve) [23]. This index measure will
be calculated for the development model, where 1 demonstrates perfect discrimination, whilst 0.5 indicates that
discrimination is no better than by chance alone.
To quantify the degree of optimism due to overfitting,
our model will be internally validated using bootstrap
re-sampling. This will be conducted as previously outlined [26, 53]. The prognostic factor variable selection
procedure and model construction will be repeated for
200 bootstrap samples. For each sample, the difference
in bootstrap apparent performance (of the bootstrap
model in the bootstrap data) and test performance (of
the bootstrap model in the original dataset) will be averaged across the 200 samples, to obtain a single estimate

of optimism for each performance statistic. Then, to calculate optimism-adjusted estimates of performance for
our new model, the estimates of optimism will be subtracted from the original apparent estimates of
performance.
The optimism-adjusted calibration slope will provide a
uniform shrinkage factor, which will be applied to all
prognostic factor effects in the developed model to adjust (shrink) for overfitting. The intercept of the model
will then be re-estimated accordingly. This will then
form our final model.
Prognostic factor exploration
All remaining candidate factors that are eligible for exploration (Table 5) will undergo univariable logistic regression
analyses to determine unadjusted associations with IMIs.
Candidate PFs will also be incorporated into multivariable
logistic regression models to determine odds ratios after
adjustment for age, height and body weight. Note that because age was included as a candidate in the original
model and will also be used for adjustment purposes in
the exploratory multivariable models, the total number of
candidate PFs eligible for exploration is 36. Exploration of
non-linear associations between candidate factors and
index IMI outcomes will also be evaluated using a fractional polynomial approach [49].
Discussion
Although previous studies in elite football have investigated the association between factors obtained during
PHE and IMIs using multivariable models, none have
developed, validated or evaluated the performance a
prognostic model for injury prediction purposes [22].
Whilst it is possible to develop a prognostic model from
PHE data [18], our investigation will offer valuable insights into the practical aspects of this process and the
clinical usefulness of a model when applied to an individual football club. Our findings may also outline how
these principles may be used in future at other clubs or
sports, or on larger datasets which could be derived
from several collaborating clubs.

Despite the availability of high-quality PHE and injury
data, the relatively small number of outcomes in this
dataset is problematic and will permit only a limited selection of candidate prognostic factors for use in model
development. Utilising more than one prognostic factor variable for every 10 injury outcomes may cause
significant issues with model overfitting, where spurious observed relationships occur because of regression value distortion [34]. This leads to an
overestimation of predictive performance (optimism)
which is especially evident in small datasets [54]. To
limit the effects of overfitting, only 10 PFs (resulting
in 12 variables) will be permitted and use of data reduction methods have been required to select appropriate candidate factors for inclusion.
PFs for clinical injury outcomes are either intrinsic
(person specific) or extrinsic (environment specific) [55]
and can be modifiable or non-modifiable [56]. Only the
non-modifiable factors of increasing age and history of
previous muscle injury have been shown to have modest

prognostic value for hamstring muscle injuries in elite
footballers [22], so will be included in model development. However, their non-modifiable nature means that
they have limited use in terms of informing injury prevention strategies. To enhance the clinical applicability
of the model, other potentially relevant and modifiable
factors have been selected for inclusion.
The methodological shortcomings in the literature
mean that only three candidate prognostic factors could
be selected for model development from our previous
systematic review [22]. Subsequently, candidate PF selection for our model has been largely based upon the
evaluation of collinearity, measurement reliability and
clinical reasoning, which means that it is possible that
some important factors have not been considered. It is
also possible that some potentially useful factors have
been excluded on the basis of having >15% of missing
values. As such, only modest performance of this initial
model is expected.
It is acknowledged that the proposed prognostic model
will assume that participants are independent for each
season and utilise the binary outcome of at least one
IMI in a season, rather than evaluating time to individual IMI events. This means that we will not account for
within-person correlations from season to season. Although this is not fully representative of the real world,
because this is a novel area and we are restricted to a
relatively small dataset, we have elected to perform the
analyses in a more simplistic manner in the first instance. Further, more complex analyses may be conducted in the future.
To assess the generalisability of a prognostic model, it
should be externally validated using data from another
location [21, 24], such as a dataset from another comparable elite level football team. Because there is likely
to be considerable between-team heterogeneity in PHE
processes [16], candidate prognostic factors within our
model may not translate externally at this time. There
are no immediate plans to externally validate this model.
However, depending on the outcome of the model development and exploratory objectives, it may be possible to
conduct a future prospective temporal validation study
within the same football club, or external validation
study in different population. If feasible, such investigations will require a separate associated protocol.
The current evidence relating to PFs for injury in
football is frequently flawed due to issues with the reliability of data measurement, adjustment, dichotomisation and potential diagnostic misclassification, so
there is a need for further studies that address these
issues [22]. Further hypothesis-free exploratory studies
that investigate many factors (including those that are
not necessarily biologically plausible) may assist with
identification of new factors that may help inform
management decisions and monitoring purposes [20].
Furthermore, these types of studies are helpful because
new PFs may be used to update a developed model to improve performance [57]. We have therefore outlined an
exploratory objective to investigate the association between IMIs and other factors from the current dataset,
using a validated diagnostic outcome classification system
and recommended statistical approaches, ensuring that
where possible, analysis of continuous data remains on
the continuous scale to explore linear and non-linear
associations.
We anticipate that this investigation will provide a
comprehensive evaluation of what is currently possible
in terms of using PHE data to predict IMIs at an elite
football club, by adhering to transparent reporting procedures and current best practice for model
