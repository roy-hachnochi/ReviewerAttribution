Abstract
Background: Fluid intake and diet are thought to influence kidney stone risk. However,
prospective studies have been limited to small samples sizes and/or restricted measures.
Objective: To investigate whether fluid intake and dietary factors are associated with the risk
of developing a first kidney stone.
Design, setting, and participants: Participants were selected from UK Biobank, a populationbased prospective cohort study.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Cox proportional hazards models were used
to investigate the association between fluid intake and dietary factors and the risk of a first
incident kidney stone, ascertained from hospital inpatient records.
Results and limitations: After exclusion, 439 072 participants were available for the analysis,
of whom 2057 had hospital admission with an incident kidney stone over a mean of 6.1 yr of
follow-up. For every additional drink (200 ml) consumed per day of total fluid, the risk of
kidney stones declined by 13% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85–
0.89). Similar patterns of associations were observed for tea, coffee, and alcohol, although no
association was observed for water intake. Fruit and fibre intake was also associated with a
lower risk (HR per 100 g increase of fruits per day = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83–0.93, and HR per 10 g fibre
per day = 0.82, 95% CI 0.77–0.87), whereas meat and salt intake was associated with a higher
risk (HR per 50 g increase in meat per week = 1.17, 95% CI 1.05–1.29, and HR for always vs never/
rarely added salt to food = 1.33, 95% CI 1.12–1.58). Vegetable, fish, and cheese intake was not
associated with kidney stone risk.
Conclusions: The finding that high intake of total fluid, fruit, and fibre was associated with a
lower risk of hospitalisation for a first kidney stone suggests that modifiable dietary factors
could be targeted to prevent kidney stone development.
Patient summary: We found that higher intake of total fluid, specifically tea, coffee, and
alcohol (but not water), and consumption of fruit and foods high in fibre are linked with a
reduced likelihood of developing kidney stones.
1. Introduction
Kidney stones are a common cause of morbidity, with a
lifetime prevalence of 13% in England, with incidence rates
having increased substantially over the last few decades
worldwide [1–4]. Taking into account diagnostic and treatment costs and the additional socioeconomic burden from
sickness leave, the fiscal impact of kidney stones on the
wider economy is considerable [5]. Kidney stones also have
a high recurrence rate, with approximately half of patients
having a recurrent episode over 10 yr and up to 90% over
30 yr [6,7]. It is therefore important to identify modifiable
risk factors that can be targeted for the prevention of
developing kidney stones.
Certain dietary factors are considered to be major contributors to the increasing incidence of kidney stones, specifically a diet low in fibre and high in animal protein, fat,
and sodium [8,9]. Additionally, it has been suggested that
increasing fluid intake is an effective method to reduce the
risk of kidney stone formation [10,11]. However, whilst
there have been several prospective studies on diet and
fluid intake and the subsequent risk of developing kidney
stones, they have typically been small or focused on a
narrow range of dietary factors.
To address these limitations, we investigate the association between a wide range of dietary factors and fluid
intake, including specific types of beverages, and the risk
of developing incident kidney stones, as assessed through
hospital inpatient records, in a large UK-based prospective
cohort of half a million participants without prevalent
kidney stones.
2. Patients and methods
2.1. Population
Participants were selected from UK Biobank, a populationbased study designed to improve the prevention, treatment,
and diagnosis of a range of diseases and conditions
[12]. Between 2006 and 2010, approximately 500
000 women and men aged between 40 and 69 yr attended
one of 22 baseline assessment centres located throughout
England, Scotland, and Wales. All participants provided
sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related information
collected through touchscreen questionnaires and verbal
interviews, as well as completed a range of physical measurements. Electronic signed consent was obtained, which
included consent for on-going linkage to medical and
health-related records.
UK Biobank received approval from the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care and the
National Health Service North West Centre for Research
Ethics Committee (Ref: 11/NW/0382).
2.2. Diagnosis of kidney stones
Kidney stones were ascertained using hospital inpatient
records, which contain data on hospital admissions, operations, and procedures obtained for the entire cohort from
Hospital Episode Statistics for England, Scottish Morbidity
Record for Scotland, and Patient Episode Database for
Wales. Diagnoses were recorded using the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding system; operations
and procedures were recorded using the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys: Classification of Intervention
and Procedures, version 4 (OPCS-4) coding system. Participants with a kidney stone or renal colic were identified
using ICD-10 codes N20 and N23 (as either a primary or a
secondary diagnosis), and OPCS-4 codes M09, M14, M26–
28, and M31 (as either a primary or a secondary operative
procedure). The codes are described in detail in Supplementary Table 1.
2.3. Assessment of dietary factors and fluid intake
Dietary and fluid intake was self-reported at baseline for all
500 000 participants using a short touchscreen Food-Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), designed to capture “usual”
intake of common food and drink items, as well as to seek
information about common sources of various nutrients
[13]. Daily intake of tea, coffee, water, fresh fruit, dried fruit,
cooked vegetables, and salad/raw vegetables, and weekly
intake of oily fish, nonoily fish, processed meat, poultry,
beef, lamb/mutton, pork, cheese, bread, and cereal were
collected. Participants were also asked whether they added
salt to their food.
Dietary data from the Oxford WebQ, a more detailed
questionnaire than the FFQ [14], available for 188 784 participants at either baseline or 2–3 yr after recruitment, was
used to account for regression dilution bias (ie, random
error in estimated intake introduced by fluctuations in
dietary intake over time and/or measurement error using
the FFQ). For more detail on the derivation of dietary variables from the FFQ and the Oxford WebQ, see the Supplementary material.
2.4. Covariates
Townsend deprivation score was used as an indicator of
socioeconomic status and was assigned to each participant
corresponding to the output area of their residential
postcode at recruitment. Educational qualifications, ethnic
background, smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, and
calcium supplementation use were collected via the
touchscreen questionnaire at recruitment. Body mass index
(BMI; kg/m2
) was derived from weight (kg) using scales and
standing height (metres) measured during the physical
examination at recruitment.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Of the 502 638 participants enrolled in UK Biobank,
7112 participants with a prevalent kidney stone identified
via either self-report at recruitment and/or hospital inpatient records (ie, with a relevant diagnostic or operation
code before the date of recruitment) were excluded. In an
attempt to account for the possibility that pre-existing
conditions would confound any observed associations, a

further 56 454 participants who reported in the touchscreen questionnaire as making major changes to their diet
over the last 5 yr due to illness were also excluded. This
resulted in an analytical dataset of 439 072 participants (see
Fig. 1 for a flowchart of the exclusion criteria).
Person years were calculated from the date of recruitment (2006–2010) until the first incident diagnosis of
kidney stones, date of death, or last date of hospital
admission (31 March 2015), whichever came first. Cox
proportional hazards models were used to assess the
association between dietary factors as measured using
the FFQ at recruitment and subsequent risk of the first
kidney stone. As the analyses presented here generally
involve a comparison of risks across more than two
categories, the floating absolute risk method was used
to estimate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) [15]. Tests
for linear trends across the baseline FFQ categories of
intake were based on the mean intake derived from the
Oxford WebQ. All models were assessed for the proportionality of hazards assumption using Schoenfeld residuals. The main analyses were adjusted for age (in single
years), sex, Townsend deprivation score (quintiles), education (no qualifications, CSE/O-Level/GCSE or equivalent,
AS/A-Level or equivalent, higher education, or other professional qualification), ethnicity (white, mixed background, black, Asian, or other), smoking (never, former,
and current), alcohol (never, special occasions only, one to
three times a month, once or twice a week, three or four
times a week, daily, or almost daily), BMI (<18.5, 18.5–
<25, 25–<30, 30–<35, 35–40, and 40 kg/m2
), and
use of calcium supplementation (no and yes). Participants
with missing data or who responded “prefer not to
answer/do not know” for any of the covariates were
assigned to a separate category for that covariate. The
proportion of data that was assigned as missing or prefer
not to answer/do not know was <0.5% for each covariate,
with the exception of education (1.7%).
In secondary analyses, dietary factors significantly associated with the risk of kidney stones in the main analyses
were included as covariates in order to explore whether
mutual adjustment for dietary factors affected previously
observed associations. To account for reverse causation,
participants who were censored within the first 2 yr of
follow-up were excluded from the analyses.
All p values were two sided, with statistical significance
set at <0.05. Analyses were performed using Stata SE version 13 (StatCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and figures were
produced using RStudio version 1.0.136 using the in-house
package “Jasper”.
3. Results
Of the 439 072 participants included in the analysis,
2057 developed a first incident kidney stone during a total
of 2 685 079 yr of follow-up (mean = 6.1 yr; standard deviation = 0.97). Participants who developed an incident kidney

in more deprived areas, were less educated, had a nonwhite
ethnic background, were current smokers, and were more
likely to be obese compared with the total population
(Table 1). Unadjusted correlations between all dietary factors are shown in Supplementary Table 4.
Total fluid intake is defined as the sum of tea, coffee,
water, and alcohol intake. Intake of fluid from all beverages
as assessed by the Oxford WebQ increased across all categories of baseline total fluid intake as assessed by the FFQ;
for baseline categories of zero to six, seven to eight, nine to
10, 11–12, and 13 cups/glasses per day, the mean intake of

all fluids from the 24 h dietary questionnaire was 1503,
1729, 1942, 2160, and 2484 ml/d (Supplementary Table 5).
This suggests that despite total fluid, as assessed by the FFQ,
being limited to tea, coffee, water, and alcohol intake, this is
nonetheless a reliable indicator of overall fluid intake.
Higher total fluid intake was associated with a lower risk
of kidney stones following adjustment for multiple lifestyle
and socioeconomic factors (Fig. 2). Compared with those
who drank zero to six cups/glasses per day of total fluid, the
hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.72 (95% CI 0.66–0.79), 0.61 (95%
CI 0.55–0.67), 0.62 (95% CI 0.56–0.70), and 0.45 (95% CI
0.40–0.51) for those who drank seven to eight, nine to 10,
11–12, and 13 cups/glasses per day, respectively. This
corresponded to a 13% reduction in risk for each additional
drink per day (equivalent to 200 ml; HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.85–
0.89).
For specific beverages, we found that higher consumption of tea (HR per 200 ml/d = 0.95, 95% CI 0.92–0.99), coffee
(HR per 200 ml/d = 0.92, 95% CI 0.88–0.95), and alcohol (HR
per 200 ml/d = 0.85, 95% CI 0.82–0.88) was individually
significantly associated with a reduced risk of incident
kidney stones, although no association was observed with
water intake (HR per 200 ml/d = 0.99, 95% CI 0.96–1.03;
Fig. 3).
Vegetable intake was not associated with incident kidney stones (HR per 100 g/d = 0.94, 95% CI 0.87–1.03), whilst
fruit intake (HR per 100 g/d = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83–0.93) and
fibre intake (HR per 10 g/d = 0.82, 95% CI 0.77–0.87) were
significantly associated with a reduced risk (Fig. 4).
Consumption of total fish (HR per 25 g/wk = 1.00, 95% CI
0.90–1.12), oily fish (HR per 10 g/wk = 0.97, 95% CI 0.91–
1.04), and nonoily fish (HR per 10 g/wk = 1.04, 95% CI 0.95–
1.13) was not associated with incident kidney stones (Fig. 5).
However, total meat intake was associated with an
increased risk (HR per 50 g/wk = 1.17, 95% CI 1.05–1.29), with
qualitatively similar estimates of risk observed for processed meat (HR per 25 g/wk = 1.12, 95% CI 0.97–1.29), poultry (HR per 50 g/wk = 1.22, 95% CI 1.00–1.49), and red meat
(HR per 50 g/wk = 1.19, 95% CI 1.00–1.41), although these did
not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5). Adding salt to food
(not cooking) was also associated with an increased risk;
compared with those never/rarely added salt to food, those

was adjusted for age, sex, Townsend deprivation score, education, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, and calcium supplementation. Tea, coffee, and
water were adjusted for the same covariates as well as alcohol. For all figures, the position of the square indicates the value of the relative risk, and its
area is inversely proportional to the variance of the logarithm of the relative risk, providing an indication of the amount of statistical information
available for that particular estimate. CI = confidence interval; HR =hazard ratio.

who always added salt to food had a 33% higher risk (HR =
1.33, 95% CI 1.12–1.58). No significant association was
observed with cheese intake (HR per 25 g/wk = 0.95, 95%
CI 0.82–1.10; Fig. 6).
Mutual adjustment for dietary factors that were significant in the abovementioned analyses did not make a material difference to the associations found (Supplementary
Table 6). The associations also remained similar when
excluding participants censored within the first 2 yr of
follow-up, with the exception of vegetable intake, which
was associated with a lower risk of kidney stones after
excluding those diagnosed within the first 2 yr (HR per
100 g/d = 0.89, 95% CI 0.80–0.99, based on 1359 cases; Supplementary Table 7).
4. Discussion
In this UK population-based prospective cohort of over 439
000 middle-aged participants, total fluid intake and a range
of dietary factors were associated with the risk of developing a first incident kidney stone. These results provide
further evidence that diet is a potentially important modifiable factor for the prevention of kidney stone formation.
Similar to meta-analyses of previous observational
studies, we found a linear dose-response reduction in
the risk of kidney stones with increasing amount of fluid
intake [10,11]. When compared with fluid intake of zero
to six glasses per day (approximately 1.2 l), individuals
who drank 13 glasses or more (equivalent to 2.3 l) had a
50% reduced risk of developing kidney stones. This level
of fluid intake is similar to that administered in trials,
which have found that increased fluid intake decreases
the recurrence of kidney stones [6]. International guidelines recommend that patients with kidney stones should
increase their fluid intake to achieve a urine volume of
2.5 l/d in order to reduce stone recurrence [16,17]. In our
study, the reduction in risk with total fluid intake was
primarily due to tea, coffee, and alcohol, which is consistent with the findings of a recent meta-analysis [10]. However, in contrast with the findings from the meta-analysis,
we found no association between water intake and kidney
stone risk, which suggests that specific beverages may
have differential effects on kidney stone formation, and
that beverages that exert a diuretic effect (thereby causing urine dilution) or that contain caffeine may be of
particular relevance.
With regard to other dietary factors, we found that
higher meat intake was associated with an increased risk
of kidney stones; however, previous prospective studies
that have focused mainly on animal protein intake have
produced inconsistent findings [9,18–20]. Two randomised
controlled trials have shown no reduction in kidney stone

recurrence with a diet low in animal protein, although they
were small, consisting of 99 [21] and 175 [22] participants,
respectively. In contrast, another trial in 120 men found that
a diet low in both animal protein and salt reduced the risk of
recurrent kidney stones by 50% compared with a low-calcium diet [23]. We also found that higher salt intake was
associated with an increased risk of kidney stones, although
findings from other observational studies have been

inconsistent [20,21,27,28]. We also found that higher consumption of fruit and fibre was associated with a significant
risk reduction, as has been reported elsewhere in prospective studies [9,24] but notin the one small trialthat assessed
this in relation to recurrent kidney stones [22]. It is possible
that fruit might reduce the risk through increased urinary
citrate (even from noncitrus fruit) and/or its relatively high
fibre content [25].
Strengths of the current study are the large sample size,
wide range of measures available on dietary factors and
possible confounders, and cohort-wide linkage to longitudinal data on hospital inpatient admissions. However, this
does mean that patients who seek treatment solely through
primary care or who do not seek any medical attention are
not captured. Whilst this will lead to an underascertainment of cases, it is unlikely that the association with dietary
factors differ markedly between those cases seeking hospital treatment and those who do not.
The availability of detailed data on dietary intake from
multiple 24-h recall questionnaires (Oxford WebQ) suggests
that total fluid intake corresponded well with categories as
defined by the baseline FFQ, providing assurances that the
latter is a robust indicator of overall fluid intake. The use of
updated data from the Oxford WebQ meant that we could
take into account random error caused by changes in diet
over time and/or measurement error of the FFQ,
Whilst the FFQ used in UK Biobank has been shown to be
a well-established and reliable tool [26], it does not enable
an accurate estimation of nutrient intake, and hence we
were unable to test the association specifically with intake
of dietary calcium or animal protein, nor could we take into
account other dietary factors that may be relevant for stone
disease (eg,types of soft drinks or juice) [27,28]. We also had
insufficient information to explore dietary patterns, and
hence were not able to investigate the hypothesis that a
DASH- or Mediterranean-style diet is associated with a
lower kidney stone risk [8,29,30].
As many patients diagnosed with a first kidney stone
may modify their diet (eg, by increasing fluid intake) based
on medical advice after their initial diagnosis, our intention
was not to assess the dietary determinants of kidney stone
recurrence, but rather the extent to which dietary factors
influence the risk of developing a first incident kidney
stone. However, in order to examine whether our findings
might have been caused by reverse causation, whereby
participants experiencing symptoms may have changed
their diet (eg, by drinking more fluids) prior to being
admitted to hospital with a kidney stone, we excluded a

priori participants who reported having changed their diet
in the last 5 yr due to illness. We also excluded participants
who were diagnosed within 2 yr of baseline and the results
were not materially altered.
There are some other limitations to this study. No information was available on stone composition (such as uric
acid, calcium oxalate), and hence it was not possible to
investigate whether dietary factors differentially affect the
development of stone subtypes. Whilst we were able to take
into account a wide range of potential confounders that did
not make an appreciable difference to the risk estimates,
confounding by other factors remains a possibility and
causality cannot be inferred based on these findings.
5. Conclusions
Increased fluid intake, as well as consumption of fruit and
foods high in fibre, was associated with a lower risk of
developing a first kidney stone, whilst higher meat consumption and salt intake were associated with a higher risk.
The lower risk of kidney stones observed for tea, coffee, and
alcohol, but not water, might reflect a potential diuretic
effect and warrants further investigation. Overall, this study
suggests that the risk of kidney stones could be decreased
through relatively simple dietary modifications.
