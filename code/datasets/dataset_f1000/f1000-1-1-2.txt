This is an interesting article, and I think it makes a positive contribution to the evidence base. However, I think the introduction understates the level of knowledge that people with HIV are likely to have about HIV (see below). The discussion also neglects to consider the fact that due to stigmatization of this disease, many people with HIV do not admit that they have it or even that they have been tested for it. Unfortunately, this is hard to study or measure, but in practice, I have seen that it is especially true for men, even after they have known about their disease and have been on ART for a long time. In this study people who admitted to having been tested before were rightfully excluded from the analysis, but the discussion should acknowledge that stigma and other factors may mean that many people who actually knew about their status already (but lied about it) could still have been included in the data, seriously confounding the analysis. In countries like Mozambique which receive significant foreign assistance to deal with the HIV epidemic (PEPFAR, Global Fund or other) â€“ people with HIV who are aware of their status typically receive much more intensive education about HIV (through treatment programs and social programs for people with HIV) than the general public. The content of this education is globally standardized enough that it typically places considerable emphasis on the modes of transmission of HIV. Also, as for people with any health condition, people with HIV are inherently more likely to pay attention to any information on HIV that they come across (public awareness campaigns, etc.).
