 This work fills a much-needed gap in the molecular modeling and cheminformatics arena. Far too often, authors of computational papers publish work that is difficult, if not impossible, to reproduce. In many cases, the structures and data used to develop and validate a new method are not included with the paper. When structures are included, they are typically supplied as images. Thus, the only way to reproduce the work is to go through a painstaking, often error prone, process of redrawing structures. If modeling and informatics are to advance, we need to do everything we can to promote reproducibility. We also need to have standard datasets that can be used to readily compare existing methods with new techniques. Datasets like DUD from the Shoichet group and MUV from the Baumann group provide a good start, but we need more. We also need more dialog and critical assessments of these datasets. The datasets provided with this paper will provide important tools for the development, comparison, and evaluation of new computational methods. In addition to releasing a large number of datasets, the authors have also provided software that allows those reading their papers to critically evaluate their groupâ€™s published methods on their own datasets. The release of this software also enables the reader to compare new methods with methods they may already be using. I applaud Hu and Bajorath for their efforts to promote open science and to provide datasets that will hopefully provide the basis for a large body of future work.
