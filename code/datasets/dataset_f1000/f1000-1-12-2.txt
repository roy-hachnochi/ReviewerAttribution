 The author proposes a new model for how proteins in intraerythrocytic stages of the malarial parasite could be transported from the parasite endoplasmic reticulum to the host cell cytoplasm. The new model is compatible with much of the existing Plasmodium protein export literature and incorporates additional mechanistic insights from other protein trafficking process. In particular, a compelling case is made for key processing and transport steps in Plasmodium protein export occurring on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER and transport vesicles based on the known topology of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate and protein N-acetylation reactions, both of which have been shown to be involved in plasmodium protein export. Another major feature of this model is that exported soluble and membrane proteins are transported from the parasite plasma membrane to the parasitophorous vacuole via membrane vesicles. The internalization of proteins into transport vesicles draws on precedents observed during autophagy and is plausible, but raises important questions about the role of a parasite-derived multi-protein complex in the PV membrane that is thought to translocate parasite proteins across this membrane.
