 The authors provide an excellent-outstanding computational analyses of the e. coli pangenome with respect to protein coding across more than 50 complete genomes and 350 complete and whole genome shotgun (incomplete) genomes. Importantly, they evaluate the proteins and protein families by recomputing/predicting families, rather than relying on GenBank/RefSeq annotations, which can vary depending upon source. Their work is well-documented and should serve as a gold standard for pangenome analyses of protein families for many bacteria. There are however, some minor improvements that can be made to this paper: 1. On top right column of page 7, the authors explicitly state that “Only two genomes are identical… BL21(DE3). Since several non-identical K-12 strains are included in their Data File(MG1655, W3110, DH10A, and a couple others), authors should simply state how many K-12 strains were included in their analyses. 2. It would be especially helpful to the community, if the authors can post data files of their analyses, e.g., the raw data used to generate their pie charts in Figure 7. I am sure users would more widely cite their efforts if such results can be made easily accessible.
