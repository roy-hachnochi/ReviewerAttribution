 The idea presented by the authors is a good one and I was very interested in reading more about their success or their outcome. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed as all that was presented in the paper was about a third of the story. They demonstrated that they could transform potato; however potato transformation is not new and of itself is an insufficient single result not deserving of publication. They did not demonstrate expression of erythropoetin or that using the patatin promoter would give sufficient expression to be of interest. Patatin is a major protein in potato but protein levels in potato are still quite low (~2%). The idea of using the starch extraction method to enrich the protein fraction is a good idea but again they did not present any follow-up that showed it would work for this particular protein of interest. When additional information is available it should be considered for publication but not before. In addition, I would recommend the authors seek a person more conversant in English to assist them in writing the next version.
