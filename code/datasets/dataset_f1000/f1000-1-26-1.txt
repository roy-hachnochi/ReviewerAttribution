As expressed by the authors, the aim of this study was to develop a protocol for the production of erythropoietin (EPO), a pleiotropic cytokine with remarkable tissue-protective activities in addition to its well establish role in red blood cell production, in the Indian tetraploid potato variety Kufri Bahar. The recent FDA approval of Elelyso™, the first plant-made pharmaceutical for treatment of Type I Gaucher disease in humans, has renewed worldwide interest of using plants as viable production platforms for human and veterinary therapeutics. Although improving the production of EPO in plants is a topic of relevance, unfortunately the data described in this work is too preliminary and falls short from accomplishing the goal set by the authors. The key information lacking here is the level of expression of EPO achieved in this system, the demonstration that the expression level is stable over generations of these transgenics, and more importantly the proof that the expressed EPO is functional. The authors also failed to include in the introduction and to compare their strategy with the one of other groups who have successfully produced EPO in other plant expression systems Conley et al (2009) 1 2 Conley et al (2010) 3 , Sperb et al.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions The idea presented by the authors is a good one and I was very interested in reading more about their success or their outcome. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed as all that was presented in the paper was about a third of the story. They demonstrated that they could transform potato; however potato transformation is not new and of itself is an insufficient single result not deserving of publication. They did not demonstrate expression of erythropoetin or that using the patatin promoter would give sufficient expression to be of interest. Patatin is a major protein in potato but protein levels in potato are still quite low (~2%). The idea of using the starch extraction method to enrich the protein fraction is a good idea but again they did not present any follow-up that showed it would work for this particular protein of interest. When additional information is available it should be considered for publication but not before. In addition, I would recommend the authors seek a person more conversant in English to assist them in writing the next version. Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed.
