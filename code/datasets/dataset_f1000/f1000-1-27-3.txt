 The premise of this study is based on a theoretical model ( Pollard 2010, Behavioral Ecology ) demonstrating that receivers might use signaler identity to infer signaler reliability. Such a framework may be appropriate when different signalers vary in their reliability, but in the case of alarm cues released from dead or wounded fish, the likelihood of dishonest alarm signals seem low. In other words, it is not clear why one would expect different responses to kin or non-kin alarm cues in these cichlid fish. Given that these cues must always honestly signal the presence of predator because of how they are released when an individual is wounded, fish would be expected to respond to any cue they find in the water. I therefore wonder if in this type of system that kin selection hypothesis is even appropriate to test. It is therefore not surprising to me that the authors find no difference in response to kin or non-kin alarm cues. I would have liked to have seen more discussion about the appropriateness of testing this model in this type of signal-receiver system.
