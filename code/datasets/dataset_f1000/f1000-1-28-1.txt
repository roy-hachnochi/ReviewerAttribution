 The author has failed to mention if this patient had ever received any chemotherapy previously and if they did what agents were used. Also what was the initial presentation of myeloma in this patient? The only imaging modality used was a Chest X-ray, it would have been helpful to know if a CT scan was done to evaluate if any pleural based mass was present along with the pleural effusion.
