 This article focuses on the challenges of blood donation in a tertiary care hospital in western India and presents a retrospective study of blood donor deferrals from a 3-month period from Jan 2011-March 2011. The study concluded that the deferral rate was 22.36% with a 17.29% permanent deferral rate for donors. Hypertension was the most common cause for a permanent deferral, and anemia was the most common cause for temporary deferral. Of interest, the paper concluded that the majority of donors were between 18-30 years of age. The limitations of this study are that it does not address issues of donor awareness and details about the recruitment process for these donors. Information is unavailable if these donors would in fact be return donors. Additional data, such as a survey given to donors, would be needed to understand the motivation of a regular voluntary donor and the impact of a temporary deferral. While this paper does give interesting information about deferral statistics, and meets the stated aim of the study, the results and conclusions do not really address donor awareness, and therefore conclusions are limited to assess the real impact on donor return rates in a voluntary donor program in India.
