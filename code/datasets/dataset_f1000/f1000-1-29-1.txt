 Upon review, the title of the article and the actual research in the paper show a considerable discrepancy. The study itself seems to focus more on the reasons for deferral and not so much on awareness as stated in the title. Furthermore, there is no indication of the contents of an assumed awareness. Overall, the outcome provides some local demographic and some medical (deferral) information, which as such is nothing new or exciting. However, the awaking interest in a safe and sustainable blood supply in India deserves some peer appreciation.
