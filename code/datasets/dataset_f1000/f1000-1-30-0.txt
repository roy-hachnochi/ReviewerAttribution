 I am pleased to approve this article for publication. I have the following three brief comments: 1. It is important to acknowledge that partial protection, or protection of some components of biodiversity, is possible in places used predominantly for purposes other than biodiversity protection. The qualification of the MEA, noted by Faith, that it is difficult to measure such a contribution must also be acknowledged. 2. More intensively transformed places may also contribute ecosystem services even though they protect little or almost no biodiversity. For example, the sediment free water that sugar cane plantations can deliver (although that water may contain dissolved nutrients). 3. As a comment - an aside really - I wonder how anything can have non-anthropogenic values when those values are being assigned by people.
