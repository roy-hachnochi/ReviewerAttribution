 The authors described a case of association of Hodgkin’s disease with systemic lupus erythematosus. This clinical report is interesting, if not novel, and reminds the clinician that persistent lymphadenopathy in SLE patients, can be due in some case to a curable malignancy. In my opinion, the report is too preliminary to allow the reader to conclude independently on the validity of the author’s findings. A revised version of this report should include the following points; 1. To support their diagnosis and their conclusion, the authors should describe and document the clonality studies performed. 2. A selection of histological/immunohistochemical stainings on which the diagnosis was based would also be useful. 3. One proposed mechanism for the association of of Hodgkin’s disease with systemic lupus erythematosus is immunosupression due to treatment of SLE. The authors mentioned and discussed that viral serology for Epstein-Barr virus was negative, but did they investigate whether the EBV genone could be detected in pathological samples or the blood of the patients? 4. Table 1 should be referenced and completed, so that reader can appreciate a) whether the ‘Potential links between systemic lupus erythematosus and malignancy’ rely on documented evidence, b) the level of that evidence, and c) the nature of the malignancies associated with SLE (i.e. Hodgkin’s disease only, or other cancers).
