 I have read this article with interest and I think it is a good paper, however I do have some reservations. The main one being there is no independent validation cohort and this is based on n=8 gastric cancers. I think if the authors tested their method on an independent cohort of samples (blinded) it would provide a very good validation. The other point is more pragmatic; do the authors still require an endoscopy to collect the gastric juice? If they will do this by less invasive means (e.g. nasogastric tube suction) they should evaluate the technique using that method. Otherwise if a patient is having an endoscopy you will be able to visualize a gastric cancer.
