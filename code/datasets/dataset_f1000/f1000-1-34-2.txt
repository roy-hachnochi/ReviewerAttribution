 The authors do discuss the FLOT3 trial at disproportionate detail compared to the rest of the discussion and probably a bit too excessively in response to the case reported. Whilst these data are interesting, it would be helpful to place these in a bit more context in relation to the case reported. There are some typographical and grammatical errors in the Discussion section (pre-operative and insufficient data in the first paragraph). The discussion about irinotecan and docetaxel combinations in the Discussion section: the authors could clarify whether they are primarily discussing the situation of current knowledge or as it stood in 2004. It would be most appropriate to discuss the current state of this combination in the article.
