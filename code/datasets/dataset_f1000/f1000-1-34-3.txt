 Overall, this case report is interesting and worthy of publication. There are however a few revisions that should be made: 1. In the Introduction section (2nd paragraph, 1st sentence), the chemotherapy scheme used in the patient is not the same as the one used by the study referenced; the scheme should be justified. 2. In the Introduction section (3rd paragraph, last sentence) there are more recent references to justify the classification statement ( Thuss-Patiente Eur J Cancer 2011 , Kang Clin Oncol 2012 and Van Cutsem ASCO GI 2012). 3. In the Discussion section (4th 5th paragraphs) the authors refer to a study published in ASCO/JCO 2008, not 2011 which they have stated. 4.In the Discussion section (5th paragraph) the authors describe a study extensively with compared with the rest of the article, maybe authors should justify why (the use of docetaxel?). 5. The authors should discuss more extensively the use of the three lines with different efficacies in the neoadjuvant setting, and they should also address the issue of long gastric patient survivors. 6. In the Reference section, references 9 and 10 references refer to the same study; it is the newest one should appear, and the older one can be removed.
