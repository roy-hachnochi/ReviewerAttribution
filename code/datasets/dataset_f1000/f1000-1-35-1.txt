In the present study, Qazi et al . examined the effect of storage on levels of nitric oxide derivatives in blood components. They examined the biochemical changes in the nitric oxide metabolism in red blood cell transfusions and reported that nitrite concentrations initially decreased rapidly and stabilized afterwards for up to 42 days. Under hypoxic conditions in an argon chamber there are even less nitrite levels compared to room air. In my opinion the data provided by the authors is interesting as they show a long-term view on nitrite levels in red blood cell transfusions and provide valuable information about optimizing the preservation of stored blood. These findings definitely extend the current knowledge base in the field.
