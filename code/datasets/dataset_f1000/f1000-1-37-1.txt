 The work carried out in this research article is in no way novel, and it provides very little in terms of being an important and relevant study. The study design uses a very small sample size (23 patients) and the inclusion criteria of the subjects is poor. Because of this weak study design, the work itself has little to no applicability. Other reasons why the work is of poor scientific value is that the work is; 1. It is a retrospective analysis, therefore the collection of the data is not standardized. 2. There are is a mix of different diseases (all treated with prednisone) which themselves carry their own cause of complications. 3. The doses of the glucocorticoids were different in each case as was the length of the therapy. 4. There was no control group for the study.
