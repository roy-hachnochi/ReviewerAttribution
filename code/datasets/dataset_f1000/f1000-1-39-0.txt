 The authors report a case of pleural effusion as an initial presentation of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in an adult patient with no physical exam findings suggestive of leukemia and or malignancy. The authors corroborated the exudative nature of this symptomatic s pleural effusion by flow cytometric analysis for CD34+ and CD13+ antigens and supported their diagnosis by bone marrow studies and cytogenetic analysis which showed a trisomy 21 pattern. While a chemotherapeutic regimen of Cytarabine and Idarubicine inhibited further progression and re accumulation of the pleural effusion, the patient’s condition deteriorated leading to his death. Given the dismal nature of the patient’s AML prognosis, hematologists need to be aware of this atypical and rare AML presentation. More importantly, pulmonary physicians should acquaint themselves with this clinical scenario because such patients present first to them and not to hematologists. Pleural effusion has been reported in association with solid tumors and sometimes as their presenting sign. A multivariate analysis by Faiz et al., Leukemia Lymphoma (2012) between 1997 and 2007 showed that 111 patients with acute leukemias had pleural effusions and the median overall survival in these patients was shorter than those with absence of pleural effusions. Other studies revealed rare occurrences of pleural effusion in AML patients. The authors need to highlight salient features of previously reported patients and compare them with their patient hoping to find predictive factors for development of such rare clinical scenarios and define better treatments.
