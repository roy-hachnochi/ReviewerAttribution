 This case report describes a case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that presented with a large pleural effusion. This unusual presentation is important to recognize when evaluating patients with pleural effusions. This particular case report illustrates the importance of a cytopathology evaluation. The report itself would benefit from an updated reference on chromosomal abnormalities in AML, and it would also be helpful to know the doses of the chemotherapeutic agents and if the patient was treated on a clinical trial for newly diagnosed AML.
