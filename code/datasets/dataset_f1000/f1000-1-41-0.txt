 In general, This is a well written case report of salivary duct carcinoma. In this case, like most rare and poorly differentiated salivary neoplasms, the correct diagnosis was only possible on the final specimen despite FNA, frozen, and permanent section histopathology of the metastatic lymph nodes. While the immunohistochemistry is reviewed in the discussion, it is not specified how it was used in this particular case. This report will not alter the clinical management of this disease but it highlights the most salient points in the clinical diagnosis of salivary ductal carcinoma.
