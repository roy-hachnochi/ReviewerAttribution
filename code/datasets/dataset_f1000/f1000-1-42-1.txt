 This is an excellent review of a rare disorder, Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome. The authors present a thorough presentation of the nature of this disorder, followed by an illustrative case of a patient who developed paradoxical vocal cord mobility during phrenic nerve stimulation. Utilization of phrenic nerve-paced respiration is carried out in effort to obviate the need for tracheotomy tube placement in these patients. However, the authors noted that this technique can lead to absence of vocal cord abduction on inspiration, which in turn leads to vocal fold closure and airway obstruction, secondary to the Bernouilli effect. Intraoperative photos are provided, as well as the outcome for this, and potentially future patients seen with this disorder.
