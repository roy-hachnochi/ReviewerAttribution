This is a cross-sectional comparative study of two age-matched groups, each of 20 participants, the first being obese (BMI 30-35 kg/m 2 ), the second (control) group with BMI 20-29 kg/m 2 , in which the effect of obesity on markers of ovarian reserve in the early follicular phase was investigated. Cases and controls were attending the fertility clinic for tubal infertility and had regular menstrual cycles. Student’s t test was used to compare groups and Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate relationships between study parameters. No differences between groups were found for AMH, FSH, E2 and antral follicle count (AFC); no correlation was found between BMI and AMH, FSH and AFC, but a significant positive correlation was found between BMI and E2. My main concern is that the design and the study size of the work was insufficient to draw any conclusion whatsoever. No sample size calculations were reported, neither was type B error. Although BMI in the study cases was significantly higher than in control cases, the BMI range of the control group included overweight women as well, thus limiting the contrast between groups in this regard.
