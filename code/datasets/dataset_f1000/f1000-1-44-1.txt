 This is an interesting study with important findings regarding the increased risk for respiratory events in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients who were not adherent to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. There are, however, limitations to this study in that the decision-makers were not blinded to the purpose of the study and the definition of “respiratory events” was all encompassing and included initiation of nasal CPAP for oxygen desaturations that failed to respond to O 2 alone. Conceivably, due to the nature of the OSA and its treatment, it may have been prudent to have included only the following; application of an oral airway, prolonged postoperative ventilation, unplanned admission to the intensive care unit, post-operative pneumonia, and respiratory failure/re-intubation. Furthermore, Cox-proportional hazards analysis with time-to-event and adjustment for covariates could have increased the power and have adjusted for known confounders (such as anxiolytics) in this observational study. Lastly, a caveat for the finding that there was no difference in respiratory events between OSA and non-OSA group should be that there may not have been sufficient power to detect any differences. A power analysis for such comparison if performed prior to study initiation could have been helpful.
