 The authors appear not to be aware of the current literature which clearly distinguishes the tomographic patterns of inferior keratoconus from Pellucid. The limitation of curvature analysis and the importance of the pachymetric map have been previously well documented. The authors reference list is outdated and lacks articles that clearly describe the tomographic findings of true Pellucid: Walker RN et al. (2008) , Belin MW et al. (2011) and Belin MW et al. (2012) . The anterior curvature patters described as “crab claw” or many other descriptors are non-specific and highlight the limitations of curvature when trying to imply shape. Adding additional descriptors (e.g. bell shape) is counterproductive. The authors use the term “tomographic” without making a distinction between anterior curvature (classic topography) and tomography which includes both anterior and posterior corneal elevation and corneal thickness maps. The pachymetric “bell sign” is also a poor descriptor and is seen in this example because of the scale chosen. If the authors had chosen an appropriate scale that covered the full range of thickness, they would see the more classic inferior band that has been previously described and published. The case report is fraught with mistakes. First the authors keep stating that the best-fit-sphere was used but the machine is set for a toric-ellipsoid. The pachymetric map has not reliable data inferior, which is why no thickness readings are produced. One cannot diagnose true PMD in this case. All in all, the paper is poorly researched and the maps show a lack of understanding of the displays.
