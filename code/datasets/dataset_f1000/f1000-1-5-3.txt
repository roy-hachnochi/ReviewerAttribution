 This Commentary by Mark Boothby adds to the increasingly louder voices expressing their concerns about the trajectory of NIH-funded biomedical research. It takes the plain numbers and places them in the context of the day-to-day reality in a R01-based research group which, as the title suggests, might be a species going extinct. While some critics might portrait this manuscript as a complete exaggeration and an unwarranted “the end of the world is near” song, the underlying facts and numbers are quite clear – the number of old-school R01-supported labs is slowly but surely shrinking. Allocation of public funds for scientific research is a political decision, and as such they are a compromise between opposing force that try to achieve their very own agenda – on the one side the supporters of large goal-oriented research programs (largely the powerful leaders of such huge and expensive projects – while many scientist would love to be such leader, very few would simply dream of being only a tiny little almost dispensable piece of such big scientific machinery) on the other hand the traditional principal investigator who follows his own intuition and fights every five years to get his R01 renewed to continue his work. Thus lobbying to reconsider the ongoing changes is a legitimate action, and this commentary spells out what has been a major topic of conversations during coffee breaks at scientific conferences and grant study sections. One question that remains, however, is whether the arguments of scientists have a stronger impact when presented in a somewhat dull and sober style like a traditional research paper, or as it is done here in a more accessible fashion, including a healthy dose of cynicism. Clearly, this is up to the reader to decide, but even if one does not like the tone, hopefully some of the message will stick.
