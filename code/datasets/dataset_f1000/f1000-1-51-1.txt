 A few comments should be made about this case report. The first is that the authors note low serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D. This is not parathyroid hormone (PTH) dependent and an etiology should be sought, i.e. inadequate sun exposure or failure of adequate vitamin D in the diet or any dietary supplements. Also, the low serum magnesium levels, while not reported, might contribute to peripheral PTH resistance. Another thing to note is that advances in this field should be anticipated. For example, the use of parathyroid hormone replacement therapy and the advent of calcilytics (which are not yet marketed), would interfere with the action of the parathyroid calcium sensing receptor preventing a decrease in the set point for circulating calcium suppression of parathyroid hormone production or release.
