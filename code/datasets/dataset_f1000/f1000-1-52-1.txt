 This paper presents interesting data on a fact that has been ignored by many researchers working on the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and that is the presence of virus-like particles in the experimental animal tissue samples. For the first time, the J2 monoclonal antibodies against long dsRNA had been used in the scrapie infected tissue. The accumulations of the antibodies in cortical neurons of the infected brain seem to be present in contrast to the controls. This fact itself deserves attention and suggests further testing of the J2 monoclonal antibodies in TSEs. In the discussion section, the author suggests the satellite nature of the infectious agent without supporting evidence that comes from his experimental data. Nevertheless, it is still a viable reminder that such a possibility should not be ruled out at the present development in the field of TSEs research. The experimental approach that had been used is unique and deserves further experimental trails by other investigators since more has to be done to identify the nature of the infectious agent of TSEs. This work could be a valuable contribution to the discovery of its identity.
