 This paper is scientifically poor. The author’s claim is based only on the data presented in figure 3, which is far from being convincing. What’s more, the data presented in Figures 1 and 2 (the documentation of the specificity of the J2 antibody) clearly show the presence of long ds RNA in both prion-infected and uninfected cell cultures.
