In my opinion, the title is misleading because iron levels are not measured in this study, only hemoglobin levels. The summary does reflect the content of the article. However, the introduction needs to be revised. Firstly, it is mentioned that malnutrition is associated with low iron levels and that anaemia, via cerebral hypoxia and other possible mechanisms, has a major negative influence on cognitive function. Malnutrition is not always associated with low iron levels as it depends on what nutrients are missing in the diet. Also, anemia (low hemoglobin levels) is not always caused by a low iron status. Considering that only hemoglobin levels are measured, I suggest approaching the introduction from this angle. Materials and methodology have been correctly explained and correspond with the topic being studied. However, the precision of the Sahlis method of measuring hemoglobin compared to the hemiglobincyanide or cyanmethemoglobin method should be mentioned, as well as the statistical software and correlation coefficients used. Concerning the discussion and conclusion, I dont think that the smaller number of male participants explains why positive results were observed in male participants only. Factors related to womens physiology such as the moment of the menstrual cycle is an important factor affecting cognitive functioning and this should be brought up here. In my opinion, we cant explain the absence of significant relationships in female participants saying that male participants reached statistical significances because there were a smaller number of them. The discussion and conclusion need to be revised.
