 This paper is subject to a number of weaknesses, in particular omitted variable bias, whereby political affiliation is almost certainly confounded by other factors â€“ a point conceded by the authors when they note the limited variables they have. A further problem is the lack of a plausible mechanism. Another is the fact that the factors that give rise to different causes of death act over different time periods. As voter preference must act through these risk factors, voter preference at a single point in time will influence deaths at many different times in the future, depending on the cause. For example, starting smoking will kill you in 30 years, getting drunk may kill you today. Hence, although interesting, interpretation of the findings is difficult
