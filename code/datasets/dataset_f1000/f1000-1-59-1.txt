 This is an interesting opinion piece that suggests authors of scientific papers, may through their decision to submit, be inducing a correlation between the quality of paper and whether the results are negative or positive. It also suggests there may be an inherent tendency for better quality research to come up with truly positive results. So there is possibly an association between quality and positiveness of results in papers submitted to journals. If so, then we would expect to see papers selected on quality showing more positive results than those rejected. The lack of such an association suggests there may indeed be something amiss, but hardly anything more than that. A suggestion for the author is to change the title to: ‘Misunderstanding publication bias: editors are perhaps not blameless after all’.
