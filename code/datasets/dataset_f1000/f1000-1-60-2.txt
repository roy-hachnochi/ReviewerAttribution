 The authors of this paper have looked at the difficulties in scaling up breast feeding and pneumonia and the IMCI interventions in a region of Peru. They are to be commended for their ’360 degree look’ at the problems and in trying to find solutions from the workers and carers within the system. The answers are not new but need repeating; many problems could be solved if the recommendations from within the service are listened to and carried out. Other health services could ask similar questions of their health service providers and users and would probably find similar suggestions to act upon.
