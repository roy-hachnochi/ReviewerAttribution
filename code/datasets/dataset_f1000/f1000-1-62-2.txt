 - The overall content of this work is very poor. It contains: growth of bacteria in medium, PCR, sequencing, sequence alignment and a homology model. It is what is done today in a student practicum. - The homology model (structure of subunit α, Supplementary Figure 3) is a homology model based on a model (this was NO real structure), which basically also means, one could just take 4 random alpha helices and put them together in a bundle. - The authors should mention in the methods section which genes from F o were amplified by PCR. - Supplementary material figure 1: The window ledge and the arm of the photographer is visible on the picture. - Supplementary material figure 2: The quality of the left EM micrograph is poor, the picture is not in focus. The picture on the right side is distorted, I cannot see anything there. - Page 5 line 1: The Cook lab did not use Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 but rather Bacillus TA2.A1 - Figure 2 and Figure 3: The alignment should contain Bacillus TA2 because the authors refer to it in the text on Reference 25 (McMillan et al. ). - Figures 2 and 3 appear to be very similar. It may have made more sense to include all the information in one figure to avoid redundancies and save space. The scientific value of this work is questionable. It is a good start to investigate the α-subunit from Stenotrophomonas but it is too early to publish as such.
