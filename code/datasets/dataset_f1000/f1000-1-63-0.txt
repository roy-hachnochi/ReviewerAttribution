 The authors spoke about a diagnosis of synovial sarcoma but there is no evidence of the research of the t(x; 18)(p11.2; q11.2) translocation for this case. I’m sorry, but to establish a diagnosis of synovial sarcoma the positivity of the translocation is needed. Without the presence of this test I couldn’t judge the rest of the paper. If the authors forgot to write in the paper the execution of the test, they have to write it; otherwise I do not approve the paper.
