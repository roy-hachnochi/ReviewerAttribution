 This is a well-written review on the possible mechanisms linking synaptic activity to gene transcription. The author provides a thoughtful consideration of technical and analytic challenges confronted by researchers addressing this question. The outline of a model of how synaptic activity signals are conveyed to the nucleus is given. This model, in conjunction with local synaptic 'tagging' hypotheses, provides a clearer picture of a complex process underlying long-term changes at synapses.
