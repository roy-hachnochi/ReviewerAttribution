 'INP' is not a helpful initialism because the most reasonable alternative to intraspecific nest parasitism is interspecific, which also starts with an 'I'. In the past 'conspecific brood parasitism' or 'conspecific nest parasitism', hence CBP or CNP, has been used. Alternatively, just drop the initialism and use the whole phrase. The writing is substandard in places, with respect to spelling (e.g., ' its' '), colloquialisms (e.g., 'more and more'), grammar (e.g. 'reasons of', or referring to the starling as 'they'); all of these examples are from the introduction. The pattern of nest visits to nest #26, combined with the numbers of eggs found, does not establish that more than one egg was laid in a given day, nor that there was a day gap between two eggs. Seven eggs could have been laid consecutively between April 18th-24th. In this case a nest visit on the 20th after laying would have met with 3 eggs; a nest visit on the 24th before laying would have met with 6 eggs; and a nest visit on April 27th at any time would have met with 7 eggs. This is consistent with the report, so no parasitism can be concluded. There is insufficient evidence of parasitism for nest #27. A paler egg, also failing to hatch, do not constitute conclusive evidence for parasitism. The egg laid in nest #37 a month after one clutch was laid could have been laid by the same or another female. The gap method of determining parasitism is relevant during the laying and incubation period of a female, not a month later. So it turns out that all three of the nests where parasitism is claimed are problematic. There is insufficient evidence here for nest parasitism.
