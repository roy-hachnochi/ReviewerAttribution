 This succinct scholarly review has an interesting story but its title could mislead. Accordingly it gives a nice account about how B cells subserve a protective function other than by their main raison dâ€™etre (antibody production). What it does not do is to provide any evidence for contradictory terminology.

Cells, like us, have many activities some of which are primary and pay the bills and others minor distractions- like surfing if you happen to live in San Diego!
