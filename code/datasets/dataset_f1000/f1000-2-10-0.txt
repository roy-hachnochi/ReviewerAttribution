The title: “III. Cellular ultrastructures in situ as key to understanding tumor energy metabolism: biological significance of the Warburg effect” is the appropriate for the content of the article. The abstract seems longer than needed – I suggest focusing on the observed findings of the present study. The methods are well documented, except there is little information about the chamber and how cells were implanted into the chamber. In the results section, I suggest: Showing the mitochondrial profiles typical of the resting phase of the cell cycle (fragmented mitochondria) described in the results section Adding an enlarged figure of mitochondria which is converting into peroxisomes in the erythroblasts described in the legend of the figure 1., peroxisomes forming in the tumor cells described or showed in the figures 1, 2. Showing the mini-chondria and eu-chondria described in the results section
