The authors provide an interesting and detailed description of the ultrastructure of breast tumor spheroids ectopically implanted into immunocompromised mice. They describe numerous changes in mitochondrial and peroxisomal structure during the development of tumors in this model. Although the structural descriptions are interesting, there are limitations to the conclusions about metabolism that may be drawn from this type of analysis. For example, changes in mitochondrial appearance do not necessarily force an increase in the glycolytic rate, as suggested. Other conclusions drawn from the microscopy studies, including the presence of hypoxia at the level of single cells, and the origin of individual cells within weeks-old tumor structures, are not well validated.
