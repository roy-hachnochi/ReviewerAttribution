This article provides not only a useful review of the ways in which nanotechnology can contribute to the field of THz medical imaging but also a review of the possibilities and shortcomings of the field in general. I believe that it will be of interest to both nanotechnology and THz researchers in general. A good list of references is provided. The authors concentrate on issues related to contrast agents, sources and detectors and mention many of the most widely-used and promising of these. Highlighting the potential impact of nanotechnology marks this review out from other THz review articles. The abstract and conclusion sections are appropriate and provide a useful summary for anyone briefly scanning the article. The publication search method used by the authors is clearly described. Minor comments The authors switch between THz and terahertz throughout the article. On page 4 (3rd paragraph). I find the sentence “The THz imaging systems can be separated into two main categories: Passive (also named incoherent) and Active (also named coherent) Pulsed or Continuous” confusing. Which are the 2 categories? Are all passive systems incoherent and pulsed? etc. Incoherent and coherent refer to the detection of the radiation, not whether the imaging set-up is active or passive. Should it be phrased “THz imaging systems can be separated according to whether they are active or passive, incoherent or coherent, continuous or pulsed”. Page 4 2nd column, 2nd paragraph “.. separated depending on whether …” or “separated on the basis of...” Would it be worth a line in the text (it is in table 2) that an advantage to THz is that it can propagate through materials such as bandages. Towards end of p.8 change " capacity" to " heat capacity ". In the Conclusion, 1st line, “..emerging THz imaging modality..." should be changed to “ ..emerging THz imaging modalities.”
