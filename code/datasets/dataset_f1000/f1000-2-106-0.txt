This article by Vogel et al . raises the very interesting and crucial problem of rifampicin coated catheters posing a threat due to Candida growth. Rifampicin by itself is not active against Candida , however various studies have shown that its combination with amphotericin B may enhance the anti-C andida activity. Comments Fig. 1D: Detection of fibronectin retention - This is very difficult to conclude from the given photograph. The photograph depicts crowded accumulation of Candida . Where are the "Fibronectin fibres"? Please provide high resolution photos, and provide evidence for the fibronectic fibres. Fig. 1E: "Western blot of SC5314"- this statement is not correct. Western blot or immunoblot should be detecting the protein, though in this figure the detection is of fibronectin - the readers will get confused as the sentence is not correct. Please provide the fibronectin addition as Î¼g/ml rather than the percentage. It would be beneficial if the authors look into the status of fibronectic binding proteins in Candida 's response to rifampicin. Fig. 3A: Densitometric analysis is required to appreciate the induction of CSH1 gene in response to rifampicin. Fig. 3B: For the western blot, housekeeping genes from Candida should be used as a loading control, and the densitometric analysis should be provided. The dose dependent response to rifampicin is required. How does rifampicin induce the CSH expression? What is the mechanism? The discussion should be strengthened by providing the probable mechanism. Is this phenomenon specific to rifampicin?
