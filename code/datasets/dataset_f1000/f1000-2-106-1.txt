This paper describes the effect of rifampicin on adhesion and hydrophobicity of Candida albicans . This is an important issue because (1) this antibiotic is commonly used and (2) Candida albicans is prone to develop biolfilms that are resistant to a number of antifungal drugs. The authors convincingly show that cells treated with rifampicin make more germ tubes, change their hydrophobicity and become more adherent to fibronectin. They also demonstrate that these phenotypic changes are associated with an increased expression of the gene CSH1 . However, it remains to be proved that these phenotypes and the increased expression are mechanistically linked. The analysis of CSH1âˆ† strain phenotype in presence of rifampicin could provide information concerning this matter.
