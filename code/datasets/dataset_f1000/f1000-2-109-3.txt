This article provides useful information for further assessing the role of Akt signaling in the activation of CD4+ T cells. The microarray experiments that assess the effect of an Akt inhibitor compound on gene regulation by TCR/CD28 co-stimulation are well done and the accompanying bioinformatics analyses are quite sophisticated such that identified changes in gene expression needed to have passed multiple statistical tests. Although a good starting point for further studies, the data presented have several limitations. First, the experiments were carried out entirely with a T cell line. It would have been straightforward, and of significant value, to confirm some of the key gene expression changes in primary T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in the presence or absence of the Akt inhibitor. It is of interest that two of the Akt-dependent genes identified in this report are IL-13 and IL-4, suggesting that Akt is critical for the effector functions of Th2 cells. It would be worthwhile to discuss the role of Akt signaling in Th2 polarization versus Th2 function and to refer to, or propose, further studies to address this question. Second, as for any study employing chemical inhibitors, it would have been useful for the authors to briefly review selectivity of this compound as well as known off-target effects on other kinases. In this regard, confirming some of the key gene expression changes by using other commercially available Akt inhibitors with different off-target effects would help confirm the dependence on Akt. Similarly, the conclusion that many of the Akt-regulated genes may be co-regulated by NF-kB or Myc could have been tested in a limited fashion. Despite these limitations, which will likely be dealt with in follow-up studies by these authors and others, this article provides useful data that will stimulate further work and discussion.
