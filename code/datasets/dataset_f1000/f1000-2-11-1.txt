Although not a scientific article, this is a well written and interesting case report of an exceptionally rare event. Although there is nothing special about management it is of educational interest due to the incompletely explained physiological events and clinical presentation and course. Did the patient have a history of syncope? It would have been very helpful to have captured the ECG sequence and to have reported on the final block height (was this checked again?), as very high spinal block remains a strong possible explanation. The case report does not mention when the inspiratory effort, that is later discussed, was made. The decision to give epinephrine prior to preparing to instituting external cardiac massage, when the second episode of asystole occurred, warrants mention given it is contrary to guidelines. Clearly consciousness can be maintained with minimal or episodic cardiac output, and has been described during CPR ( Bihari S, Rajavee V. Neurocrit Care 2008 ). In the conclusion, reference is made to a transient tachycardia in the patient â€“ but this would be more accurately described as transient myocardial conduction or activity or similar.
