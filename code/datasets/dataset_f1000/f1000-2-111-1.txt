In the Methods section, the authors say: “We recruited 50 predominant right-handers and 50 predominant left-handers after evaluating handedness” but in the Results section they say “In this study we observed the handedness-wise digital dermatoglyphics pattern distribution of 140 individuals (70 lefthanded [35 females, 35 males] and 70 right-handed [35 males, 35 females])". The error should be corrected
