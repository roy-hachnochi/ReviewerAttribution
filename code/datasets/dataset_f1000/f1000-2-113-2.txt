I find this case report interesting, but no more than that. The clinical entity which has acquired the acronym POIS is intriguing and for that reason alone worthy of appearing in print to increase awareness of its possible existence. I do feel that a cluster of symptoms does not make for greater interest. I would be fascinated to see someone consider neuroradiologic imaging (PET/MRI) in these subjects.
