The authors present an interesting case of post-orgasmic severe fatigue and allergy-like reactions. Although several similar cases have been reported in the literature or professional discussion forums, we are still far away from understanding the pathophysiology of this phenomenon or how to manage it clinically. In this reviewer’s opinion, one of the main reasons for not being able to understand the pathophysiology is the lack of robust clinical data. To my knowledge, no one has collected blood samples from patients before and after sexual activity to determine the changes in patients’ chemistry. One obvious and simple thing to measure is the neutrophil, basophil counts and Ig levels to assess whether this is indeed an allergic reaction and what type of allergic reaction it might be. Others may be other biomarkers of allergy or inflammation. The field is looking forward to such a study.
