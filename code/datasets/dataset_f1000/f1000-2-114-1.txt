In this pilot study the authors evaluate whether there are differences in arterial versus venous blood in 3 potential biomarkers of COPD. Since the bulk of prior work on COPD biomarkers has been focused on venous blood and there are potential limitations to not using arterial blood. This is an appropriate study question. The methods are appropriate, statistical analyses are sound. There is the limitation of sampling pulmonary arterial and venous blood to understand the “direct” lung effects on blood markers, but this is likely neither feasible nor practical in biomarker discovery as its clinical use would be limited.
