Although the article is generally well written and the methods and results are likely to be correct, there is one major flaw that really should have been addressed before embarking on this negative project; Trans lung changes in mediators means you absolutely have to obtain pulmonary arterial and peripheral arterial blood. Even then differences could reflect a “cleaning” of the blood which is a non respiratory function of the lung and is most notable in the clotting differences. Peripheral arterial and venous blood will if anything reflect changes in the local limb capillary circulation and clearly misses changes to more systemic venous blood that is fully mixed in the pulmonary artery. This concept was recognised over 30 years ago and although the Authors mention it in discussion as a potential limitation I think this is a definite limitation. The study also fails to include the likelihood of some shunt in COPD lungs. Finally it is not clear whether the blood was allowed to clot but as serum is mentioned the assumptionis that it was and this would have the effect of activating local cells during the clotting process so ideally plasma should be studied.
