Peterson and co-authors have investigated the association between genotypes of two candidate genes ( Clock and ADCYAP1 ) and migratory behaviour in the avian genus Junco . They examined this association among subspecies, populations and individuals. Previous studies have found contradicting results regarding the association between phenotypic variation and genotype of these genes; therefore, more similar studies are required in order to determine the generality of this relationship and the role of these genes. The authors have sampled and analysed a large number of individuals and populations and analysed the data adequately. Unfortunately, the results are mostly negative and prevent from reaching clear-cut conclusions regarding Clock or ADCYAP1 and migratory propensity. However, studying the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes on several levels (subspecies, population, and individuals) enabled performing interesting comparisons and detecting some positive patterns. The authors have properly discussed the results and potential explanations and mechanisms for the differences found among the levels examined. I agree with the authors that correlating genomes with phenotypic variation may be the next step to identify potential candidate genes that may have a role in complicated behaviours such as migration. Despite the mostly negative results, I believe that this nicely-written paper provides a fine contribution to the literature.One technical comment â€“ it would be interesting to learn the nature of the ADCYAP1 alleles that are just one base-pair apart.
