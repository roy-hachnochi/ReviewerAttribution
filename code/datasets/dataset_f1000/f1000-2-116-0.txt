This article reports a new approach to modeling biological signal transduction systems based on the simple but important assumption that such systems have been evolutionarily optimized for maximum signal transmission efficiency. By embedding evolutionary optimization into the equations, the author obtains a self-organizing, evolving model. The approach is not fundamentally novel as the idea comes from the well-developed field of flux balance analysis. Apparently, however, this methodology has not been previously applied to signal transduction. The current article is somewhat too abstract to judge on the ultimate utility of the approach but certainly, this is a step in an interesting direction.
