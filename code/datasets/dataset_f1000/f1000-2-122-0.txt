 This is a very comprehensive ecophysiological study carried out on a wide range of woody species in two contrasting karst sites over the course of three years. The extent and duration of the study is far greater than most comparable field studies, and the paper provides a great deal of valuable information on the physiological responses of woody species in these sites. The differences found between the degraded and intact karst forest must be considered as hypotheses rather than conclusive demonstration of differences between degraded and intact forest, because of the limitations of the experimental design, as discussed in my review of the previous version . Because of the way the study was set up, a more accurate title would be: Ecophysiological responses of dominant tree species in two karst forest sites in southwestern China. I understand that this paper represents an enormous amount of work; ideally, the experimental design could have been thought through with respect to being able to test the factors most of interest before initiating all of that excellent work. In addition, the study design is not a factorial ANOVA; it is a hierarchical design with a nested structure and thus should have been analyzed as such (thereby changing the F tests and P levels); the reported values for the ANOVA are therefore inaccurate.
