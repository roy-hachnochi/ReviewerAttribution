This article was well designed, analyzed and presented. It is not “science” but it does address a clinically useful question and does so using an appropriate scientific methodology. The only comments that I would make require minor changes. I suggest modifying the names of the groups to “anesthesiologist at head of patient” and “anesthesiologist facing patient” – or possibly a more elegant phraseology (south-facing vs north-facing approach?) - this is really the main difference between the techniques – whether you use the thumb or index finger is a secondary difference derived from the first. This should also appear in the title. In table 3, please add a footnote explaining IS1, IS2 etc and OV 1, OV 2 etc – I know these terms appear in the text but each table should be self-explanatory.
