The authors present an interesting case report of a condition not commonly seen in developed countries. Its unusual presentation reaffirms the need for otolaryngologists to consider infectious processes in the work up of sinonasal and nasopharyngeal masses. The paper is concise, well written and easy to follow. It provides a nice summary of rhinoscleroma particularly of the histopathophysiological features essential for diagnosis. Additional photographs demonstrating the encroachment of the mass on the pharyngeal airway (i.e. with the use of a tongue depressor), a nasal endoscopic view and a post treatment view may have been helpful in providing more visual information for the reader. I agree with the previous reviewerâ€™s concern regarding the need for an awake tracheotomy for the management of the airway. Given the superior appearance of the mass on the sagittal CT scan and the fact that the authors state that an adequate visualization of the uninvolved vocal cords and epiglottis was obtained with transoral endoscopy, why did the authors not consider awake fiber-optic endoscopic intubation or at least mention this as an alternative for managing the airway. The discussion of the response of the mass to treatment is a little brief. I think additional information would be useful to the reader such as: Percentage decrease in the size of the mass with treatment, how the authors deemed that 12 weeks of treatment was appropriate, progress post treatment and also any scheduled future follow up.
