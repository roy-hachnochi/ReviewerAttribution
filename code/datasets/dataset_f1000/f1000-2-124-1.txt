This is an interesting case report describing an unusual presentation for rhinoscleroma, an infectious problem that we see rarely in the USA. It is well written, and well-organized. It would have been interesting to include patient photos post treatment. It can be a difficult diagnosis to make, so a more thorough literature review discussing potential physical findings on presentation would also have been helpful.
