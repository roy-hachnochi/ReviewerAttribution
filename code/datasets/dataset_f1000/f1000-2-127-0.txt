The data presented are of general and particular interests. All experiments have been properly done, and data were carefully analysed. However, the text in its present condition is difficult for comprehension and should be rearranged for better understanding. Title is appropriate. The Abstract should be rearranged to exclude discussion-like elements. Introduction is too long and could be shortened at least to one-half of the present size. Everything concerning figures should be excluded from Introduction and moved to Results. Minor point: Description of Fig. 3 occurred in text before that for Fig. 2. Materials and methods. This part of manuscript is also too long. It might be helpful to describe here only main or originally built methods giving commonly used as references. Again, part of the text concerning figures should be put into Results. Results. Experimental results would be better put in a more straight forward way, in support of the main line of study: morphological and immunostaining data showing die-coupling for GABA-ergic PCT neurons; spontaneous and evoked activity of these cells in aspect of de-/synchronization as an evidence for gap junction mechanisms in the network. Pharmacological tests for gap junction connectivity would be very desirable. Minor point: Fig. 2 could be combined with Fig. 11. Minor point: Conclusions are justified on the basis of results.
