The study of forest insect population dynamics has a long and storied history, and many forest insect species have served as model systems for studying conceptual processes of population biology and ecology. This is particularly the case for two geometrid species undergoing cyclical populations in Fennoscandia. A recent paper by Tenow et al. (2013) 1 , recommended in F1000Prime 2 ) revealed the presence of regular travelling waves for the winter moth ( Operophtera brumata ) across the European continent, providing evidence of the importance of continental processes in understanding regional and local dynamics of cyclical populations. In this commentary paper, Tenow contends that due to the presence of these continental-scale travelling waves, other studies within this system that do not account for these patterns could be in fact missing an important driver of population dynamics. Tenow critiques five papers to challenge their respective conclusions. This commentary should stimulate a thoughtful dialogue by all involved in these studies, which undoubtedly would a benefit to others involved in the study of insect spatial and temporal dynamics.
