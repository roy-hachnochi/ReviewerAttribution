Population cycles of two species of forest caterpillars, winter moth Operophtera brumata and the autumnal moth Epirrita autumnata have been studied extensively over both spatial and temporal scales in Norway, Sweden and Finland by a number of workers. Two major findings are that the outbreaks of winter moth tend to lag those of autumnal moth by one to two years, and waves of population outbreaks of both species occur from east to west across Fennoscandia with a ten-year periodicity ( Tenow 2013 ). Over the years there has been much interest in the synchronous population dynamics of cyclic species and whether this is associated with some environmental cue, wide ranging dispersal, or the movement of natural enemies among populations. The lag in outbreaks of winter moth and autumnal moth and the waves of outbreaks suggest that a single environmental cue is unlikely to explain the outbreak dynamics. Here Tenow reinterprets the results of 5 publications of population outbreaks of winter moth and autumnal moth in Norway to show how interpretations could be different if the lag between the two species and the waves of outbreaks were considered. The descriptions are complex and the paper would be clearer if the figures from the original papers were included so that it was evident what the population trends were that were being discussed. Given the extensive amount of work on this system it is useful to reevaluate earlier studies in light of more recent findings as is done here. Remaining interesting questions are 1. What factors determine the geographical waves of outbreaks? And 2. Why does this apparently consistent lag occur in outbreaks of two species feeding on the same host trees?
