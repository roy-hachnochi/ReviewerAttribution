The article provides a novel way to image and investigate the tumor in the original similar microenvironment. That makes it much easier to investigate the tumor characteristics related to the microenvironments. However, there are some questions need to be clarified in the paper: 1. After the implantation of the orthotopic tissue to the dorsal skin chamber, where is the blood supply of the tissue from? Will the angiogenesis happen in the tissue like a tumor? Usually, it’s a challenge to make the engrafted normal tissue to get good blood supply after the implantation. If the angiogenesis or vasculogenesis happened in the tissue, where did the vessels arise from? Were they from the host animal or just attached to the blood vessel of the host animal? 2. For the vascular parameters, I didn’t notice any vascular mark methods, were they only identified by the dark space between the fluorescent tumor background? If so, will the stroma tissue in the tumor which has no fluorescent effect the counting of the blood vessels? 3. There are no units of the tumor size in the graphs of figure 1, 4, 6 and the supplement figures.
