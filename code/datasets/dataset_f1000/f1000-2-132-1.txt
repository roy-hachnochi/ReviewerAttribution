The systematic review of Chelladurai et al. on VTE prophylaxis in patients with traumatic brain injury is an excellent review and analysis of the literature on the subject. It reinforces the urgent need for well controlled, prospective studies to assess the safety, efficacy and drug choice for thromboprophylaxis in this group of patients. Timing of intervention, severity and type of injury and associated conditions, interruption of treatment for surgical procedures, effects on the geriatric population and others are variables that would require special attention. The evidence reported in this review, as the authors conclude, supports (although weak) the use of thromboprophylaxis in this group of patients. It is probable that a subgroup may benefit more than others and it would be interesting to focus even a retrospective study to such a group.
