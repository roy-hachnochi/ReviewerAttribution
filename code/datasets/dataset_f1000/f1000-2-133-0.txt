In general, earlier HAART improves outcome particularly in those with the lowest CD4 counts. However, opportunistic infections of the CNS such as TB and cryptococcosis are an exception, and timing of HAART requires special consideration. The optimal timing of HAART in the setting of toxoplasma encephalitis has not been studied. This well written and informative case report illustrates that initiating HAART (very) early after beginning anti-toxoplasma therapy might be deleterious, deserving further studies.
