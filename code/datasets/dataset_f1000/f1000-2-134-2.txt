1. The title is appropriate for the study. 2. The experimental design and methods are appropriate for the topic being studied. 3. The information and data provided is enough for replicating the experiment 4. The conclusions are correct but need additional data to substantiate it. In this article, the authors have identified FAM129B as a positive regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in melanoma cells. They also demonstrate that FAM129B is required for Wnt3a-induced apoptosis in vitro . However; there are three important pieces of information missing that the authors should address: Can this effect be replicated in vivo in animal models? Does FAM129B expression correlate with beta-catenin activation and disease progression in melanoma patients? What is the mechanism by which FAM129B regulates Wnt signalling? I would like the authors to do a bit more work on answering at least one of the three questions raised. They should also discuss the other two questions in the discussion section. From my standpoint it seems the easiest thing to do would be to compare FAM129 expression in various tumor samples and correlate them to Beta-catenin activation (nuclear localization) and growth pattern (tumor depth).
