The authors have satisfactorily addressed all my previous comments. This is a very informative and brilliantly written review on miRNAs and their current and potential use in human diseases' diagnosis and therapy. I only have two more minor suggestions to finalize the review: Page 3 of 14: When the authors cite and discuss reference 37 (Sempere et al .) the number '2' is missing from one of the HER2 genotypes they mentioned. Also, when looking to the original paper published in 2007, I am not sure the authors refer to the right TMA genotypes, and their conclusions seem a bit too vague: what does it mean that miR-145 shows an "opposite pattern"? That statement is not that clear to me when I look at Figure 3 of the original paper. Page 8 of 14: The authors talk about "heart generation" but it should read "heart regeneration". I would suggest: "Upregulation of miR-15 and miR-195 executes a postnatal cell cycle arrest during the process of heart regeneration after myocardial infarction (ref. 100)".
