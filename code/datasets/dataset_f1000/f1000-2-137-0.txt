1) The title of the paper is clear and outlines key information in this article. 2)The abstract has provided a concise and fairly good summary. 3) The description on the study design, method as well as the analysis of the findings are comprehensive. 4) The conclusions are justified based on the results. 5) The limitation of the data has been clearly stated within the article. As many of the descriptions are based on the design instead of the implications of the results, some finding of relevant studies should be cited within the discussion to provide more evidence and to support the conclusion and suggestions. Despite this I would like to 'Approve' this article as it has provided a very comprehensive review on the NCMS's benefit package designs for NCD outpatients in China.
