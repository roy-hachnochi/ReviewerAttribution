I have reviewed the manuscript by Grovenstein et al. In this manuscript, the authors identified a Chl deficient mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by insertional mutagenesis. As described in the manuscript, Arabidopsis possesses two CHLI isoforms, CHLI1 and CHLI2, like Chlamydomonas. However, it is not clear whether these isoforms are paralogous or not among these two photosynthetic organisms. The authors should perform phylogenetic analysis to show whether these isoforms are truly phylogenetically related or not. Considering the chli1-1 mutant is Chl deficient, it is reasonable to assume that CHLI2 is not functional in Chlamydomonas . In my understanding, the expression of CHLI2 is not affected by the mutation of CHLI1 gene in Arabidopsis. The upper band of Fig.11B could be a non-specific band of CHLI1 protein that hides the original band of CHLI2 in Western blot analysis. In this sense, the expression analysis of CHLI2, as well as functional complementation with CHLI2 in the chli1-1 mutant, are apparently necessary for further understanding. Specific comments: In Fig. 7, the authors performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of CHLI1 and CHLI2 . As the authors discussed quantities of these transcripts in the Discussion section (p.10), it is necessary to show the levels of housekeeping genes such as ACTIN8 or Ubiquitin10 as loading control.
