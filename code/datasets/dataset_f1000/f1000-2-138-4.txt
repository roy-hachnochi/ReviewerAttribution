In this paper, the authors have successfully identified a Chlamydomonas mutant deficient in chlorophyll biosynthesis using insertional mutagenesis. Through molecular genetic analyses, the authors demonstrated that the deficiency of the CHLI1 gene, which encodes a subunit of Mg-chelatase, caused the chlorophyll-deficient phenotype. Although Chlamydomonas has another homologous CHLI2 gene, this mutant failed to accumulate chlorophylls, suggesting the limited function of CHLI2 on chlorophyll biosynthesis. To clarify whether the reduced expression of CHLI2 caused chlorophyll deficiency, overexpression of CHLI2 in the mutant should give further insights into the functionality of CHLI2. In addition, it is desirable to determine the levels of chlorophyll intermediates that are correlated to the photosensitivity of the mutant. Suggested revisions: Considering the distinct regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis and nuclear gene expression between Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis , I am not sure whether this mutant is useful for analysis of the retrograde signaling. Actually, a number of previous papers suggested distinct roles of tetrapyrroles on nuclear gene expression in Chlamydomonas ( Kropat et al . 1997 , Kropat et al . 2000 , Chekounova et al. 2001 and Vos et al. 2011 ). In this sense, the last paragraph of the Discussion section should be largely revised including already known mechanisms in Chlam ydomonas cells and not be so focused on Arabidopsis .
