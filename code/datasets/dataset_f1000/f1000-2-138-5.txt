In this paper, the authors describe the isolation and characterization of a mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii deficient in chlorophyll biosynthesis. The authors screened a population of Chalamydomonas that was transformed with an insertional mutagenesis vector. They found a chlorophyll deficient mutant that only grew under heterotrophic conditions. The authors provided convincing evidence that this mutant lacked the CHLI1 gene as well as several flanking genes. The CHLI1 gene encodes a subunit of the enzyme responsible for inserting Mg 2+ into protoporphyrin IX. Interestingly, the chli1 mutant also showed decreased expression of a homolog of CHLI1 and CHLI2. The authors also rescued the chli1 mutant phenotype using a wildtype CHLI1 cDNA transgene. This work is important because it is the first report of a chli1 mutant from a green alga. This mutant provides a starting point for additional genetic and biochemical analyses of chlorophyll biosynthesis in Chlamydomonas . Suggested revisions: The authors should change their mutant name to chli1-1 , since it is the first mutant allele isolated. This sets a precedent for naming new alleles as they are discovered. Instead of calling the rescued transformants that contain the wildtype CHLI1 cDNA "complements", the authors should consider calling them "rescued transformants". Some geneticists adhere to a more strict use of the term "complementation" and its derivatives where complementation is done by crossing two mutants, and not by genetic transformation of a mutant using a wildtype gene.
