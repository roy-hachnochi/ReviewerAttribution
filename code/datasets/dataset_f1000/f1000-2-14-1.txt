 This is a nice paper that is generally of high quality and using appropriate methodology. It is a contribution to the literature in terms of its relative size compared to many studies; and it adds new knowledge on the subject of particle emission in health adults. The data are clearly constrained by a lack of data on children and the elderly; this issue is fully acknowledged but one or two statements might be seen as overly bold given these shortcomings. Some of the raw observations require greater explanation (for example why particle emission would be higher at each end of the range of humidity and indoor temperature (are U-shaped curves already recognised? If not the data are more puzzling). There could be improved clarity and separation of the results of univariate and multivariable analyses. But overall, a nice paper that adds something.
