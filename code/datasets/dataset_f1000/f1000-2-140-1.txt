This is a nice study that adds to a growing list in the literature exploring the role of environmental enrichment on tumor pathophysiology in mice. Most of these studies, including the present, are unable to reproduce the findings of Cao et al in Cell 2010. The authors explore the possible explanations for these differences. Title and Abstract: The abstract is a good summary. Article content: Design, methods and analysis of the results are explained well and the science is robust. Conclusions: Conclusions are sensible, balanced and justified. Data: The data Is strong and presented well. In summary, this is a very well written manuscript that attempts to dissect possible confounders in previous studies. It would have been nice if the authors could have measured serum leptin levels in their mice (to compare them with those published by Cao). If levels were similar then this would substantially undermine the conclusions of Cao. However, such measurements may be beyond the scope of the present study.
