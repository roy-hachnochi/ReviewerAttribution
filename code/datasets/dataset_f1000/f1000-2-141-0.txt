This is an excellent synthesis of the literature surrounding the history, clinical manifestations, genetic basis and aetiology of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC), and in particular, proposes a role for the resident Sca1+ PDGFRα+ interstitial population that includes mesenchymal (MSC-like) progenitor cells in the fibrofatty infiltrates that develop during the disease. This hypothesis piece notes carefully the limitations of conclusions arising from published studies using animal models that hint at a role for second heart field cardiomyocyte progenitors in the development of disease. Of importance, is whether the fibrofatty infiltrates are the primary or secondary target of the mutations in desmosomal component genes that underpin the disease. The piece is scholarly, and well written. A dimension not explored extensively is the possibility that the fibrofatty cells arise from the epicardium of the adult heart, which has been shown by a number of groups to become activated after injury. Activated epicardium re-expressed genes involved in the fetal epicardial program and reveals a latent lineage reserve that can contribute fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells to the infarct zone of a chronically injured ischaemic heart. While the Sca1+ PDGFRα+ interstitial mesenchymal cells and epicardial cells share a lineage relationship in development, an additional challenge in the lineage mapping studies proposed is to distinguish whether fibrofatty infiltrates in AC arise from one or the other, or both, of these cellular compartments. Nonetheless, the ideas explored in this article overlap with interesting and important issues in cardiac developmental and stem cell biology, and with the potential for targeting fibrofatty progenitor cells as a therapy in arresting the progression of AC in the clinical setting. An excellent work that should be a reference point for future studies.
