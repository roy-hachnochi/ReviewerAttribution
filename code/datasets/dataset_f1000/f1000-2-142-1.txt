This manuscript presents data regarding phenotype of isolated mutants ( 6F14 ), identification of the mutation locus in 6F14 and its complementation.The results revealed that 6F14 is defective in the GUN4 (genome uncoupled 4) gene which regulate MgChel activity. Therefore, the transformation of 6F14 with a GUN4 gene restored the wild type phenotype with over-expressing the GUN4 protein. The authors concluded that 6F14 is the second gun4 mutant identified in Chlamydomonas . In that sense, the study of 6F14 ( gun4 II ) is not novel. However, the authors have shown the difference of mutation locus of gun4 I (earlier identified) and gun4 II (in this study) and also the differences of light sensitivity and chlorophyll content which is very interesting. I do have some suggested revisions: 1. If the authors compare all physiological responses for two gun4 mutants and their parental wild types in the same culture condition, it would explain more clearly the differences between the gun4 II and gun4 I mutants. 2. Authors may need to propose the future experiment with this new gun4 mutant ( 6F14 ) in the discussion section of the article. 3. I noticed that the introduction part of your abstract (up to 5 lines) is almost identical with your recent paper “ Identification and molecular characterization of a novel Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant defective in chlorophyll biosynthesis ” paper. I would recommend you to revise the introduction part of this abstract.
