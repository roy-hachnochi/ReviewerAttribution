This interesting paper by Mitra et al. presents results that show another allele of the gun4 mutant in Chlamydomonas . Although this is not the first article to report on gun4 mutant, it is important as it does provides extra phenotypic studies that show both consistent results and novel investigations. I do have some minor concerns that the authors should consider to improve the manuscript: 1. The title is somewhat misleading as the progressive Chl deficiency is just one of the phenotypes of this mutant; please consider properly revising it. 2. Why did the authors need to put up so many figures in one article? Some of the figures are not really necessary and can be put attached online as supplementary figures. With too many figures, the article can become very boring to read. 3. The authors should put some more emphasis on the interesting findings like the genetic rearrangement of the gun4 gene in the mutant, for example. 4. Unless the authors made further characterization on the two HYP genes regarding their sequences and deduced amino acid and possible functions, they can be omitted from the paper as they would confuse the reader.
