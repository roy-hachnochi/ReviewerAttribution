The author presents an interesting technique for detecting new BRC repeats. The paper is generally well written, but needs some additional material to bolster its case. The introduction section needs more discussion of the 'state-of-the-art' in the alignment and motif detection area (especially with respect to detecting BRC repeats). The paperâ€™s argument can be made stronger by explicitly mentioning the advantages of fragmented alignment over any other recursively applied local alignment method or homology search method. Some discussion of existing methods exists in the discussion/results section, but that needs to be made available in the introduction in order to justify the need for creating a new method An explanation of the choice of parameter values needs to be given. For example, why does FRscore have weights of 1/3 for only Similarity (equation 2)? Also, the reasoning for choosing particular values for gap open and gap extend penalties needs to be mentioned along with whether parameter tuning/search was done to arrive at those values. Otherwise, those numbers seem arbitrary. The author needs to discuss whether he tried any other alignment algorithms apart from Clustal-W. Some other algorithms such as MAFFT, ProbCons or CONTRAlign may yield better results. The author may want to discuss the data in a separate section under methods/materials. A figure describing the FRAGAL pipeline will be useful to visually describe the pipeline/algorithm.
