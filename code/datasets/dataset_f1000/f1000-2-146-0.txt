This is a straightforward analysis and the interpretations are justified. I have two minor comments: Figure 1B shows that ecosystem-service-providing (ESP) bee species tend to be increasing whereas non-ESP species tend to be decreasing. But how is ESP measured? Is there any possibility that this result could be artefact, in that declining species are now rare and that therefore their ESP behaviour is less likely to be recorded? I would like to see this issue addressed briefly. The final sentence “It is important to remember that all bee species may well be crucial to providing ecosystem functions in natural systems and therefore merit conservation attention.” seems like a non-sequitur, because the authors have just finished talking about how important pollinators are less likely to be declining. Presumably the authors mean that we have incomplete information and that it would be risky to assume that apparent non-pollinators are genuinely playing no useful ecosystem-service role. This could be expressed better.
