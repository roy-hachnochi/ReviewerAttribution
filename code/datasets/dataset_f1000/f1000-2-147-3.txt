This interesting article submitted by Clutterbuck et al. is a well written and designed research paper. I do have a few comments that would help to clarify the research for readers. Suggested revisions: In the methods section the authors should clearly state how many repetitions have been used for each experiment and each condition – this is not clear at times. Presumably at least 3 repetitions per assay per condition were made in order to derive the statistics but this should be specified. In figures 3 and 4A, the % of proteoglycan release is mentioned and graphed – how is this related to the total PG content if the variability appears to be rather high from the 80s to over 300 μg/mL? This needs to be clarified. In figure 5, did the authors use a reference protein to ensure that the same total protein content was used for each band? If so, this should be included as a reference in Figure 5. In the discussion section, the authors mention that curcumin in different preparations can present with varying effects. Since curcumin is a pure substance isolated from Curcuma longa, it will have the same chemical properties and therefore – given that it is properly dissolved like in this study using DMSO in non-toxic concentrations – then it should not be different from any other study. If the authors refer to a Curcuma longa extract then it would be a different issue worth discussing. Furthermore, and of great importance, the authors briefly mention the low bioavailability of curcumin in vivo in humans – how does that compare to the concentrations that were used in these experiments? What would be a good comparison blood concentration one could expect in humans after oral application of curcumin? This should be included in the discussion section to provide the reader with some perspective.
