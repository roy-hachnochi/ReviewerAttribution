I think this is a very nice paper. This interesting study identifies a novel mechanism to explain the differential susceptibilities of neurons and glia in neurodegenerative disease and injury, and so makes a significant advance. In vitro experiments implicate Histone H1, but not core histones, as selectively toxic for neurons while simultaneously activating astrocytes and microglia. The data are convincing and the proposed H1 positive feedback model (Figure 11) warrants future investigation in vivo . Suggested revisions : Figure 1 The caption should read 'Diffusion-mediated degeneration of embryonic neocortex is...' The blebbing of degenerating axons is indistinct as shown and would be more convincing at a higher magnification. It would also be interesting to know whether neuronal cell bodies, and not just their axons, are susceptible to H1 toxicity in the collagen gel co-culture; and to confirm that H1-antibody-coated beads pull off the neurotoxic activity. Figure 7 The type 1 morphology is indistinct - it would be helpful to show or state the typical appearance of astrocytes without added H1.
