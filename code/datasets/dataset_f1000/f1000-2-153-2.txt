This commentary is much needed in the field of life science. It is well written and concise. Andrew Chalmerâ€™s group has contributed significantly to the use of research antibodies by creating CiteAb. When operating the CiteAb search engine, I imagine that they constantly run into problems with publications with poorly described use of research antibodies. I have two minor suggestions: In the Antibody Validation paragraph, a statement could be included in the methods section of a paper regarding if, where and under what name antibody validation information or reviews has been posted in publically available databases. This would increase the value and transparency of these databases. Unlike the previous reviewer, I think it is fine to mention CiteAb in the paper. After all, even Nature Publishing Group is a highly commercial enterprise. However, I suggest that a table could be included listing the relevant databases including CiteAb, pAbmAbs, Biobrea, Antibodypedia, 1degreebio, Antibody-Advizer etc. In this regard, I regret that the Checklist from Nature Publishing Group only refers to sites in which they have a commercial interest (1degreebio and Antibodypedia). I hope that other publishing groups are not tempted to do the same.
