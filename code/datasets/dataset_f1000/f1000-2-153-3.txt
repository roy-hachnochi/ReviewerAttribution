The title and abstract are clear and appropriate. The article is timely and written clearly and accessibly. It could be improved further by providing references for papers that are examples “of good practice and detailed reporting”, which might serve as a template for others. The process of antibody validation is worthy of more extensive discussion, as the research community needs to develop a clear understanding of the most appropriate tests to be performed in each experimental system, and standards which should be attained for acceptance of the status of “validated”. This data should be provided in supplementary data, or by reference to previous supplementary data if the same reagents are used in a new study. The importance of batch number is made, but could be emphasized more. Finally, the critical role of peer-reviewers in evaluating and enforcing these standards is key. Some discussion of this would enhance the manuscript.
