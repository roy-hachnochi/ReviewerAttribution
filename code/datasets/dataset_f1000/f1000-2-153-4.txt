This commentary is timely and well written, but it could be shortened or tightened up a bit for the purpose of conciseness. It also should include a few points noted in this review. The major point is the problem that lack of information in publications involving research antibodies affects assessment and future use. The discussion could be more efficient in stating that if methods were reported in a previous referenced article, then referencing that article in a new publication is sufficient, unless there are nuances (i.e., new uses of the antibody). It should also be made clear that such information be mandatory when an antibody is used in a particular way for the first time. There are also a few things the author may want to include: Many antibodies work on a particular protein in a particular cell type without knowledge of the protein domain(s) found. In spite of that they may be of value, so you donâ€™t have to identify the sequence molecule. Some antibodies identify native conformation and therefore are not on a peptide sequence per se. Such antibodies are not unusually performed on denatured proteins in western blots, but may work in nature gels. Some antibodies have not been fully characterized beyond reference to the data sheet provided by the company or source if necessary. If the authors of a paper refer to the company, and catalog name of the antibody, prior characterization can access. Antibody validation should go in the supplementary data to a paper. Do not cite CiteAb in your paper - it sounds like an ad. But all in all, this is a reasonable commentary. It reinforces what many already are advocating. The title and abstract were fine.
