The revision to this article clarifies its conclusion. My commentary on the previous version to the effect that both criminology and epidemiology perspectives are important for an understanding of crime trends in the U.S. (and the extent to which the presence of lead in petrol was a contributing factor) still holds. For instance, consider the data plotted in Figure 1 : this rate is calculated annually per 1,000 individuals in the 12 to 17 age group and is based on the perceived ages of the offenders as estimated by violent crime victims. It can be seen from the figure that the violent crime offending rate begins to rise in the late1980s - just when the adolescents who should have been benefitting from the mandated reductions in average lead content of petrol from 2 g to 0.5 g per gallon in the 1975 to 1980 period were coming into the 12 to 17 age group. This uptrend continued to a peak in 1993 with generally high levels in the 1990-1995 years, even though all members of this age group in those years were born well after the mandated reductions began in 1975 to 1980. My point is not that lead plays no role in violent crime rates (almost surely, among children exposed to high levels of lead, the risk of crime offending will be higher than among children not so exposed) but that this is only one factor among many in determining overall societal crime rates and trends therein.
