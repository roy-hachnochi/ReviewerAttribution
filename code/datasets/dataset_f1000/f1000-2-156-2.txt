 Title and Abstract: The title and abstract are appropriate to the content of the article. The abstract represents a suitable summary of the work. Article content: The article is a survey and review of prior research on the topic of whether or not the decline in all types of crime since the early 1990s in the USA was an unintended consequence of the elimination of lead from petrol between 1975 and 1985. This review is competently and adequately done for the most part. Its conceptual orientation comes from epidemiology, which is good, but the incorporation of the body of research done on this topic from a criminology perspective would add greater substance and depth to the article. The synthesis of these two perspectives would likely produce the inference that although the presence of lead in petrol was an influencing factor on the rise and subsequent decline of crime rates in the USA, it was but one of many factors and cannot account for these secular trends alone. Conclusions: The conclusions are sensible, balanced and justified on the basis of the content of the survey and review of the existing research.
