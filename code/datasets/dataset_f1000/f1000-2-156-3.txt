This article is a good summary of the existing evidence on lead and violence and there's not much to dispute about it. However, a change in the perspective would improve it and at least one correction is needed. In the abstract the word ' unintended ' is not correctly placed or in context of the problem. If anything, the unintended consequence is the plausible link between the toxic response due to rapid increase in the commercial consumption of fuel containing lead additives (especially in the 1950’s and 1960’s) and the unintended cascade of societal health costs, including learning disabilities and criminal behaviour, that was triggered around 20 years later. These consequences are only becoming appreciated recently, after the use of lead additives in fuels has decreased 1 . Ecological studies like ours provide suggestive evidence, however when coupled with neuroimaging studies, animal studies and individual-level analyses, the current state of the science on lead provides strong evidence for a serious societal problem in need of attention to better protect future generations 1 . The lead story is rich and so well-documented that the benefits of using resources for cleaning up play areas and improving the environment for children is becoming recognized by progressive nations as a cost effective and important activity 2 .
