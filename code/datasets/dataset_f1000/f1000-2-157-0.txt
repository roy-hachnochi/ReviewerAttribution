I have read the manuscript with great interest. Empathy will remain an area of high importance for medical education and, despite being extensively studied, its research should still be encouraged world-wide.This is well-conducted research and the authors have succeeded in explaining the data clearly and concisely. The abstract is concise and provides an adequate summary of the article. The article is clearly written and well constructed.I recommend only a few minor changes:I believe that the current title may be somewhat misleading as the word “maintenance” implies a more longitudinal study, or a study across all cohorts from first to final year, whereas this research is more of a comparative cross-sectional study between first and final year medical students. I recommend that a more appropriate title be used.The methodological rigor is adequate with only a few pointers:Since the EQ test was not included in the article, I do not see any need for paragraphs 5 and 6 in the “Materials and methods” section. These paragraphs did not help explain the EQ and those who are interested in understanding the EQ test can easily refer to the reference. Similarly, table 1 does not add any information and can be removed.In the statistical analyses section, it was mentioned that the t-test and chi-square test were used. The values of these tests along with the p-values should be included in the text and in tables 2 and 3.The discussion and conclusion appear to be sensible and balanced. It would have been interesting to tell us about the selection process that medical students have to go through before being accepted in this private medical school.Overall, this is a well-written and interesting article.
