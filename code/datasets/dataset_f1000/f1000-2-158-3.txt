The title of the article “ Adaptability of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex ” is not so specific to the current study. The title of the article should be confined to the main research results of the study, i.e., the nociceptive withdrawal reflex responses in the upper limb are resistant to the change of joint position and short term motor practice. The abstract represents a suitable summary of the work. The experimental design and methods are appropriate and the discussion is well balanced. The conclusion is justified on the basis of the results of the study.
