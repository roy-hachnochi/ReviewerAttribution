While the report offers an interesting hypothesis, the sample is under-powered and the findings are not significant. There are also many biases in why vitamin D levels were or were not measured in psychiatric samples. The authors note limitation of sample size. I would suggest increasing sample size and being more targeted in the definition of psychopathology in future case control design.
