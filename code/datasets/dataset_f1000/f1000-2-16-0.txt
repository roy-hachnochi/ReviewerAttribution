 Title and Abstract: The title is acceptable and clear. Article content: The authors are to be applauded for their thoroughness and attention to accepted pedagogical models when designing and setting up their curriculum. However, there is little description of the actual content and emphasis of the curricular components, and the methods by which key knowledge and skills were actually assessed in the OSCEs. It is not clear if the OSCEs had been validated, or whether there was any comparison group for analysis of effect. There was no information to determine if the OSCE was used in any novel way. Data: The methods used to introduce the curriculum were presented in some detail, but as stated above there were significant areas not described. The figures were unhelpful and the data could be better portrayed in table form. Conclusions: The conclusions were substantiated by the data presented, but without information about any comparison or control group, it is difficult to gauge the impact of the curricular intervention (over that of secular trend etc). It is also not clear what these conclusions add to the existing literature.
