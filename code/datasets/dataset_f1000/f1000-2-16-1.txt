 Title and Abstract: The title is OK, though I would describe it as a structured physical exam skills educational program (italicized words added by me). The abstract focuses largely on the theoretical models underpinning the approaches to evaluation. I think it would be clearer to focus concretely on concisely describing the evaluation performed. The theoretical rationale for that approach can be described in the paper itself. Article content: Overall, the methods and design are adequately explained, though there are a few important exceptions. The authors go into great detail about the theoretical models underpinning their approach to evaluation. This is fine but is not really critical. The critical components of both the survey and the OSCE are whether these are validated instruments. I assume the authors created both for this project, but it is important for them to state that these tools have not been previously validated (unless of course they have). In addition, I did not find the Figures particularly helpful. They might be more clearly displayed in table format than as graphs. Conclusions: The conclusions are reasonable, though I would add the caveat that because the measurement instruments were not validated it is difficult to be certain of their reliability. Also, the authors should emphasize that the meaning of the OSCE scores in particular is not clear since there is no comparison group and the OSCE has not been validated. Data: The data is limited, but the curriculum design is presented in adequate detail.
