This paper reports a case series of 10 adult cancer patients treated with a procedure involving sublingual administration of a “photosensitizer” called PhotosoftE4 and illumination of tumors with a laser and the whole body with a “LED bed”. Not surprisingly there was no real therapeutic effect. Using a sub-optimal PDT regimen such as that described in this report and describing it as “ complementary and alternative medicine, CAM ” is analogous to snipping at a tumor with nail scissors and calling it “CAM surgery”, or using a diagnostic X-ray machine and calling it “CAM radiotherapy”. Of course PDT performed with this bizarre methodology didn’t work; the question is more why would one think it possibly could? PDT treatments for cancer using chlorophyll-based photosensitizers (PS) such as HPPH, ce6 or TOOKAD work perfectly well when the PS is injected IV 1 . If the investigators in this study were intent on only using an orally delivered PS they could have used oral 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 2 . While this has some problems in terms of side effects such as blood pressure changes, it has been shown to work. Putting this type of ce6 preparation under the tongue would not be expected to lead to any appreciable systemic absorption and therefore no therapeutic effect. The assertion that a whole-body illumination procedure could eradicate “circulating tumor cells” is frankly laughable. PDT is a perfectly respectable but not yet mainstream medical procedure and I am concerned that flawed studies such as this one could affect the reputation of this potentially useful therapeutic technique and offer false hope for desperate cancer patients.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions It is not clear what information this report is designed to convey. PDT is not 'alternative' therapy, having been approved by the FDA for some indications and showing evidence for effective cancer control. The approach described here seems to be based on a random trial error method with no consideration for pharmacokinetics, biodistribution or dosimetry. There has been some enthusiasm for publication of negative reports so as to tell future investigators what not to do, so in that sense, this report qualifies. Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed. I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above. reply Respond to this report Responses (0)
