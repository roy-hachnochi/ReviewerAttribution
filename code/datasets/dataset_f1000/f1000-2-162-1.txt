Over all, the method described in this article does not seem to provide any benefits over previously published methods. Several details of the procedure are hard to understand since they are not clearly described either in the text or the figure legends. We also have concerns that the quality of the figures is below the standard we would expect. Specifically we have the following comments/queries: Why was the targeting construct inserted in the opposite orientation? Was this perhaps to circumvent the promoter effects from the ROSA26 intrinsic promoter? This is not clearly stated in the article and should be explained. Why was Flpe been used and not Flpo (which has been known to be superior for several years)? Fig. 1b: The text is hard to follow. Which transgenes were cloned into the constructs? It would be helpful if the authors could provide a schema depicting the cloning strategy. Fig.2 is of poor quality overall. 2C: This PCR picture is inacceptable (as there are no annotations of size). Something has been written on the gel picture but it is hard to read as it is far too small. The ES cells used for RMCE were not characterized with regard to pluripotency and checked for karyotypic aberrations. Including these points in the article would be useful. We had major problems understanding the loxP site insertions in the vector. The positions are not clearly described in the text. Why is the stop site 4 x pA? The manuscript does not mention that the promoter driving the transgenes is the endogenous one. This should be added and explained. Our most serious concern is that very similar approaches (ROSA26 targeted by Flp-RMCE using F and F3 sites) have already been published, at least three times 1 , 2 , 3 . We would have expected these papers to have been cited in the article and any advantages in the authors’ method to be discussed in relation to these previously described approaches. References 1.
