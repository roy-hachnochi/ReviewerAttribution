This article describes a method to insert a recombination cassette specifically into the ROSA26 allele. However I find it hard to establish how novel this method is and how much better it is then existing protocols from the work outlined here. Also, the results did not summarise the efficiency and specificity of this system well (which would have been nice to see in the figures) and I was unclear as to whether the pCAG-Flpe plasmid was a control or a comparison plasmid (and there were unclear results from this work). Additionally, only using examples to show the outcomes instead of statistics does not demonstrate how good the method is, only some of the potential outcomes. Also, what is the FRT-neo-F3 cassette mentioned in the last line? I am not an expert in transgenic mouse generation, but I do know that the ROSA locus has been used for some time. What is the essential advancement with this method? Also, please label panel 2C so meaning can be derived from it. I think some work needs to be done to enhance the clarity of the objectives, outcomes and any novelty in this article. Also, perhaps some better schematics of the various cassettes mentioned in the text would help the reader follow what they are being used for.
