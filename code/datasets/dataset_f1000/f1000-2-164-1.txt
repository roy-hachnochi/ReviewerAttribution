This is a well written and well conceived study that focuses on an important topic: the nature and prevalence of pain among individuals experiencing homelessness. This is an obvious and overlooked area of research that represents an important target of clinical intervention. The methods are clear, appropriate, and appear well executed. The findings confirm what one might expect: there are high rates of chronic pain among the homeless. They also add insight into the type of pain individuals experience including high rates of neuropathic pain. The notion that these individuals use drugs to self-medicate the effects of pain seems only partially supported, suggesting that pain is an important consideration, but only one of many in terms of understanding substance use in homeless populations. High rates of the use of acetaminophen raise questions about potential liver damage and toxicity, and it would be worth considering homeless individuals' knowledge on this topic, which is perhaps a point that could be raised in the discussion. One final suggestion is to consider whether and how providing housing would help address or alleviate pain among this population.
