This commentary presents an interesting yet highly controversial view of acid secretion. The literature cited is very limited and is predominantly from the authorâ€™s previous work. My second point is that there are factual errors. There is no evidence for Calcium being pumped into the lumen of the gastric gland. The paper the author cites is measuring intracellular Ca not efflux of Ca into the lumen. In that study there are changes in intracellular Ca associated with carbachol that are typical for Ca activated H,K stimulated acid secretion. The critical studies have not been preformed that are necessary to prove the theory; namely block the H,K with omeprazole, stimulate the cells with increased intracellular Calcium (thapsigargin, carbachol, etc) and show measurements of luminal Ca concentration changes. As it stands now there are small pieces of unconnected data that do not give a convincing argument for this paper.
