This review reflects the opinion that the gastric H,K-ATPase may transport other cations than potassium and protons, i.e., may transport sodium or calcium ions. According to the author, these different transport modes mostly depend on the local cytosolic composition (Na + , pH, and Ca 2+ ), and on a cytosolic factor that acts in a dual manner on the pump activity. This interesting view of the mechanisms of gastric secretion is based on previous results that have been obtained by T. Ray's group. However, I would appreciate that the author further discuss the specificity of the reported assays, the purity of the preparations (apical and tubulovesicular membranes), and the possibility that other, physiologically quiescent, P-ATPases or channels may obscure the interpretation. Also, I feel that the title sounds different than the ms content, and that a change has to be considered.
