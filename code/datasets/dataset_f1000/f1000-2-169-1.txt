In the article “Anti-rhesus D prophylaxis…” by Winkler, Berger, and Ehlers the authors present data demonstrating enrichment of galactosylation and sialylation in the anti Rh-D fraction of Rhophylac. This study is well written with adequate discussion of methods. Moreover, the report builds on exciting recent findings that the pattern of glycosylation is an important determinant factor in the effector function of IgG providing mechanistic control of FcGR interactions and tolerogenic v.s. inflammatory immunity.Their results would suggest the therapeutic value of anti-RhD therapy may lie in an active tolerogenic response rather than via clearance mechanisms, a theory which should be tested moving forward. The title is a bit misleading as it suggests experimental evidence contained within the report demonstrates anti-RhD activity is due to glycosylation, a theorized outcome that has yet to be demonstrated. A revision to reflect this fact may be appropriate. Otherwise, it is an exciting report pointing to a novel mechanism that may drive prophylactic anti-RhD therapy.
