This is an interesting chemical genetics study addressing the parallel biosynthetic pathways for isoprenoids in plants (which are also significant in human pathogens). As such, this work provides a paradigm for the discovery of bioactives that might be applied in several contexts. Of course, the unique characteristics of plant cell walls / membranes, contrasted with bacteria, may make this screen less general than might be desirable. Being based on imaging, this screen is relatively low throughout, but cell-based assays typically have some of this sort of limitation. A few new chemotypes have been investigated and found to have significant activity. This study follows well-established processes for examining the sequence of steps in a biosynthetic pathway, with opposing effects of inhibitors and molecules downstream of the site of inhibition. A slight ambiguity about the chemical structures of the pro-drugs and their active forms hinders understanding of the structure-activity relationships. It should be emphasized that the most active SP compounds have N-methyl groups on their hydroxamate nitrogens. Also, structures presented on p. 20 are in error, in that all but TJ290 are missing a carbonyl group.
