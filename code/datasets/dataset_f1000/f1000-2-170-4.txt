This manuscript by Bach, Rohmer and colleagues describes a new and powerful plant screening system for chemical inhibitors of the MEP or Rohmer pathway. The basic concept as well as the underlying chemistry of the manuscript is excellent, but the presentation of the results and conclusions driven from the biological experiments, as well as a number of paragraphs need carefull revision. A few points that shall help the authors to improve the manuscript are: None of the inhibitors the authors measure show their uptake. This should be mentioned/discussed. The size of the cells should be shown with exactly the same magnification in all figures. Otherwise it is hard to compare the morphology of the cells upon treatment with different inhibitors. To my mind it seems that the treatment does result in changes in cell size and shape i.e. Figure 1, unlike what is stated for Ro in the 7th paragraph of page 4. In Figure 2 only the cells in the top line show stunting; the cells shown in the lines below look normal to me. The authors should carefully check again whether parts/paragraphs can be moved into the method section and vice versa. In Figure 6 fluorescence intensity is given. How was this measured, do the authors not mean distribution?
