Severe post-sphincterotomy bleeding during or after ERCP requiring intervention other than simple measures, such injection of 1:10,000 epinephrine, or that does not respond to first line attempts at hemostasis, is uncommon. This review, by DeBenedet and Elta, describes 21 patients from four articles where fully-covered self-expanding metallic stents were placed to provide tamponade to achieve successful hemostasis in 100% without complication. All stents were subsequently removed endoscopially or had passed spontaneously. This is a highly select group of patients but this option is a useful addition to the range of hemostatic modalities available for this difficult situation.
