This paper is a survey of the topological properties of known protein complexes and is mostly focused on k-connected subgraphs as a good candidate for predicting protein complexes in PPI networks. K-connected subgraphs have been previously proposed as a good alternative for predicting less dense protein complexes. I have the following comments about this paper: The idea of using k-connected subgraphs to predict protein complexes has already been investigated by other researchers. The authors should therefore clearly point out what is new about their concept and how it differs from earlier published methods. According to Sharan et al. (2007) the functional similarity of protein pairs will decrease as the distance of the path connecting them increases. Hence, a large k value results in a less functional correlation among proteins. Specifically, for k= 3, functional similarity significantly decreases and for k3, or k=1 or 2, the k-connected graph is dense. As this has already been investigated by others the authors need to clearly state what makes their method significant.
