This article explores for the first time the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A5) in lung cells. The merits of the present study are the investigation of CYP3A5 expression in different primary cell lines and the use of various corticosteroids in well-controlled experiments that have produced solid data. Main concern: Although the data in A549 cells are convincing, the hypothesis that CYP3A5 is expressed in “non-transformed” lung cells (tracheal/bronchial) potentially regulated by corticosteroid therapy is not apparent from the study. Unless the authors can show that CYP3A5 is indeed expressed in vivo in the epithelium in endobronchial biopsies from asthmatic patients, the physiological and/or clinical relevance of the present study in steroid insensitive patients is not apparent and this point should be revised in the discussion. Another concern relates to the data shown in figure 3A. The figure shows that the CYP-P450 suicide inhibitor (1-ABT) blocks the production of BDP active metabolite M1.This is a surprising finding as production of M1 is thought to result from the action of esterases in contrast to the production of inactive compounds (M5) occurs via CYP-P450 enzyme. How can the authors explain that M1 is sensitive to 1-ABT?
