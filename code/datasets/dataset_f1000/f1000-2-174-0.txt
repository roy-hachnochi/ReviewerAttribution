Here the author showed that the expression of CIP2A (Cancerous Inhibitor of PP2A) in HT080 human fibrosarcoma cells is inhibited by treatment with the PD98059 MEK inhibitor, as previously reported, and also more strongly by the SP600125 JNK MAPK inhibitor, but not by the SB203580 p38 MAPK inhibitor. Although SP600125 does inhibit JNK, it is known to be a rather nonselective protein kinase inhibitor, meaning that its effects on CIP2A expression could be due to inhibition of a protein kinase(s) other than JNK. Indeed, the author found that combined siRNA depletion of JNK1/2 in HT1080 cells did not reduce CIP2A expression, suggesting that SP600125 targets another kinase involved in CIP2A expression. Other kinases known to be inhibited by SP600125 include CHK1, CDK2 and DYRK1. siRNA knockdown of CHK1, but not of CDK2 or DYRK1, led to a reduction in CIP2A protein, suggesting that inhibition of CHK1 might be responsible for the ability of SP600125 to inhibit CIP2A expression. Finally, the author found that two different CIP2A siRNAs, which efficiently depleted CIP2A, led, unexpectedly, to a reduction in JNK2 levels. Given the continuing and indiscriminate use of SP600125 as a JNK MAP kinase inhibitor, even though it is well known to be a very nonspecific kinase inhibitor, it is reassuring to see a paper where the author has carried out a careful analysis and reports that the inhibitory effects of SP600125 treatment they observed on CIP2A expression in HT1080 cells were not due to inhibition of JNK1/2, and must therefore have been due to the action of SP600125 on another protein kinase, such as CHK1. However, there are a number of concerns about the paper as it stands. PD98059 MEK inhibition only reduced CIP2A expression ~50%, as did CHK1 knockdown. To confirm the results obtained using CHK1 siRNA knockdown (this really needs validation by expression of an siRNA-resistant form of CHK1), the author should test the effects of a small molecule CHK1 inhibitor (there are several selective CHK1 inhibitors, e.g. PF 477736). This would then allow him to test the effects of combined MEK and CHK1 inhibition, i.e., are they additive, which would indicate that they activate CIP2A expression by independent pathways. Does the inhibitory effect of SP600125 occur at the CIP2A RNA level? The author needs to determine this. They have previously reported that CIP2A is regulated downstream of ERK by ETS1-driven transcription, but the effects of SP600125 on CIP2A protein levels do not have to occur at the RNA level (although this seems likely). What is known about the response elements in the CIP2A promoter region that respond to CHK1 activation? One might expect CIP2A to be induced by DNA damage, which causes CHK1 activation. Is this the case? How are JNK2 levels regulated downstream of CIP2A does this occur at the RNA level, and what pathway is involved in JNK2 expression downstream of CIP2A? Do these results hold true for other fibrosarcoma cell lines? Since the data in Figure S1B demonstrate that CHK1 is likely to be the key target for SP600125 inhibition of CIP2A expression, these data should be included in the main body of the paper.
