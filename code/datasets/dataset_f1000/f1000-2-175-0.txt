Tekguc and colleagues describe an 11 month-old child hospitalized for high fever, thrombocytopenia, and possible multi-organ dysfunction. While it is possible that this is an unusual case of HHV-6 primary infection another obvious alternative is that the child has inherited or chromosomally integrated HHV-6 commonly referred to as ciHHV-6. Unfortunately this possibility was not considered in the differential diagnosis. The diagnosis of ciHHV-6 can be established by either quantitative PCR, or alternatively by PCR of hair follicles. Therefore the title A rare cause of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome: Human Herpes Virus 6 infection and the overall conclusions of the paper are not supported by the laboratory data.
