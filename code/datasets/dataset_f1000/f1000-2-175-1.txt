Overall I ‘Approve’ of this paper but I have the following comments: All the patient's laboratory values (normal-abnormal) should be displayed in table 2. In the Case section the authors state that the capillary refill time was prolonged and that the patient had ‘ generalised edema ’; please state how these symptoms were treated. In the Discussion section the authors state that ‘ The patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 11 ’; this should probably also be mention in the Case section. In the Discussion section the authors state that ‘ ALT was twice the normal upper limit for her age ’ yet this measurement is recorded as being 3000 in table 2. In the Discussion section the authors state that ‘ We checked for other viruses which can cause hepatitis and encephalitis like enterovirus, herpes simplex type 1 and 2 ’ yet in the Case section different viruses are mentioned: 'Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A IgM results and bacterial cultures were all negative.' Finally the authors state that ‘ The patient was diagnosed with intrinsic renal failure .’ but renal failure cannot be distinguished as intrinsic or extrinsic on the basis of this kind of laboratory data.
