I approve of the authors' commentary. The mistake in the original paper comes from a confusion where the binocular field is relative to the head, rather than where it is relative to gravity - which is actually the relevant measurement. Cox and Meister are right to point this out. It is certainly true that the field moves as the head moves, because of the compensatory eye movements, but it remains only partially overhead, and has its maximal extent in the forward direction.
