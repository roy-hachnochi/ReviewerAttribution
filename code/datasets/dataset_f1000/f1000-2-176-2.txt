This commentary can perhaps be reconciled with the original paper by considering the meaning of 'overhead'. In the original paper, 'overhead' seems to mean literally 'above the head'. Because the head typically faces downward (compare Figures 5e and 5f), that actually means 'in front of the animal'. I agree with the commentary that this is possibly a poor word choice: it will likely be interpreted by most readers as 'above the animal'.
