Myers-Morales et al. present results indicating that B6 or BALB mice depleted of gut flora using streptomycin do not show altered resistance when given a fecal transplant from the opposing strain. The studies suggest, but do not prove, that gut flora do not contribute to the differing resistance of these strains. A few concerns, if addressed, would strengthen the paper. It is assumed that B6 and BALB mouse strains have differences in their streptomycin-resistant flora. However, this was not actually established by the authors. A control group with streptomycin treatment alone might establish whether depletion (not "eradication," as stated) of the flora itself affected resistance. If so, the reconstitution apparently restored the original phenotype regardless of donor. This or other more direct approaches could be used to establish whether the transfer was successful at modifying the flora in recipients.
