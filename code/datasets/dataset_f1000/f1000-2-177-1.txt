The article “Fecal transplantation does not transfer either susceptibility or resistance to food borne listeriosis in C57BL/6 and BALB/c/By mice” by Myers-Morales et al . demonstrates that the intestinal microbiota is not a major determinant in the differences in susceptibility between C57BL/6 and BALB/c/By mice. It is an important report of negative results. A couple of clarifications are requested/suggested. 1) While not necessary, the characterization of the microbial community in transplanted mice to confirm effective transfer would strengthen the claim. 2) The report by Willing et al . demonstrated that susceptibility in C3H/HeJ mice could be partially transferred to resistant NIH Swiss mice, not completely. While higher colonization and increased pathology was shown, the transfer of mortality phenotype was not demonstrated. 3) The presentation of data for CFU counts should be normalized to weight. (CFU/g). CFU/organ or CFU/fecal pellet would also be acceptable. 4) In the results section: Streptomycin depletes, but does not “eradicate” the microbiota.
