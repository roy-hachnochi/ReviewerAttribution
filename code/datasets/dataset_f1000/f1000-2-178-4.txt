The study by Chatterjea D et al . is well-designed; its conclusions are balanced and justified based on the results shown. I think that it could be relevant to know whether TNF-alpha injections can mimic the effects of c48/80 injections in the model used: hyperalgesic withdrawal responses. Figure 4a leads to the conclusion that neutrophil influx is not affected by treatment with anti-TNFalpha antibodies and c48/80. Data is based on n=3 according to figure legend, though there is a trend for neutrophil numbers to be reduced by treatment with anti-TNFalpha antibodies. I am wondering whether the authors have considered increasing the number of mice for this experiment. If it is definitely not the case that neutrophils numbers are reduced, it remains unexplained why there is a discrepancy with a previous study, in which the authors demonstrated that neutrophils are an important component of the hyperalgesic response induced by c48/80.
