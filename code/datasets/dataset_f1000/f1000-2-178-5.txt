This paper makes a strong case for the early involvement of mast cell-derived TNF-alpha in thermal hyperalgesia and oedema during inflammatory reactions. The only contentious issue is the suggestion that TNF-alpha acts directly on nociceptors, rather than via the cascade of inflammatory mediators triggered by TNF release. The references cited in support of this view either did not directly address this point, or did not provide the intended support. For example, Zhang et al . (2011 ) (reference 9 in the paper) proposed that TNF-alpha sensitizes meningeal nociceptors indirectly via local COX activity and the p38 MAPK signalling cascade, rather than by direct actions on nociceptors. Wang et al . (J Mol Neurosci 2007;32:207-216) reported that TNF receptors in the sciatic nerve were expressed primarily on Schwann cells rather than neurons, leaving open the possibility that Schwann cells are involved in the inflammatory cascade triggered by TNF-alpha. One other minor point: I think this sentence in the first paragraph of the Results "Saline-treated control mice had no increase in thermal sensitivity and showed no tissue swelling after c48/80 treatment" should be "Saline-treated control mice had no increase in thermal sensitivity and showed no tissue swelling".
