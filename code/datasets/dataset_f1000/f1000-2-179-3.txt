This article is investigating the role of perfusion temperature on postoperative outcome and survival of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The idea is interesting, however, the presented data does not support the conclusions. The analysis was retrospective, the time interval very long, monocentric with a bias regarding surgeons, used technique and chemotherapy regime (mixed patients with HIPEC alone or plus intravenous 5FU). The postoperative outcome is determined mainly by the extent of surgery and critical anastomosis and less by HIPEC itself. This has been shown by several published data. The TRNT is influenced by even more other factors. The causality relation between the maximal temperature and survival has not been demonstrated. Moreover, other significant prognostic factors e.g. peritoneal cancer index, completeness of cytoreduction, histologic subtype etc have not been evaluated. Out of any context, temperature may play in the statistical analysis a role but the clinical interpretation of the results should be very careful. For instance, who were the patients having maximal temperature during HIPEC: was this group having a high tumor load with a high Peritoneal Cancer Index?, a more difficult resection, were they co-morbid etc. In my opinion, this manuscript is confusing rather than helpful. We know from other hyperthermia studies that efficacy is affected by every C â€“ this sounds more reasonable to me.
