This article certainly made me sit up and think. The finding of an adverse effect of T max during HIPEC on long term survival is certainly very challenging. The science of the effects of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion is far from solid, but we have achieved previously unachievable survival results by using it. If this article is correct, we are harming our patients by using heat. I do not have the best statistical brain in the world, but the number of patients is small and for example there are only 21/138 patients with a maximum temperature of C and only 10/138 with a temperature C. The model used in figures 13 and 14 may well be valid but when there are only one or two patients with a T max of 37C it is not appropriate to plot a survival curve. The lactate data is interesting because it provides a clear illustration that a biologically important measure is being affected by temperature. This paper creates more questions than answers but is clearly a stimulus to others to examine their data.
