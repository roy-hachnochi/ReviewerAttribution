Salp blooms are medium-scale oceanographic events that happen normally throughout the world oceans. We can only appreciate the regularity, extent, and significance of these events if there is a record of their occurrence. This paper localizes an extensive salp bloom in time and space along the Apulian coast, and also mentions a single anecdotal observation of an unrecorded bloom in the same area in 1998, giving us perhaps an idea of the rarity of such an event.
