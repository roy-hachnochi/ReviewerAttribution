This paper provides data on auditory evoked potentials in rats using a mismatch (oddball) paradigm and also tests the role of scopolamine on the evoked potentials. The work appears to have been conducted well and analyzed appropriately. I have a few minor suggestions for improvement. Fig 2A. 'P6' should be 'P60' How much of the AEP was due to the reference screw v.s. the recording electrode? This is an issue that the authors may wish to address, as the reference screw presumably contributed to the evoked potentials measured in the differential recordings. Table 1. How were the n's determined in this table? Is this the total number of recording sites? Are any recording sites counted multiple times? Need to provide F values and d.f. for all comparisons, not just some, in the paragraph under the heading "Increased cortical response to the deviant tone" as well as in other places in the manuscript. The authors should make sure that the appropriate test statistics and degrees of freedom are provided for all of the measurements not just the resulting p values.
