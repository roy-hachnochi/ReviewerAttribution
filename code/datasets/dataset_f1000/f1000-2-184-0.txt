The manuscript by Jensen and Ussery entitled 'Bayesian prediction of microbial oxygen requirement' describes a novel improved method of distinguishing aerobic, anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. While previously published methods only demonstrate the ability to distinguish two classes at a time, the method described herein first distinguishes respiring from non-respiring bacteria, followed by distinguishing aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria within the respiring group. There are several issues that require additional comments. Looking at Additional Table 3 and Additional Table 4, I noticed that the definition of over-representation of domains may be a problem. For example, Additional file 3, line 6: domain ADK_lid is 86% represented in respiring bacteria and 94% in anaerobes. The authors decide that this domain is over-represented in anaerobes. However, isn't it over-represented in both? The authors state at the beginning of the manuscript that the over-represented domain is defined as the domain being present in at least 65% of the members of a given group. Have the authors considered defining over-represented domains as over-represented in one group and under-represented in the other? In any case, both have to be analyzed and commented on in the manuscript. In addition to the abbreviation of each domain, it may be useful to include the function of each domain. Also, the authors need to discuss the functions of over-represented and under-represented (maybe even completely lacking) within each group of bacteria. If the authors would like to claim this method for all organisms, the analysis needs to be performed also in archaea as well as the available eukaryotes. However, if the authors decide to present only the results on bacteria, this will have to be pointed out in the text.
