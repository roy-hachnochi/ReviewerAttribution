The authors propose a prediction method for bacterial oxygen requirements using Bayesian instance with protein domain profiles. Although there is no originality in the context of prediction methods, the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is higher than that of the previous study. This suggests the validity of this method. This method is expected to be useful for estimating the oxygen requirement of newly isolated bacteria. The manuscript is generally well constructed, and it is readable. However, I have the following concerns: This study is limited to bacterial species. Thus, the authors have to emphasize this limitation, and the title should be “…bacterial oxygen requirements”. The authors have to discuss the prediction of archaeal oxygen requirement. For example, can this method be applicable to archaea? The authors should provide a clear description of the relationship protein domains and oxygen requirement. What protein properties are dominant for predicting oxygen requirement? A previous study (e.g. Kim KM et al. , 2012 ) may be helpful. I recommend that the authors mention some applications of the proposed method. The denominator in the first stand alone equation is incorrect: 0_i = O_i Are the numbers of included genomes in Table 5 correct? For example, Tables 3 and 4 include 157 aerobes, 108 anaerobes, and 98 (97 in Table 4) facultative anaerobes. This is inconsistent with Table 5.
