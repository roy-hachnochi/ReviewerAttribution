This article is an extension and confirmation of findings on the degradation of the borate transporter BOR1 in Arabidopsis thaliana tobacco BY-2 cells. From elegant and conclusive techniques used in previous works by the Fujiwara and Matsuoka groups, the authors demonstrated that, under high B supply (3-5 mM), the BOR1 transporter in transformed tobacco BY-2 (BOR1-GFP) cells was also transported from the plasma membrane to the vacuole via endocytosis for degradation, this borate-dependent process being specific for BOR1-GFP. However, unlike in Arabidopsis , BOR1-GFP did not pass through the trans-Golgi network during degradation. Interestingly, the authors showed that de novo synthesis of the borate-dependent degradation machinery of the borate transporter BOR1 is required for maintaining the degradation. However, it is noteworthy that the threshold B concentration for the onset of borate-dependent degradation in tobacco BY-2 cells was 3 mM, but in Arabidopsis root cells is only 0.1 mM B. The authors should give some additional explanation for this significant discrepancy, other than that the plant species have different high-boron sensitivity.
