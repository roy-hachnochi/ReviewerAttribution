The authors report that coral bleaching at their study site declined dramatically with increasing depth and they hypothesize that the mitigation of bleaching was caused by localized decreases in temperature caused by cold water upwelling. Although they are continuing their research at the site, including monitoring temperature, at the time they wrote this article no data were available to discuss the magnitude and temporal characteristics of temperature differences between heavily and lightly or unbleached sites. However, the manuscript would be improved with a brief discussion of the magnitude and duration of temperature differences that have been reported in the scientific literature (e.g. Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999 ) that have been found to induce bleaching.
