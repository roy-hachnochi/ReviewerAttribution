This paper makes a valuable contribution, highlighting the marked differences in bleaching-induced coral mortality associated with changes in depth of just a few meters. It highlights the need to conduct surveys over a range of depths to characterize bleaching events and, in particular, to identify “microrefugia” - sites where oceanographic conditions reduce the effects of thermal anomalies - as a priority for coral reef conservation. In their introduction the authors mention the importance of both irradiance and temperature, but no further mention of irradiance's possible role in the observed coral bleaching and mortality patterns is made. Additionally, the author’s state that “pulses of cold water were regularly experienced during data collection” as evidence that upwelling of cold water was the mechanism responsible for the reduced bleaching-induced coral mortality at their deeper survey sites. Although it may not be possible to reconstruct temperature differences during the 2010 bleaching event at their study sites, even temperature records from the different survey depths on the Acehnese reefs well after the event may provide some insight into the possible magnitude of temperature differences that were sufficient to reduce coral mortality. Some discussion of the specific parameters that might distinguish microrefugia, e.g. the frequency and magnitude of differences in temperature or irradiance relative to surrounding waters, would greatly enhance the paper’s utility, and provide an important addition to further work on this topic.
