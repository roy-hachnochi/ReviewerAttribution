This article is built around 2 case reports of clinically significant intra-abdominal bleeding in the days following egg collection for the purposes of IVF, in patients receiving therapeutic doses of Heparin. The authors use the case reports as a focus for discussion of the management of patients prescribed this medication prior to IVF. The reports are provisionally novel to warrant publication. The use of English is somewhat idiosyncratic and requires minor review. The text preceding the first case report includes the suggestion that both eggs and embryos may be collected for surrogacy. Only eggs can be collected, and this should be amended. The most important part of the article is in the discussion. The authors suggest a review of anticoagulant co-treatment in the light of their cases. I do not think that their experience would be sufficient risk of thrombotic complications. This problem is mentioned but should be further highlighted by the authors. I would also suggest they further emphasize the use of a smaller gage aspiration needle for egg collection in these higher risk cases.
