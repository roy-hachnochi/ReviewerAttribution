This is an observational case-report on two cases of delayed intra-abdominal bleeding following OPU for IVF in patients under anticoagulant therapy. This article is acceptable, but some changes should be included: There is no information either on the type of needles used for aspiration, or on the aspiration pressure. Why does a young patient (32 yrs) have a negative OPU? How many needle punctures have been performed? There is no information on the outcomes of the oocytes retrieved in case 1. The discussion section is well structured, but authors should present a final recommendation on daily doses and the duration of LMWH.
