By means of several computational tools Uversky et al. investigates the level of disorder of key members in the cellular network of apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. The study represents an extension of their previous work ( Peng et al. 2013 ) and the two are best read together. I found the study very interesting since it implicates structural disorder as a cell death network building/sustaining principle. Since individual components of the network are analyzed and the results of disorder prediction and connectivity (according to the STRING database) are presented back-to-back the study represents a handy knowledge resource and lays ground for the future experimental validation.
