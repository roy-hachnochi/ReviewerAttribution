The author's have addressed my comments on the original version of their manuscript. The issues I pointed to regarding naming conventions were not intended to be addressed now but in a future version of the package. The new appendix is a good addition to the manuscript, although I don't fully follow why "open .Rprofile" is highlighted as code?
