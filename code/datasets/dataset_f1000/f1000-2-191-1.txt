The authors have addressed all my concerns, and I think it's perfectly reasonable to address naming conventions in the next release of the package. The third appendix is a particularly nice addition; if the authors intend to alter the manuscript when they next update the package, the section entitled 'API Keys' may contain a minor typo/area that's not perfectly clear (see below) but I was still able to follow the appendix to alter my .Rprofile. "Navigate to your .Rprofile file, which should be open .Rprofile"
