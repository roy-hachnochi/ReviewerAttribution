In this new version of the manuscript, authors detailed handling procedures and care taken to avoid accidental trap infestation after the first tick encounter on the mosquito trap. Nonetheless, the phenomenon presented by Jose Loaiza and collaborators is uncommon and deserves further investigation. However, I suggest removing from the final version the following phrases from the manuscript: This possibility suggests that an association between arboreal monkeys and ticks is opportunistic, perhaps occurring principally at the peak of the fruiting season. However, ticks were also collected during August and October of 2009, and so, tick-monkey ground interactions could also be the result of monkey behaviors such as drinking from terrestrial sources or chasing games. Monkeys as tick carriers up to the canopy is very speculative by itself, explaining how it occurs is excessive speculation. Should this phenomenon occur, many other possibilities should be explored.
