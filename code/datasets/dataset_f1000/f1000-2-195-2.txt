After the comments and amendments of the authors, it becomes now clear that they are testing the aversion of mice to different concentrations (rather than different volumes) of the high molecular weight fraction of rat urine, and they are doing so properly. Even if their results differ from ours, the quality of the paper is high and the results are of interest for the researchers in the area of communication through chemosignals in the rodent model. We wish the authors good luck in their future research.
