This paper showed the quantitative relationship between the amount of crude rat urinary kairomone fraction, and aversive behavior in mice. The figure 1 data is reasonable, but not interesting. The figure 2 data fails to demonstrate the relationship between the amount of rat urine and the "detection threshold" of the mice. On top of that, this evaluation system is not suitable for detecting the detection threshold of kairomones. This is because if mice spent time evenly in this system, you cannot say that the mice cannot distinguish between these two sources, you can only say that the mice did not distinguish between them.
