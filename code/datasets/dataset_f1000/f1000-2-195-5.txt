This article addresses and characterizes rat urine kairomonal effects on mouse avoidance behavior. The study convincingly shows that 1) the effect is dose-dependent and 2) mice display proportional discrimination across several different concentrations. The title of the study and abstract provide an adequate summary. With respect to the methods, I would like some clarification on whether the different urine doses were made from the same initial sample. If several different urine collections were used, it should be stated how it was verified that the concentration of MUPs in the size exclusion fraction is similar from sample to sample. Otherwise, the conclusions are justified on the basis of the results and the paper is well-written.
