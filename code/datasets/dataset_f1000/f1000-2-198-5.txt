This paper reports an intriguing aspect of the complex pathogenesis of the obligatory intracellular bacteria M. leprae (ML) . The authors report that ML infecting Schwann cells are not able to disseminate to fibroblasts but the cells re-programmed by the bacteria in stem-cell like cells are efficiently transferred to the same cells in vitro . These observations are very interesting and contribute to our understanding of the phenomenon of mycobacterial cell-to-cell transfer. There are only three technical points I think that authors could consider in this work, to unambiguously claim that the putative cell-to-cell transfer mechanism is a non-apoptotic, non-lytic one: The authors stated as data not shown that there is not evidence of bacteria in supernatants. It would be important to show this information and indicate in the methods how it was performed. The authors mentioned that they could not detect any apoptotic GFP+pSLC debris. It would be necessary to show these experiments as well, to exclude e.g. efferocytosis. They should indicate in the methods how apoptosis was detected (markers, staining etc…). The bacterial transfer to fibroblasts is measured primarily by detection of one lipid, PGL-1. It is known that lipids from M. tuberculosis can be transferred from infected cells to “bystander” cells ( Beatty WL et al. 2000 ). I understand that the system with ML is much more complicated, but would it be possible to confirm that the fluorescent signal represent ‘intact’ bacteria e.g by electron microscopy? A minor comment: the authors refer to “strict confinement of ML to the cytoplasm” (results) or “retain bacteria in the cytoplasm” (discussion). Do they mean intracellular?
