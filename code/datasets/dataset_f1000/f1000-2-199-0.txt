The commentary provides an up to date view of activity cliffs and assess their prevalence in ChEMBL. In addition, it discusses how activity cliffs can be defined using potency and similarity criteria. The paper is well written. My only suggestion is to make table 1 more detailed; that is to include the activity cliff frequency around target families or even around the 129 individual target sets.
