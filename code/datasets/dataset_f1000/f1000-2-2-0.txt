 Computing and visualizing multiple sequence alignments might have been considered a solved issue for bioinformatics a few years ago, until the flood of sequence data we have been experiencing recently. In that respect, efforts to address the issue on another scale altogether are indeed necessary. This work reports on a newer version of ProfileGrid that attempts to solve the visualization of very large alignments and a demonstration of its capabilities with the influenza hemagglutinin as an example. JProfileGrid 2.0 appears to perform well, captures some elements of large alignments and provides a useful interface for the exploration of large homologous sequence data-sets. Offering a number of options to users, e.g. color schemes and frequency diagrams might indeed be helpful, but the claim of 'solving' the visualization issues with these data is a bit of an over-statement. For funding agencies and beginners in the field, that might have implications such as not appreciating the importance of this line of research. Beyond this extraordinary claim, the work is fine and provides sufficient detail for interested readers.
