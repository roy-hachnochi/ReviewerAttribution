 The authors have selected an important problem to address which is how to visualise very large multiple sequence alignments. The manuscript describes a new improved version of their software called JProfileGrid originally published in BMC Bioinformatics in 2008 . The software ran on a Stockholm formatted alignment I selected from Pfam and so appears to work largely as advertised. My main critique of the work is the claim that ProfileGrids solve the large alignment visualisation problem as stated in the title. In my opinion the visualisation given does not solve the problem. The problem is recast as a visualisation of a profile. Profiles give the frequency of amino acids at each position calculated from a multiple sequence alignment and so their size is independent of the number of sequences in the alignment. So visualising the profile is one way of gaining an overview of a multiple sequence alignment. But others have already done this such as HMM-logos a nd SUPERFAMILY profile visualisation . Both of these visualisations are more intuitive that the ProfileGrid because it is easier to map these visualisations to a real sequence. However, none of these are really alignment visualisations. They all lose a lot of information that is implicit in the alignment. For example, the correlations between amino acid positions in subfamilies. The JProfileGrid software does provide a compact stacked alignment representation, but that is also possible in other alignment viewers by choosing a sufficiently small font. Overall I think that this is a well engineered update of an existing software package that has some utility. The authors need to remove the claims that this software solves the large alignment visualisation problem. This is in my opinion is not justified. In particular the current title is not acceptable. The text of the paper also needs to include mention that other profile visualisation software exists.
