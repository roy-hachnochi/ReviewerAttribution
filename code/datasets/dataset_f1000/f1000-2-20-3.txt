 This paper describes an interesting but fairly standard set-up for neurophysiology data acquisition in behaving subjects. It would be nice to have more details about how timing and synchronization were verified, and also what are the special capabilities of the hardware that justifies their selection? Nevertheless, it is good to know what other people are using and this is therefore a useful contribution. Minor comments The Power 1401 is rather expensive. What special capabilities justify this cost? Introduction: “which nevertheless continues to be the most reliable and useful way to understand neural computations and function.” This statement is debatable. The communication between the spike2 and presentation computers appears critical. More details would be welcome. What exactly is conveyed by the 1-bit com port? What is the signal timing diagram? How is this bit manipulated? A critical issue regarding the use of LCD displays for neurophysiology experiments is stimulus timing. How did the experimenters determine the relationship between the video output of the presentation computer and the actual appearance of stimuli on the display? Not clear about the hardware for neural signals. Was neural data stored on a third computer? Or on the spike2 computer? How many channels, what sampling rate, etc? How were spikes detected – window discriminator, waveform analysis?
