Juvenile-onset respiratory papillomatosis is often a severe disease, with an extraordinary burden on the quality of life of children and their families. Surgical approaches, especially debulking and, when not avoidable, tracheotomy, remain the mainstay of therapy for this devastating disease. Therefore, the need for adjuvant medical therapies that may allow long-term remission is evident 1 - 3 . In this sense, the current case series by Moldan and collaborators is worthy of attention. The series also stresses the fact that several medical adjuvant treatments are available but, unfortunately, none has shown conclusive evidence in terms of efficacy. The authors treated four patients with an off-label indication for EGFR inhibitors, often combining several molecules (antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors) in the same patients. Furthermore, most patients had in the past received other forms of medical therapy (e.g. celecoxib, ribavirin, INF alpha-2A). It is interesting that patients initially treated with erlotininb (patients 1, 2, and 3), when switched to panitumumab responded better in two cases. This is worthy of attention, as the same holds true for the improved results of cetuximab versus erlotinib in the treatment for head and neck cancer 4 . As the authors and Dr. Bauman state, the major difficulty in the choice of a given adjuvant treatment, including EGFR inhibitors, is the lack of readouts for response stratification. As for oropharyngeal cancer, immunohistochemical evidence of EGFR overexpression is not an accurate predictor of treatment responses. The same holds true for every medical adjuvant therapy. The relatively low incidence of severe RRP makes it difficult to set up proper randomized clinical trials, a problem which may be palliated by multicenter efforts. As the authors correctly state, their findings must be considered as preliminary data which need further in-depth evaluation before any specific recommendations may be formulated. As an outlook, it is likely that further understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HPV-related tumorigenesis is going to lead to the development of new approaches, for example PI3K inhibitors (given the association between HPV and PI3K mutations in cancer) 5 .
