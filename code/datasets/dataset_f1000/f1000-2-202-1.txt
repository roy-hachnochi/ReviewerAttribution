M. Moldan and colleagues report an intriguing, retrospective case series of four patients with severe recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Two descriptive features, including a numerical increase in the intersurgical interval for three of four cases, and a numerical decrease in anatomic Derkay score in all four, prompted the authors’ conclusion that EGFR inhibitors have a potential adjuvant role in the management of RRP. Inclusion in this report required both severe disease (defined by the authors as requiring at least four debridements per year) and treatment with an EGFR inhibitor. Authors describe neither a systematic process for case identification, nor how many cases were excluded – raising the question of how selective reporting was avoided. Particular caution is warranted in clinical interpretation of the results, due to the variable natural history of RRP. The average pediatric patient requires approximately 20 lifetime surgical procedures, including airway debridement. However, 19% of patients demonstrate a more aggressive course requiring more than 40 lifetime procedures, and a small percentage of patients will spontaneously remit 1 - 3 . Patterns of surgical frequency for individuals with RRP indicate significant fluctuation in intersurgical intervals, independent of adjuvant use 4 . Moreover, the anatomic Derkay score improved in both the cidofovir and placebo groups in a randomized, controlled trial in juvenile RRP 5 . Thus, descriptive improvements in intersurgical interval or Derkay score as noted in this selective, retrospective report must be treated with caution. This case series, along with other anecdotal reports in the literature 6 - 8 , may justify a prospective, randomized trial but do not establish EGFR inhibitor therapy as an adjuvant for RRP. The use of EGFR inhibitor therapy in RRP, including this report, has been justified by the presence of EGFR over-expression in laryngeal papillomas relative to normal laryngeal epithelium 9 . Of note, EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry has been a disappointing biomarker of response to EGFR inhibitor therapy in cancers of the lung, colon and head and neck – areas where EGFR inhibitors are currently FDA approved 10 - 12 . EGFR expression is unlikely to be an appropriate selection factor for patients with RRP to be treated with EGFR inhibitor therapy. Of particular relevance to this question, in head and neck cancer, EGFR expression is lower in cancers driven by human papillomavirus (HPV) than those driven by tobacco and other environmental carcinogens 13 , 14 . Nonetheless, HPV appears to deregulate EGFR independent of expression level: in preclinical models, the E6 HPV oncoprotein increases phosphorylation of EGFR, downstream signaling, and internalization of activated receptor forms 15 . The importance of EGFR inhibitor therapy, if confirmed in prospective, randomized trials in RRP or other HPV-related neoplasms, will likely relate to HPV biology rather than EGFR expression level per se .   References 1.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Juvenile-onset respiratory papillomatosis is often a severe disease, with an extraordinary burden on the quality of life of children and their families. Surgical approaches, especially debulking and, when not avoidable, tracheotomy, remain the mainstay of therapy for this devastating disease. Therefore, the need for adjuvant medical therapies that may allow long-term remission is evident 1 - 3 . In this sense, the current case series by Moldan and collaborators is worthy of attention. The series also stresses the fact that several medical adjuvant treatments are available but, unfortunately, none has shown conclusive evidence in terms of efficacy. The authors treated four patients with an off-label indication for EGFR inhibitors, often combining several molecules (antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors) in the same patients. Furthermore, most patients had in the past received other forms of medical therapy (e.g. celecoxib, ribavirin, INF alpha-2A). It is interesting that patients initially treated with erlotininb (patients 1, 2, and 3), when switched to panitumumab responded better in two cases. This is worthy of attention, as the same holds true for the improved results of cetuximab versus erlotinib in the treatment for head and neck cancer 4 . As the authors and Dr. Bauman state, the major difficulty in the choice of a given adjuvant treatment, including EGFR inhibitors, is the lack of readouts for response stratification. As for oropharyngeal cancer, immunohistochemical evidence of EGFR overexpression is not an accurate predictor of treatment responses. The same holds true for every medical adjuvant therapy. The relatively low incidence of severe RRP makes it difficult to set up proper randomized clinical trials, a problem which may be palliated by multicenter efforts. As the authors correctly state, their findings must be considered as preliminary data which need further in-depth evaluation before any specific recommendations may be formulated. As an outlook, it is likely that further understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HPV-related tumorigenesis is going to lead to the development of new approaches, for example PI3K inhibitors (given the association between HPV and PI3K mutations in cancer) 5 .
