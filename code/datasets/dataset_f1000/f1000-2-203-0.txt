I agree with the authors response to my comments, the evidence supports the conclusion that expression of genes encoding homologous electron transport components does not appear to be of value in this case. Further work would provide an improved characterization of the transgenic plants, but the conclusion would most likely remain the same. This is an interesting study and adds some valuable information to plant lipid research.
