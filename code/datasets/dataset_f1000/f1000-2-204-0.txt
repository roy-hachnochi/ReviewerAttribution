This interesting paper provides new evidence that the e2 isoform is absent in brain and it is consistent with the earlier paper by Itoh et al ., 2012 demonstrating that selective deletion of MeCP2_e2 does not result in RTT-associated neurological phenotypes but confers a survival disadvantage to embryos carrying a MeCP2_e2 null allele of maternal origin.
