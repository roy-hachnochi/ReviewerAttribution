This paper, backed by very convincing and carefully discussed images of immunofluorescence stains and Western blots, describes novel antibodies specific for each of the two MeCP2 isoforms, useful tools no doubt, for the Rett syndrome community. These antibodies allow the authors to conclude, in line with many other clearly summarized previous findings, that one isoform (e1) massively dominates in the adult brain. The text could be shortened a bit.
