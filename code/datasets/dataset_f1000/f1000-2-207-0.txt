In this study a relatively new and sophisticated method (using large-deformation, high dimensional brain mapping (HDBM-LD)) has been used to investigate for the first time structure geometry and volume of basal ganglia and thalamus in 13 children with Tourette syndrome (TS) compared to 16 healthy controls. Comparable to a prior study in adults with TS performed by the same group, no significant differences could be detected in volume, shape, or right/left asymmetry. These findings are in contrast to several other studies suggesting a reduction of the volume of the caudate in both children and adults with TS. The major limitation of this study is the small sample size and the heterogeneity of the patients group with respect to comorbidities and medication. In particular, medication with neuroleptic drugs might have influenced the results, since there is evidence that exposure to antipsychotic medication may cause basal ganglia enlargement. However, the study has also several strengths including the well experienced team of researchers, low age range and inclusion of children only, and excellent matching for age, sex, and handedness. I enjoyed reading the discussion, because results obtained in children were not mixed with those in adults. The introduction would benefit from a more precise clinical description. For example: tics are no longer characterized as movements, abdominal tension is an untypical example for a motor tic, and tics be associated with other disorders such as Wilsons and Huntingtons disease. The title and abstract are appropriate. Although this study contributes to our understanding of the neurobiology of TS, comparable to most MRI studies in TS, it is limited by the small sample size and possible influences of medication and comorbidities. I would love to read the results of a follow-up study including a larger number of patients soon.
