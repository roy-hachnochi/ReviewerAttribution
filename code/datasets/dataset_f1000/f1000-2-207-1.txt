This study continues the quest for subtle structural abnormalities in striato-thalamo-cortical circuitry in Tourette syndrome. The technique is innovative and in this paper is negative for a relatively small number of children as it has been for a similar number of adults in the past. The technique has yielded positive results in certain other conditions. The current results are not consistent with some other larger studies of caudate volumes and the reasons for this are explored and are a common issue in this area. Given the small number of subjects with heterogeneity of comorbidities and medication history the negative result here cannot be definitive, as suggested in the discussion. A common group of core authors in a small number of sites published the previous HDBM-LD work and so external replication, particularly of the so far positive results would be valuable. The methadology is described more fully in an earlier paper, but it is hard to confirm if it could be reproduced directly from this alone. The title and abstract are appropriate.
