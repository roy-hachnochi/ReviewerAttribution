SV2 is a transporter-like synaptic vesicle membrane protein with unknown function. In the previous work, this group has shown that SV2 can bind ATP. In this paper, the group extended characterization of SV2 protein and found that SV2 does not hydrolyze ATP. This is important information about function of SV2. It is very difficult, however, to give any conclusion from negative results. Although I almost agree that SV2 does not possess ATP hydrolytic activity, the results shown here only mean that ATP hydrolytic activity by SV2 is under the detection limit under the conditions employed. The title and some sentences in the text are thus overstated. Further characterization on the SV2-dependent ATP hydrolytic activity, that is the effects of phospholipids and detergents, temperature and dose dependence on the ATP hydrolytic activity, will be required to support this conclusion. In addition, it is helpful for readers to evaluate the suitability of the assay system used in the paper if the authors use any kinds of ATPase as another positive control. Furthermore, some important properties for enzymatic reaction by ATPase are lacking, some of which are as follows: Indicate evidence that SV2A and B were purified. Use of CIP as positive control is inappropriate. Please use ATPase such as ABC-type transporter for positive control. Please show the effect of phospholipids on ATP hydrolysis by SV2. Please show the dose dependence of SV2 protein. Temperature dependence.
