This is a nice, straightforward analysis of features of protein decoy sets. The authors find that a simple, novel measure of protein geometry is sufficient to distinguish native structures from decoys in the popular fisa decoy set. A rational response to this work would be to include measures of geometry such as that which are used here in the generation of the decoys. This would make the measure less useful, but would improve decoy sets.
