This paper proposes an absolute discriminator to identify non-native protein structures based on backbone C α atom distance. Interestingly the authors found that most methods performed poorly in the fisa decoy set from the Decoys “R” Us database and remind researchers to be cautious of using this decoy set since most of the sub-structures in the fisa decoy set are incorrect. This work provides a simple and fast assessment for protein structure quality.
