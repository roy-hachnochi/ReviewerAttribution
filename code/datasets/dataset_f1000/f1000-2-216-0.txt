In this work, Wasko et al. investigate whether altering the pH of rich medium can result in changes to the replicative lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4742. They find that replicative lifespan, except in the most extreme case of pH 9.0, is not affected by extracellular pH. Their results indicate that mutations and conditions increasing replicative lifespan are unlikely to do so through altering acidity/alkalinity of rich medium. Recently, it was demonstrated by Hughes et al . Nature 492:261-265 that deletion of the vacuolar V 1 V O -ATPase subunit Vma2p, which results in an increased vacuolar pH, causes a drastic shortening of replicative lifespan. Also, Hughes et al . found, by a qualitative microscopy assay, that over expression of VMA1 or VPH2 decreased vacuolar pH and that replicative lifespan was coincidentally increased. Extracellular pH has been demonstrated to impinge on vacuolar pH, more prominently in the case of increased medium pH. This has been examined most comprehensively by Brett et al . PLoS ONE 6(3):e17619 , but has also been demonstrated by others using genetic, fluorophore-based, and even 31 P-NMR-based assays. If extracellular pH impinges upon vacuolar pH, and if replicative lifespan depends upon vacuolar pH, then why is replicative lifespan not changed upon altering extracellular pH? A discussion of this point is definitely warranted in a revised version of this manuscript.
