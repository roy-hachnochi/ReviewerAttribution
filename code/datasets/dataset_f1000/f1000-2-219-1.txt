I thank the authors for the revised article and in particular addressing in detail the electrode placement issue. I agree that interpretation of results from tDCS studies may need to be qualified when using two cerebral electrodes, and that using an extracerebral or extracephalic reference electrode can in theory avoid this ambiguity. However, it should not be assumed that the reduced cortical excitability that can result when using such montages due to the greater interelectrode distances necessarily results in reduced efficacy in therapeutic/behavioural applications of tDCS. This is due to a conceivably greater cerebral area being modulated when for example using an extracephalic reference, which when treating major depressive disorder, may be just as effective (if not more) than a 'bi-cerebral' montage, as it may activate a larger network of brain regions involved in depression. As the authors note, widespread stimulation outside the electrode sites is a characteristic of tDCS and assumptions that effects are limited to the electrode sites are overly simplistic.
