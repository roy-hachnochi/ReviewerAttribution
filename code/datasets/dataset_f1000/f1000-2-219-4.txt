 Introduction: The authors cite previous studies (e.g., Zaehle et al ., 2011) as an example that the applied electrode montage makes the interpretation of the effect of previous tDCS results difficult, due to the confounding factor coming from the cephalic or extracephalic position of the return electrode. However, the present study addresses this question relatively shortly, limiting the question to the extracephalic reference electrode position. Please rewrite this sentence. Method: Why did you include 21 subjects? Did the task last for exactly the same time for each participant (irrespectively of the individual differences in the reaction time)? Why did the participants receive performance-dependent extra monetary reward on Day 2 only? It makes the comparison between Day 2 and the previous session rather difficult. Results: First paragraph: line 1-5 and line 6 is seemingly contradictory. Discussion: page 5: ” no effect of tDCS “ delete stimulation, and: “ was identified ” on what?
