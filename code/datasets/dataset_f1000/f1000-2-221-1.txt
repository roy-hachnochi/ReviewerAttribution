 This seems like a very interesting new idea, and the experiments seem well done. I do find the title a bit confusing. if the proteins are aggregated, how is it that they attack the membranes without needing aggregates? Maybe a qualification such as "a common mechanism for aggregation-prone proteins to attack membranes without the participation of large aggregates"? The only other small change I would recommend is to check the title of Figure 2. Should this be NMR not NME?
