I fully agree with the reviewer from Bonn, Matthias Simon. Meningiomas grade III are fortunately rare and they do metastasize through vascular pathways. Of course a register of such cases would be a valuable tool to get an idea of the prevalence of such events. The case reported by Basunaid is a tragic one as the patient asked for euthanasia one week after dismissal from hospital. This shows that he could not be offered any therapeutic option able to provide enough solace for staying alive.
