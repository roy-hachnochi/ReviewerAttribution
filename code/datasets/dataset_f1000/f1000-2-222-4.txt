Basunaid et al. describe a patient with a recurrent meningioma who ultimately developed pleural metastases. The primary tumor was assigned to WHO grade II, and the recurrent tumor to grade III. While this paper by itself does not provide truly novel information, in my view such rare patients should be reported in the literature. This and similar reports will help to build a database which may at some point help to improve our understanding and management of rare conditions. The report may benefit from a more comprehensive and detailed (tabular?) review of the literature.
