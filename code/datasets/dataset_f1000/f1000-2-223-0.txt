In this article the authors provide convincing evidence that expression of miRNas mir23 and mir23b* in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients affected by inflammatory myopathies is unchanged. This result warrants future investigation to elucidate the role of the same miRNAs in cells that take an active part in the inflammatory response in affected muscles. Minor comment: The authors should spend one sentence to describe the existence of two separate mir23b miRNAs. Also, in the main text the authors should correct the acronym PBMC in a few places towards the end of the discussion.
