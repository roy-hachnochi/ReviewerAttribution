This is an interesting case report. However, the discussion is somewhat superficial. I have two comments: Please make it clear that the sensitivity to detect cerebral ischemia by EEG is not perfect and that the BIS monitor has not been developed for this purpose. Please explain why you think that an ischemic event would lead to a decrease in the BIS value from approximately 50 to 25 in your case (but not in all cases e.g. your references). What is the temporal relationship between the balloon inflation and the BIS value. You state that it "fell to approximately 25 over a 60 second period". Theoretically, I would expect some delay before the BIS reacts (already because it samples over 15 or 30 seconds to calculate the BIS value; which sampling interval did you use?). Is there an alternative explanation you could offer (e.g. did you check the EMG value)? Did you administer neuromuscular blockers or other drugs prior to balloon inflation, is it possible that you recorded an artifact of some type? Please expand your case description and the discussion.
