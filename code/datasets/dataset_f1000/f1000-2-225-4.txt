The authors should mention that BIS has a very limited ability to detect ischemia as it only monitors the frontal lobe. Therefore it cannot be compared to traditional 16 channels EEG or NIRS to detect cerebral ischemia. This case should not be used as standard for care for using BIS as a monitor for cerebral ischemia.
