This is a well-written and instructive case report. It emphasizes that minoxidil, which is not a standard first line therapy in alopecia areata, should probably not be used in young children because of possible side effects. Some comments: Detailed information about the endocrinological work-up performed would be of interest. Were minoxidil levels in the blood of the child assessed? Was there a family history of hypertrichosis? Is there a follow up picture that shows the improvement of the hypertrichosis after discontinuation of minoxidil?
