This case report is well written and informative. Here are a few comments: 1. " The patient was referred to a pediatric endocrinologist who excluded underlying endocrinological abnormalities ." - It would be very helpful if a short paragraph about the possible endocrinologic causes and the lab work done by the endocrinologist to exclude them could be added. 2. " Minoxidil was discontinued and considerable clinical improvement of the hypertrichosis and the scalp alopecia areata was observed at two month follow up " - Are there any photographs to demonstrate the improvement of hypertrichosis?
