In this interesting paper, Aditya Padhi and colleagues describe a mechanism for predicting the effect of mutations in the ANG gene on the risk of ALS. The paper is well written, the title is appropriate, the abstract provides a good summary and there is an excellent explanation of the study design, methods and analysis. I have only two minor recommendations: First, the authors state that there is no successful therapy for ALS. This completely depends on what is meant by successful; there are many therapies and it is the only neurodegenerative disease for which a disease-modifying therapy exists - riluzole. I agree there are no curative or disease-halting therapies. Perhaps this sentence could be rephrased. Secondly, the authors state that functional assays have been used to predict whether certain mutations cause ALS. I would argue that this is not possible. They can only show a laboratory-based mechanism that is consistent with ALS causation. It would be helpful if the authors could provide the URL for the ALSoD database at first citation.
