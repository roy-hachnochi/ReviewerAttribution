This case report is well written and will be helpful to practitioners. Major concerns: The case report needs to add a few additional details, especially: A graphical representation of the blood flow over certain time periods. The gauge of the needle used for this patient Access recirculation, if any. KT/V The ratio of AVF fistula vs AVG vs catheter in the institute. Ultrasonography pictures of pre and post procedures. The time duration between the placement of AVG and cannulation. Details of the organism(s) detected from the culture. These are all the educational points which will help the practitioners at the outset. The case reports' stress is currently on the procedure, which is not unique. Instead, as this article is addressed to the nephrology community, I would suggest that the stress should be changed so as to lean more towards the event that lead to the pseudo-aneurysm.
