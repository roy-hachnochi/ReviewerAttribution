This is a case report on the management of a pseudoaneurysm of a fistula by interposing a graft. Aneurysms are becoming increasingly common as patient timelines on dialysis are increasing. The management strategy is not novel however there is little reported in the literature on this subject. The article would benefit from pre and post procedure pictures. It would also be useful to hear about other case experiences in the unit that have long term outcomes. Overall this case report is useful for other practitioners as it promotes monitoring/referral and highlights a management strategy for pseudoaneurysms.
