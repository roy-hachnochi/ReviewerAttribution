 Literature concerning PRP use in rotator cuff pathology is mainly oriented towards intra-operative use of this biological strategy. However, recently, a double blinded randomized controlled trial on 39 patients has been published ( Rha DW et al. (2012) Comparison of the therapeutic effects of ultrasound-guided platelet-rich plasma injection and dry needling in rotator cuff disease: a randomized controlled trial ). This article is a case report on the same topic, with all the scientific limitations related to the nature of such kind of article. At the present moment, also considering the controversies arisen on PRP application in tendon pathology, we need well designed high quality trials to assess the efficacy of this treatment option. The article is written in a fair manner without big methodological bias. However method is not only how you did what you did but also what you could have done better. Of course case reports provide poor evidence and it is impossible to rely just on findings from this kind of study. The author of the present study should have used some clinical scores (there are many available for the shoulder) to document outcome over time, MRI pre- and post-treatment should be added to better assess tendon healing and the features of PRP used should be discussed as this is one of the crucial points of current debate on PRP application. These changes could improve the scientific value of this case report, and it is important to be exhaustive when you have a single patient examined.
