This is one of the most succinct, yet comprehensive analysis of the complex issues surrounding the development of a resilient, socially viable food system for our future I have ever come across. Consistent with the observations made in recent UN studies, “ Agriculture at a Crossroads ,” “ Agroecology and the Right to Food ,” “ Save and Grow ” and “ The Future We Want ” this brief paper outlines the key issues that must be incorporated into designs for a viable food system for the future. The tile and abstract accurately reflect the content of the paper and its core position. The paper clearly points out that people in their own communities, and especially small-holder farmers, need to have access to fundamental resources to have the right to food and the necessary information and natural and social capital to achieve food sovereignty, escape the poverty traps that capture so many of the very people who can provide secure food systems and restore and maintain the biodiversity necessary for a resilient food system for future generations. This paper presents a brilliant, science-based alternative paradigm to the neo-liberal, global-export-oriented model which is often presented in our current culture as “the only way to feed 9 billion people” when in point of fact, it fails to address some of the key problems of that system: entrenching the poor in poverty traps, eroding the ecological capital of the very communities it purports to feed, and perpetuating many of the social dysfunctions that prevent large populations in poor rural communities from achieving the right to food. This paper and many of those it cites need to be published widely and called to the attention of the public press so that the general public can become more aware of the issues we all need to address. This paper conforms to our highest scientific standards and makes its case persuasively and competently. I highly recommend it for indexing as presented.
