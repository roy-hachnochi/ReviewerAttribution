This is an interesting report showing that naphazoline use was associated with chronic headache in one patient. The patient deserved further evaluation to exclude other brain pathologies related to chronic headache (e.g. no brain MRI or MRA was performed). The authors made a long and nice hypothesis regarding the potential pharmacological induction of headache which, however, needs experimental documentation.
