 Figure 1a protein purification is OK, and the the signal with the antibody to the purified protein is fine, but needs the control lane with extract from uninfected cells. The presentation of the activity in Figure 1b is a bit unorthodox. Why not just present the blank and the experiment for each concentration, and if you want to present the fold activity with respect to blank, it can be a figure below the blank and experimental bars. Deacetylation assays support activity only with alpha tubulin, not histones. For the sirtuin assay, a positive control would be informative; can you see activation of a pure sirtuin in the assay performed. Minor Comments - in the first line of the Results, it would be better to say the first CUG and 271 st CUG codon rather than serine.
