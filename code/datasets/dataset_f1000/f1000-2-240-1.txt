In the current study the authors suggest to accumulate either embryos or oocytes for PGD/PGS in patients who are low responders. This method was found to be successful in its outcome as well as money saving. Although patients have to repeat ovum pick-up cycles and vitrify either oocytes or embryos, the PGD/PGS process and embryo transfer is performed only once. The revised manuscript has been corrected according to the referees suggestions and I found it suitable now for publication. Although this is a retrospective study with heterogeneous patients but still small number of patients, the concept that raised by the author is worth presentation.
