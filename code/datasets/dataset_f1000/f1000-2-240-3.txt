This is an interesting paper that addresses an important issue, but the sample size is small (13 patients) and there is relevant information lacking. I believe that this article should have the following recommendations taken into consideration: Provide information concerning patients’ baseline characteristics (as well as age, AFC and hormonal profile). Could the authors specify how allocation was done? (Please explain “based on the outcome of a medical counselling session with the patient”.) In Methods, Ovarian stimulation of patients, in the phrase “to obtain an accumulated minimum of 6 oocytes” the word “mature” should be added after oocytes. How was the cut-off of 6 mature oocytes established? Taking into account the average rates of fertilization and development to D2 embryos, isn’t this cut-off too low? (It is true that with this cut-off the obtained results are good but the sample size is small…) In Results, the phrase “until a sufficient number was stored ( 6 mature oocytes or 5 embryos on day 2)” : the should be a . One patient did not have any healthy embryos for transfer: could you please explain how many embryos were biopsied in this patient? The total number of embryos available for PGD is given for each group, but could you provide the mean number of biopsied embryos SD per patient? If multiple pregnancy rate is zero it should be specified better, if it is not zero the rate should be given. I agree with the conclusion of the study but, in order to firmly state that vitrification for accumulation purposes in PGD cycles increases the chances of success, the next 2 points should be taken into account: Was the rate of development to day 3 embryos the same in fresh and vitrified and warmed cycles? It could be interesting to analyze the euploidy rate between embryos coming from fresh oocytes vs. vitrified + warmed oocytes; the same for fresh vs. vitrified + warmed embryos.
