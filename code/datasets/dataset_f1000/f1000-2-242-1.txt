The title and abstract accurately describes the content of the manuscript. Method: The analysis described here is based on the selected 30 genes from literature that are associated with the GO term ‘heart jogging’. According to the description by the authors these genes are involved in zebrafish heart jogging, but a better definition would be that these genes affect heart jogging (either direct or indirect). Indeed some of the genes that were included play a role in cilia function and establishment of the left-right axis. Many more genes have been identified in zebrafish that affect left-right patterning and thus ‘heart jogging’. It remains unclear why these were not included in the search. The observation that many zebrafish left-right genes are not associated with the GO term ‘cardiac jogging’ could be due to annotation issues (e.g. not every authors uses the term ‘jogging’ for heart laterality defects in zebrafish embryos). This limitation in the design of this study should be discussed more thoroughly. In addition the authors could make some conclusions about the usefulness of the GO term ‘heart jogging’ . Although heart jogging is a process specific to zebrafish it is controlled by a conserved left-right patterning mechanism. However the GO term ‘cardiac jogging’ is associated with genes that control heart morphogenesis and left-right patterning.
