 The quality of protein structure models is assessed by the geometry of adjacent C beta atoms. The approach successfully distinguishes properly folded proteins in most cases. It adds a new way to assess protein models and could be included in the protein model assessment toolbox. Just a few comments: a) Table 4 lists three of 20 structures where the incorrect one has a lower score. A few comments about structural features of those examples that lead unexpected scores would be useful. b) It might be preferable to note in the title that the method is applied to computational models of protein structure as a way to distinguish the manuscript from those that deal with quality assessment of experimentally determined structures. c) I did not test the available source code.
