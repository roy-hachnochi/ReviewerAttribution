The majority of the paper contains well conducted bioinformatic research. I would ask for a small amount of laboratory work and the editing of one section. To infer a rate of validation of the SNP discovery, it would be useful to see a small subset of identified SNP (10-20 should be sufficient) randomly chosen from the discovery set genotyped using a different method (e.g. Sequenom) in the discovery animal DNA, and ideally a small cohort of animals of the same breed. The section "Access to BAM and VCF file data via the Intrepid Browser" is superfluous to the major paper and could be removed and replaced with a reference link to the paper and a second link describing access instructions.
