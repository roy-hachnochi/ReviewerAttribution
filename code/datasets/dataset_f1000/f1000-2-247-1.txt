This is a well conducted study that examines whether cuing effects of color on 'local' and 'global' processing manifest with relatively low-level visual tasks. The authors find no such effects, with reasonably well-powered measurements. Indeed the measurements have sufficient power to reveal a learning effect within a subjects’ replications of the task. The error bars for the global task are particularly small. I have only minor suggestions: Although certainly not for this paper, I would be interested in whether the present authors are able to obtain color cuing effects in an exact replication of some of the published studies that do obtain such effects. This might be a good project for a registered replication attempt. The paper as it stands now is in excellent shape. If the authors choose to revise it, I think a quantitative expansion on the classification of their tasks as local and global would be helpful. For example is the spatial integration area known for each task, for stimuli like those employed by the authors? Direct measurements of the integration area would establish experimentally the locality/globality of each task in a satisfying manner. Another analysis that could be considered would be to look at individual observer data. Do any observers show reliable cuing effects, and if so in what direction? "... because we altered contrast (rather than luminance), pooled responses from very large ‘global’ receptive fields are uninformative about local dipole features." Although it is easy to believe that contrast discrimination is more local than identifying pattern structure, I don't understand this particular argument. It appears from Figure 1 that the pattern elements were all increments, so that changing contrast must also have changed luminance.
