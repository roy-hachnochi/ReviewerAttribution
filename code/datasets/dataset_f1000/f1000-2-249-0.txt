I cannot say this better than the authors have: Our cases serve to remind clinicians of the potential for passive antibody transfer with IVIG products and to define the potential clinical confusion that can arise in situations where infectious serologic screening is not performed pre-infusion . It is important to realize that this includes HBcAb, since it is not generally recognized that antibodies to hepatitis B antigens other than HBSAg (HBsAb) are present in US IgG products, as shown in Table 3. It is also important to recognize that passive transfer of antibodies also occurs with subcutaneous IgG treatment. The gold standard for identifying blood borne infection is detection of viral genomes in the patients blood. Nucleic acid tests such as PCR are done to rule out the presence of infectious agents during the processing of plasma for products like IVIG, and are available in many hospital and commercial reference laboratories. Prompt confirmation of the absence of detectable hepatitis B virus DNA in the patients blood could obviate the need to wait for catabolism and dropping of the titer of passively transferred antibody, and avoided the delays experienced by the patients described in this paper. I have no conflicts of interest regarding this paper. For the purposes of complete disclosure, I am a salaried employee of CSL Behring, LLC, a manufacturer of fractionated plasma products like IVIG, and a stock-holder.
