It would be nice to know if treating the Borrelia helped the Morgellons disease? Publishers note added on 19 Apr 2013: Since the publication of this referee report, a potential conflict of interest has come to light. It appears that just prior to John English completing his report, he and Peter Mayne had been collaborating on another manuscript. Following the publication of the article by Middelveen et al. in F1000Research , Peter Mayne asked Raphael Stricker to become an additional author on this subsequent manuscript, which has since been submitted to F1000Research with Stricker, Mayne and English among the authors. Given this potential conflict of interest, the original referee status has been greyed out on this report but the comments of the reviewer on the article are still accessible.
