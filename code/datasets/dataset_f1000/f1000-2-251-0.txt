This paper deals with Merkel-like cells in the murine conjunctival stroma, claimed to be identified by immunofluorescence microscopy, incorporating TM1-43 dye and by electron microscopy. I have various points of criticism and doubts about the nature of the identified cells: Fig. 1: C(Keratin) 8 immunofluorescence staining is stated to have been located in the membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm of the specific cells. However, CK 8 in murine Merkel cells is restricted to the very typical cytoskeleton within the cytoplasm. Moreover, CK 8 can be found in many organs not restricted to Merkel cells and therefore the more specific staining for CK 20 should be used to identify Merkel cells in general. Fig. 2: The TROMA-1 antibody staining remains unclear, most probably the nucleus is stained (see DAPI), but TROMA-1 should again, decorate the cytoskeleton. Fig. 3: The TROMA-1-antibody decorates a cell layer and this cell layer is not decorated by the Ngn3 antibody. Again, cytokeratin 20 should be used to identify Merkel cells. Fig. 4: The same is true for this figure (see Fig. 3). Electron microscopy: the particles stated as being neuroendocrine granules are up to 1m/ in diameter. However, the neuroendocrine granules of Merkel cells show a diameter 80120nm and a typical dense cored structure. Therefore, the particles shown could not represent dense cored neuroendocrine granules and thus the cells are not Merkel cells.
