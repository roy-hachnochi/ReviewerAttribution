This study highlights difficulties with the use of MRI contrast agents for the imaging of cells in vivo in stroke models. The evolution of ischaemic damage after stroke typically involves a degree of petechial haemorrhage with deposition of haemosiderin commonly evident histologically or on sensitive MRI sequences after an iscaemic event. Confounding of the signal from iron-labelled cell therapies is therefore likely, as described here. In vitro functional assays offer some evidence that the MRI contrast agent may not affect important properties of the NPC cell line, but the in vivo assessment is incomplete and deserves comment. Effects on infarct volume are highly unlikely with therapies delivered 48h after ischaemia, so this is unsurprising and neither supports nor argues against a therapeutic effect. Functional assays are more difficult and time consuming, but a rodent focal ischaemia model with delayed cell delivery would offer the only means of establishing whether any therapeutic effect is compromised by the cell label. This would be important for further study since it has previously been reported that intracellular MRI labels (a gadolinium conjugate) negated functional benefits from a neural stem cell line (Modo et al. Neuroimage. 2009;47 Suppl 2:T133-42).
