The authors present a highly interesting and very well written study evaluating the role of MDCT angiography for bleeding post PCNL, based on a case series. This paper is clearly worth publishing and excellent as it stands. I have solely some suggestions: The title should point out that a case series is presented. All patients had bleeding post PCNL â€“ what exactly were the parameters which triggered the angioembolization? Were there patients where MDCT angiography had been performed, and as a results NO embolization had been performed? Otherwise, I join in with the comments of the first reviewer.
