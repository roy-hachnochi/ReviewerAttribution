This is an interesting opinion article in which the author describes a common problem in biological research, especially in the genomics/genetics field. This problem is a lack of knowledge of the biology and/or ecology of some of the species that we, as researchers, analyze at a genetic level. The author describes why much of the current research is like this and asks whether this may limit us to a narrow understanding of the genome itself. Typically the research is done by combining different expertise, so that some researches will understand the biology and the ecology of the species, while others will unravel the contents of the genome. The manuscript is very well written and will hopefully make a lot of us think twice about the way we perform research nowadays.
