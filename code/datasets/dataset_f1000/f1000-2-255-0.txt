 From Scott Williams: I have now read the paper and as it stands it is ok. I would however recommend several things that may improve it: State that the data generally suggests that most effects are maternal so that this may be a hard task. Note whether any of the candidate genes that have even nominal data fall in regions of statistical significance. Although not proof positive such findings would support an association albeit not novel. I always like to ask if the cases are in HWE as well as the controls as there are several papers I could cite including some of our own that indicate this is a good way to detect effects. Lastly, I am concerned that their bonferonni correction is too conservative as the ~550,000 are not all independent. We have paper in press on this point. That said nothing the authors have done is incorrect only what I would consider to be a too limited exploration of the data. And since this type of study is by nature exploratory I would focus on lowering type 2 errors as opposed to type 1 (e.g., bonferonni corrections). From David Olson: Preterm birth is a very complex and heterogeneous problem; there are many causes, and these can vary according to gestational age. I would have expected the outcomes observed (no significant SNPs) because the authors did not stratify their preterm birth subjects into homogeneous groups. They should have separated single fetus pregnancies from multiple-fetus pregnancies, excluded those with other pre-disposing problems such as pre-eclampsia, preterm premature rupture of membranes, incompetent cervix, etc., and they should have stratified according to age: 28 weeks gestational age, 28-30, 30-34 and 34-37. I would suggest they re-analyze their data according to such stratification in an attempt to create more homogeneous groups.
