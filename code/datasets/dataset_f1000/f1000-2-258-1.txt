In general, the rationale behind the decision to develop a user friendly tool to compare finished and draft assemblies, to reference genomes, is highly justified. The accurate calling of single nucleotide variations and indels using the comprehensive SnpEff tool will allow a wide variety of users to make use of C-Sibelia. For non-informatic inclined users, the output formats and the optional Circos diagrams visualizing high level genomic architecture for rearrangement analyses, is an excellent addition. The framework for the software is also an interesting choice, making it accessible to social networking style discussions with other users. On the technical side, the authors do demonstrate that the performance of C-Sibelia in detecting variants is comparable to MUMmer and improves upon Mauve in terms of the false-positive rate. These tools are currently highly used and the research community would benefit from a user friendly tool such as C-Sibelia. The approach to decompose the genomes into synteny blocks, using the iterative de Bruijn graph algorithm is novel . In order to validate this tool I have signed in to the web-based version (signing in increases the size of the files you can upload) and tested an assembly against a reference genome and obtained results comparable to MAUVE. An explanation of the common use of the VCF format would help readers further. Visualizations of the SNPs would also be a nice addition in the future. I look forward to further enhancements of this tool.
