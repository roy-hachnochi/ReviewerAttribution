This is a very interesting article about an emerging complication of acute hepatitis E. The following information is missing however: the gender of the patient. if prothrombin time increased during hepatitis. which auto antibodies were screened for. if PCR was realised in stools. the duration of the ribavirine therapy. Additionally in the discussion, the authors must highlight that this case concerned a genotype 3f virus which is predominant in France ( Luciano et al. 2012 ).
