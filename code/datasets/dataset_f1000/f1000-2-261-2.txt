The changes made by Gitton and colleagues in this revised manuscript have improved and clarified their new finding regarding Dlx5/6 contributions to upper jaw morphogenesis. In particular, the addition of Figure 3 and the changes to the text more clearly describe the role of epithelial expression of Dlx5 to upper jaw patterning. However, I do not necessarily agree with the statement that these observations provide the first genetic demonstration of the Hinge and Caps model (p.1 Abstract). Previous genetic evidence supporting the Hinge and Caps model comes from references 3, 14, 20 cited in this article, as well as Ferretti et al. 2011 and Inman et al., 2013 . Nonetheless, the data shown here add to these previous examples supporting the Hinge and Caps model and further our understanding of the role of Dlx5/6 in jaw morphogenesis.
