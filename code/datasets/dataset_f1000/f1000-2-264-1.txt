The article describes illuminaio, an R package to process the raw data files produced by the Illumina scanning software. This tool is valuable, because it enables researchers to use a completely open analysis workflow, without having to use a closed source, blackbox, analysis step. I have tried the package on IDAT files from several chiptypes, and only files from the beginning of 2005 scanned with beadscan 2.2 were rejected. Files scanned with beadscan 2.3 (Nov 2005) and onwards were processed properly.
