This is a comprehensive evaluation of periprosthetic bone loss in mostly total hip arthroplasty that is helpful for orthopaedic surgeons. Currently, most orthopaedic surgeons only evaluate bone loss with plain radiographs. Having the knowledge to use DXA and BMA may be helpful in selective cases, although ordering advanced imaging on all patients may not be clinically necessary. Additionally, being able to combat bone loss with therapeutic treatments such as bisphosphonates and strontium ranelate may prove useful in a select patient population for a specified duration of time. Overall, this is a helpful article with cutting edge technology that may be useful for imaging techniques to better evaluate bone loss, and holds potential for evaluating future treatments to prevent and restore bone loss. Title/Abstract : Both are appropriate Imaging techniques for the evaluation of periprosthetic BMD loss : - This should include a section on x-ray imaging and CT imaging with metal subtraction. - What is the accessibility of BMA? What type of facilities have this? Are there studies comparing this technology with other imaging techniques with implants? Therapeutic strategies for enhancing bone mass recovery after arthroplasty : - Good sections on surgical and pharmacological considerations - Under Pharmacological strategies to prevent aseptic loosening , the authors mentioned the use of OPG and the soluble fusion protein RANK-Fc. However, there are no studies presented evaluating this in the setting of implants and only in the osteoporosis model. This may not be an appropriate to mention in this article (in comparison to the dominant negative IB protein or the IKK inhibitory small peptide, which has been demonstrated to block particle-induced osteolysis). - It would be helpful to provide the mechanism of action of Strontium Ranelate. Conclusions : There should be a sentence on imaging, as mentioned in the article.
