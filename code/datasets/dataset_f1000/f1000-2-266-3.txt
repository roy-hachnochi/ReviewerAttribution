I would like to congratulate Loredana Cavalli and Maria Luisa Brandi on this really quite enjoyable review. For me, I found it quite comprehensive but there were some minor omissions such as the role of electrical charge on bone integration and role of tissue engineering and rapid prototyping on prosthetic design in the future. I would also have liked to have more information from the lessons learnt from failed implants in terms of the pathobiology at the interface. Otherwise it was a good review of the literature and worthy of publication.
