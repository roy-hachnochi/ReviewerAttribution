Because of the very low ciHHV-6 positivity in the analyzed HIV-infected population, the author's suggestion that the presence of ciHHV-6 associates with HIV disease severity seems to be too strong and not (yet) justified. In particular, the abstract is misleading: the authors should add the number of ciHHV-6 positive subjects, and delete/modify the sentence about the severity of disease and ciHHV-6.
