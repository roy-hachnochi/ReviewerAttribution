This study addresses an interesting question: the potential impact of chromosomally integrated Human Herpes Virus 6 (HHV6) on HIV-1 disease progression. The rationale underlying the proposed hypothesis is weak. The authors do not suggest potential mechanisms underlying their hypothesis, which may provide a more provoking discussion. It is appropriate to anticipate that immunosuppression will lead to HHV6 reactivation. Since HHV6 shares tropism for CD4 + T cells with HIV-1, HHV6 could accelerate disease progression by impairing the immune response to HIV-1. Based on observation demonstrating that HHV6 replication accelerates progression to AIDS in macaques, I am curious to understand why the authors hypothesize that chromosomally integrated HHV6 could impact HIV-1 disease progression specially without evaluating HHV6 replication/reactivation. It would have been appropriate to define how the authors evaluated chromosomally integrated DNA. Are the primers used specific for HHV6 or do these primers cross react with other HHV family members? Only describing the target gene will allow the reader to define the potential confounding effects of additional endogenous herpes viruses. The manuscript is well written and the authors do not draw overambitious conclusions. The fact that only one individual in the rapid progression group had ciHHV6 support the authorâ€™s conclusion to conduct a multi-center study with a larger sample size. Based on higher HHV6 prevalence rates described in another groups of HIV-1 infected individuals I would be curious to know whether the authors evaluated HHV6 antibodies in this group and how do they explained that, despite high prevalence, the percentage of integrated HHV6 DNA is so low. The pathogenesis of HHV6 in HIV-1 infected individuals should be further investigated.
