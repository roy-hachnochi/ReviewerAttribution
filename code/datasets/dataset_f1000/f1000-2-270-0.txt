The work described by researchers Whiteford and De Rossi is placed in the scientific field angiogenesis. The research group has identified the mature syndecan-3 ectodomain in fusion with a GST protein as a possible therapeutic target for anti-angiogenic therapy. A therapy that could prove relevant in the treatment of cancer. The biological activities of extracellular core domain of Syndecan-3 is both novel and interesting and deserve publication. The only minor point of criticism to the authors is the following: In the discussion it is mentioned that O-linked glycosylation in the mucin-rich region of Syndecan-3 may also engage in molecular interactions. While this may be true it is also a fact that the expressed syndecan-3 fusion protein is not glycosylated because in was produced in the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli .
