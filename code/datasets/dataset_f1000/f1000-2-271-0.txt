In my opinion the manuscript is well written and describes the effects of intravitreal dobesilate in the resolution of submacular haemmorrhage due to exudative AMD. I think the authors could describe the findings of the angiogram and ICG and how they ruled out other causes of SMH as polipoidal or RAP. As we know, polipoidal is always a diagnostic hypothesis that must be thought when a patient has SMH. Another point to be discussed is if the patient developed a new subretinal fluid and the possibility of a new dobesilate administration in refractory cases. Also something not clear is that the patient was or wasnt already submitted to intravitreal anti-VEGF injections before the dobesilate administration.
