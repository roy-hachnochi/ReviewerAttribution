In their manuscript, Vowinckel et al . evaluated 6 sample preparation methods for label-free quantification, compared DDA and SWATH approaches of TripleTOF5600, and drew two major conclusions. The organization of the manuscript is clear, it is well-written, and the coverage is effective. The first conclusion is supported by their results. However, the second conclusion should be clarified that SWATH outperformed DDA in quantification when a TripleTOF5600 was applied. Without the clarification, it misleads scientists to believe that SWATH outperforms all DDA approaches carried out using other mass spectrometers. Figure 2C shows that DDA of QExactive detected about 40% more proteins than SWATH of TripleTOF5600. It is necessary to compare DDA of QExactive with SWATH of TripleTOF5600. Minor issues: "Protein Discoverer" should be "Proteome Discoverer"
