The title and abstract cover the contents of this original work well. The study design, methods and analysis seem appropriate. Overall I do agree with the conclusions. However, one crucial element should be mentioned (which is recognized by the authors). The fact that it is not sure that the lichens still were alive after the experiment puts considerable constraints about the applicability of these organisms in extensive green roof systems. My experience with lichens is that they normally grow on nutrient poor, dry, acidophilous soils. I've seen Cladonia's enter extensive green roof systems after a number of years (when substrate pH dropped). Green roof substrate used here (which is the standard) is indeed nutrient poor, but definitely not acid (see info). That makes the point whether these lichens are still alive or not even more important. One could eventually use dead lichen material and or other dead materials with similar properties (e.g. albedo), e.g. white pebbles.
