The Title is appropriate, the Abstract is useful and the article clearly constructed. The experimental design also appears appropriate. I am pleased to see complete data collection information, enabling the experiment to be duplicated, however, although it is required as a part of the F1000Research format, the raw data could be more easily understood if graphed. I have the following comments about the Conclusion/Discussion section: The last part of last sentence in the Methods section should go into the Discussion and lead on to a more detailed discussion of the lichen’s growth (or death). This following sentence is unclear. It implies that the non-planted controls had seedling growth. How could this be possible if it was simply straight substrate? “[D]uring the trial, seedlings of trees and grasses were observed growing out of these modules, although control modules also had such seedling growth .” How would the Sopraflora-X get seeds? While beyond the scope of the study, could a line be added about transplanting/regrowth-rate/propagation? Those features have an important impact on the future use of lichens. In my experience, Lichen growth under “normal” conditions is very slow. The authors should talk more about the wind damage which might be an indication that the lichens have not attached themselves. This is important because most green roofs are very windy places. It is also worth noting that displaced lichen cover would function less effectively.
