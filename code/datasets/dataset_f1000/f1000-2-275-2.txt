This is a rare case report of solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) occurred in the infratemporal and pterygomaxillary fossa treated by combined approach of frontotemporal craniotomy and nasal endoscopy. However, the points that the authors emphasized are not obvious. Do the authors want to stress the regions occurring the tumors, pathological findings, or the surgical approach? In the discussion , only the general considerations of SFT were described. Are there differences between the previous reports and the case regarding initial symptoms, radiological findings, surgical approach, or final outcome? The authors should show the tables including the information previously reported about SFT in the skull base. Minor revisions The authors used “minimum invasive surgery” in some parts. I think that craniotomy in addition to endonasal approach was not minimally invasive. The term “combined surgery” or “combined approach” is better. In the 4 th paragraph of the introduction, the authors state“without any facial osteotomies”. However, in the 3 rd paragraph of "Treatment", the authors described that “a Cadwell-Luc incision was made with minimal osteotomy the anterior maxillary sinus.” Are these inconsistent? In "Treatments", the authors should describe the findings with respect to tumor characteristics, such as soft or hard, massive bleeding or not, massive invasion to the adjacent bone structures or not. In the discussion, the first paragraph the authors have already said in the introduction. This paragraph should be deleted. In the 6 th paragraph of the discussion, the authors said that “With the addition of adjuvant radiotherapy treatment, we were able to achieve no sign of recurrence at the one-year follow-up”. SFT has slow growth rate and long-term follow-up is required, such as 10 or 20 years. The sentence should be deleted or re-wrote.
