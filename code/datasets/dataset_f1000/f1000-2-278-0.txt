I don't think the analysis in this paper, or that of Efron, is correct. We actually compute Pr(identical twins | twin brother) as an exercise in chapter 1 of Bayesian Data Analysis (originally published in 1995); we estimate the probability as 5/11 (see solution to exercise 1.6 here: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/solutions.pdf ). The probability has surely gone down in recent years with the rise in popularity of fertility treatments, which have drastically increased the rate of non-identical twins. So I don't think that either 2/3 or 1/2 is a good answer! Maybe I'm missing something here?
