The manuscript is improved. However, the authors have not responded to my comment regarding adjuvant medications (the third bullet point in my original response to the article). The authors have still not provided a statement 'that a dose reduction may be required for patients with renal insufficiency' within the revised article. The authors only refer to drug-drug interactions and do not mention that adjuvant medications require dose adjustments with a clinical disease such as renal insufficiency. This problem is independent from any drug-drug interaction. It is important that this point is addressed by the authors in order to improve this article
