The authors describe a fascinating patient with ASS and PML-IRIS. The latter appeared to develop concomitant with tapering of corticosteroid therapy. I would suggest the following to improve the manuscript: The focus of the paper should be expanded or modified. The occurrence of PML-IRIS at the time of the initial diagnosis of PML is a well-described phenomenon in patients being treated with natalizumab. In fact, as many as 40% of the them have IRIS concomitant with their PML. This literature should be cited. More importantly, this appears to be the first case of ASS and PML. There is at least one case report of polymyositis and PML, but I could not find another of ASS and PML and I think that is probably more important than the concomitant appearance of PML and PML-IRIS. The figures should include some histopathological sections to demonstrate the demyelination and the SV40 staining. Were bizarre astrocytes and enlarged oligodendroglial nuclei not observed? If so, it should be described. Does ASS ever occur with vasculitis or brain disease? A discussion of this aspect of the differential diagnosis would be helpful to the reader. The authors reserve comment on the specific clinical features of the rheumatological condition to the very end of their case description. I think it would be more useful to incorporate it earlier in their description. When did it develop, what were the clinical features, etc? Do the authors think that the mycophenolate mofetil contributed to the PML? After all, it carries a black box warning in the U.S. for PML. Change the wording from "mainly relies on CD8" to "mainly characterized by CD8" or something similar. This patient had resolution of the IRIS in the absence of corticosteroid treatment. This is another important point as the neurological community has widely embraced employment of steroids at the outset of the disorder. A discussion of this dilemma can be found in Berger, JR (2009).
