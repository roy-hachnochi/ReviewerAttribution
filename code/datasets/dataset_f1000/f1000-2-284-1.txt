The authors present an interesting case of rTMS-induced hypomanic symptoms in a 52 year old woman with treatment-resistant MDD and PTSD. Importantly, the patient had a history of a manic episode induced by a course of ECT 10 years ago. No hypomanic or manic symptoms have been reported after ECT termination and the patient had not been taking mood stabilizers since 2003. To date, rare cases of affective switches triggered by rTMS have been reported in bipolar subjects. This important case report indicates that further caution is needed when treating patients with rTMS who have a history of ECT-induced mania.
