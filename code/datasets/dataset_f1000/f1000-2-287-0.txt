This is a well written review on an important topic. Fmr1 knock-out mice have been used as a best approximation of a genetically accurate model of fragile X syndrome, despite the fact that the patients have a tandem repeat expansion rather than a null mutation. The systematic comparison of knock-in and knock-out Fmr1 mice is important not just for our understanding of fragile X syndrome, FXTAS and related disorders, but also for the role of this fascinating tandem repeat polymorphism in healthy brain development and cognitive function. Whilst the maintenance of very long tandem repeat mutations in mouse lines has been a technical challenge (particularly for fragile X syndrome), this can no doubt be overcome so that such tandem repeat disorders are modeled with optimal genetic construct validity. The article summarises and integrates a large body of data. The integration of cognitive endophenotypes with information on cellular and molecular mechanisms is informative. I think it is a useful addition to the literature on tandem repeat polymorphisms and associated disorders, and their effects on the healthy and diseased brain.
