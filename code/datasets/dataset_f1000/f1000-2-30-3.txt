 This paper describes a cross-species phenotype ontology, which promises to be extremely useful. It was not clear to me how much of the data preparation was purely computational versus some biological input. One has to be wary of trying to make too many terms apply to multiple species, but given the collective experience of these authors I am sure this has been taken into consideration.
