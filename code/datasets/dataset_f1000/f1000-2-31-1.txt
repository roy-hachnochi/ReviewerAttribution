This is an interesting, well-written and straight-forward study. The analyses appear to be appropriate to the study aims. Some explanation should be given for the exclusion of nine participants and information provided regarding if they are different from the rest of the sample in some way. Additional demographic information would also be of interest. For example, the duration of shoulder pain and pre-operative pain rating would be of value in placing these results in context.
