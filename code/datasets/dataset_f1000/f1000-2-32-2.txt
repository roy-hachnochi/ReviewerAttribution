The authors compare, in a very thorough and detailed manner, the performance of Microarray resequencing (MS) vs. Sanger sequencing (FS) for mutation detection in the ATP8B1 and ABCB11 genes in cholestatic patients. They recommend the cautious use of microarray resequencing as an initial evaluation tool and propose to limit the use of Sanger sequencing to more problematic and discordant cases. However, given the non-negligible discordance observed by the authors between the two approaches (MR had a false positive rate of 3.4% and a false negative rate of 7%), the definition of the cases that should be analyzed by FS is not entirely clear. Moreover, a number of other resequencing procedures that can be applied to the simultaneous analysis of multiple genes are now available. Some of them are very competitive in terms of efficacy and cost with MS and it is quite likely that in the near future they will be more widely used with respect to MS. Ideally, the authors should have discussed about this issue.
