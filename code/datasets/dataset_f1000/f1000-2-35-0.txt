The depth and temporal nature of the dataset presented in this paper will be beneficial to any researcher interested in cortical development in general, and potentially lead to many new insights and avenues to pursue. A point of note, in my experience differences in passage number of the cells used for differentiation can affect gene expression levels throughout. The authors state “ESCs were differentiated into neurons between 5-30 passages after adaptation to suspension culture.”, I wonder if that is why the DIV21 samples cluster in between the DIV16 and DIV28 when performing a PCA analysis on the transcript read counts (obtained from Data File 2)? Related question, how raw are the transcript read counts in Data File 2, as I thought raw counts would have to be integers whereas the counts given have decimal points? Finally, with regard to the previous Ref Report (Ragsdale and Albertin; 12 March 2013), have you considered comparative analysis using the Allen Brain Atlas/ Mouse Brain expression data for the thalamic and cortical areas and see which region your samples resemble most?
