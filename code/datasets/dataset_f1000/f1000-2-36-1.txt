The study presents novel and convincing data for immunomodulatory activity of synthetic cationic peptide WLBU-2. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that WLBU-2 induces IL-8 promoter activity and stimulates TNFa and IL1b gene expression in the IB3-1 cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelial cells. Several questions remain to be addressed. In particular, given that TNFa and IL1b production is regulated at post-transcriptional level, it will be important to address whether WLBU-2 stimulates the production and secretion of TNFa, IL1b and/or IL8 proteins. Also, given the relatively high concentration of peptide used in the in vitro studies, it is important to address whether the induction of inflammatory cytokines could be linked to non-specific cytotoxic effects of the peptide on the epithelial cells. The IB3-1 cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelial cells were chosen for the study because immunomodulatory peptides are being explored as a potential therapeutic against bacterial colonization and inflammatory tissue damage in CF. At present it is unclear whether there are any differences between wild type and IB3-1 epithelial cells in their responses to WLBU-2. Possible immunomodulatory activities of WLBU-2 on other cell types (e.g. leukocytes) also remain to be addressed. These are possible interesting directions for future studies. The paper is clearly written. Given the many previous studies exploring anti-endotoxic properties of cathelicidins, and activities of cationic peptides in CF models, some sections of the paper could benefit from additional citations.
