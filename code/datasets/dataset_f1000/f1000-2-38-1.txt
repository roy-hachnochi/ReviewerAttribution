I think this case presentation is well written and appropriately referenced. I have one question for the authors: In retrospect, do the authors believe that early delivery at 35+ weeks gestation by LSCS would have been justifiable if they had have made the diagnosis antenatally? And further to this, is there an increase in perinatal mortality if these babies with a patent urachus are allowed to delivery at term? I think the Conclusion should also be changed to read: 'Antenatal ultrasound detection of an umbilical cyst, particularly if located close to the anterior abdominal wall of the fetus should alert the clinician to the possibility of an underlying patent urachus. Once diagnosed post delivery, the laparoscopic approach is the preferred surgical route.'
