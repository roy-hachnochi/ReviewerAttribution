I agree with the authors on how important open discussion is in science. However, the prion hypothesis has been well and openly discussed for many years. Due to the hypothesis, many achievements have been obtained. Abnormal prion proteins resulting from prion protein gene mutations clearly cause genetic prion diseases. Minor point: “Abnormal prions” should be “prions”, because prions all are abnormal.
