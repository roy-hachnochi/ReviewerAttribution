On the surface, the results seem quite striking with virtually any sperm endpoint one can imagine being significantly altered in the collective analysis of mobile phone studies compiled. However, upon looking at the data in the supplementary table, it is obvious that the relatively few studies compiled varied widely both in respect to endpoints measured and the sample size. As shown in Table 1, motility is the endpoint representing the greatest combined sample size for both in vivo and in vitro studies. Motility was measured in 4 out of 4 in vivo studies and 5 out of 7 in vitro studies. So motility ‘might’ be an endpoint that is repeatedly altered by cell phone exposure. The reason for ‘might’ is the lack of any reported exposure data in this study. In summary, the small sample size and lack of exposure data significantly weaken the conclusions of this study.
