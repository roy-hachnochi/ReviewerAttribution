This article shows how increasing genetic variation in prey can stabilize the dynamics, especially since predator can barely establish in communities without variability in prey. This last finding is by far the strongest and I think that it adds substantially to a current important topic. A second relevant finding is that, despite having only a single strain with low variability, the high genetic variability replicates had also more stable dynamics than the one single strain. The finding that colony formation was linked to predator presence and that there was a trend in which colony formation increased through time also provides a hint on how multicellularity evolved. However, unfortunately I do not think that this article provides convincing evidence of an evolutionary response of defense through colony formation as the authors claim. First, in their preliminary assays the authors did not combine the different strains to see how they form colonies when different strains are present in the same habitat. We do not know if they are able to combine and to cooperate with other strains (at least with the information provided) and if there are emergent patterns of colony formation when more than one strain is combined. The findings that defense (aggregative behaviour) increase when predators are present could be just the result of complex patterns of (plastic) cooperation among strains which change through time, for instance as a response to persistent predation risk. Assays at the end of the experiment to test if after removing predators, colonies were still maintained at substantially high rates (e.g. as in strain LB2405) would have been a convincing evidence for adaptive evolution ocurring during the dynamics.
