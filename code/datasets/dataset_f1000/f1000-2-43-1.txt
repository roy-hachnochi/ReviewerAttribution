The authors of this study performed a laboratory mesocosm experiment that sought to address the role of intraspecific variation in predator-prey dynamics. While the underlying questions presented an interesting and relevant avenue of research, four of the five clonal lines went extinct in their single-genotype treatment. As a result, their contrasts between low and high prey genetic diversity were performed with a single genotype (CBS strain). Consequently, it is unclear to me whether conclusions could be drawn about the consequences of genetic diversity per se , as opposed to the identity effects of this individual genotype. I agree with the authors that it is a major limitation in interpreting this experiment.
