 Overall evaluation : In this manuscript, Behrendt and coworkers present some novel results about the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a cyanobacterium ( Acaryochloris marina ) that relies on chlorophyll d for photosynthesis. Although I am not an expert on the biochemical pathways involved in photosynthesis, the methodology chosen appears appropriate to address the question at hand and the experiments appear to have been well conducted. Additional replicates and tests are still necessary to confirm the pattern found, but I believe the subject matter addressed in this manuscript and the results obtained are of enough interest to warrant immediate publication. Limitation of the study : As the authors point out, additional measurements of ROS levels under various light regimes are necessary. Data should also be subjected to appropriate statistical analyses to derive stronger conclusions. In addition, it will be interesting to test another strain that does not aggregate to reinforce some of the conclusions presented in the article. Introduction : In the first paragraph you mentioned that 2 strains of A. marina have been well described, but then proceed to describe only one (MBIC11017). Please, add some information about the second well-described strain.
