 Overall evaluation : This is a well-written paper describing potentially ground-breaking research which has universal application, considering the ubiquitous occurrence of the cyanobacteria studied, and the crucial role they play in primary production of shallow-water habitats worldwide. Limitation of the study : The authors acknowledge that the experiment suffers from lack of replication of measurements of ROS levels under the different light regimes. They also do not include statistical analyses that would have confirmed significant differences among the different strains, and between treatments (NIR- and VIS-adapted). Nevertheless, the results are interesting and merit further investigation. In general, the experiment appears to have been conducted following appropriate scientific standards and protocols, and using valid methods.
