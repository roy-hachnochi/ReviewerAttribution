The Perinatal Adverse events and Special Trends in Cognitive Trajectory (PLASTICITY) - pre-protocol for a prospective longitudinal follow-up cohort study is rather intriguing. By observing a well-developed cohort of individuals who suffered perinatal adversity as they enter mid-life and later-life, this study can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of perinatal adversity on the cognitive, behavioural and functional prospects of the individual. The findings would also be valuable from a neuropsychiatry research perspective, as it offers examination of perinatal and psychosocial risk factors of mid-life and late-life dementia, cognitive decline and psychiatric disorder. Already, some data suggest that learning disabilities are associated with a higher risk for frontotemporal dementia in later life (see Rogalski et al., 2008 ). Thus this is an excellent and timely study, and the research agenda offers examination of many important questions. As with all major undertakings, the devil is in the details. One would eventually want to see the details, i.e.., the measurement and data analysis procedures. I am especially interested in understanding how the data analysis will manage intervening events such as adverse rearing environment, head trauma, substance abuse, that may have potential for independent or overriding influence on the outcomes.
