 What is the point of using “ecological” stimuli if the response is then reduced to 6 parameters? How is that different from using drifting gratings? The authors should either provide the comparison with simpler stimuli or better justify their choices. The main point here is that the larger summation of two stimuli from the same movie versus two stimuli from different movies may be simply due to objects that span the two masks generating a similarity in the orientation and spatial frequency in the two stimuli, which, in turn, would lead to very well-known orientation-specific effects of contextual stimuli. How is presenting another stimulus “contextual”? the stimuli where either one or two stimuli of identical size. It would be easier to read if the authors used only one terminology, such as single, coherent and incoherent. How was a 2D Gaussian fit to the response of one of the stimulus while presenting both? The response is merged, doesn't this affect the fitting procedure? What was learned from the multi-unit recordings? Figure 2: It is pretty but mostly useless without quantification, the authors should show values of dF/F or contour plots of the significant response (3 or 5 SDs above baseline noise) so that the movies can be properly compared. It is remarkable that the responses to the same mask in movie 1 and 2 are so different, are they really statistically different? Is the VSD signal capable of discriminating the differences between the two movies? Looking at the movies it seems that they have similar spectrotemporal composition. Where were the values presented on top of page 5 taken from? What area? What time? Figure 4:What is “modelized”? Does figure 4A not represent data? Minor Points: Page 4, 2nd column: Dissonance? What is “superadditive”? Does it mean supralinear? Very difficult to understand, mainly because the term is used in combinations such as “superadditive facilitation”
