 The authors seem to only deal with linear addition of activation. We are not sure that this is a reasonable assumption, without more information about how optical activity scales with spiking rate. Thus, supra-linear summation may not be that surprising. i.e. the presence of one stimulus patch might lift the optical activity to close to threshold, so a second patch then seems to create a lot of activation, but it's just because there was a "hidden" threshold. Figure 5 is pretty complicated. We had a hard time understanding it. Maybe it needs to be broken into smaller, more digestible bits of information and have a clearer legend. This paper will be more useful if they also present data using gratings as stimuli.
