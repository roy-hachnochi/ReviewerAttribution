A nicely conducted study. Note three important reservations regarding interpretation and conclusions: Acquisition studies are notorious for variability, and differences between genotypes were observed only on Day 1 of acquisition and throughout the large majority of the study were identical for the two genotypes; A slight hyperactivity especially under reinforced conditions is a fairly common observation with a variety of manipulations, and nose pokes in Figure 1B are suggestive of such a phenomenon (i.e., higher nose pokes during timeouts as well as during reinforcer availability in the active nose poke hole for KD mice than for WT); There are no data addressing whether similar results would be obtained with other reinforcers, such as food.
