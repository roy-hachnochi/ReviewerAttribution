This is an interesting short case report and the images are striking. A couple of points: The actual therapy for this patient was not described in any detail. The timing of therapy for TB/HIV disease could be discussed. The evidence for use of anti-inflammatory agents could be discussed and referenced. It would help to expand on the apparent drop in CD4+ T cell count and anemia. What were the other blood indices and how did these recover over time? As a small point the 1st line of abstract should be “39 year-old”.
