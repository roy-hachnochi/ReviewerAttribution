This is an interesting case report, about a mediastinal manifestation of unmasking Tuberculosis Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS). Specific remarks are: 1- Since the optimal time to start ARV in the course of anti-tuberculosis treatment is unclear detailed comments about case management i.e. TB-treatment are encouraged. 2- The discussion should consider the fact that even though ARV decrease HIV-1 viral load, CD4 levels after three weeks of treatment were even lower (85 cells/ul compared to 28 cells/ul). Was this a clear indication of a recovering immune system? Should an increase in CD4 cells count have been expected?. 3-This report underscores the relevance of an inflammatory response targeting either live microorganisms or antigens from dead microorganisms as the pathophysiology of IRIS. Is there any evidence to support ARVs as a contributing factor to the on-going inflammatory response?
