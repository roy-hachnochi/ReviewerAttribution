The paper written by Uefune et al. studied the effect of qualitative and quantitative changes in a synthetic blend on the behavioural response of Cotesia vestalis , a specialist parasitoid of diamondback moth. The experimental design and methods are correct, and have been clearly described. By bioassay, the authors found that the wasps could distinguish qualitative changes when they had a positive experience (oviposition success) with the volatile blend; while when they had a negative experience (starvation) with the blend, the wasps could distinguish both qualitative and quantitative differences. The result provides new insights into the role of associative learning in the host searching behavior of wasps, and also new information of the extent to which qualitative and quantitative changes can influence the behavioral responses of the parasitoid. Minor concerns: It would be better to regard “ratio change” as a qualitative change; For both quantitative and qualitative changes, only one case was measured. It would be better to investigate more cases.
