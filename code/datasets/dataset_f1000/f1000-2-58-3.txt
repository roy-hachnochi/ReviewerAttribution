The presented manuscript is very interesting and well written. The experiments are very well conducted and it is a pleasure to read. The authors introduce a new size illusion and they investigate it using a very good methodology, providing clear results. I have some suggestions that in my opinion could improve the manuscript even more, but my general opinion is extremely positive. Please see my suggestions below: 1. The introduction is really short, and it doesn't cover the topic of size illusion properly. Several other interesting examples of size illusions should be cited and discussed to provide a better understanding of the topic. Firstly, I would suggest discussing the literature on the illusions that are cited by the authors which are very similar to the one that they introduced here. For example, several interesting papers have been produced on The Ebbinghaus Illusion (which should maybe be called the Ebbinghaus-Titchener illusion, referring also to the 1902 Titchener book that made it popular) that maybe should be discussed (just few examples, without pretending to be complete at all: Roberts et al . 2005; Nemati, 2009; Doherty et al. , 2010; Schwarzkopf and Rees, 2013). The same can be said for the related Delboeuf illusion, which is suggested to be caused by the same brain mechanisms by Roberts et al . (2005). A few examples of recent works that may be worth checking are: Zanuttini and Daneyko (2010); Jaeger and Long (2007). Moreover, other interesting size illusions could be mentioned in the introduction, for example: The Muller-Lyer Illusion (Zeman et al . 2013; Plewan et al . 2012; Proulx and Green, 2011), the Oppel-Kundt Illusion (Wackermann, 2012a,b; Savazzi et al ., 2012) and the related filled area illusion (Giora and Gori, 2011); the Breathing Light Illusion (Gori and Stubbs, 2006; Anstis et al . 2007; Gori et al . 2010), StarTrek Illusion (Qian and Petrov, 2012), Accordion Grating Illusion (Gori et al ., 2011; 2013; Yazdanbakhsh and Gori, 2011) and the Fat Face Illusion (Thompson and Wilson, 2012; Sun et al . 2012), to name just a few. 2. Moreover, it would be nice if the authors could explain in more detail why studying this new illusion is relevant. In other words I would like to know which characteristics separate this new configuration from the ones already known. 3. In the introduction of Experiment 3, it should be noted that the filled area illusion (Giora and Gori, 2010) is influenced by spatial frequency and a similar procedure to the one used in this study was employed. As both are size illusions, it would be interesting to discuss the similarities between the two. 4. When the authors state that several illusions are based on local configuration features, as well as citing the 1860’s work, they should also cite some new literature to provide more up to date references. 5. In the discussion, the difference between perceiving a difference and perceiving a group (Gori and Spillmann, 2010) could be interesting to discuss in relation to the last experiment. 6. The link with the Oppel-Kundt Illusion could be discussed in more detail, for example, by also referring to the work done by Wackermann. 7. In the discussion, some references to the potential brain mechanisms involved would be the icing on the cake in my opinion. Visual illusions are open windows on how the brain works and they are interesting tools to investigate it in a non-invasive manner. It would be nice to read about the hypothetical brain mechanisms underlying specific illusions. References Anstis S, Gori S, Wehrhahn C. Afterimages and the breathing light illusion .
