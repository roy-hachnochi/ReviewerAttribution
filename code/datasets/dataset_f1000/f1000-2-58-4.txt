This paper is a study of a size perception illusion related to the Ebbinghaus illusion and the Delboeuf illusion. The study includes quantification of the basic phenomenon and some relevant parameters. It is well designed and executed, and contributes to our knowledge of this class of illusions. Size illusions of this class have been known for a long time and are still lacking a generally accepted explanation, but have not been studied much in recent years. My only substantial criticism concerns the authors’ suggestion that the effect they studied is based on a high-level mechanism, late in the processing stream. I don’t find that they have offered enough evidence for such a conclusion. Note that recent research on the Ebbinghaus illusion ( Schwarzkopf et al 2010, Nature Neuroscience , 14 (1), 28-30 ), not cited by the authors, indicated that the strength of the illusion correlates with the size of V1, suggesting contributions to the illusion fairly early in the visual stream. As a minor comment, it is commendable that the authors have cited the early research on size illusions, but some of the references, although often cited in that form in the recent literature, are in fact incorrect. For example, Oppel did not publish about the the illusion named after him in 1854/55 but in 1860/61, and in that paper he did not report about the dependence of the illusion on the number of tickmarks. For more details, see Wackermann J. Kastner K. (2010), Acta Neurobiol Exp , 70 : 423–434 . Also, Ebbinghaus did not publish the illusion named after him in the reference cited in the paper, and in fact seems to have never published it. For details, see Burton, G. (2001), History of Psychology , 4 , 228-244.
