The current paper presents a novel variant of visual size illusion that is named the Binding Ring Illusion by the authors. The illusory effect is quite strong as one could easily experience the illusion him/herself by looking at figure 2. The authors further tested several stimulus conditions to investigate why the Binding Ring Illusion occurs. Their results suggest that size assimilation at a relatively high level in the visual processing stream may underlie the illusion. I think this is a clearly written paper, the results are clear-cut, and the conclusion of this paper is well supported by the results.
