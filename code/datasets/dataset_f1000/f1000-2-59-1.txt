The paper would be improved if the following were added: An inclusion in the methods section of the classification criteria for abstracts based on basic/fundamental science. On page 6, the authors state 'proportion of basic science abstracts may significantly influence publication rates'. Data on % abstracts in clinical, audit and basic/fundamental science areas in 1995 and 2005 should be included so changes in patterns of submission/acceptance over the 10 year period can be determined. Information on whether the journal impact factors of clinical versus fundamental/basic science publications differed. Are data available on the funding sources for abstracts published as full papers? Are abstracts of work funded by national research councils and charities more likely to be published than pharmaceutically funded studies?
