 Very unusual story. I am still puzzled how this is all possible. I can assume that original vtc1 line had some Ler-1 background (may be from backcrosses). In this case it is possible that the seeds you started with for mutagenesis are highly heterogeneous and some have Ler genomes still present. Now, such a severe case of rearrangements due to combination of EMS and vtc1 background is unbelievable. I wonder why other plants with even greater instability, such as ddm1 or msh2, have never had anything like this reported. Maybe they have not looked for it hard enough? It would make sense to get the vtc1 mutant into rdr2 or rdr6 background (or both) and see whether this RNA cache plays any role - I would expect much lower chance of getting those revertants, same with reverse transcription mutants. I understand that the event is rare – a single plant was produced – but it would really make the entire story stronger if several different plants were produced.
