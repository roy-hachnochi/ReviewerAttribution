This revised manuscript includes both a better description of the mutagenesis and screening strategy that led to the isolation of sor1 and a new experiment quantifying transcript levels. This addresses two of my initial questions. A transgenic-rescue experiment aimed at verifying that the mutation detected immediately downstream of the RPN12a STOP codon truly corresponds to sor1 has not been carried out. Although I still believe this would be useful to verify this conclusion, I also think that all other data lead us to believe in the proposed model.
