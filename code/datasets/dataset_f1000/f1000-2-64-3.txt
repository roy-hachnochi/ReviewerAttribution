The authors have carried out MD simulations in lipid bilayer for three different models for the C-terminal region of the envelope glycoprotein E2. The use of different structures provides a priori a good benchmarking for the observations claimed in the article. However, the trajectories presented in this work seem not to have converged completely. The plots will show the trend more clearly if running average is used rather than the raw data. With the current advances in hardware and software, it seems to me that the authors have explored a limited conformational space of the system, which might be masking some other biological conformations for the region in the study. I am missing a more elaborated discussion in context with the available experimental data that they refer to in the conclusion. So far the correlation done in this study is too vague. The paper with experimental data the authors mentioned also suggests that this amphipathic helix could fold upon lipid binding. A MD simulation in water could help to elucidate this experimental observation. It would be convenient if the authors could specify the exact definition of membrane interface; for those people not working in the field, it could be a bit confusing. This concept could suggest the interface of the phospholipid bilayer (membrane core) or the lipid-water interface. The legend for the Supplementary Figure is missing the colour code used.
