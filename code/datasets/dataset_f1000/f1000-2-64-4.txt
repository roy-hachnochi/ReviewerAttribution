The paper describes comparative MD simulations on the E2 TM region embedded in a lipid membrane. Different start conformations have been considered based on different molecular modelling methods + a structure from the pdb. I believe the simulations have been performed properly. Some interesting results on orientational preference of the helices have been reported. However, it should be emphasized that the simulations are too short to achieve convergence of the simulation results. This should be discussed in the Results Discussion section or in the Conclusion section. Also, comparison to other simulation studies on peptide helices in membranes are missing (e.g. of the Thielemann group). At the end of the conclusion section the authors state “The results also revealed the orientation and positional preferences of the amphiphilic segment in relation to the water-bilayer interface that further clarify speculations from experimental studies.” The authors mention “.. speculations from experimental studies.”, however, no reference to such speculations have been given and the details of the speculations are not discussed. The authors should give proper reference and should in detail explain what is meant by their statement.
