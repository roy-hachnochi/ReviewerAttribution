This paper is an interesting follow-up to the first author’s recent report ( JCN, 2012 ) that chorda tympani (CT) nerve section causes a robust increase in the number and functional activation of microglia in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST), an increase largely confined to the terminal field of that nerve. In the initial paper, the authors established that the mechanism of microglial responses in rNST was distinct from the better-studied response in nociceptive regions of the CNS because of the lack of immune cell migration from bone marrow. The current study provides additional data suggesting that the microglial response in the NST is distinct—it is attenuated only marginally following minocycline treatment and does not rely on the toll-like 4 receptor, again in contrast to what occurs after injury of nociceptive afferents. It is also noteworthy that the microglial response persists in P2X2/P2X3 double knockout mice, suggesting that a lack of gustatory-driven activity does not drive the effect. The methods, including the analytical approach, were thoroughly explained or suitable references provided. The experimental design was appropriate and the methods used seemed adequate to test the hypotheses advanced. Because the outcomes were essentially negative, however, it would have been more compelling if an example of a positive control had been presented to show that these authors could replicate the attenuation of the microglial response in the pain system, the system from which these techniques were adapted. On the other hand, the fact that 2 different approaches were used to probe the role of TLR-4 is reassuring. The authors’ conclusions are based on the data, which are quite clear, presented in detail, and discussed in an appropriate and scholarly fashion.
