The authors investigate whether microglial responses to gustatory nerve injury parallel activation in neuropathic pain. This context was helpful as a guide to the experimental progression, as well as a model for their hypotheses. The experiments were conducted appropriately. Though group sizes were small, the results appeared to be straightforward and could be replicated. A brief rationale for the different behavioural schedules would be useful in that regard. The idea that the discrepancy in afferent activity after nerve sectioning (vs. the absence of activity in P2X KO mice) contributes to microglial responses is intriguing and will be interesting to pursue. Distinct receptor subtypes, such as P2X4, may also be involved in microglial responses in the NTS.
