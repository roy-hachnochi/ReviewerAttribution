This automated web-based analysis system provides a helpful system for considerably simplifying analyses of dynamic focal adhesions of cells in 2D cell culture. Although two examples of the analysis of single adhesions are clear, the example at the bottom left of Figure 1 seems to show appearance of a rather large, complex, multi-pronged cell adhesion that may be a composite of several smaller focal adhesions â€“ it may be useful to discuss this conceptual issue briefly. After further validation and use by other colleagues, this analysis server may become a valuable shared resource for the field.
