The article is excellently written, clear and interesting. It addresses some of the issues of widely used but often undocumented and poorly evaluated therapies readily available to patients with IBD. The design and methods are clearly laid out and the discussion was relevant and appropriate. My reservations relate to: Although this is an observational study some comparator data in an age-matched group without IBD would be helpful. The numbers are small and the age distribution of the study group is older than one might expect with IBD (mode age range 61-65). This may limit generalisation to the wider IBD population. Further information as to which probiotic preparations were taken would be helpful. Overall, however, I feel this should be approved, particularly as a pilot to a larger study when the issues raised above could be fully addressed.
