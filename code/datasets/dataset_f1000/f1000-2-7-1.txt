 This paper describes methods used for E. coli O157:H7 (EHEC) to prepare phage lysates and to use those lysates for generalized transduction of bacterial markers, which is useful since P1 transduction in this strain requires the presence of a special gal mutant in any EHEC recipient. The general phage methods described are also useful. I have a few minor comments below to improve the paper. - The authors point out that the kanR phage marker does not come along during the transduction event. See the last sentence of the abstract and the last sentence in the second paragraph of results. Both should say something to the effect that this indicates phage DNA is not involved instead of arguing that host DNA is. This is pretty obvious but I think the question is more whether there is some kind of host DNA pick into a phage genome. - It would be informative if the authors can provide a frequency of generalized transductants per phage particle (as well as per 10 microliters). What is the frequency of lysogeniziation by this phage as measured by KanR? How does this transduction compare to a similar phage like P22. - How frequently does the tet marker transduce the EHEC strain? I mark this as approved for publication with some minor revisions as suggested.
