The title should indeed specify that this work focuses on pharmacokinetics (PK). However I must add that the model function considered is unusual enough that it seems difficult to extend their conclusions to a real PK study analysis. The abstract is too general and more details should be provided on the simulation study (model function, number of samples, number of subjects, number of random effects) and the results (differences between selection on OFV, AIC and AICc, impact of increasing the random effect variance). The whole methodology is very well described. But one aspect is missing, as underlined by the other reviewer: the (very direct here) link with the best sum of exponential model and the information in the design. I was not much surprised that K=6 (or 5) exponential got the best AIC when you have 11 evenly spaced samples and the candidate models all had evenly spaced rate constants. Also, why not investigate the performance of BIC (with log(N) and log(NxM)) ? Finally, the conclusions are balanced in the sense that the authors have rightly identified the limit of their exercise which is the generalization of their results to a real PK data analysis: only one random effect, no covariance parameters, only slope parameters, etc...
