This is an interesting and useful study, written in a relaxed style. I believe we need more studies like this, because there is a lot of folklore around AIC, mainly claiming that is generally over-fits. I have one major objection: the effective dimension (ED) of a mixed model is less than the number of parameters (D), because shrinking takes place. The easiest way to obtain ED is to compute the trace of the “hat” matrix. In linear models this is relatively easy. In non-linear models it is harder. What one needs is (in LaTeX notation) $h_{ii} = \partial \hat y_i/ \partial y_i$. I can provide more details if needed. I don’t know if NONMEM can provide the needed quantities.
