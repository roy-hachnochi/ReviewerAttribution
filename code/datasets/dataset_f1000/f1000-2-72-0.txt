Carbon starvation is likely to be a common stress that fungi encounter in the environment. This group has previously identified the xprG gene, which contains a p53 like Ndt80 DNA binding domain, as being involved in the response to starvation. Here they have studied by microarrays the effects of xprG on the response to 16 hours of carbon starvation. They have verified some of the responses by qRT-PCR as well as physiological studies. Effects on glucose uptake, conidial and hyphal pigmentation, secondary metabolite production and autolysis were verified and are consistent with previous studies. The effects of an xprG gain of function mutation support the results. This work therefore provides strong support for XprG playing an important role in the response to starvation – a novel and significant result which adds to the large body of data relating to genes involved in development and secondary metabolite production in A. nidulans . A further significant result is the finding that a second Ndt80 domain containing gene, AN6015- designated ndtA , when deleted results in loss of sexual development. This may be related to the known role of Ndt80 in meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Interestingly an Ndt80 homolog has been found to be involved in biofilm formation in Candida albicans ( Cell 148, 126–138 ).
