This is an interesting report on a complex and somewhat controversial area (insect immune memory responses) by an investigator who has done nice work in the field. The experimental methods are sufficient, although some methodological issues might create some difficulties in data interpretation; The results would be more convincing if isogenic strains of Pseudomonas and Drosophila were used, as differences are rather small (and possibly biologically non-significant), raising the question of genetic-background influences. In addition, backing up the mortality experiments with bacterial burden data (CFU/gr) or even histopathology in selected differences would make the claims much stronger. It would be of interest to have, in addition to heat-killed bacteria, septic injury in the same day as the control. Perhaps priming could occur even by septic injury, in a bacteria-independent factor Future experimental direction could be to investigate the effect of different inocula and whether there is a critical minimal threshold of exposure that results in priming. Another way to investigate the role, if any, of phagocytosis would be to feed wild flies corticosteroids (see Chamilos G et al . PNAS) and evaluate if wild type flies have sluggish priming compared to corticosteroid-unexposed flies. I would also analyze survival data of figs 3 and 6 by alternative statistical method in view of the close overlap.
