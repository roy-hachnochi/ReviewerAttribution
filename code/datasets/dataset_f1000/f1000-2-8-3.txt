The title: “I. Embryonal vasculature formation recapitulated in transgenic mammary tumor spheroids implanted pseudo-orthotopicly into mouse dorsal skin fold: the organoblasts concept” is appropriate for the content of the article. The abstract represents a suitable summary of the work. The methods are well documented, except there is little information about the chamber that was implanted – that portion needs to be expanded (e.g. explain the chamber design, dimensions, material, the pore sizes). How the tumor spheroids were implanted into the chamber (e.g. injected by needle). Using the results section, I only assume that the chamber was made from glass and covered by a hyaline membrane. The article is well constructed and is bringing a different opinion about angiogenesis in a tumor microenvironment. I appreciate that the authors moved their observation from in vitro to in vivo studies and emphasize the fact that the processes in the tumor microenvironment are very dynamic. I appreciate that the authors studied cell morphology during their analyses rather than relying solely on immuno-markers. If the authors prefer to use the original black and white microphotographs, then I suggest adding arrows, arrowheads and other symbols to the figures, figure legends, and text to indicate exactly which cells are being discussed – e.g. megakaryocytes or erythroblast in figure 1A. This type of correction should be carried on to all other figures. Or the authors may switch the B/W Figure 1 with a color Figure S1 (there are the different cell types indicated by the colors). In figure 5 and S5, I suggest adding arrows pointing at GFP positive structures. In figure 10A and S10A, change the scale unit ‘M’ to ‘m’. The discussion seems longer than needed – I suggest that it should be cut to focus on the current results.
