 The authors rely heavily on their own identification of ultrastructure components of cells without any confirmation of the identity of the cells by immunostaining. Furthermore, all of the immunostaining they do show is questionable and likely non-specific staining (in the materials and methods the appropriate species-matched isotype control is not listed, the one that is listed is of incorrect species). While megakaryocytes and erythrocytes are easily morphologically identifiable, I disagree with their interpretation of the data at 5 days, when they state that no endothelial cells are visible. My opinion is that an EC is visible in Figure 1C at the bottom (they claim this is a megakaryocyte). The authors are strongly advised to read papers by Leon Weiss, who did excellent TEM studies of mouse bone marrow and is the expert in this field. Without confirmation of the different cell types in this study with specific immunostaining their conclusions are not valid. Larger numbers of mice at each time point are also required to show reproducibility of findings.
