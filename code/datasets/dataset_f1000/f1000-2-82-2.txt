The suggested technique for the analysis of solid state fluorescence of proteins is simple and can find multiple applications. Although the authors analyzed both fluorescence intensity and λ max of protein powders and corresponding protein solutions, the applicability of fluorescence intensity is questionable. In fact, fluorescence intensity depends on a wide range of factors and cannot be easily interpreted, especially if samples are in different aggregated states (solid versus solution). Therefore, only λ max should be taken as a parameter for analysis since this characteristic has understandable physical grounds.
