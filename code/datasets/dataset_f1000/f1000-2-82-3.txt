The use of solid state fluorescence to provide protein quality control is a modest technical advance. This study looks at both fluorescence peak position and intensity. The latter value, however, will be affected by light scattering that is both particle size and morphology dependent. I would suggest focusing on the peak position as this will provide a much better metric.
