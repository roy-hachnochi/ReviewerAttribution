The publication by Kufahl and colleagues presents an investigation into the effect of positive and negative allosteric modulators of mGluR5 on the expression of locomotor sensitization to the psychostimulant methamphetamine, the results of which apparently support previous data regarding a lack of involvement of this receptor in the expression of sensitized locomotion. While the study is well designed, a critical component of the results was omitted making the interpretation of the current data impossible, and severely undermines the author’s conclusions. Specifically, while the authors methodologically included a saline challenge when assessing the expression of sensitization, they failed to report these results. Without this it is not possible to determine if indeed the increase in locomotor activity observed in the METH pre-treatment group is due to expression of conditioned hyperactivity or locomotor sensitization. I suspect it may be the former due to the apparently reduced locomotor activity (approx 1200) observed during this challenge session even when compared to acute METH (approx 2000). Usually expression of locomotor sensitization is much greater than the final conditioning session. It is therefore unreasonable for the authors to conclude that PAM or NAM of mGluR5 has no effect on expression of sensitization as it is not even clear if the animals are expressing sensitized behaviour. Inclusion of the saline challenge data will clarify this point. Have the authors considered using a longer ‘waiting’ period between development and testing expression? A recent study by Timmer and Steketee, 2012 found that intra-prefrontal cortex injections of the mGluR5 PAM MTEP reduced the expression of locomotor sensitization to cocaine following 21 days but not 7 days. The authors should include this in the discussion of their results.
