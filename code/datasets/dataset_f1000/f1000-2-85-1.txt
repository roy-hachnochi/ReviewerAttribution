The title is appropriate and the methods and analysis are appropriate to this articleâ€™s conclusions. The conclusions are mostly fine. My one comment is that the authors cite reference 23 at least twice to support the statement that lesions of the RIP cause saccadic intrusions. Ref 23 is a report of one clinical case whose brain damage is almost certainly not restricted to RIP and not even very well defined. In contrast, a careful study which specifically damaged the RIP in 3 monkeys reports a result consistent across all 3 animals and very different from that in ref 23 ( Kaneko, 1996, J Neurophysiol. 75:2229-2242. ) The authors clearly present enough data here to support their conclusions.
