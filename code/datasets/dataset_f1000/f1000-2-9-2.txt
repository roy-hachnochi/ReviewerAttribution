The major response of the authors was the inclusion of new images and the addition of the word 'implication' to the title of the manuscript. While these two additions improve the manuscript, the major issues that were raised remained. These include the basis of the study is on in situ ultra structural analysis; the title does not correctly reflect the conclusions from this paper; the lack of metastatic response and hence the lack of a cellular mechanism for metastasis, and the use of one mouse model and one cell line. The authors provide a lengthy response arguing that the TEM complements other methods used elsewhere in earlier publications as their response. They further claim that others have also used a single mouse model and a single cell line, without specific citations. While this may well be the case in other studies providing detailed mechanism, this claim by the authors does not address the limitation of the current study as raised by us and the other reviewer previously.
