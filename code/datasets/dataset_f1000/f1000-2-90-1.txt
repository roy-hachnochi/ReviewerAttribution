I enjoyed the article and was particularly pleased that the authors provided sufficient examples of the keywords used in queries. The commentary was balanced. It is worth noting that while 'Dr. Google' may be helpful in identifying the diagnosis once provided with the keywords or search term, it takes a clinician to be able to sort through the detailed history, physical examination and laboratory data to determine which aspects of the presentation are worth using for a “search.”
