Studies on patient monitoring systems such as this are important. The study has limitations and the authors acknowledge this: it is an exploratory study of limited scope. This limits the conclusions to tentative assumptions at best. The study could be strengthened by acknowledging that the two scoring systems (TISS-28 and SOFA) are not intended for general ward use, whereas this is the overt intention with the MEWS, with which the former systems are compared. Morrice and Simpson (2006) did this successfully in a cross-sectional survey using the EWS, TISS-28 and APACHE II. Neither the abstract, nor the main paper, forefront the difference in purpose of the MEWS, TISS-28 AND SOFA. The results are therefore not surprising: both the TISS-28 and SOFA systems, used within high dependency areas, require staff-intensive input and supportive interventions. The TISS-28 point equals 10.6 minutes of a nurses' shift (a total of 46.55 points per shift delivered by one nurse) ( Miranda, de Rijk Schaufeli, 1996 ). The MEWS, on the other hand, although also designed for early recognition of physiological deterioration in ward patients, but by non-specialist nurses, is used in a context characterised by sicker, more dependent patients than previously described in the literature. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient records have been omitted making replication difficult. The results do not indicate if the MEWS was used as a single parameter or aggregate weighted track-and-trigger system for the record review.
