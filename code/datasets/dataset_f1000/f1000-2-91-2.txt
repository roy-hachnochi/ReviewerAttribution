The conclusion is not justified based on the presented data because of the following concerns: Small convenience sample (n=17) studied retrospectively. Article does not specify DNR status or comment on limitations of care preceding cardiac arrest. Only 48 hrs of hospitalization studied. No detail provided on level of care, level of monitoring, or level of nursing. TISS-28 and SOFA has not been validated outside ICU and present sample size precludes any meaningful correlations between scoring systems. TISS-28 and SOFA excludes the intuitive criterion (concern for patient) that is included in RRS trigger track systems and found to be both common and predictive of outcome. For example, normal physiology maintained with significant support would not meet numerical triggers but definitely be very concerning for clinical staff (cf. discussion MEWS vs. TISS-28/SOFA). This limits both the novelty and the validity of the study. Insufficient detail for SOFA provided in article to delineate cardiorespiratory pathology (only aggregate SOFA) and notably TISS-28 did not change significantly in any domain apart for “Interventions” (again, concern for patient).
