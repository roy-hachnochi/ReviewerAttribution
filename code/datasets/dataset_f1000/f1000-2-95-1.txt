The paper explores an interesting use of tags within the context of recommender systems. My reservations regarding the paper have to do with: The baseline comparisons The baseline approach is a user-based content filtering of similar users. Though this is an acceptable baseline, it would also be nice to see how a pure collaborative-filtering approach works as well (i.e., no content, just article IDs). The interpretation of the results It is not fair to compare the results coming from the first set of experiments, as they use a different approach when doing a train/test split. The results between the two methods can only be compared if the first step of both methods is the same. My suggestion is to use the "Select a tag group at random which contains at least 6 items; call this the target group." approach for all experiments. The reason that the reported results are not comparable, is the the train/test scheme used for the tag-based results has created a very homogeneous test set relative to the training set, and as such, the prediction problem is easier. On the other hand, the train/test scheme used in the first set of experiments, when the user has rated many items, will be significantly more diverse, and as such it would be harder for the prediction method to identify the hidden articles, as they can cover only a subset of the user's interests.
