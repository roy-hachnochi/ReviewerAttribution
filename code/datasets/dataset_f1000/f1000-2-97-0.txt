The paper is well written and the results are properly analyzed and interpreted. An important control that has been performed but not described includes the PBS-injected eyes to demonstrate normal ocular growth at this age. There is no figure showing the AQP4 immunohistochemistry or caspase labelling, when it is discussed extensively in the discussion section. Figure 2 does not convincingly show increased swelling of Mller cells, and as such higher magnification images or specific antibody staining would be useful. The ERG a-, b-, c- and d-waves are not labelled in figure 3. It would be difficult for the uninitiated to understand the figure without the labels. The references should be thoroughly checked. For example, ref. 27 is incorrectly stated as published in IOVS, whereas it is actually only available as an ARVO abstract. It is indeed difficult to assess mechanism of oubain-induced refractive compensation due to the severe retinal toxicity of the chemical. Perhaps the authors ought to try lower doses with minimal toxic effects to tease out the true effect of ouabain?
