This manuscript has been improved and the points I raised have been addressed, but I have some comments about the new Fig. 2: The underlined uppercase letters indicating the blaGES-1 coding region should extend until the stop codon at position 914. ttagat of the IR site shown for the complete blaGES-1 attC is really part of the adjacent 3'-CS in AF355189 (most of the 1R core site belonging to the blaGES cassette (TTAGAC) is found at the start of the linear cassette). I would suggest ending this sequence after the first g of this site. The partial 1L of the truncated blaGES cassette (924-9), the nucleotides derived from the attI1 site (930-6) and 1R of the aacA4 cassette (937-42) should be indicated. I would suggest ending the sequence of the truncated cassette after 1R of aacA4, as the alignment of the complete attC with the start of the aacA4 cassette beyond this point is not really useful.
