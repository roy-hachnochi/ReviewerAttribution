This work is conducted to address the transcription of the fused gene cassette bla GES-1 / aacA4. This arrangement is rare but not exceptional in a class 1 integron. In this work, the experimentation confirmed that the three gene cassettes harbored in this class 1 integron were expressed together from a unique polycistronic transcript. It seems that the authors have observed a circular form containing the gcu14 gene cassette associated with the aacA4 gene cassette. Could they explain this arrangement? Is it possible that the Pseudomonas isolates harbored another class 1 integron containing the gcu14 gene followed by the aacA4 gene? The authors have to provide in the paper the classical length of the bla GES-1 attC site, which is 110bp and contained the 1L, 2L, 2R and 1R sequences-shown in bold.

The translational start codon of aacA4 gene is erroneous in the Genbank data base ( DC236170 ). Indeed, it has been determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing to be a GTG (in italic in the sequence above) and the beginning of the cassette was 24 bp before [ Hanau-Bercot B. et al., 2002 ]. -Could the Genbank annotation be modified as explained above? -The Appendex is not necessary and should be deleted. -In the sentence page 4, line 13, “The single copy of rpsL gene of Pseudomonas ...”, should be replaced by “the rpsL gene of Pseudomonas (see Bodilis et al., 2012 ) -In the conclusion, page 6, change “never” to “rarely”.
