Very well written. I can identify with the ideas expressed in this article. In fact, it reminds me of my medical schooling in India, during which we focused on honing our clinical skills rather than relying on diagnostic imaging/procedures, due to limited resources. Our bedside rounds were more often than not painfully elaborate, with emphasis on physical examination. For instance, examination of the tongue used to be an hour-long lecture in itself. So were topics like variants of Babinski's reflex, types of pulses and their causes, dermatological findings in various diseases... and the list goes on. One would be fortunate to present his/her case beyond the physical examination part. But looking back, I miss that kind of learning. As much as I value my resourceful training in the U.S, I miss the mentorship of old-school clinicians, very appropriately addressed as Master Clinicians in the article. Hoping that these Master Clinicians don't go completely extinct in the future, and help us keep the art of medicine alive and vibrant. My suggestions for revision: Consider deleting the lines- "While I support the advent of technology and the advancement of knowledge in medicine, medicine is also an art which cannot be taught by Google, Up-To-Date or Twitter. You have the experienced hands of a Master Clinician who carries the wisdom of diagnostic skills and carries knowledge." The same message is well conveyed in the paragraphs that follow. Consider consolidating the role of master clinicians into one paragraph and limiting the last paragraph to the 'invitation' alone, such that each paragraph conveys a distinct message. An issue of concern, very creatively drafted.
