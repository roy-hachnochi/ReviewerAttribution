A very nice idea to use this avenue to encourage the master clinician to spend more time where they will make a big impact. That is great. To me this type of publication needs to be short and sweet, to keep the interest in the topic and get the reader to continue to the end. I would suggest: Combine the first two paragraphs together. Keep the third paragraph as it is written - strong. The last 3 paragraphs seem to be repetitive - I would think through the ideas you are trying to convey. Spend time, inspire learner, teach skill-set to others - there are so many examples that I feel the message gets lost. Overall, very nice. Thanks for the read.
