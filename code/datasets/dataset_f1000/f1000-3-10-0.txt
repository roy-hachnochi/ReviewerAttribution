Metastatic basal cell carcinoma (MBCC) is so rare that this case report is justified, in particular the occurrence of MBCC in a patient with oculocutaneous albinism. The manuscript, although well-written, requires some amendment because of some points of criticism that are listed below: Was this patient treated with vismodegib in the frame of a trial, or was the drug given after drug approval? The Cytology of the lung lesion is morphologically not convincing, even after exclusion of neurocrine differentiation. Immunocytology with other markers are required, e.g. Ber EP 4 antibody. Please also show the histology performed from one of the lung metastases in addition to the cytology shown in fig.2. Vismodegib bears the risk of side effects such as muscle cramps, disturbance of taste and alopecia. The authors did not mention how the patient tolerated the treatment.
