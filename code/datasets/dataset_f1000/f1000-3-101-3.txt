This is an exceptional paper in many ways. First, it is extremely well written and well organized. Second, it deals with an important, complex subject, providing a careful, novel analysis and parsing of terms. Though the subject cuts across many scientific domains, the author demonstrates clear competence in each. Finally, I think Hinsen is right in advocating primacy of models over tools (as he has so carefully defined them).
