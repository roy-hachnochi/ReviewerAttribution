Tang et al. report attempts to replicate the findings of Obokata et al. on the derivation of pluripotent STAP cells by acid treatment of mouse splenocytes. Despite attempting to replicate the exact details of the Obokata experiments as published, they were not able to observe any activation of an Oct4-GFP transgene or of the endogenous pluripotent markers after several days of culture of the treated cells. While these results do suggest that the STAP protocol is not simple and easily replicated, negative findings are always hard to interpret and need to be very carefully controlled. For this reason there are some points that need to be considered: It is not clear how much cell death occurred after the acid treatment - was this at the same level as reported by Obokata et al. ? What was the sensitivity of the PCR analysis of the expression of the pluripotent genes? A control analysis of different levels of expression in existing pluripotent lines would help. Is it possible to repeat the analysis with a different Oct4-reporter to avoid the potential confusion with green autofluorescence? There is merit in this replication study being published in the scientific literature, however when trying to reproduce a null finding the controls used need to be well defined to prevent any ambiguity.
