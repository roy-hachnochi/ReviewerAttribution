The authors describe their attempt to reproduce a study in which it was claimed that mild acid treatment was sufficient to reprogramme postnatal splenocytes from a mouse expressing GFP in the oct4 locus to pluripotent stem cells. The authors followed a protocol that has recently become available as a technical update of the original publication. They report obtaining no pluripotent stem cells expressing GFP driven over the same time period of several days described in the original publication. They describe observation of some green fluorescence that they attributed to autofluorescence rather than GFP since it coincided with PI positive dead cells. They confirmed the absence of oct4 expression by RT-PCR and also found no evidence for Nanog or Sox2, also markers of pluripotent stem cells. The paper appears to be an authentic attempt to reproduce the original study, although the study might have had additional value with more controls: failure to reproduce studies need to be particularly well controlled. Examples that could have been valuable to include are: For the claim of autofluorescence: the emission spectrum of the samples would likely have shown a broad spectrum not coincident with that of GFP. The reprogramming efficiency of postnatal mouse splenocytes using more conventional methods in the hands of the authors would have been useful as a comparison. Idem the lung fibroblasts. There are no positive control samples (conventional mESC or miPSC) in the qPCR experiments for pluripotency markers. This would have indicated the biological sensitivity of the assay. Although perhaps a sensitive issue, it might have been helpful if the authors had been able to obtain samples of cells (or their mRNA) from the original authors for simultaneous analysis. In summary, this is a useful study as it is citable and confirms previous blog reports, but it could have been improved by more controls.
