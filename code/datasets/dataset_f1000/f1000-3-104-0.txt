The article presents minimal models for CA1 pyramidal cells, based on fitting the frequency-current curves that had been experimentally recorded in whole hippocampus preparation. There are two types of models, differing in some parameter values, to account for and adapting cell varieties. The goal of the present work is to present the models and their basic fit to single cell data, in preparation for future large network studies. Comments: I think this work would be much stronger if testable predictions were generated from the models. For example, what would be the responses to time varying inputs and how the responses would differ between the strongly and weakly adapting cells? It is not clear to me that obtaining one model for each of variety of cells is sufficient. For example, two strongly adapting cells have very different rheobase current values. If you fit the model to each cell individually, I expect that you will end up with two very different parameter sets. What would be the consequences for responses to time varying inputs, for example? Considerations like these will be very important when you decide how much variability and in which parameters to include in the network model. This is also related to the fact that a single model was not able to capture all desired properties of the weakly adapting model. I would like to see more discussion on the consequences of the spectrum of models for future network work.
