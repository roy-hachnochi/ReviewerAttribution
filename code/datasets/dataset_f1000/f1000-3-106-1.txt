This paper provides an intriguing two-conformation hypothesis for the enzymatic cycle of B. cereus D-alanyl carrier protein ligase DltA. Overall, both structural determination and biochemical assays were well done. A minor point: The two-conformation hypothesis (Figure 6) suggests that the inclusion of ATP to the DltA-CoA-Ala complex functions includes CoA release and a large domain rotation. It is important to show that AMP-CPP, a non- hydrolyzable analog of ATP, can indeed induce CoA release.
