This paper is timely and addresses a problem that will be of increasing importance as units struggle to meet waiting time targets. This is the first paper as far as I am aware to look at the quality of colonoscopy done on evening lists, although there is literature supporting evidence of fatigue for colonoscopy elsewhere. The paper is well written, with clear title, methodology, statistics, results and discussion, including limitations. I have no additions or amendments to suggest.
