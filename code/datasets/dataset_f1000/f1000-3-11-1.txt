Dr. Ramasamy and colleagues present a well-researched brief summary on a topic which has received great attention among physicians treating low testosterone. The authors provide a nice summary of a newsworthy publication by Vigen et al. in JAMA in late 2013. The concerns presented with the methodology of this article, primarily regarding the efficacy of likely sub-therapeutic testosterone replacement therapy in an elderly veteran population, are relevant and worthy of further study. Given the conflicting studies within the literature, further research is required to clearly delineate the cardiovascular risks (or lack thereof) in elderly men receiving testosterone replacement therapy.
