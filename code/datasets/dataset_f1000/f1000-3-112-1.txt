This observation article provides a portrait of an ice scouring event on the Nova Scotia Atlantic shoreline. The article is very short yet explains and demonstrates well the devastating effects of ice scouring. The authors provide several pictures that efficiently illustrate the disturbed community. It would have been ideal if the authors had taken pictures 4 and 7 as well as 6 and 7 with a common guide mark (for scale) on the ground. However, the pictures are clear enough to appreciate ice scouring impacts on the benthic communities. Such impacts on macrobenthic communities from ice scouring are very common in the St. Lawrence estuary and gulf. I do agree that communities in the latter regions would remain in early successional stages on exposed substrates. All information provided in this communication is accurate. I consider the observations reported by this paper as interesting and useful. I would suggest the authors add the reference below into the paragraph 2, first sentence: Bergeron P, Bourget E (1986) Shore topography and spatial partitioning of crevice refuges by sessile epibenthos in an ice disturbed environment.
