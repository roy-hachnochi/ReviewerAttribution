The manuscript on the SAR matrix method offers a useful approach to extract the relevant information from large datasets with compound activity data, and to present this in an intuitive way to chemists and computational chemists. It is therefore an attractive tool to use in analysis of HTS screens and to find structure activity trends and discontinuities in large groups of structurally related molecules. The title and abstract cover the content well. The chemogenomics application of the method is related to the use of compound promiscuity instead of the more usual compound activity on a single target. The methods are clearly described and can most likely be reproduced. The datasets used (even the dataset from the public source CHEMBL) are not provided, so the results will be difficult to reproduce. There is no mention in the manuscript on the availability of the tools that were developed. Methods like these could get widespread usage if they would be available to a wider audience. It would also be good if at least the public dataset would be made available so the results can be compared to other approaches. One significant benefit of this approach is that a large dataset can automatically be processed by the method to create multiple (often very many) SAR matrices. The authors point out that the idea is not that all these (often hundreds or thousands) SAR matrices are inspected visually, but that interesting elements in the matrices can be identified automatically, for instance "virtual compounds" (core-substituent combinations not yet made) that are predicted to have interesting activity. The same virtual compound can appear in different SAR matrices, and therefore multiple predictions can be made for the same compound and the level of consistency could be a good indicator for deciding to make he actual compound. The method also automatically identifies virtual compounds that are close to activity cliffs and are therefore interesting to make and test.
