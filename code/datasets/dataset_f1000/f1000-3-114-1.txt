 This article represents a growing body of research which will hopefully inform the appropriate education and training of our residents. The authors present data regarding the reported use of a variety of devices to manage the difficult airway. The venue of using F1000Research to quickly and more widely disseminate this information is highly valuable. The granularity of knowing user rate and first attempt success rate for these devices is a constructive addition that should be incorporated in future surveys to allow for comparison. With more data, it will be interesting to note whether the lower first attempt success for FOI (nasal or oral) stays the same or even drops compared with video laryngoscopy as the latter becomes more prevalently used and taught. The authors are commended in adding their research findings and their thoughtful opinions for review.
