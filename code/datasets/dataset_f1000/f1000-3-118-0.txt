 Well documented case report. I wonder whether patients with mild cor pulmonale would also qualify for this life saving procedure, since this may ameliorate further remodeling of the heart. Another thing that bothers me is whether this patient was on selective decontamination of the digestive tract during postoperative ICU stay or not? The documentation of pulmonary infections and their (appropriate) antibiotic treatment is somewhat lacking. This is an important issue for lung transplant, immune suppressed patients. Did this patient harbor multi-resistant microorganisms prior to transplant?
