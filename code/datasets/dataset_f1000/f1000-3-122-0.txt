This is an interesting paper about the role of sequence and percentage of eruption of first premolar in comparison to canine on development of crowding in the mandible. This case control study has a sound research methodology. I wished that there was an explanation added about the dataset regarding the control group and the method of its TSALD calculation. The conclusion is justified.
