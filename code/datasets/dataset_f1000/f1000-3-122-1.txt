This is a very good paper, methodologically sound. The findings of the paper have the potential to allow early detection of malocclusion cases and would possibly benefit treatment planning for orthodontic cases. A minor change is needed. In the first paragraph the authors referred to NHANES III 1998. The date for NHANES III is 1988-1994. If the authors are referring to another year or to NHANES in general they should amend the text and use the reference.
