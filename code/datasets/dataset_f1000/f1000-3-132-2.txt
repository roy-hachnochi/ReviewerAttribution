 This manuscript by Lee and Levin continues work by Levin on the role of an immune response to hnRNP-A1 in human demyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis. Previously, Levin had shown that an antibody response to HTLV-I Tax cross-reacted with hnRNP-A1. Now, they go on to show that there are mutations in hnRNP-A1 that affect the localization of this protein and how it could affect neuronal survival in multiple sclerosis.In general, the experiments appear to be well performed. One might be interested to know whether testing in another cell line such as a oligodendroglial cell line would have similar effects on cell survival as in the neuroblastoma cell line. This could also be highly relevant in MS, as in addition to neuronal loss, there is demyelination and loss of oligodendrocytes.This work attempts to address whether mutations in hnRNP-A1 could contribute to MS pathogenesis. It would be interesting to note whether antibody responses to the protein correlated with mutations (i.e. does the mutation in the protein affect tolerance). Another issue that needs to be addressed is whether the mutations in the hnRNP-A1 gene are due to increased mutational frequency that can be observed in replicating cells, similar to the observation of increased hprt mutations made by Allegretta many years ago in MBP-specific T cells.Overall, this is an interesting study which certainly increases the interest in non-myelin targets in diseases such as MS.
