 The authors evaluate the -adrenergic pathwaywhich is an interesting target for modulation of inflammatory and metabolic pathways. This paper investigates the potential (additive) effects of -adrenergic and cytokine stimulation on lipolysis in mouse adipose cells. Additive effects of isoproterenol, TNF- and IL-6 on lipolysis in 3T3-L1 cells are demonstrated in vitro. A major question concerns the applied statistics: The n value seems insufficient to assume normal distribution, a non-parametric test seems more appropriate. The post-hoc test after ANOVA is not mentioned. If performed the (non)significance between different experimental groups should be indicated. Does the n=3 mean technical replicates? If so they should be averaged but not evaluated as separate experiments. If not, why does group 1 to 3 not cover all possible experimental strategies? This is confusing and should be clearly stated. Are there data on a sham experiment? If so they should be included. Other questions concerning this paper: As for most in-vitro studies: what is the relevance for the in-vivo and/or human situation? A good part of the discussion is based on assumptions - e.g. additive effects are suggested to be the consequence of the activation of different signaling pathways, however this is not experimentally verified. These questions should be addressed in an updated version of the paper.
