The presented aspects of the reported case are indeed interesting, however... One cannot talk about pain if no pain is reported. Buzzing and a vice like squeezing of the pelvis is not the same as pain. The vice like squeezing of the pelvis may also have been due to the observed fractured pelvis. It is unclear if there indeed is subjective pain. If there is a report of pain there should also be an assessment of the visual analogue or numerical pain rating scale. Unfortunately this is not mentioned. Another clinical aspect is the missing of a DN4 score (douleur neuropathique 4 questionnaire). As I can see the score may not be more than 3 in which case the presence of neuropathic pain is unlikely. The MRI scan of the L5-S1 interspace is not clear. It lacks a saggital view. The cross-sectional view should be more clearly and preferentially showing more than 1 slice. Suggestions: Add the VAS or NRS of the pain intensity (probably 0?) Specify if pain scores are for the feet, legs or pelvis. If pain scores are not 0 then indeed there may possibly be neuropathic pain. In that case add the DN 4 score. If there is no pain, symptoms should be mentioned as neuropathic or neuropathy instead of neuropathic pain. In that case also the title needs to be changed (e.g. neuropathy in a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain). Add the saggital view of the lumbar MRI. Show more than 1 cross-sectional view of the MRI. Specify if views are T1, T2 or contrast dye enhanced.
