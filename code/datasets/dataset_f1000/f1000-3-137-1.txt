 In this study, the authors describe machine-learning classifiers for predicting aggregation propensities of proteins. A novel aspect of this work is that the classifiers are based on experimental data obtained from different sources regarding chaperone dependence (GroEL or DnaK) and solubility in chaperone-free systems. The authors then use their machine-learning approach to test for ~1100 eubacterial proteomes whether a low GC content correlates with a greater tendency to aggregate or mis-fold as suggested by earlier studies. One possibility is that the GC content affects the amino acid composition of proteins that, in turn, affects their folding and aggregation propensities. The authors show in Figure 3 of the paper that amino acid compositions do indeed correlate strongly with GC content (the Figure shows data for all 20 naturally occurring amino acids, although its title suggests otherwise). They then show that aggregation-prone proteins have a higher GC content than soluble proteins. This finding is not really new since it has already been reported (see ref. 21 in the paper) that GroEL substrates tend to have a relatively high GC content. However, the observation for a large number of genomes that the fraction of aggregation-prone proteins increases with an increasing GC content is novel. A weakness of the paper is that the authors do not discuss the problems of distinguishing between (i) causation and correlation; and (ii) cause and effect. In other words, is the correlation between high GC content and an increased tendency to mis-fold due to some unidentified factor(s) that correlates with both GC content and mis-folding or to a direct effect? In addition, it is also possible (at least in principle) that a high GC content reflects selection against mis-folding rather than being one of its .
