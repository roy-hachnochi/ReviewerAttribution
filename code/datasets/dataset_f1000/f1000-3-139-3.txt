 Analysing several centrality measures in parallel is important and there is a need for this, however, it would be even nicer to compare them (see http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380007001184 ) and discuss better their biological relevance (i.e. what is Eigenvector centrality good for?). Central nodes can be of key regulator function but this is not a result, this is still a hypothesis. It should be mentioned briefly that either simulations or lab experiments should reinforce these findings. For infinite distances, using the reciprocal distance matrix has already been suggested as an elegant solution (see http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01164642#page-1 ). It should be clarified a bit more that a large weight can be considered as a short or as a long path, depending on its biological meaning. In Figure 1, the grid layout algorithm could be replaced by some better one, I think. Finally, a quick English check would be welcome.
