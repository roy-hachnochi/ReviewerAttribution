The author has addressed a majority of my concerns. I felt the explanations and cases used were much clearer with this set of revisions than in the past, and I can foresee how I could use the software. I also believe that providing windows binaries will also significantly help users. My only trouble spot was building the package from source and its dependency on libtiff. However I think that is an issue that can be resolved on the issues page of the repo. My one thought for what might improve the paper for the more novice users would be to include that issues could be posted on the github repo, not just cloning the source. Other than that I think the paper is substantially improved and is strong work.
