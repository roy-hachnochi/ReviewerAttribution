This is a useful Web Tool for the researcher, particular the ecologist in the community ecology, who wants to use the multifractal method describing the SAD and point pattern of species distribution. The paper is well written. However, the script (followed with the instruction in the “R integration” section) don't work well in Windows with R 3.0.2 (64bit). The author needs to revise the R scripts or provide detailed instruction on it, before the work is acceptable. Reports on the performance of the software in GNU for the Windows environment are also needed. There are two minor comments: The q is usually an integer in community ecology, because this will directly correspond to the Hill numbers. The range of q in this paper is from -5 to 5. Can the users of this tool set the range of q for their own preference?
