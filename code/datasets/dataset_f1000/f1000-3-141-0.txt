 This paper is an update on the Enrichment Map introduced in 2010 by the same authors. They have extended the methodology and made it available in the newest version of Cytoscape. Gene set enrichment methods of various forms are one of the most widely used first steps to gain a global picture of which pathways or other functional units are involved in some molecular phenotype. However, it is generally very hard to make sense of the results - mostly because lists of enriched gene sets can be very long and might be due to a small set of genes that appear in many of them. This is where the Enrichment Map comes in: By making the overlap between gene sets explicit it allows users to visually explore enrichment themes (clusters of overlapping gene sets). Because it is simple and informative I believe this will become the standard way to present enrichment results.
