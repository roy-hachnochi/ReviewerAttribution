The authors describe the latest port and usage of GFD-Net as a Cytoscape 3 app. The calculation of GO-based functional dissimilarity (GFD) on networks provides a useful way to assess and annotate inferred networks. As part of the calculation, each pairwise interaction is weighted, providing a more granular assessment of a given network. The app takes care of mapping from gene identifiers to GO terms, the GFD calculation and the interactive display of results. The authors also share their future plans to expose an API so other apps can call on GFD-Net as a service. A welcome idea. I particularly appreciated the thorough Architecture section. Together with the open source code availability, this description will be helpful to future Cytoscape app developers interested in network model query performance, accessing GO resources and overall app design. A minor suggestion to include in your next revision of the paper: The programming language, Java, should be capitalized (first sentence in Implementation).
