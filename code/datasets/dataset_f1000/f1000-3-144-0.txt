KEGG is one of the foremost sources of metabolic pathway data. Cytoscape is the de facto standard pathway visualization platform. Cytoscape-based visualization of KEGG pathways has always been cumbersome and limited. KEGGscape gets over many of these limitations by streamlining the process, and improving the translation of the graphical elements of KEGG pathways. This makes KEGGscape a very useful resource for the scientific community. The manuscript is clear and informative. There are only two changes I would ask for: First, the authors should mention that KGML files are currently freely available on the KEGG website. This will be news to some readers of this paper, since KEGG has gone through various distribution and licensing models. Second, the authors should expand their discussion of merging gene expression data with KGML diagrams. The power of network visualization is in pathway data integration. If there are special challenges in integrating with KEGG pathways, these should be brought forth. The mention of custom python scripts and fuzzy ID matching suggests that this integration task can involve special challenges.
