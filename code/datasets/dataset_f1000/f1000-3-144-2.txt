 KEGGscape is valuable Cytoscape app that enables flexible visualization and manipulation of KEGG pathway maps. The capability for visualizing data sets (e.g., gene expression levels) on pathways in Cytoscape is particularly appealing. However, the example presented in the paper does not contain sufficient information to enable a reader to duplicate the process. First, the authors do not cite the origin of the gene expression dataset they use in their example. Second, as far as I can tell, there is no tutorial provided with KEGGscape. At a minimum, the authors should provide instructions for opening a KGML file and loading a dataset.
