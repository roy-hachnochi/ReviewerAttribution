 The article CyKEGGParser: tailoring KEGG pathways to fit into systems biology analysis workflows by Lilit Nersisyan, Rouben Samsonyan and Arsen Arakelyan presents a comprehensive software tool allowing to edit KEGG pathways based on additional information taken, e.g., from tissue expression data and/or protein interaction networks. The functionalities are well described and illustrated using selected pathways in the context of B-cell signalling. In my opinion, the impact of the contribution is high especially for researchers who are interested in different kinds of biological networks and particularly who aim at interpreting experimental results in terms pathway activities.
