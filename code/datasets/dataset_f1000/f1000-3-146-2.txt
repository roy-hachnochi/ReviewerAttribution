 This article describes version 4.1.0 of the Reactome Functional Interaction "plugin"/"app" for the Cytoscape network exploration/analysis Java platform. The Reactome Functional Interaction network is an established, well-received and widely used resource. The software described here provides useful resources both for exploring Reactome networks and for using them in network enrichment analyses. My only reservation about this article is that its brevity makes it sketchy. For example, how are pathway enrichment statistics calculated? Does the implementation of HotNet offered here differ in any way from the original? I am especially intrigued that the example use-case given is reported to work well with the 2009 version of the ReactomeFI network, but apparently the discovered modules cannot be found with the newer versions of the FI because the underlying interactions have been "s pread into several modules in the newer version of the FI network ". Why does this happen and how can users guard against it? I was also not able to explore/reproduce the example presented in the paper, because (contrary to its ".txt"extension) the MAF file provided did not appear to be plain text and the needed survival data file was not included in the zip file provided. A file with instructions may be useful here. P.S. The multiple names given to this resource - "ReactomeFIViz (also called the Reactome FI Cytoscape app or ReactomeFIPlugIn)" - are a little confusing and seem unnecessary.
