 General comments: The authors describe a Cytoscape App, which provides a generic interface for displaying additional data onto the nodes of a graph. I believe that this App will be highly useful to researchers working with transcriptomics and proteomics data, as these often have a need to display, for example, expression time-courses onto protein interaction networks. This is especially true if the App is used as the foundation for other more specialized Apps that make it easier for users to import and visualize specific data types in an appropriate manner. Specific comments: The Integration section is difficult to fully follow for people who are not Cytoscape developers, who cannot be assumed to know what, for example, a CyCustomGraphicsFactory is. It would in my opinion be good to revise this section to make it understandable to a broader audience. In Figure 1, I find it strange that the pie charts are not circular and that the circos charts, unlike all the other chart types, are not embedded within a frame with rounded corners. Also, the figure would benefit from a figure caption explaining the difference between Pie Chart 1 and Pie Chart 2, as well as between Circos 1 and Circos 2. The differences between these chart subtypes are not clear to me.
