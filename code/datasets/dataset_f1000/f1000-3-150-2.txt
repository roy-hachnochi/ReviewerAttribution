 This article provides useful technical advice for Cytoscape app developers looking to port plugins from version 2 to apps in version 3. The technical advice is provided in the context of a specific application PanGIA, which helps determine the functional significance of genetic interaction data. The case study of PanGIA describes: How to deal with the data model and GUI event handling changes for developing software within the Cytoscape version 3 framework. What upgrades have been introduced in the port from v2 to v3, and some expected results when running the software. Overall the authors do a nice job of giving development advice and technical details for creating a Cytoscape 3 app if one is familiar with creating plugins for Cytoscape 2. In addition, the authors describe the new functionality that was added to the PanGIA app (random seed for obtaining reproducible results from the heuristic algorithm) and offer a small tutorial for anyone wanting to use the app for their research. This article is clearly written and provides a helpful resource for Cytoscape developers as well as end-users.
