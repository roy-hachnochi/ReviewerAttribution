In the paper "Cytoscape: the network visualization tool for GenomeSpace workflows", Demchak et al. describe the design, implementation and operation of an interaction layer between Cytoscape and GenomeSpace. Unfortunately, I was not able to run the example described in the manuscript, due to a "unable to find the document" error. Overall, the manuscript gives a fair description both of the technology used for integrating Cytoscape into GenomeSpace and its use. This however does mean that the actual focus is not completely clear. If the message is "there is a new tool accessible from GenomeSpace" which would be aimed at the end-user, then terms like "JRAC" and "cyActivator" cannot be expected to be understood without further explanation. Care should be given to explain these sufficiently enough for lay-people. On the other hand, the message could also be "here is how to integrate a web-tool with a desktop application", in which case the technical part might be described a bit more in depth. I expect this paper and the bridge between Cytoscape and GenomeSpace will be of considerable interest to the community. Minor textual remarks: In the abstract, there is an extra "it" in "It has been downloaded it over 850 times". Hyphenation has gone awry in many cases. Although this is not important for the contents of the manuscript, it does start to bother the reader after a while. These include (but are not limited to): "GenomeS-pace", "submen-us", "grav-ity", "Genom-eSpace", "Genom-eSpaceContext", "attrib-utes", and "Bi-oGrid".
