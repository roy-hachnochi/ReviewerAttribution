 Language/spelling: The language is acceptable but would benefit from a more careful reading/editing. Some examples where improvements are possible are: should be corrected to . In the sentence that begins Web browsers are defined to process a JNLP file URL by starting a specialized launcher, the portion that reads are defined to is extraneous. In the sentence that reads Paradoxically, Javabased tools (such as Cytoscape) run directly on the users workstation instead of within a browser, it is not clear what is paradoxical about the described execution protocol. The word should/could be dropped or maybe be replaced by a more appropriate adverb. Comments on specific sections: Launch : there is a sentence that reads GenomeSpace constructs the JNLP URL to contain a GenomeSpace file descriptor as a parameter, and the PHP script extracts it and defines it as a parameter to the LaunchHelper (see Supplementary Data). It would add to clarity to explain what the file referenced is. GenomeSpace app: This section appears written with the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the Cytoscape app framework, essentially no background is provided. GenomeSpace communication strategy : Same comment as above: the article refers to Cytoscape-specific programming constructs without introducing them or providing relevant references for disambiguation. E.g., in the sentence As with other apps, the apps cyActivator initializes the app state, including gaining references to the standard Cy objects: application, network, view, and table managers, terms like and Cy objects are used without prior definition/explanation. The same issue exists with GenomeSpace-specific objects, e.g., the sentence It also initializes basic CDK-related state (e.g., the GenomeSpaceContext root context). Demonstration : It would be helpful to describe what the columns of the input data file EnrichmentData.dat represent. Demonstration : The demonstration would benefit from a more detailed analysis workflow. E.g., a gene expression data set and a class file can be processed by GenePattern (or some other GenomeSpace tool) to generate a list of differentially expressed genes for some reasonable pair of case/control phenotypes and then feed the resulting file into Cytoscape. This could also help demonstrate the value proposition of GenomeSpace, i.e., providing the ability to seamlessly use multiple tools within an integrated environment. The authors may also want to briefly discuss why people are often interested in visualizing enriched/differentially-expressed genes in the context of a network, this would help the less-initiated better appreciate the value of having Cytoscape available as a GenomeSpace tool. Overall Impression: This is an informative article, describing how a specific tool (Cytoscape) has been integrated into an innovative framework (GenomeSpace) that enables seamless access to multiple bioinformatics tools. The main concern is overall readability in the absence of sufficient background on the Cytoscape app framework, to put the implementation of the GenomeSpace app in proper context. The other issues are minor and can be easily addressed.
