This is an interesting article that has good relevance to ongoing debates on the adaptiveness of memory errors. The methods and analyses are appropriate and the authors have generally represented the scientific literature well. I have a few minor suggestion for improvement, as follows: In the paragraph beginning While such tests might be viewed as rather remote from real-life situations.. it should be noted that there are several more studies in which errors in different false memory paradigms are correlated either weakly (e.g., Zhu et al. , 2013 ) or not at all (e.g. Ost et al ., 2013 ). The line Clearly false memories cannot in themselves be useful is disputable several studies now show positive consequences of distorted memories, see e.g. Howe, Garner Patel, 2013 ; Bernstein Loftus, 2009 ). Line It is therefore possible that memory errors are an inevitable fluke of a powerful, adaptive cognitive phenomenon I would prefer to say some memory errors there is a broad literature on other adaptive reasons why memory errors occur, see e.g. Newman Lindsay (2009) . Same point applies to the very final sentence of the Discussion. Why wasnt the order of the two tasks counterbalanced? Is it plausible that the first (memory) task might have primed a particular mindset in participants that affected their categorization performance? Id suggest the addition of a little discussion of this point. Data analysis which data departed from normality? The authors have reported a normality test but it isnt clear to which variable this test pertains. The line A significant negative correlation was still found for free recall and a moderate negative correlation still found for recognition the authors should reiterate explicitly that the latter correlation was non-significant.
