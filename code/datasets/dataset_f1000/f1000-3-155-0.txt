Lundqvist has overviewed the effects of Vitamin D on steroidogenesis. Overall, the manuscript is disorganized. In addition, there are many serious issues: The references are improper. There are too few for a review article. Additionally, the author references some articles which are already retracted. There are some unclear sentences. For example: Page 2, last line: " For example, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increases the gene expression of CYP24A1 while it increases the gene expression of CYP27B1. " Why are both genes are upregulated by vitamin D? Page 3, Adrenal steroidogenesis: [...] and zona reticularis is the point of synthesis for adrenal androgens (e.g. DHEA) " What is the point? The description of steroidogenesis is not sufficient. Abstract: Steroid hormones are synthesized in steroidogenic tissues such as [...] Why are breast and prostate tissues steroidogenic? They hardly perform de novo synthesis of steroid hormones, at least under normal conditions. Page 3, Adrenal steroidogenesis: The adrenal steroidogenesis is quantitatively regulated by the transcription of CYP11A1 (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) and the activity of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). " The transcriptional regulation of StAR gene is also a rate-limiting step for steroidogenesis. P3, Adrenal steroidogenesis: The qualitative regulation of adrenal steroidogenesis, determining which type of steroid that will be produced, is performed by the transcription and activity of CYP17A1. This sentence is an overstatement. The expression of 3-HSD is also important for zone-specific adrenal steroidogenesis.
