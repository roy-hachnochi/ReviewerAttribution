This review is comprised of three parts: first a review of the mechanisms of action of vitamin D, second a review of steroid hormone metabolism, and third a review of primarily the authors research into the role of 1,25(OH)2D in regulating steroid hormone metabolism. The first sections provide a brief but effective introduction to the authors main focus on his own work regarding the regulation by vitamin D of steroidogenesis. The major criticism I have is that this last section reveals how preliminary the evidence is that vitamin D has a physiologically significant role in steroidogenesis. The work has been done primarily in cancer cells in vitro . No compelling in vivo data are provided to show its physiologic importance, although animal models with deletions in VDR and CYP27B1 have been available for years. Nevertheless, this review opens up an interesting area for future research, and as such serves as a useful stimulus for that research to occur.
