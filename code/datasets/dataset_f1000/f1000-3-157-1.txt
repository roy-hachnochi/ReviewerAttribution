The manuscript has certainly improved. However, the added conclusion is too weak and should be enforced by including the conclusive considerations regarding the use of AD syringes, and a recommendation to the international world to synchronize guidelines and teaching materials on the practice of injection with or without aspiration. The recommendation that 'further studies looking at the need for aspiration during injection should be conducted' is a crude generality and might follow a short listing of practical/feasible recommendations. Afterall the manuscript is written as a review, not a reporting of original research on the question 'to aspirate or not' when injecting a substance. Minor comments: Start the current conclusion with the word 'There' instead of 'The'. The typo in the abstract mentioned has not yet been corrected - '... medical/-nursing ..' = '... medical/nursing ..' (delete the dash!)
