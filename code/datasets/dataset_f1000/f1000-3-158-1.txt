 This research was conducted well, and the article was well written. There is one grammatical error in the Outcomes section (paragraph 2) : " In both insecticide treated groups the majority of lice at post-treatment assessments were juveniles, of which 712 first were [1st, 2nd...] stage nymphs that could only have originated from eggs not killed by insecticide. " Also, nymphs can transfer so this conclusion is not accurate. "However, success rates were significantly (p 0.01) higher in people who had previously used a head louse treatment successfully, by an estimated factor of 1.88 (95% CI 1.13 to 3.11)." So how many of the failures may have been due to inappropriately applying a treatment? The title and abstract are appropriate for the article, and provide a suitable summary. The experiment appears to have been conducted properly, with appropriate controls and data measurements, and the analysis is also adequate. The conclusions drawn from the study are both sensible and balanced, and the competing interests of the authors have been sufficiently disclosed. Im just left wondering if any of the participant variables had an influence on the outcomes? If there was no effect, this should be stated.
