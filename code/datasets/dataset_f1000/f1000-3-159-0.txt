The case report submitted by Benusiglio et al. is well documented and provides convincing evidence that we should consider widening the tumor spectrum generally ascribed to the rare Birt-Hogg-Dub syndrome. Indeed, the authors report the case of a 72 y-old patient with a suggestive familial and personal history who developed a primary clear-cell carcinoma of the thyroid. Gene-testing for FLCN revelead a germ-line deleterious mutation and LOH for FLCN was demonstrated in the thyroid tumoral tissue. This finding is of interest since most (all ?) cancers described so far in this syndrome arise from the kidneys. Altogether, the title, the abstract, and the article content, based on adequate methodology, are appropriate. However, we are told that the reported patient developed at the age of 64 an early-stage rectal cancer. It would have been interesting to know more about the morphological aspects of this primary digestive tumor and if the authors could also perform on this primary the search for FLCN LOH. This information may be relevant since the median age of tumor diagnosis in this syndrome is generally considered to occur below 50 y, a point that the authors fail to discuss.
