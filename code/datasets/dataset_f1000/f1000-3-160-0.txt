This revised version of correspondence, in reference to Wang et al. (2014) , points out two major problems: one is the terminology of Wdnm1-like and another is insufficient control for RNAi experiments in mice. Upon the original version, two independent referees, Dr. Burchard and Drs. Smas and Ren, have given inspiring and constructive comments both for the above two major issues. I think the authors have responded them reasonably and amended the manuscript accordingly, with minimal rebuttal. I also agree the correspondent authors claim that it should have been well noted and discussed that the lncRNA named by Wang et al. is a protein-coding transcript, Wfdc21 or Wdnm1-like, in all mammals with available sequence other than hominids. As for the criticism on the inconsistent use of the control RNAi, I also consider the correspondent authors criticism appropriate and sound, as the previous referees do. The correspondents state that the model for human WDnm1-like-pseudogene proposed by Wang et al. leads a quite spectacular evolutionary model. However, the following paragraphs, in my impression, could have explained how the evolutionary model is spectacular more clearly and concrete. This may further improve this version to help better understanding by readers who are not specialists of molecular evolution.
