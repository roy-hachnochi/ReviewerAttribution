The authors have provided responses to my original comments and incorporated some changes into their manuscript which have improved it. Suggestions for minor modifications : Section entitled The authors state that estrogen regulates the proliferation and development of tissues expressing estrogen receptors and that is expressed in steroid--‐ responsive female tissues such as the ovary, endometrium and breast. The authors further state Thus, estrogen is mitogenic for cultured ER positive breast cancer cell lines. The authors need to amend this paragraph to make it clear that there are two estrogen receptor genes both of which are expressed in breast cancers 1 - 3 . Studies on knockout mice have highlighted that expression of the ER isoform has been identified as critically important to cell proliferation in the uterus and breast 4 , 5 . Studies in breast cancer cell lines have highlighted the importance of ER in both up and down-regulation of cell proliferation and this remains a very active area of research 6 , 7 . The authors are encouraged to amend the text of this section changing to ER to make better sense of comments made in the section entitled Research Breakthrough. References 1.
