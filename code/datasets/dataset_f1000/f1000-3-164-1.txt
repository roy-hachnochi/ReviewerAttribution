This is a comprehensive study on the shark fishery from Peru. I read the comments of the previous reviewers and I consider that authors take into account most of their recommendations; however, the manuscript requires some clarifications. Title and abstract are appropriate for the content of the article. Methods are partially appropriate. Analysis of the catch trends are appropriate due to the lack of effort records. However, a problem is the estimating CPUE; it is not clear how the authors extrapolated from the fishing effort of the small-scale fishery to the small-scale shark fishery. Also, I agree with one of the previous reviewers who “interpret that the study describe records of shark landings from any fishery in the Peruvian waters”. The comment of the authors to this interpretation was as follows: “the reports of the Peruvian small-scale shark fishery is composed of target sharks species but in some cases sharks are not the main target”.Therefore, I have two questions: where and when sharks are not the main target? This occurred in a higher or lower percent of the landings of the small-scale shark fishery? This information is important to estimate the CPUE; it was considered for the extrapolation? If the extrapolation is difficult, I recommend to eliminate the CPUE estimations; but indicate where and when sharks are not the main target of the fishing fleet (if possible). I consider that the small-scale fishery cannot be considered as a small-scale shark fishery, because not always are the sharks the target species; or can be considered as a “seasonal” shark fishery. It seems that small-scale fleet operates according to the seasonal abundance of several fishery resources, including sharks.
