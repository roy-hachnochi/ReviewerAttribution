This is a well-written case report about a newly diagnosed lupus patient who develops GBS meningitis after a spontaneous abortion. Most of the salient details are included and there is an informative review of the literature on GBS infections, autoimmune disease, and spontaneous abortions. This is a useful documentation of an unusual case that can be helpful when considering the differential diagnosis of meningitis in a patient with lupus, other autoimmune disorders, or spontaneous abortion. One presumes that the patient was in her first trimester, but confirmation of that in the description of the patient would be helpful to be complete.
