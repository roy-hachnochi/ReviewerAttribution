This is the first study to determine the transcription response of haloarchaea when grown under extreme pH conditions. It is surprising that the pH tolerances of the select organisms have not been determined before and it was good to see that the authors did determine the pH values each of the organisms could tolerate. This data enabled the authors to determine the up-regulation and down-regulation of individual genes under the most acidic and alkaline conditions the organisms could tolerate in comparison to optimal pH conditions. The results support the authors conclusions. The only thing that I would like to see included is a more complete discussion of how their results support their statement "We also chose three organisms, as opposed to one, to ascertain if the response to pH was specific to the organism, the Halobacteriaceae, the Prokaryotes, or the three Domains of Life." in the first paragraph of the Results and Discussion. The authors touch on this a few times in the article but do not really bring it to a full conclusion.
