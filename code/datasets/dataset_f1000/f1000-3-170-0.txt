I still have reservations about the methodology used within this proof of concept study - I do not feel that the current proposal will be very useful as a mobility monitoring system. Though the concept is along the right lines. The manuscript remains poorly written while still being vague and illogical in most parts, and introduces concepts/methods that are unsuitable. The technical quality or blatant limitations have not been addressed. Moreover a lack of insight into current algorithms for possible use if lacking - which I would expect from a proof of concept study, i.e. whats currently been done for possible inclusion within a modern mobility monitoring system? For instance in relation to stair climb - the authors could have presented the work by Sekine et al. (2000) for possible accelerometer solutions to detect stair walking? There are still clear and sizeable limitations for the authors to overcome, which still have not been addressed: manual video analysis, evaluators having access to automated classifications during manual analysis. A large degree of work and attention to detail still needs to be performed by the authors. I feel that a high standard of work could have been achieved by the authors as the potential is certainly evident.
