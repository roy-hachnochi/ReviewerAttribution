This paper describes the synthesis and characterization of two new forms of the well-known membrane fluorescent probe, Laurdan. The paper is interesting and generally well written. The work is of interest to researchers in the field. I have read the comments of the other reviewers of the paper and agree with their concerns, adding my endorsement of the need to respond to their points. In particular, I also think that Fig. 7 is not a good choice for arguing the superiority of M-Laurdan. As pointed out by Dr. Cherezov , one cannot judge the strength of the correlations without quantitative information. My guess, looking at the figure, though, is that the differences are small. It would, though, be better to compare GP to the rotational relaxation time as suggested by Dr. Duportail since GP and anisotropy are mutually convoluted with excited-state life time. More importantly, it is not clear to me why a strong correlation between the two parameters (GP and anisotropy) is necessarily ideal. Since the two represent different things (polarity of local environment vs. probe wobble (after correcting for lifetime)), isnt there value in exploring conditions under which they may report disparate results? Frankly, I am more excited about the richness of information that could come from comparisons among probes that interact differently with membrane lipids (as revealed by Fig. 5) than by choosing a single probe based on the concept that two different measurements with the probe are best if they are redundant. I would therefore recommend that the paper be steered more in the direction of pointing out the types of information each probe can provide rather than trying to identify one as the optimum.
