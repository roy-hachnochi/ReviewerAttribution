This manuscript written by Fortin et al. presents an R package to assess the quality control of 450k methylation array data through an interactive interface. A unique aspect of shinyMethyl is the use of the shiny package to allow the interactive visualisation. shinyMethyl is easy to use and therefore suitable for a novice data analyst with limited programming experience and also experienced bioinformaticians that would like to quickly assess large datasets. Additionally the package utilises the established and widely used R package minfi for the data analysis. shinyMethyl is available for download from Bioconductor or github. In this manuscript, the authors clearly describe the use of the package through a workflow and various screenshots and plots. They discuss the example dataset that is available through TCGA. Data interpretation is only explained briefly as the purpose of this manuscript is to present the interface. In depth background information on analysis methods (terminology, normalisations etc) and details of data interpretation can be found in the minfi publication or the Bioconductor vignette. The package does require the raw IDAT files. Some publicly available datasets may not provide this information and therefore shinyMethyl would not be applicable. However, it is becoming mainstream to provide this data and with more packages utilising this raw data it is expected that investigators make it available. The authors have clearly presented their package that is well designed, easy to use and a useful addition to the options for 450k data analysis especially as it is the platform of choice for large epigenome-wide association studies.
