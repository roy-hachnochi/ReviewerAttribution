The title of the report is entirely appropriate. The abstract would benefit from mention of the interactive demo on spark.rstudio.com, as the interface is trivially easy to grasp while performing the various quality control checks. The methods not directly treated in this report (functional normalization, Shiny internals, 450k chip design) have been discussed elsewhere at length.The discussion of design and implementation decisions for shinyMethyl is sufficient (again an interactive/exploratory session will provide the interested user with most if not all of the same information). The conclusion (shinyMethyl eases 450k quality control for large datasets with potential technical artifacts) is justified in the report, the included example for the package, and the interactive demo hosted by Rstudio. The data for the example are available as raw binary IDAT files from the TCGA data portal; reproducibility via minfi is trivial, provided the user has sufficient compute resources to process and normalize a large dataset. (In my experience, datasets of 1000+ samples can be read with illuminaio and normalized via funnorm() on a typical Linux server with 48-64GB of RAM) This report serves a useful purpose (beyond the announcement of the software) by providing a usable baseline for 450k quality control. Epigenome-wide association studies are prone to a staggering number of potential confounding factors, not least of which are technical and experimental design artifacts. Investigators who have an interest in reproducible conduct of such studies now have further incentive to use and deposit raw binary IDAT files for their experiments. Investigators who choose not to do so may be viewed with skepticism, especially when the data has been processed for analysis via minfi (or, for that matter, methylumi), and verification of straightforward quality controls is made simpler by the interactive shinyMethyl package.
