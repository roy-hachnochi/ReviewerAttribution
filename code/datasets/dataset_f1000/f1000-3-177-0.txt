The manuscript describes a method to improve the interpretation of dendrograms from clustering algorithms. It is well written and the authors go into sufficient detail to describe the issues with the available ways to display dendrograms. They have applied their method to a number of case studies, and here they show that their method improves the distinction between clusters in the data. The method is made available in the form of an R package (dendsort). Creating re-ordered dendrograms is quite easy with this package, but I found it more cumbersome to apply the method to heatmaps. The standard heatmap() function has a parameter, but it expects other parameters than the dendsort() function. The documentation of the package should be improved to make this easier.
