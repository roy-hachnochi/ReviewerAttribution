This is an excellent piece of work which is immediately available to the bioinformatics community via the implementation in R and deployment to the CRAN repository. Within the visualization community, we know that heat map representations work much better when clustered appropriately since correlations with colour are more difficult to detect when colour grouping is not present, see Haroz and Whitney (2012) . This technique presented by the authors goes some way to making heat map representations more effective. Their evaluation is complete and shows clear advantages over existing methods.
