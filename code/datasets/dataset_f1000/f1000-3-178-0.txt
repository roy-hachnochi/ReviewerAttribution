Studies, mostly from A. Prochiantzs laboratory, have demonstrated that the transcription factor (TF) Otx2, produced by external sources such as the choroid plexus, is internalized into parvalbumin neurons of layers II/III and IV of the visual cortex, thereby controlling its plasticity. So far these studies had not ruled out the possibility that part of this effect could be mediated by Otx1, a closely related TF, which may act redundantly with Otx2. In this study, the authors combined the use of Otx1 -/- mice with immunoprecipitation from layers I-IV extracts and high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis to demonstrate the sole presence of Otx2 peptides in these layers. The study thus demonstrates that Otx2 is the only non-cell autonomous Otx family member functional in fast-spiking parvalbumin cells of layers I-IV of the visual cortex. This is a clear and well-executed study that solves an existing concern.
