The authors address an issue that is unresolved in the literature. Is the Otx found in the cortex, and responsible in part of cortical plasticity, cortical derived Otx1 or choroid plexus derived Otx2? The problem exists because the antibodies used previously can not distinguish between the two. In the present study using Otx1 KO mice and a variety of measures, the authors prove Otx2 is the protein in the cortical cells and that this therefore is a cell non- autonomous phenomenon. The one question I have relates to figure 1B, which suggests there is greater Otx2 staining in the Otx1 KO mouse cortex. If this is a reliable observation the authors should comment. The low peptide coverage in the MASS SPEC could be a concern but the authors address that and in addition the other supporting data decrease the concern. This is a clear, straightforward manuscript that adds important and definitive information to the existing literature
