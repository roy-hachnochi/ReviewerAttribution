This paper proposes a somewhat provocative but also inspiring hypothesis which claims that neurotransmitters evolved from a similar principle as the sexual signals in birds: it tests the activity and the status of the signaling cells by secreting a toxic substance. They provide an overview of the toxicity of neurotransmitters when concentrations are slightly unbalanced. They also propose that the blood-brain barrier evolved as part of the distinct signaling of neurons in the CNS, without disturbance by signals produced in the periphery. The authors provide interesting thoughts as to why and how the transmitter system could have evolved from the release of a toxic waste. This is all fine, but what I miss is the evolutionary perspective promised in the title, which not only is based on a "Gedankenexperiment" but on available evidence. All animals except sponges and placozoans have neurons. Current evidence suggest that neurons from cnidarians and bilaterians have a common origin, which is also reflected by the use of the same transmitters (although the Hydra genome shows that several crucial genes of Ach production are missing). The recent analysis of the ctenophore genome led, however, to the conclusion that neurons evolved independently in ctenophores and bilaterians. Sponges, on the other hand, have many synaptic genes present in the genome, yet lack neurons. In summary, interesting hypothesis, but I miss a discussion of all these available genomic data in the context of the hypothesis.
