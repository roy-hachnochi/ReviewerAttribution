The authors described an 18-mo old girl with a solitary mastocytoma, which was successfully treated with tacrolimus. This might suggest that the mastocytoma requires therapy. This is not the case. Mastocytomas are self-limited and usually dont need therapy. The most important management is the avoidance of known trigger factors. It is not clear whether the reduction is due to the self-limiting nature of the tumor or to the therapy. Pathogenetically and from the mechanism of action of tacrolimus, which prevents mast cell degranulation, an improvement of mastocytoma can be expected. However it should be made clear that the indication for treatment of a solitary mastozytoma should be made very cautiously.
