I thank the authors for this interesting article. I believe it is worthy of indexation because there is surprisingly little in the literature about this alternative treatment. I might make a few small suggestions for consideration: Is solitary mastocytoma really "rare"? I see an awful lot of them for such a designation even taking into consideration referral bias. Uncommon might be a better descriptor. Could the line " Diagnosis is by biopsy... " be modified? I do not think these absolutely must be biopsied and in fact almost never do. If there is a + Dariers sign and a strong clinical suspicion this presentation is specific enough that I do not think biopsy is mandatory. As a pediatric dermatologist I do all I can to avoid biopsying when not absolutely necessary and I worry readers might take this line to imply diagnosis mandatory for diagnosis of mastocytoma. It is not. Can we still call tacrolimus and pimecrolimus "new" given they have been available almost 15 years now? I think in fairness the authors must mention the boxed warning about this class of medications somewhere. If the authors cite the concerns for topical and systemic side effects of topical steroids as they do I think they must balance this by mentioning the biggest barrier to using these agents - the black box. I might have included two references the authors omitted: Correia O, Duarte AF, Quirino P et al. : Cutaneous mastocytosis: Two pediatric cases treated with topical pimecrolimus. Dermatology Online Journal. 2010; 16 (5): 8 This describes two cases similar to the authors treated successfully with pimecrolimus Avshalumov K, Pichardo R, Jorizzo JL et al. : Bullous mastocytosis: report of a patient and a brief review of the literature. Am J Dermatopath. 2008; 30 (5):455-7 Cutaneous mastocytosis - albeit not mastocytoma - treated with a number of things including topical tacrolimus.
