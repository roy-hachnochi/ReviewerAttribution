 In the abstract and introduction sections the authors stated that solitary mastocytoma accounts for 10-15% of cutaneous mastocytosis whereas in the introduction section it was 10-20%. The lesion was present since birth, but parents sought medical advice after 18 months. Was there any particular reason for this delay? In particular, was any other previous treatment(s) prescribed for the child? The magnification of Fig, 2 was mentioned as 40X but it seems that Fig. 2A and 2B have different magnifications. Authors should also insert the magnification of Fig.3. As per any case report describing a treatment for a disorder known to be self-limited, it is uncertain whether the resolution is due to the applied drug or due to natural spontaneous subsidence.
