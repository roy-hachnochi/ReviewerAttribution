This is an interesting study dealing with the number of treatments reimbursed by Medicare for AK in Australia over time, and paralleling those treatments with number of treatments for SCC. As discussed by the Authors, the data presented have several limitations mainly connected with the nature of the claims data available (there is a lack of information on treatments of less than 10 AKs, and a lack of information on treatment modalities other than cryotherapy). In addition, a few points are worth of consideration: The Title does not accurately reflect the contents of the paper. I would change it to: "Costs for the treatment of AKs on the rise in Australia" The study is restricted to treatment of 10 or more AKs by cryotherapy. Is there any estimate of the number of treatments for modalities other than cryotherapy (including field therapy)? Is there any indication that some lesions were not treated at all? Were repeated treatments of the same lesions counted separately or did they simply sum up to the total? Introduction, 5th paragraph: what does "PBS" stand for? Methods, 3rd paragraph: as far as I understand the meaning, the reference should be to Figure 3 and not to Figure 1. Discussion, penultimate paragraph: "treatment of early treatment and prevention of AK is prudent" should read "treatment of early lesions and prevention of AK is prudent"
