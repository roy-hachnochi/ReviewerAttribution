The authors present a manuscript describing a procedure that allows for the quantification of the total amount of residual confounding prior to bias amplification caused by propensity score models. I believe the procedure described in reasonable, and my biggest concerns with this manuscript are the presentation of the approach, which I had a hard time following initially. I think this paper is deserving of indexing as it is, but could be substantially improved with clearer presentation. Specific Comments: The authors talk about creating two models (Model 1 and Model 2) that are nest within each other in such a way that Model 2 contains all the variables in Model 1 plus one/several extra variable/s. It seems like there are money choices for this extra variable/s from among the possible variables. Do the authors have any specific advice on how this or these should be chosen? They do mention that this variable should be chosen to have ``discernible confounding amplification", but isnt it possible that there are many acceptable choices that will satisfy this criteria? In that case is there any advice on how to choose between the good candidate variables? In Step 2 of the description of the method,the authors mention that the when $R^2$ is between 0.04 and 0.56 there is a linear relationship between unexplained variance and confounding amplification. I believe that this threshold is then used in Supplementary table 1 when they state that the step should be taken only if R^2 is less than 0.56. Should this step not be taken if R^2 is less than 0.04? Do the authors have any advice on what to do when R^2 is greater than 0.56? Minor Comments: Should the outcome in Table 1B be hip fracture rather than all cause mortality? Supplementary Table1, 3a I think this is a typo: ``IntV:"
