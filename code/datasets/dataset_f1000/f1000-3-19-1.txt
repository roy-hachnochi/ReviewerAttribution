In this article, Madan and Spetch describe a tool for monitoring animal movement in an open field that will be extremely useful to many researchers. Not only does the software monitor the animals path through the environment, it also offers time-based information, and can provide information about velocity and acceleration of the movement over time. MATLAB software is in wide use in behavioral research, and Madan and Spetch have made the STL algorithm freely available in MATLAB. This is the sort of new tool that can lead researchers to ask new questions and to look in new directions to answer current questions. This algorithm will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to our understanding of animal behavior.
