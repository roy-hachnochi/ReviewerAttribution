This manuscript reports increased longevity for two common species of small coastal sharks (Atlantic Sharpnose Shark Rhizoprionodon terraenovae and Blacknose Shark Carcharhinus acronotus ) based on tag recapture data. These findings are particularly interesting given the previously assumed longevity of these species, and are clearly relevant to population models that include longevity as a parameter for these species. This note is clearly written, and conclusions from this work are appropriately presented; moreover, these data illustrate the benefit of long-term fisheries-independent monitoring and tagging programs for long-lived species such as sharks. These data are clear, concise, and important to the continued successful management of these two species; as such, they are worthy of publication. The two tables presented are sufficient to convey the data discussed. Given the straightforward nature of these data and their appropriate interpretation by the Authors, I have no major comments. There are two typos in the first paragraph of the Discussion (detailed below) which should be addressed. In the sentence A review of published shark age and growth studies shows that, in most studies, that females have a greater remove that. In the sentence Therefore, we believe that we did not sample older females and suggest that the longevity estimates maximum observed longevity we observed for each species revise longevity estimates maximum observed longevity as desired.
