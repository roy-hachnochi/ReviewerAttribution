The manuscript by Stein et al. expands previous work from the same group characterizing the learning abilities of CamKII knock-in mice ( Halt et al. , 2012 ). The mice carry two point mutations that impair the binding of CamKII to the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B, and were shown to exhibit deficits in memory recall in the Morris Water maze (MWM). Here, the authors present an extended and carefully performed behavioral analysis. Their new results show that spatial learning in the MWM is impaired when 12 training trials are compressed in a single day. In contrast, the previous study showed that spatial learning was normal when training was conducted over 6 consecutive days (2 trials per day). The different outcome is attributed to the increased cognitive demands and higher stress levels posed by massed training. The paper is well-written and clearly presented, and the Methods are described with enough detail. Comments: The deficits in massed spatial learning are only detectable in the last two trials. Do the authors have an explanation? Could the delay be related to a defect in an early phase of consolidation, in line with the hypothesis previously proposed by the authors (Halt et al., 2012)? It might be nice to see whether memory consolidation is impaired in other hippocampal-dependent tests not involving stress. For instance, the novel object recognition test that can be performed in a brief period of time and would additionally permits the assessment of memory recall at shorter time intervals after initial learning.
