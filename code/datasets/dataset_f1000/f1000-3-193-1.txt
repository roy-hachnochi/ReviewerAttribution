 Summary: This study substantially extends the previous behavioral analysis of a mouse line with mutant GluN2B that is incapable of CaMKII binding. Individually, both GluN2B and CaMKII are critically involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Previous studies from the same lab showed that the mutant GluN2B KI mice have impaired hippocampal CA1 LTP (reduced to ~50%) and impaired recall during the consolidation phase of a Morris water maze (MWM) task 1 . Here, learning impairments were found in a modified MWM task that involves massed learning during day 1. All other learning paradigms tested here or previously were normal. Basal behavior was also extensively evaluated, and was found to be normal in all tasks tested here or previously. Evaluation: The manuscript is very well written. The experiments and the analyses are solid. The interpretation and discussion of the results are both careful and insightful. Overall, it can be very reasonably concluded that learning requires the CaMKII/GluN2B interaction only when the learning task is rather difficult and/or involves some stress (such as in a water maze), consistent also with impaired but not abolished LTP in these mice. Comments: The conclusions from this study may also inform potential future behavioral studies on these mice. For instance, while the GluN2B KI mice were normal in multiple variations of contextual fear conditioning, the contextual part of the task was made rather easy in all paradigms tested. However, even with shorter exposure to the context, fear conditioning may still be too easy of a learning task to reveal any differences in the GluN2B mice. Thus, while such future studies may be interesting, either outcome would still be consistent with the conclusions reached here. The behavioral analyses of the GluN2B KI mice were done specifically in order to evaluate the impact of the LTP impairments in these mice. When comparing the GluN2B KI mice with CaMKII T286A or CaMKII knock-out mice in other behavioral tasks in future studies, it may have to be taken into account that the GluN2B KI mice are impaired only in LTP, while the CaMKII mutant mice are additionally impaired in LTD. One point in which my opinion differs is within the introduction, specifically regarding the statement that auto-phosphorylation on T286 is required for effective binding of CaMKII to GluN2B . The cited references could indeed be interpreted support this statement 2 3 . However, newer data indicate that the increased binding observed after ATP addition was largely caused by direct nucleotide binding to the kinase, rather than by auto-phosphorylation 4 5 6 . Notably, this point does not affect the validity of any conclusions reached in the manuscript. However, it may significantly mislead the reader about the larger context of CaMKII in synaptic plasticity. Recently, we have shown that CaMKII T286 phosphorylation is required not only for LTP, but also for LTD 7 . Prior to this, other recent evidence had already suggested a more prolonged T286 phosphorylation after LTD than after LTP 8 9 10 (for review see Coultrap Bayer, 2012 11 ). If T286 phosphorylation would induce the most effective CaMKII binding to GluN2B (as stated), binding would be expected to be more extensive after LTD compared to LTP. However, this does not appear to be the case 9 , and the CaMKII/GluN2B interaction contributes exclusively to the CaMKII functions in LTP but not in LTD 1 . References 1.
