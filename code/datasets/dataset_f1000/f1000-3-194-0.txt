This case report describes the rare concurrence of two haematological genetic disorders associated to chromosome X (PNH and G6PD deficiency) and provides a retrospective interpretation of the clinical development throughout the detailed and focused experimental analysis of the patients cells and the genetics associated to them. Following an appealing and reasonable hypothesis, the results obtained by Perdigones et al. offer an authoritative haematology lesson. Thus, the authors take the case report as a centre to discuss the biology of PNH clones and the potential mechanism of red cell lysis when two independent haemolysis-prone genes are associated in the same patient. The originality and presentation of the case warrant the readers interest. The final version with the amendments made following the report from two previous reviewers resulted in a solid article worth reading for haematologists and geneticists.
