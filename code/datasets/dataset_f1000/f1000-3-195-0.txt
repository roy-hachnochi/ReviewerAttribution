This is an interesting case report of a patient with SCLC and hyponatremia, supposed to have developed due to SIANP. I have the following comments: Different patterns of SIAD (Type A to E) have been described, i.e with high ADH levels, but also with low or even undetectable ADH levels and different patterns upon osmotic stimulation 1 , 2 . Patients with solid cancers were seen in almost all types of SIAD. Low AVP does therefore not exclude the presence of SIAD, please discuss. Also, it is known that AVP measurement is difficult and often unreliable, with false low levels, please discuss. Furthermore, could it not be possible that the tumor produced AVP similar peptides or precursors of AVP, which are not measured by the classical AVP assay? Many patients with SIAD do not respond to treatment with fluid restriction (treatment response depends, among others, from urinary osmolality and treatment is successful in only about half of the patients). The last sentence of the first paragraph of the introduction is therefore not correct and also, lack of response to fluid restriction does not prove the diagnosis of SIAD. It has recently been shown that ANP levels are significantly increased in patients with SIAD reflecting the mild volume overload 3 . Most importantly, ANP levels are elevated in all different etiologies of hyponatremia. The high ANP levels in the case report could therefore be the consequence of hyponatremia, or, as hypothesized by the authors, causative for hyponatremia. However, this case report can not prove whether it is cause or consequence . This has to be critically discussed. Also: Since the patient was hospitalized with lung embolism: couldn‘t this be the reason for the increased ANP levels (due to cardiac stress?) The authors indicate that the patient was not hypovolemic, please also provide serum osmolality values to underline this statement. References 1.

This is possibly true. However, without clear ... Continue reading READ ALL
