This is an interesting article examining the time course of the electrophysiological properties of neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells. The authors studied firing of action potentials, potassium currents and spontaneous synaptic activities. They found that all of these properties gradually become more mature over time. This study shows the feasibility of conducting such experiments to map out developmental stages of neurons in a culture dish. The title and abstract convey the message of the manuscript. It is well-written and contains comprehensive information on the study design, methods and analysis. The data is well presented. It is not clear from the article that the three properties that the authors looked at are fully developed at 37 days. Can they comment on the variability between cultures? In the conclusion, the authors could possibly expand on what they think about the timing of maturation. Would the days of maturation be very different due to the differentiation method; therefore, such time-course should be performed for each new differentiation protocol?
