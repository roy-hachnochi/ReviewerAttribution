Operating room space and time is one of the major reasons for long waiting times in elective operative procedures. Improving operating room efficiency is therefore imperative. The authors of the current report attempted to identify lacunae in the operating room throughput and identify reasons for cancellations of elective surgeries. The authors noted that a significant proportion of time spent is non operative. This is particularly important for urology, where a typical operating list is comprised of many short endoscopic procedures. The authors recommend increasing nursing and anesthetic staff to cater to this particular need. Induction rooms are valuable as they limit the loss of non operative utilization of the OR room. It is not apparent from current rooms whether the induction room was fully utilized in the course of this work. Last minute cancellation of an operative procedure is not only an emotional and financial stress on the family/insurance but also on the hospital. Pre-operative anesthetic and nursing review is valuable in significantly reducing cancellations on the day of surgery.
