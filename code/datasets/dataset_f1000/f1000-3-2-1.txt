The authors describe a fairly rare case of testicular artery pseudoaneurysm, presumably secondary to orchitis. The case history is complete and the figures are well-presented. Furthermore, based on the patients history, age, and ultrasound findings, their management was not unreasonable. However, I would like them to describe in more detail the thought process that led to a radical orchiectomy, particularly since pseudoaneurysm was in their differential. Because the patient was of reproductive age, I wonder if it would have been possible to preserve some functioning testicular tissue. Based on the gross appearance of the specimen, it appears that at least a third of the testis was unaffected. How accurate is scrotal ultrasound in identifying a testicular artery pseudoaneurysm? Finally, looking back, is there something that the authors could have done to prevent a radical orchiectomy? This might be helpful for those of us facing this situation in the future. I think with some revisions of the Discussion, this case report should be acceptable.
