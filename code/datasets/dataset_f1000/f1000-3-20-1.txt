This study addresses an interesting and relevant topic. Box 1 in particular is innovative and makes a good link to the findings. I have the following comments: More remarks are needed about the relevant body of evidence. Are there other studies that investigated the self-understanding of basic scientists in biomedicine? The Background mentions none and the Discussion only one paper. The main text should make clear that the response rate and reasons for non-response are not known. A brief explanation together with a justification on why this approach was selected should be given. Figure 6 is somewhat simplistic and packed with several unjustified assumptions on what the (true) positive and negative effects of specific pattern of resource allocation to basic or translational research are. This should be deleted. The legend to figure 6 is very general, for example the recommendation saying that one should produce a good integration between basic and applied investigations .
