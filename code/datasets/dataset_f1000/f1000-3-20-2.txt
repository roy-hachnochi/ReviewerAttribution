This is an interesting well-conducted study that clarifies the way basic science is perceived by basic scientists. It would have been interesting to assess whether the career stage of the respondents has any impact on their answers to the survey. In the discussion a point is raised as to whether there is the need to revisit “ the idea that since the future benefits of basic research cannot be accurately predicted, all basic research is equally valuable ” based on the finding that the majority of scientists believe that “ some degree of assessment of the transformative value of basic investigations is always possible ”. However in the absence of a clear definition of what the degree of assessment is, it remains difficult to fully support such a perception. Thus caution should be exerted in drawing a conclusion as to whether this mindset could “nudge” more basic scientists (and grant funders) to wonder about the future impact of their investigations. The list of soft motivational incentives in BOX1 is thought provoking and stimulating.
