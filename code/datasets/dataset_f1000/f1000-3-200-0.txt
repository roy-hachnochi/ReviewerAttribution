This is a very well written report on a very important topic of very high impact in the actual of omics and multi-level omics data, allowing beyond sheer analysis (which in large data sets is very demanding indeed in terms of runtime and memory) many more questions answered also for methods research. The methods put forward present a very major step forward for this type of analysis. The methodology is very sound and promising. A tool to actually use is provided, which is also not always the case. The authors are to be commended for this work.
