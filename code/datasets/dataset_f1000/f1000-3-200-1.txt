This article introduces a new software tool (omicABEL) for performing rapid association analyses between SNP data and high-dimensional "omics" data (e.g. gene expression) using mixed models. This is an extremely important development for the following reasons: Identification of genetic variants associated with gene expression (eQTLs), methylation (mQTLs) etc is becoming ever more important in understanding the biology of complex genetic disorders. It is desirable, when performing association analyses, to allow for population stratification and/or cryptic relatedness among members of the sample. Mixed models are an effective way of doing this. The high dimensionality of the "omics" data (tens or even hundreds of thousands of measurements) has made the application of mixed model association approaches computationally prohibitive up to now. In addition to detailing an application of considerable practical utility, the article is also clearly written and mathematically rigorous.
