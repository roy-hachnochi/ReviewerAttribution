It is a well written article and deserves to be indexed. My comments and suggestions are: Abstract should explain the method better, including more details of controls on Earth. It should contain some data (numerical data with the most important statistical analysis) Introduction is good. Methods Samples and procedures: I suggest explaining the phases of the parabola and their duration. I also believe that it would be good to clarify how many parabolas were used for the tests. Figures are ok, although figure 2 does not add much to the study itself, unless some explanation is added to the figure and its caption. Results I believe that figures could show the microG changes better If figures are kept, please correct first line on Table 1 (data is misplaced) I think it should be 1G (not just in results but throughout the text), and then ground should be deleted (it is a pleonasm in this case) Discussion It is very good, clear, and consistent Conclusion It could be shortened a bit. It was very good to have considered and presented the limitations of the study.
