Overall good series with an adjustable intragastric balloon. In the Methods, need to describe the initial fluid volume Describe the parameters used to define as well as weight plateau for removing or adding fluid. Need to present weight loss at 6 month interval as well to compare with 6-month balloons data, also will tell us how much effect the balloon has on the 2nd 6-month period. May need to explain if there were similar features on pts requiring upward adjustments (i.e., height, stomach size, etc.) Discussion needs to include comparative analysis with other balloons data, or mention systematic review
