The authors have analyzed the efficacy of adjustable intragastric balloon in mid-term weight loss. There are few questions which need to be raised. How many patients have achieved success after 6 and 12 months of treatment (defined as EXWL 20%). It would be of readers interest to know EXWL in first 6 months and in the next six months. Then we could easily compare the results with BIB. How many patients experienced nausea, dyspeptic symptoms etc? In the discussion section, please compare the efficacy and side effects between Spatz1 and Spatz3. Additionally, compare Spatz3 with BIB (since BIB is the gold standard of treatment with intragastric balloons). Please mention how long did it take to perform additional adjustments, how many additional visits were necessary and what were the complications of all adjustments. All the above required changes should be presented in new tables or figures, since the current ones are too small and hard to follow.
