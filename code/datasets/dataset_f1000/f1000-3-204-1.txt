This is an important contribution to the difficult airway literature and will be helpful to clinicians wanting a means to predict that mask ventilation may be a problem following the induction of general anesthesia. While the limitations of the study are correctly stated (see p. 5) I would add some wording to this section to re-emphasize that this was a retrospective study and that the use of neuromuscular blocking drugs was not part of the analysis. In addition, since a great many cases of difficult mask ventilation vanish following the administration of neuromuscular blocking drugs, I recommend that the discussion on this particular issue should be discussed in a bit more detail, perhaps making reference to one or more of the following recent publications.
