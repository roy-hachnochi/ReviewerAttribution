The authors aimed at further define features for helices, which are key structural elements in polypeptides. Based on the traditional hydrophobic moment, they proposed the concept of charge moment. It is interesting but I am a little bit of doubtful how useful the charge moment will be. In particular, the authors found the Swapping one positive residue (R5) from the hydrophilic side with I7 and replacing it with a negative residue (D7), results in the same charge moment (Figure 5). In the case of helical antimicrobial peptides, such a swap may have a detrimental effect on peptide antimicrobial activity. For example, even a change of a hydrophilic residue serine on the hydrophobic face with a hydrophobic residue influenced peptide activity ( Wang G et al. , 2012 ). The authors may refine this idea and conceive the possible use of charge moment. Based on charge moment, is there any clue that interfacial charged residues of antimicrobial peptides play a larger role than non-interfacial ones in determining antimicrobial activity? Will it be possible to incorporate the observation that arginines are usually more important than lysines in determining peptide activity (see Mishra B et al. , 2013 )?
