 AHs are not invariably present in ALL antimicrobial peptides. The formation of AHs in antimicrobial peptides is dependent on solvent conditions. The statement to this effect should be edited appropriately. The proposed empirical structural property of AHs is OK as it is validated on a set of high resolution non-homologous proteins from a database. Extension of the analysis to antibacterial peptides such as cecropin and LL37 may not be valid. These peptides are unstructured in water and fold into amphipathic helical structure only in media of low dielectric constant. Also, the helical structures are not rigid as observed in protein crystal structures and show considerable conformational flexibility in solution. Hence, a unique value of hydrophobic moment will not be very meaningful. Solvent effects need to be taken into account. This point (3) needs to be addressed and clarified.
