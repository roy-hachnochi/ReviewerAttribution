Dragogna and colleagues describe a case of persistent psychosis associated with the ingestion of mephadrone and related compounds. These cathinone derivatives have similar risks as other phenethylamine stimulants such as methamphetamine and MDMA and are widely available and easily abused. It is therefore not surprising that persistent psychosis, as described in this case report, can be seen with prolonged use. Although the authors show an association of cathinone use with admission for a persistent psychosis the relationship between cathinone abuse and the development of psychosis is less clear - this patient may have become psychotic well before using any illicit drugs. However, the case report makes the essential point that urine drug screens with currently available immunoassay are likely to miss cathinone-like drugs. Thus, if cathinone use is suspected, a laboratory work up of biospecimes will need to be performed by groups specializing in medical toxicology. Due to the increasing abuse of drugs in this class clinicians can expect to see more toxicity. Overall, this report adds to the literature.
