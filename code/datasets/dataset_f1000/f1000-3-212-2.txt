I thank the authors for careful consideration of my previous comments. However, I still think that my main concern remains. The comparison of the reaction to faces against scrambled images is not enough to conclude that the difference in activation is due to faces. It could well be due to any characteristic in the class not present in the class, like smoothness or local contrast values. They mention in their response that scrambled images are are suited to maximize the cognitive comparison to faces. Quite the opposite, you would need a control class that has as much as possible from the class except the appearance of faces, probably several classes of distorted faces as well as your present control.
