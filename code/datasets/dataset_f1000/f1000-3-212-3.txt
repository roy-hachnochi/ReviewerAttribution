This reviewer is happy with the authors effort on the revision and the resulting significant improvement of the manuscript. However, several important issues are remained unanswered, as follow: For point 1, the authors clarified that the two contrasts do represent the cognitive process of their interest (i.e., two components of decision making process) but failed to provide reasonable defense against the contamination of the process of no interest, which was the point of this reviewers criticism; for example, as the reviewer 1 has also pointed out, the contrast against the scrambled face includes many decision-irrelevant processes including object or face perception. The authors have to explain the reason to believe that the two contrasts predominantly reflect the process of their interest rather than other confounding factors, and also describe the unfavorable possibility as a limitation in the Discussion section. For point 3, the reasons for the difference between the case 1 and case 2 are understandable, but not for the case 3. Please provide the reason for the necessity of Monte-Carlo-like simulation. In addition, please provide these reasons also for readers explicitly in the manuscript. For point 4, considering the slow hemodynamic-response temporal separation of 2.600 ms on average is obviously insufficient to make two time-series models independent, regardless of the scanning TR. Here the detailed information on the range of jittering is important, and this limitation caused by this insufficient separation should be declared in the Discussion section
