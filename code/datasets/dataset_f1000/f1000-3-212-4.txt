The authors use fMRI experiments to argue that the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) responds in decision-making to masked affect human faces. The reference images for the pre-decision phase are scrambled images. Scrambled images have a number of obvious features as they are not (a), faces, (b) smooth and (c) they have local contrast different to faces. So it is not obvious to me why the experimental condition, respect to this baseline, corresponds to affect faces, and not more generally to (a) some structure of faces, (b) smooth figures or (c) particular contrast structures. Why wouldnt you need to use additional controls to eliminate these options? (i.e. normal faces or objects) Related to this, you mention that you eliminate the 26% of subjects that suspect the presence of emotional faces and that 78% reported flickering. Although I didnt understand whether this flickering came from real flickering or not, I could not find in the text whether some subjects could report seeing the transition from scramble image to face. Some of the reported data (mean age, % subjects that suspect emotional faces, etc) are identical to Prochnow e t al 2013b, but I cannot find mention in the present ms that the data collected is the same than in Prochnow et al 2013b or that the subjects are the same. Is this the case? Please, clarify. Data presented are comparison of means, but the data obtained is distributions. Did you find whether other parameters of the distributions for other brain regions were significant (median, mode, variance). Is there individual variability? As you made many preliminary tests on subjects (for example, empathy), it would be very interesting to correlate these results with brain activations.
