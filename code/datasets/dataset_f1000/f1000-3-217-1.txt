The work proposes a simple procedure for accelerating the search for structural motifs. It pre-compiles all motifs of size n within a radius R from protein structures and use this motif table to detect faster matches between a query sequence and proteins with known structure. Major points: This procedure is a trivial step since motif searches are not performed sequentially. A motif search algorithm must pre-compile of possible motifs in order to make the search feasible. In my opinion, it is a detail of CLASP implementation and the method is insufficient to justify a full Method Article - maybe a short paper. Minor: The paper is confusing and English must be improved.
