Key points: 500+ drugs successfully mapped to ChEMBL to follow a time course of promiscuity. When high-confidence activity data were considered, only small average increase in drug promiscuity over time were observed (from ca 1.5-3). When the stringency of data selection criteria was gradually relaxed and low-confidence data were considered, unrealistic increases in promiscuity over time were detected. As an illustration, please, see the imatinib example in Figure 9 (in comparison to Figure 8a) that the reader might find interesting. In addition, please, see the conclusions, especially the second part beginning with " On the basis of high- confidence activity data ..."
