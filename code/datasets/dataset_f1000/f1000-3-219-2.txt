This is an interesting manuscript describing top research priorities in the aging and energetics field based on ideas extracted from recent papers. The title and abstract are appropriate and represent the information presented in the body of the manuscript. The basis of the paper is atypical in that the data generated are not assay-based but literature-based. The design is again, different but reasonable based on the outcomes to be generated. The data generated are ranked to identify the most highly cited papers in the past 4 years (20092014) and then further narrowed to 40 highly cited papers. The authors identified the top ten areas related to aging and energetics focusing on recommendations within these papers as to where further work should be focused. These areas included the CR longevity response, nutrient effects beyond energy, autophagy, mitochondria, ROS and cellular energetics and age-associated predictors of chronic disease among others. The recommendations for continued work in the areas covered were directed, insightful, and addressed strengths and weaknesses of the published studies and the area in general. Overall, the manuscript was well-written and provided important direction to those in the field in a relatively unbiased manner.
