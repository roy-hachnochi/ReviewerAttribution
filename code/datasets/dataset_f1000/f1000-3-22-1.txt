Apart from the rarity, the case report attempts to convey that the treatment options available for congenital dislocation of radial head are either early reconstruction or late radial head excision and the former is ideal. But the fact of the matter is that, this is not in alignment with established evidence. "A congenitally dislocated radial head is irreducible manually or surgically because of adaptive changes in the soft tissues and the absence of normal surfaces for articulation with the ulna and humerus. Consequently, open reduction of the dislocation and reconstruction of the annular ligament in childhood are not advised. Any impairment of function usually is caused by restriction of rotation of the forearm; in children, physical therapy to improve this motion is the only treatment indicated. If pain persists into adulthood, the radial head and neck can be excised." Campbells Operative Orthopaedics, 12e. Though not recommended by standard textbooks, if a reconstruction is planned as in the present report, annular ligament reconstruction is necessary as per available literature. De-Boecks recommendations against this in case of chronic acquired isolated radial head dislocations do not seem to be applicable for congenital dislocations. Further more, as per Sachar, reconstruction is better than radial head excision in adulthood only if it is performed before 2 years. Figure 2 is not a MRI picture. Do MRIs have any role in determining whether a rotation osteotomy is to be done or not? How can we measure cubitus valgus angle in patients with fixed flexion deformity? A detailed explanation on method of pre operative templating may help curious surgeons.
