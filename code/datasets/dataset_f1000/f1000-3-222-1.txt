This is solid contribution to the literature on creatine and its possible beneficial role in acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions. I have one major comment and several minor issues: Major: the manuscript does not, but should, deal to any extent with possible side-effects of creatine supplementation. Particularly since the population proposed for intervention are largely elderly and very ill. A paragraph stating this and possible side-effects should suffice. Minor things: s disease section, paragraph 2, sentence 7, please insert "not" before "results". Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis section, second paragraph, SOD-1 is cytosolic, so more than just mitochondrial proteins would be affected. This paragraph should be changed to reflect this. Long-term memory section, third sentence, I would replace the term "dramatic" with another term as little drama happens in results of studies. s disease section, first sentence - the phrase should read "amyloid-containing plaques and neurofibrillary tangles". s disease section - define CRT.
