The aim of this manuscript is to describe a software tool that was developed to calculate the inertia properties of the human body and segments of the body using the method developed by M. R. Yeadon. Yeadons method represents the body as a series of solid shapes, and is frequently used in biomechanical analyses. The software described in this paper makes the method developed by Yeadon faster and easier to implement. The manuscript is very well written, includes numerous examples that highlight the software flexibility and capabilities, and the host site for the software is well documented. Additionally, the detailed description of the inertia model clarifies a few ambiguities from Yeadons original text, and modifications were made to enable the model to answer more general questions. The figures are detailed and descriptive. My only minor suggestion is for the authors to add definitions for terms in Figure 4 that are not self-descriptive. For example, it is not clear what rel_center_of_mass and rel_inertia are defined relative to.
