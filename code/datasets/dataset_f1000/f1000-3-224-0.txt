An interesting finding that even nurses are guided more by personal beliefs than medical knowledge in their personal health practices. Influenza virus contributes to morbidity and mortality via annual epidemics, and pandemics every 10-50 years. These epidemics can be moderated by mass vaccination and herd immunity. Nursing faculty are role models for their students, who are future nurses, as well as their patients. The authors used a cross-sectional survey based on the Health Belief Model to assess knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (KABs) on annual influenza vaccination of nursing faculty members, nursing students, and members of the public. The sample was recruited from three sources: 1) convenience sampling method of nursing faculty and students attending an annual research conference (226 surveys collected of 1000 distributed; 23%); 2) nursing students and faculty attending a health fair; 3) Community members chosen randomly. Logistic regression was performed to assess the extent to which influential personal experiences, vaccine beliefs index and vaccine knowledge index were predictive of flu vaccine receipt. Interestingly, positive experiences had a greater effect on influencing behavior than negative experiences. Response rate was low (23%) or note reported, and there was a small sample size: 29 nursing faculty, 197 nursing students, 152 community members. Therefore, the power of the analysis was low (0.63). It was also not clear how the community members were recruited. Due to the small sample size, and selection bias issues in the convenience sampling method, the generalizability of the study is limited and should be interpreted with caution. It is also not clear how the recommendations in the Discussion (e.g. social marketing campaign) were decided upon, as the effectiveness of such an approach is not clear, especially in comparison to other potential approaches. Overall, the underlying premise and theory is interesting and merits further study.
