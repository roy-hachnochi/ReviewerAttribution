The authors have investigated the role of preoperative ketamine on analgesia in opioid-naive patients undergoing open colon resection. This was a negative study, showing no significant differences in VAS or opioid consumption over the first 24 hours postoperatively. Overall it was a well conducted study. Perhaps the authors could comment on why epidural analgesia was not utilized for open colon resections (though it is unclear whether this would have affected the outcome measures). The dose of ketamine given preoperatively is low. It would be interesting in future studies to use an infusion of ketamine and to include opioid tolerant patients as a study population.
