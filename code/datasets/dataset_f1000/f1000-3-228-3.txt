The research group generated a new ubiquitous CrT knockout as mouse model for creatine transporter deficiency with a large 3 exon deletion in the Slc6a8 gene. Biochemical phenotyping revealed creatine deficiency in brain, muscle, heart, and kidneys and behavioral testing revealed a phenotypic similarities with CrT patients. Therefore the new mouse model appears to be a valid tool to study creatine transporter deficiency. What needs some more elaboration is the discrepancy in findings compared to the mouse model described by Skelton et al. ( 2011) . Considering the similarities of the knock-outs, both have a large deletion of three exons, on would expect similar findings. But in the knock-out presented here there is more cognitive impairment, i.e. novel object recognition was abnormal while it was normal in the Skelton paper, and this is despite of the fact that the brain creatine deficiency reported here appears to be less pronounced than in the mouse model of Skelton et al . Before indexing the authors should provide information on whether the mouse chow contained creatine (some mouse chow contains fish meal and the latter contains creatine). Also it would be important to know the creatine concentration in plasma. The creatine concentration in mutants is expected to be higher than in wild types. I wonder whether blood contamination has contributed to unexpected high brain creatine concentration in mutants. Why did the group not consider whole-body perfusion prior to organ removal? Did the authors measure creatine/creatinine ratios in urine? And why not providing the information on guanidinoacetate in organs and body fluids as well?
