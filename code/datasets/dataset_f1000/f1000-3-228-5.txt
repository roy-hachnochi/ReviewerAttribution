In the present paper the authors describe a new murine model of CCDS1 obtained by ubiquitous deletion of 5-7 exons in the Slc6a8 gene. The experiments in general are well controlled and the results could be of interest for a general audience. However, I think there are two related points that should be added or clarified before the paper can be considered for publication. The authors reported that Cr depletion altered spontaneous locomotor behavior (Fig 7) and reduced muscle levels. How can this data fit with the normal behavior (namely, the motion speed and the total distance moved) displayed by mutant animals in the open field test? On the other hands, can the authors exclude that the aforementioned reduced motor activity may have interfere with learning and memory trials? The authors should at least discuss this possibility.
