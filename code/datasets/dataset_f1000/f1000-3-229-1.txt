This timely letter by Drs Gandy and DeKosky sheds light onto the inherent difficulties of using not yet fully characterized imaging markers where lack of validation of the tracers used, coupled with limited experience in an emergent field, might potentially lead to over- or under-interpretation of the results, especially when no controls are available to juxtapose the findings. This in turn might reflect badly on the value of this new approach. Larger cohort studies and, as the authors point out, neuropathological confirmation of the imaging findings will be required to fully validate and characterize the binding of these new and essential markers for the in vivo imaging of tau deposits in the brain.
