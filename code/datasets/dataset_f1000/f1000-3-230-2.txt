This is a very well written paper dealing with the determination of the proteasome activity in the ageing model Podospora. The experimental work is technically sound and is performed diligently. Although the results obtained, especially with respect to the lack of change in the protesomal activity during ageing of Podospora, appear to be contrary to the ones reported for mammalian systems and for Drosophila, it does not decrease the significance of this study which once again underlies the fact that age-related changes can be both universal (public) or specific (private). Actually, this is the important point that needs to be discussed in this paper as to why such differences are observed (see some papers by George Martin on public and private mechanisms of ageing). Authors should therefore comment on the usefulness and limitations of using model systems such as Podosopora in the context of modulating human ageing and longevity, and for testing/screening potential ageing-modulatory strategies. Furthermore, it will be useful if the implications of enhanced autophagy-related pathways in the context of ageing are discussed a bit more. On a minor note, just to be up-to-date with the literature on proteasome activity during ageing of various systems (refs 14-16), authors may include and cite a paper on Drosophila ( Hansen et al., 2012 ) which deals with the sex-specific differences in proteasome activity changes during ageing etc.
