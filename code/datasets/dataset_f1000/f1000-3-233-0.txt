This article provides interesting commentary on pan-assay interference compounds [PAINS] and focuses on the recent paper by Baell and Walters (2014) . Because of the danger of wasting resources following up inappropriate leads, major effort has gone into identifying classes of compounds that are made up of PAINS. One danger of applying many PAINS filters is that they will remove compounds that are promiscuous but are real leads, as highlighted by the authors reference to the work of Dimova and Bajorath (2012). There is a delicate balance between removing PAINS and keeping real, small "promsicuous" hitters. In addition to that reference I highlight the paper of Skolnick and Gao (2013) which explains the basis for promiscuous interactions with proteins and provides a potential paradigm for identifying promiscuous compounds that are not PAINS.
