The authors make a good case for the importance of the recent publication on PAINS compounds, hits from screening that are artifacts and may drain resources in followup form legitimate hits. Their conclusion that it will take years for the scientific community to accept this case and institute controls to protect against it is also valid. They point some caveats in terms of compounds that are legitimately promiscuous and therapeutically valuable as a result. But for academic labs unfamiliar with the HTS triage process, the danger of wasting resource on PAINS will be an ongoing risk of the drug discovery process. The article thus makes many valid and worthwhile points, and should be indexed.
