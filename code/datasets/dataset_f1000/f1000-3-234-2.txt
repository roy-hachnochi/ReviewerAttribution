This is an interesting intervention study with a good twist on keeping hand hygiene interesting for healthcare professionals. The intervention can also inspire other hospitals to undertake quality improvement which is excellent! In general the paper is well written with a good literature base, and great effort were undertaken to ensure reliability during the record breaking attempt, including two witnesses. I have two reservations though, and hope the authors could add something on these points. The authors report an increased compliance from 50-83%, although it in unclear how or where this was measured. Was this data collected after the intervention (how long after?) in hospital wards? More details on this could help place the results in perspective and help other professi9onal undertake similar efforts. I miss a discussion of the project. By listing some of their limitations others can be helped in further improving similar activities.
