This manuscript reports on a unique project aimed at refreshing the support for a WHO global hand hygiene compliance program in healthcare workers from a tertiary teaching hospital in Hong Kong. The manuscript is well written and has succinctly reported the literature to highlight the lack of research into methods to amelioration fatigue. The only comment I have to improve on this excellent manuscript is to include a reference about the need for behavioural research (Page 2, paragraph 6), after ....behavioural determinants is needed e.g. by Whitby M et al. (2007) .
