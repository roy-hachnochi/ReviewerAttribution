The authors report a patient with bilateral diaphragmatic dysfunction due to Borrelia. I enjoyed reading this interesting and well written manuscript. I think it would be nice to point out more details about the etiology of functional disorders of the diaphragm and acquired paralysis to explain why Lyme desease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of functional disorders of the diaphragm beside the mentioned extended differential diagnosis in table 1. Despite my comments, I think that in its current form it can be accepted for indexing.
