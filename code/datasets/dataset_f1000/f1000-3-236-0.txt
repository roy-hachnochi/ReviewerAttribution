My concern with this article in its current form is two-fold: As a software tool article, the discussion seems quite dated. The field of Evolutionary Computation has moved well beyond discussions and/or demonstrations of the form XXX is better than a simple GA. In fact, almost everything is! From a software tool perspective, the key issue here is how one deals with multimodal fitness landscapes. Various forms of nicheing GAs have been developed for this purpose since the 1980s. Additionally, other approaches such as embedding internal restart mechanisms have been developed and studied. To be of interest in 2015, the authors need to compare their approach with state-of-the-art alternatives. The particular application chosen is an important one, but the discussion also seems quite dated. The bioinformatics community has moved well beyond the simple hydrophobic-hydrophilic and on-lattice models used in this paper. To offer a credible tool to this community, one again has to do so in the context of the current state of the art. See, for example, Zhang Y (2008) , or Liu J et al. (2013).
