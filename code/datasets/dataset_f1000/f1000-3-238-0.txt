This review provides a comprehensive summary about the role of the transcription factor GLI1 in pancreatic cancer (PDAC). This manuscript highlights the dual role of GLI1 during pancreatic carcinogenesis, acting as an oncogene in the early stages of disease and as a tumor-suppressor in the late stages. Recent evidence suggests the loss of GLI1 in the later stages of PDAC might accelerate disease progression. This might explain why Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors have been successful for treating basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, but do not appear to have the same effect in metastatic PDAC. Moreover, this article summarizes recent data on the integration of GLI1 with other signaling pathways, suggesting that GLI1 is not only regulated by the upstream Hedgehog signaling in a SMO-dependent manner, but also by other oncogenic inputs, such as KRAS, TGF-beta and EGFR signaling. Recent experimental data suggest that lower GLI1 levels associate with PDAC progression, whereas increasing GLI1 levels could drive terminal differentiation and decreased PDAC tumorigenicity. What is missing in this review is a consideration about the factors that might contribute to decrease GLI1 levels and activity during PDAC progression. I would also suggest to mention in the Discussion that the dual role of GLI1 is so far limited to PDAC, as the evidence is lacking in other cancer types.
