The review is timely and addresses a very important problem in pancreatic cancer. The Smoothened inhibitors that work well for other tumor types have not only failed to stop the progression, but instead promote aggressive behavior in pancreatic cancer. The authors make a good case of balancing the evidence that suggests that there is HH-independent upregulation of GLI1 in the epithelial cells and a Hh-dependent upregulation in fibroblasts. Moreover, they nicely discuss how GLI1 is necessary for PanIN formation and then restrains further cancer progression. What is lacking in the review is a consideration of potential non-canonical effects of the Smo inhibitors. It is known that Smo induces cytoskeletal changes in fibroblasts, for instance, and that it can regulate glucose uptake in other cell types. Perhaps modulation of GLI1 is a bystander effect confusing the results. And the GLI1 knockout animals only partly acknowledge this interpretation, since some effects can be cell-type specific and opposing, as discussed in the review. A minor criticism is the following: the introduction erroneously says that GLI1 is conserved from Drosophila to humans. However, GLI3 is the closest homolog in sequence and function to Drosophila Ci. It seems that the authors meant the GLI family is conserved.
