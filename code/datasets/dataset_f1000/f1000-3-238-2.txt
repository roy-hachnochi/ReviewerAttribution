In this article Hogenson et al. provide us with a timely review regarding the current knowledge about the role of the transcription factor GLI1 in pancreatic carcinoma. There is an important focus on the dual activity of GLI1 during pancreatic carcinogenesis depending on the stage of disease progression, as evidenced in most recent works in this field, both clinical and experimental, that are nicely summarized in this review. Another important aspect of this review consists in integrating GLI1 as a transcription factor that is not solely regulated by Hedgehog signaling downstream of SMO but also by other pro-tumorigenic pathways, such as TGF-beta and KRAS signaling. Overall, I believe that this manuscript is very focused and contains valuable information for the broader readership, with up-to-date citation of the most relevant and recent literature in the field. A couple of minor points may be corrected or improved: A figure summarizing the role of GLI1 downstream of the various pathways described to modulate its expression/activity would be helpful. On page 3, one reads "TGF induces the expression of GLI1 through Smad3 and LET-dependent up regulation of GLI2". "LET-dependent" should be replaced by beta-catenin/LEF-TCF-dependent or something similar.
