I would like to compliment Dr. Cattano and his colleagues for undertaking the investigation on this important topic. Their results confirmed most of the risk factors that other investigators have also found may make mask ventilation difficult (studies cited in the reference section of this manuscript). However, Cattano et al . have attempted to go a step further and identify as to how many risk factors need to be present for mask ventilation to be difficult. They had a partial success in that venture. The definition of difficult mask ventilation in this study seems very reasonable and I hope it gets wide acceptance among those that manage airway. I agree with Dr. Doyles comment that it needs to be re-emphasized that this was a retrospective study and these results should be re-tested in a well designed prospective study.
