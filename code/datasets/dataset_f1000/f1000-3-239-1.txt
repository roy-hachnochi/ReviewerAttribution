Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript and my apologies for the long response time. This manuscript comes from one of the world leading research centers on difficult airway and deals with a very important and possible life saving topic: the difficult mask ventilation (DMV). Based on a retrospective analysis the authors found that three factors (age 49, neck circumference 43 and short neck) are strong predictors for DMV in obese patients and thus, should be included in a pre-operative assessment. Despite the retrospective nature of the study, this screening tool should make an important contribution to the predictability of DMV especially in the obese patients. I would encourage the authors to expand their work into a prospective study. Minor comments: Methods section: 1399 anesthetics were identified to have both mask ventilation and airway evaluation. Please specify over what period and/or how many patients. Please define patients and clarify the term nasal deficiencies. I am surprised that the dentition status was not one of the factors involved in the DMV. Is that due to the fact that very few patients in your group are edentulous? This might be different in other geographical areas. Could you comment on that? Ethnicity and body fat distribution would be another factor to consider in a future study. Obese patients with predominant abdominal fat distribution might have normal neck and airway as compared to those with an equally distributed fat habitus. Finally, one of the study limitations noted in the discussion section mentioned the skills level of the residents participating in these cases. This is a valid concern but I would also be interested to see if other factors related to the provider might play a role in DMV. From my clinical observation I noticed that providers with small hands have more difficulty with mask ventilation of a large, obese patient. I wander if anybody looked into this association.
