Thank you for the opportunity to review this very interesting manuscript that focuses on studying difficult mask ventilation in obese patients. This manuscript highlights an important safety consideration when caring for this patient population. The authors have appropriately discussed the limitations of this study. Of those, the most important is the retrospective nature of the study. Another limitation to consider is the lack of data on the use of muscle relaxants: how much and its timing relative to the assessment of the ventilation difficulty, etc. As one might imagine, there may have been variability related to the ongoing controversy of the administration of muscle relaxants either immediately after induction, or a bit delayed till confirmation of the ability to mask ventilate. As we acknowledge such limitations and thus their impact on the validity of these results, we should keep in mind that the resulting increased awareness of these predictors will likely increase the likelihood of a thorough airway exam and making the right decision in managing such airways. As per the most recent ASA difficult airway algorithm (2013) a thorough airway evaluation will aid in deciding the safest pathway taken inclusive of the following factors: invasive vs, non-invasive, awake vs. asleep, videolaryngoscopy as first approach vs. DL, and finally maintaining spontaneous ventilation vs. muscle relaxation.
