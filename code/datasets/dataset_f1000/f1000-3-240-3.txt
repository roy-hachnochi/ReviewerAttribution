This paper describes a method that allows quantification of miRNA-directed cleavage of specific target RNAs in plant tissues. Method validation includes an analysis of target cleavage in miRNA over-expressing tissues and in miRNA-deficient samples ( hen1 mutant). Usefulness of the approach is illustrated by the identification of a role for miRNA-directed cleavage in the modulation of nodule-specific GmNAC1 -isoform expression in Glycine max . This quantitative protocol may reveal itself as very useful in experiments aimed at characterizing the role played by miRNAs in the regulation of target gene expression in plants and their contribution to growth, development and response to the environment. However, under its current form, this manuscript suffers from a lack of independent validation of its quantitative output. Such validation should involve a different approach aimed at quantifying the relative levels of miRNA, full-length and cleaved target transcripts in wild type, overexpressing and miRNA-deficient mutants. For instance, a Northern blot analysis of wild-type, miR164-over-expressing and hen1 plant tissues could be carried out to evaluate relative levels of miR164 as well as full-length AtNAC1 and its miR164-induced cleavage product, and the results compared to those obtained through the qRT-PCR and qAce approaches described in this manuscript. Indeed, we know from the publication by Guo et al. (2005) (referenced in this manuscript) that these various RNAs can be identified and quantified by Northern blot analysis
