The manuscript by Will Howat and colleagues validates an anti-ARID1A antibody and provides a good example of an antibody validation paper. In particular the use of negative cell lines and knockout mouse tissue demonstrate the extent of specificity of the antibody. The data is mostly well presented and clearly explained in the text. The manuscript would be suitable for indexing if some, mostly minor, issues can be addressed. I think the title should mention to make clear its an antibody that is being validated. The authors say there is 95% sequence homology between human and mouse, it would be interesting to see how conserved the sequence the antibody was raised against is. The Materials and Methods give a good overview of the reagents and methods used for the IHC, but there is little information about the western blotting. The reagents and methods used should be added. It would be good to cite the source of the cells used and the mouse tissue. I was not clear if the lack of staining in RMG-II cells was expected or an unexpected but useful result? This should be explained. Figure 1 legend. Should read represents the loading control In figure 4B the KO epithelium is clearly negative, except one region in the top left which looks positive, I wondered what the authors felt about this? It is interesting that the stromal staining appears to be non-specific, I wonder if the authors ever did a no primary control? Does the stroma still stain? Also it would be worth mentioning this staining in the conclusions. Author contributions. Should it read conceived the idea behind the article or similar wording ?
