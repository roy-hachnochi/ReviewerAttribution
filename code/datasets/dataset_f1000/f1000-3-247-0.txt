In this article, Petzold and Scrosati provide observational evidence suggesting that food supply drives the re-colonisation of benthic organisms in wave-exposed intertidal communities after being disturbed by drifting ices. The title and abstract of the article are appropriate for the content of the work and represent a suitable summary of it. Although the authors report the results of only one site for each (i.e. one site with high and one site with low Chlorophyll-a concentration), the differences in food supply between these sites are strong enough to propose further studies analysing the role of bottom-up forcing in this system. Accordingly, the conclusions of the study are sensible and justified on the basis of the results. As a follow-up approach, the authors may consider first, to expand the study to a larger set of sites in order to confirm the pattern, and second, to construct competing hypotheses (in addition to the bottom-up hypothesis) that would be tested by means of manipulative experiments replicated at those sites. This article is a necessary benchmark from which further hypothesis-driven research should be conducted
