Interesting pilot study investigating metabolite differences between patients with psoriasis, those with psoriatic arthritis, and unaffected controls. I look forward to seeing these results replicated in a follow-up study which will include larger sample size. Controlling for treatment method, and comparison of patients who are on vs off treatment will also be necessary next steps. It will also be interesting to demonstrate in what manner such metabolites fluctuate with extent of disease. The mechanism behind these metabolite discrepancies and their significance in the disease pathogenesis also require further investigation. This study opens the door to multiple avenues of further study.
