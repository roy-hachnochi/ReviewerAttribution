The present research work is very important in an Indian context, highlighting the major public health issue where large numbers of malnourished children reside here and the majority of the malnourished children are found among socially and economically underprivileged communities. Tribal population in India is considered as socio-economically underprivileged. However, I have a few minor suggestions as under: The present study is clinic based data collected from two states. Re-analysed data separately for each state. There is large interstate variation of malnutrition and culture as well as food variation. Therefore individual tribal specific data is more important. If available include morbidity history in relation to malnutrition. There are a large number of studies highlighting the application of MUAC as screening tool of undernutrition. More importantly it is a low cost technology as compared to measurement of height and weight. It is to be highlighted in the present manuscript. Compare the prevalence with other studies conducted among tribal population in India.
