The authors have responded to my previous questions and improved the manuscript. Although, the described computational approach can identify alpha helices with unique features, the authors proposal that the helical propensities can be linked to host protein interactions is rather weak and requires experimental data to validate the method. There are still a conceptual error in the manuscript: Page 4: " The antibody most likely inhibits the rearrangement of GP2 segments, which abrogates the fusion of the internal loop in the host membrane ." Do the authors mean that the antibody binding prevents Gp2 conformational changes required for membrane fusion?
