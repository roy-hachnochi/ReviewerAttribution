The work by Muzamal and co-workers is an in depth study of the Staphylococcus two-component system GraRS, its auxiliary protein GraX and associated ABC transporter system vraG. The work is thorough and shows a methodical approach to characterizing the players in this system, however a few issues need to be addressed. Major comments: Considering how detailed the work is, it is surprising that VraG, co-transcribed with VraF and under the regulatory control of GraR, is not investigated. Why? If components of this system sense and bind CAMPs (page 3) to effect a change, perhaps some of these binding studies should have been done in the presence as well as absence of CAMPs. Minor comments: pg. 4, Protein concentrations determined by Bradford assay, a reference should be included. pg. 5, "GraX fractions were pooled and concentrated". How were proteins concentrated? pg. 5, cell cultures were cooled to 4C before IPTG induction at 16C for 16 h. Why? pg. 6, DNase footprinting experiments, +28 to -168 was used, what was the justification? Has the promoter architecture been mapped to solely this region? If so, a reference should be added. pg. 7, "cytoplasmic domains of histidine kinases have been used as model to study...", should be model s . Why does the ratio of protein:protein used in experiments vary? The quality of some of the gel figures are perfectly clear whilst some are poor, exacerbated when the document is printed. More consistency in quality would improve interpretation of the manuscript. Due to the large number of expression vectors used in the study, a small table should be added to note the designation, host, resistance, induction etc, of those plasmids used and those plasmids made for reader clarity and reference. Some of the figures referred to in the manuscript do not match to the correct figures, this should be thoroughly checked.
