The Review by Arredondo-Peter et al. presents our current knowledge on the fascinating field of plant non-symbiotic (nsHb) and truncated hemoglobins (tHb), for which substantial, but scattered, information has accumulated over the past twenty years. The Review deals specifically with rice Hbs. Work from several distinct worldwide groups has so far provided information on the gene families for five nsHbs, and for a single tHb in rice; moreover, expressed proteins have been located to various plant organs and developmental stages. Crystal structures and kinetic analyses have helped delineating the potential roles of rice Hbs in plant physiology, highlighting different O 2 binding affinities that differentiate the various Hbs. A main question that remains unanswered concerns the in vivo functions carried over by the five distinct rice nsHbs and tHb; hints reviewed from the literature include O 2 sensing, signaling, O 2 transport, NO scavenging, and NO dioxygenase pseudo-enzymatic activities (others may also be plausible). The Review includes evolutionary considerations (and the effects of rice selection through domestication) that will be reinforced by the forthcoming completion of rice genomes. Overall, the Review provides a useful compendium over a subject whose reunification into a coherent presentation will indeed support deeper exploration of the functional aspects, whose scientific and practical relevance cannot be underestimated.
