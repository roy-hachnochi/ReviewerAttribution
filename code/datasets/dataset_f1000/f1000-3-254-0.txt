This is a very well-written and conducted systematic review and metaanalysis. I would have liked to get a sense of the level of agreement between the two reviewers for study inclusion, though I suspect the search was relatively straightforward. It would be worthwhile pointing out in the discussion that the Dresler paper weighs heavily in the results, particularly with respect to respiratory complications, inherent in surgical procedures and perhaps, in some instances, unrelated to the talc pleurodesis itself. The methodological flaws of this study (exclusion of a substantial number of patients after randomization limiting the benefits of randomization) should have been specifically highlighted in my opinion. Nonetheless, this is an important meta-analysis that should be indexed.
