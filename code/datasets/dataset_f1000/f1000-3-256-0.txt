The study addresses a long running question in aging research, which concerns the interaction of the two regimes known to consistently extend mammalian (mouse) lifespan: caloric restriction and manipulation of the GH/IGF1 axis. The study provides a wealth of very useful endocrinological and metabolic data and the authors must be commended their extensive work. The interpretation with regards to the effects of insulin sensitivity and caloric restriction are plausible, though ultimately, whether this is truly the mechanism by which the lifespan-extending effects are mediated (and account for the differential response to CR in GHRko mice), will require direct experimental demonstration. I would like the authors to discuss the metabolic results a little more. For example, it is indicated that the total caloric output of GHrKO mice is higher, considerably so, than WT (regardless of CR). However, the heat production is more or less the same. At the same time, CR has opposite effects on hear production in GHRko versus WT mice. It would seem to me overall, that as a whole the metabolic effects of CR in table 3, are much attenuated in the GHRko mice, i.e. WT mice have much more profound alterations in metabolic parameters in response to CR than do GHRko mice to CR. These are just suggestions. Overall, the data and paper are very valuable as is.
