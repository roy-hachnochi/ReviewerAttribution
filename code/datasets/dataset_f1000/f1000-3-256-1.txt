Caloric restriction prolongs longevity in experimental animals via altering insulin sensitivity. The growth hormone receptor knockout (GHR KO) mice live longer and have increased insulin sensitivity. In this study, the authors tested the hypothesis that the modest effect of caloric restriction on longevity of GHR KO mouse is because of the failure of caloric restriction to further increase the already maximally elevated insulin sensitivity in this mouse model. Surprisingly, the authors found that caloric restriction increased blood insulin concentration and reduced insulin sensitivity in GHR KO mice. These findings refute the established assertion between insulin sensitivity and and slowed senescence in GHR KO mice The paper is well written and the data analyses are appropriate. The conclusions are supported by experimental data. The number of animals per group are considerably large except for GHR-N on caloric restricted group. I recommend indexing the paper as submitted.
