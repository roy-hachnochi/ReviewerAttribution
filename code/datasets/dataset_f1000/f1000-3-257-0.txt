Lamming comments on, and presents an alternative approach to, identification of hot topics in aging research previously published by Allison et al. (2014) . In the original paper, Allison et al. screened title to identify the 10 most cited papers from 2010 to 2013 and to suggest promising future research opportunities. Lamming was concerned about including review articles in the search, and sensed a lack of concentration of papers listed in the highest impact factor journal. By broadening the search to include title as well as key words, and excluding review articles, Lamming generated a markedly different list of top cited papers. Interestingly, distinct thematic areas (which make intuitive sense as hot topics) were identified, including diabetes/insulin resistance, sirtuins, and microbiome. Bottom line: changing search approach somewhat modestly had a major impact on list outcome. The correspondence is interesting and the search was validly conducted. The paper makes the important point well familiar to geneticistsdesign of the screen has a major impact on outcome. Both search strategies have merit, and the reader who prefers not to search for her/himself now has two chances to have her/his papers or research area cited.
