Overall Comments: This study presents a framework for discovering ADRs using population based administrative data sources. The approach is exemplified by use of AChEIs treatment on dementia. Overall, the study is very well done. However, there is an issue that needs to be clarified as following: On page 4, paragraph 3, the authors state that they treated the use of statin drugs as indicators of health status because they are preferably prescribed to less frail who are not at the end of life. Even though the statement seems reasonable the reference they provided does not support it. The results of these pilot study shows that use the framework for discovering ADRs using population based administrative data a source is promising as a hypothesis generating approach.
