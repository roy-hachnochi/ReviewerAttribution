The article by Sterling et al. has described the identification and functional analysis of evolutionally conserved non-coding elements that might be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the gene SNCA , mutations in which were associated with Parkinsons disease. This is a very interesting, proof-of-concept article, with an attempt to provide pathogenic insight from the point of view of regulatory genomics for a complex human disease. I endorse the indexing of this manuscript. It is now well recognized that ~98% of human genome do not code for proteins. Comparative genomics studies revealed that the majority of evolutionally conserved regions consist of non-coding elements that that might be involved in regulating gene expression. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have showed that the majority (~93%) of SNPs contributing to human diseases or susceptibility lie outside protein-coding regions, and there are many non-coding SNPs have been demonstrated to be associated with common diseases and traits. By identifying functionally significant non-coding elements for SNCA , Sterling et al .s work could lend a new perspective to study the genetic architecture of Parkinsons disease, and promote further investigations on the pathogenic impact of non-coding elements and their regulatory networks on the clinical courses of Parkinsons disease.
