This is a well-written and articulate article advocating collaborative research and organizational approaches to develop drugs with the potential to treat rare diseases. The case for collaboration is thoughtfully developed and the authors make compelling arguments. I fully sympathize with the contentions laid out in the article and this piece will be a valuable addition to the literature.
