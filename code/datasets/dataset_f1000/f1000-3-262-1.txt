I will be keen to see the progress of this work, particularly with regards to an integrative setting that considers various structural models and further interface with energetic minimization protocols. I do sympathize with the comment on an independent researcher aiming to share research progress in spite of large-scale evaluation settings. F1000 is the right venue for these types of dissemination.
