The author has presented a novel docking algorithm based on the principle that spatial and electrostatic properties in cognate pairs of residues are conserved in the catalytic site of proteins endowed with the same function. Thus, in case the crystal structure of a protein-ligand complex is available, it can be used to dock the same ligand into the active site of a homologous protein (with identical catalytic activity). The author has tested the algorithm by docking vildagliptin into the active site of PI-PLC. Examination of Figure 2 and Table 5 show quite a few short contacts between the docked ligand and amino acid chains. Under such circumstances the author could consider the inclusion of an energy minimization protocol to relieve the short contacts. The author considers the method validated by the above mentioned docking exercise. However, the author could consider a case where the actual crystal structure of the solution exists and the rmsd between the experimental solution and the solution obtained by DOCLASP could be provided to give some estimate of the accuracy of the docked poses. Given the fact that the DOCLASP solution abounds in short contacts, further improvements could be made in the pose. On page 3, two lines below Equation 4, a more explicit account of CScore could be given in the manuscript.
