In this manuscript, Ispasanie et al. describes the characterization of vaccine antigens of meningococcal serogroup W isolates from both carriers and patients in Ghana and Burkina Faso. The work seems very interesting and adds up to the previous knowledge with information on the limited antigenic variation of meningococcal OMPs that induce antibodies. The manuscript is well written and the methodology is well defined. Minor comments: The authors state in the discussion section, that after the introduction of the meningococcal A vaccine outbreaks caused particularly by serogroup W are occurring with increased frequency. To the readers surprise, only 31 isolates were studied (21 carrier and 10 patient strains) within a seven year period (2003-2009). Maybe the authors would consider adding more information of the numbers of serogroup W incidence or number of cases in both countries and the reason why they choose only this limited number for characterization of the vaccine antigens.
