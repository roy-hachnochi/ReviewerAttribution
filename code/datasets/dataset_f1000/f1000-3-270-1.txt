The authors performed a confirmatory study for the recently reported protective effects of loss-of-function mutations in APOC3 in the Chinese population. Not a single loss-of-function mutation was identified in exons and exon-intron junctions of APOC3 in a total of 4470 study subjects. The authors concluded that APOC3 is not a good predictor of risk of ischemic vascular disease in the Chinese population. This is a worthwhile study and the information, although negative, is certainly useful. However, based on the data reported in the paper, it is premature to conclude that functional variants in APOC3 are very rare and/or not related to ischemic vascular disease in the Chinese population. The data merely conclude that detrimental mutations are very rare in the sequenced regions of APOC3 gene in the Chinese population. Potential effects from large deletions of the gene and mutations in regulatory regions of the gene cannot be excluded. In fact, there have been reports of promoter polymorphisms that affect the expression of APOC3 (ref. 28-31 in Jrgensen et. al). Unless additional, more comprehensive mutational studies are performed in the cohort, conclusions should be modified to reflect the limitations of the current study. There have been examples of synonymous mutations that affect the translation of mRNA and therefore affect the protein level. Also, intronic mutations distant from splice sites could affect splicing. Authors should clearly state reasons why they believe that the variants identified in the study have no functional consequences. References should be added to the end of the second sentence of the paper (while only few studies have identified protective variants conferring reduced risk).
