Despite being a negative study, the information in this article is valuable. It describes a study that found no relevant mutation in APOC3 among a large number of Chinese subjects (4470), including 1488 healthy controls, 1050 patients with ischemic stroke, 628 patients with coronary artery disease, and 1304 patients with venous thrombosis. Actually, no one with the loss-of-function mutations reported in European and African individuals was identified in this study. Only synonymous and intronic variants were discovered. The authors indicated that these variants have no functional consequences, but no data are shown. At the least the TG levels according to the genotype might be shown in table 2. The authors must indicate that other genetic defects, such a gross deletions or regulatory mutations not identified by sequencing methods or by analysis of exons, may cause a loss-of-function of APOC3 and might be associated with decreased triglyceride levels and a reduced risk of ischemic vascular disease. Actually, selection of subjects with decreased triglyceride levels and a deeper analysis of this gene might be a better strategy to identify these genetic variants potentially involved in TG levels and risk of ischemic vascular disease. Accordingly, I think the authors might change the title of the article.
