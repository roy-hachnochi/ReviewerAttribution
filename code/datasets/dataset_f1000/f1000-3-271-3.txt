The revised paper is much improved in terms of its (now appropriate and not tedious) length and clarity of statements. I still see a problem with the proposed absolute requirement (listed as the first principle) of disclosing the reviewers identity. While noble in principle, I think it is unrealistic at this time; if so, compromising the first principle would appear to make the subsequent ones partly irrelevant. On the other hand, the authors clearly explained their decision to avoid addressing one specific issue of the reviewing process - frequent requests for tedious and time consuming experiments that do not contribute substantially to the main point of the paper, often precluding publication. As an experimental scientist, however, I do see this point as critical and think that its resolution would contribute more to the fairness of review than disclosing the reviewers identity. Finally, I am still surprised that the related work by Bienz and Weston is not discussed and/or cited.
