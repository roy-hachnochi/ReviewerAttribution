The principles outlined here are important, and this piece is certainly timely. I have two suggestions to improve the manuscript. First, as currently constituted, the manuscript is a bit repetitive, with a large text box recapitulating what is also laid out in much the same format in the body of the manuscript. Perhaps each of the major points could be expounded upon in the text. Second, while it is hard to argue with the specific tenets enumerated here, there are quite a lot of them. I guess my feeling is that for ideas like this to be more widely adopted that it would be helpful if the core principles could be boiled down to a more manageable size (which would be ideally presented in a text box). I applaud the authors for doing their part to increase openness in scientific publishing, something I agree is very much needed.
