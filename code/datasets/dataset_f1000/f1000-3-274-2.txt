The authors have done an excellent job of gathering and presenting data about journal subscription expenditures in the UK. I have no major suggestions for the current version of the article. The only minor suggestion I would have is that the authors may have wanted to include more information and links to similar data that has already been collected for both the UK and other countries, such as the data collected by Timothy Gowers or Theodore C. Bergstrom et al.
