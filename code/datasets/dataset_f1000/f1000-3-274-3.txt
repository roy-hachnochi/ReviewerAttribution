Academic and research libraries purchase large number of professional journals from publishers, often in packages (also referred to as bundles). Often publishers insist on non-disclosure clauses in the contracts they sign with subscribing institutions, and they sell journals to different institutions at different prices. Clever negotiators (as those in the University of California system) bargain hard and obtain better deals, but others pay needlessly high prices. Selling the same product at different prices to different consumers is unethical. Till recently it was very difficult or even impossible to obtain information on how much a university pays a (commercial) publisher as subscription to journals. Now people like Lawson and Meghreblian (and Bergstrom, Timothy Gowers) have found a way to overcome this unethical practice of publishers. This short paper and the data is on how much each university in the UK pays seven publishers by way of subscription to journals. The paper is well written and it makes public the voluminous data they have collected using the Freedom of Information Act.
