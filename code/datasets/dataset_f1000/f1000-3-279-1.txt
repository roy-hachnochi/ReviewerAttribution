This is more of an opinion piece than a research article. The idea of incorporating practical applications into STEM education is obviously a good idea, but the obstacles to implementation have not really been addressed, which is crucial. Statements such as "science training at the undergraduate level should move beyond rote memorization of facts" seem rather naive. No one, for a long time, has argued that undergraduate education should be rote memorization.
