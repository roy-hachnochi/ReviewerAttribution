This is an interesting and timely article that presents viable solutions to some of the challenges being faced by higher education. The two main solutions presented - increasing the interdisciplinarity of STEM undergraduate curricula and providing more work experiences for students - are consistent with accepted high impact educational practices. The paper is quite brief, but nonetheless presents several concrete examples, and the authors rightfully encourage educators to share what they are doing in order to develop guidelines and best practices. In terms of the interdisciplinary curriculum argument, I would encourage the authors to broaden this even further to include disciplines such as sociology, political science, and psychology, as many of todays scientific issues (such as climate change and the challenge of feeding the planet) can be addressed from a multitude of different angles. In terms of the suggestion of increasing work experience for students, it would be helpful to see more discussion of the different approaches that can be taken in this regard. For example, consideration of co-operative programs, internships, externships, and course-embedded community engaged learning projects. Overall, this paper achieves the stated objective of describing strategies to connect undergraduate science education with the needs of todays graduates, and should prove informative to educators in STEM fields.
