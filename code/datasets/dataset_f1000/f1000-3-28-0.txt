In the revised article, the authors have addressed most of my concerns. There still remain a few relatively minor issues, mostly involving data presentation / manuscript readability rather than scientific validity. As in the prior version of the manuscript, the authors claim in Fig. 8 (model figure) that IGF-1 has a neuroprotective effect under basal conditions (i.e. in the absence of H 2 O 2 ) and now explicitly cite Fig. 3A in support of this claim. However, as previously, Fig. 3A includes no information on the statistical significance of IGF-1 effect on the neuronal death in the absence of H 2 O 2 (by eye, the IGF-1 effect seems very modest). In the legend for Fig. 3A, the authors state that "#" means " p0.05 vs control " but symbol "#" is not used in the figure - perhaps it has been accidentally omitted? I appreciate that, as I suggested, the authors repeated statistical analyses for many experiments and are now using two-way rather than one-way ANOVA where appropriate. However, the results of this analysis are buried in the figure legends and are described in a fairly non-transparent, difficult to understand way; the figures themselves are largely unmodified. To make the paper more accessible to future readers, the graphs for experiments analyzed by 2-way ANOVA should show statistical significance for all post-hoc comparisons that were performed (including the effects that were not significant, to make this clear); for a 2x2 experimental condition grid this means all 4 post-hoc comparisons should be shown in terms of statistical significance. As an example, for the experiment in Fig. 2B, the authors should show statistical significance for (1) H 2 O 2 vs vehicle in control; (2) H 2 O 2 vs. vehicle following PPP pre-treatment; (3) control vehicle vs. PPP vehicle; and (4) control H 2 O 2 vs. PPP H 2 O 2 . Analogous pairwise comparisons should be shown for all experiments using 2-way ANOVA.
