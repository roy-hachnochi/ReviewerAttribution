This manuscript by Laura Genis and co-workers is very interesting and the data presented are of significant scientific value. These studies provide further understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in neuronal damage and rescue following oxidative stress. Of particular interest are the protective effects of IGF-I on neuronal cells mediated via the astrocytes. To these, the synergistic/additive effects of SCF on IGF-I are novel and interesting. I have only few minor suggestions - mainly to improve graphic illustrations: In figure 1B, IGF-I ELISA, the conditioned media from astrocytes and neuronal cells is analysed for IGF-I levels but the values are express in ng/ug of protein, why? In Figure 3E I asume that the graph shows the % phosphorylation for the IGF-I treatment? This should be properly label. In Figure 4 a statistical significance is shown for the , but it should shown for the IGF-I which actually prevents MitoO2. I have a similar comment for the graph below in figure 4B.
