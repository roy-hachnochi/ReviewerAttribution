A very interesting paper indeed, I am glad to provide a review. The title seems appropriate, however I would suggest to limiting it to “Case Report: "ADHD Trainer": the mobile application that enhances cognitive skills in ADHD”. The conclusions seems coherent, and balanced. This paper is about a case report, hence no clear conclusions can be drafted on the efficacy of the ADHD trainer, however it seems it may improve many clinical domains in ADHD children. It would be of interest to replicate these findings in a case series, or other types of study. In the last sentence, the last word is misspelled, please correct it.
