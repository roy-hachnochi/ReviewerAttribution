This is an interesting and encouraging report, but I have the following reservations. One case provides very limited evidence for efficacy and even less for safety. In this light, a couple of statements, including the following, are too enthusiastic and need to be toned down: "regular cognitive computerized training in ADHD patients can improve some of their cognitive symptoms and can help treating video game addiction" "We conclude that a daily cognitive computerized training in ADHD patients can improve some of their cognitive symptoms, and can help treating the video gaming addiction." â€‹The manuscript is understandable, but needs copy editing by a native English speaker. For instance, the first sentence of the abstract has 2 errors, and the following phrase is really hard to parse: "the method of Tajima Cognitive Method (TCT) cognitive training called ADHD Trainer." The exercises comprising "ADHD Trainer" are not described in any detail beyond listing the categories of mental functioning that tasks were thought to reflect. If another publication or thesis describes it, a reference would suffice; otherwise a list of tasks would be a first step. Similarly, as with any method, the authors need to provide some kind of information about where the reader can obtain the TCT. The Barkley School Situations Questionnaire was administered, but the scores are not reported.
