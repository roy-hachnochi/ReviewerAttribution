I reviewed this plugin as an end-user and as a biologist. I have created and analyzed many networks using Cytoscape. I installed the BiNat plugin, but unfortunately was not able to test its functionality because of a flaw I encountered in the initial step. I was unable to load my networks on to the plugin. The author gives two formats that are compatible. My main problem with this is that I am already using cytoscape and I have uploaded a network on Cytoscape. I should be able to use the network I have already uploaded and working with, rather than loading it a second time on to the plugin. At the least it should take the same formats that I was able to load onto Cytoscape (which did not work) or the *.cys format that cytoscape saves. The "import network from table" feature of cytoscape takes tab delimited files. The plugin was unable to take the very same files. This is a major drawback and a fatal flaw in my opinion. The second issue is the English in the paper and the manual. It needs extensive correction and reworking to be legible. This may very well be a useful and effective plugin. But I was unable to test its functionality because of a) poor instructions in the paper/manual , b) inability in using existing cytoscape networks and formats (This is a major drawback, and the utility of a plugin which cannot act on a network loaded in the main cytoscape window or at least makes use of the same format is very limited). I recommend that the author rework these issues and make the plugin more robust.
