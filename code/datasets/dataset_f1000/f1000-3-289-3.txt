This article has been thoroughly revised. Its purpose is clear, and its finding are supported by a mixture of literature and software review and experience with ActivePapers. We have two minor suggested revisions. First, the four bullets in the conclusions could also be worked into the introduction. We see these as well-stated, important points to make early in the paper. For example, the first bullet---thinking of a software representation as a dataset and archiving it accordingly---is a simple, intuitive way to think about much of what is discussed in this paper. Second, on page 4, the author says "many practitioners consider the idea of preserving scientific software for many years unrealistic, and some even argue that it is unnecessary because computational methods change so rapidly that their long-term preservation is of no interest." This statement needs citations.
