The authors have conducted a survey of reintroduction practitioners and they have analysed the distribution of different project statistics, such as degree of autonomy of and frequency of meetings. They also present data on project success rates. These data will no doubt be useful to people working in the field. I was surprised that the authors did not investigate whether any of the other factors, e.g., frequency of meetings, was correlated with project success. They obviously have the data to look at this. Why didn’t they? Minor comments: p2: "Lindemeyer" - "Lindenmayer" p2: Citation formatting: “Clark Westrum’s (1989)” p7: Heading of column 2 in Table 1 could just be “0”, because otherwise it could be read as “number of partnerships”. p8, Figure 13: “Formall Evaluated” - “Formally Evaluated” p8: Citation formatting again: “Kleiman et al. (1999)”
