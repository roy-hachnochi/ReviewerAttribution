This paper analyzed the volume of publications in the field of life sciences by country and continent in order to better understand regional differences in life sciences research infrastructure. The authors additionally allocated scores to quantify focal areas of interest and examined the potential use of these scores by exploring the relationship between Attraction Score and research policy on hESCs. This report is interesting, providing a detailed analysis with a graphical representation of data that facilitates a smooth understanding of the studys conclusions. However, as the first reviewer has mentioned, a limitation seems to be present in terms of the data source used for the study. PubMed is a comprehensive and authoritative database but is generally unable to provide an exhaustive data package for scientometric studies. Although the authors have claimed that the study covers the most recent, diverse and refined research output (via PubMed), the number of publications is likely to be only illustrative of the quantitative aspect of the research output. Similarly, the affiliation of the first author provides partial information on the contribution of each country to the publication. Instead, WoS or SCOPUS may be more useful data sources, allowing analysis of the citations and journal impact factors for all authors, as shown in previous studies. In addition, whether the Attraction Scores designated by the authors distinguish between the proportion of studies focused on the topic of interest and the entire number of publications remains open to speculation. Finally, the correlation analysis referred to in this study is not an actual correlation analysis (which is a statistical term). It is recommendable to change the term in order to avoid confusion for the reader.
