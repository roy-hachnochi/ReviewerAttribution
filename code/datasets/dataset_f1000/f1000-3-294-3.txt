This is a solid study, addressing an important point in the study of truncated haemoglobins (and indeed all proteins), namely the verification of results obtained on recombinant proteins also with proteins obtained in the native state. The experimental design and methods are appropriate, the results are clearly presented and carefully discussed, and the conclusions are justified and supported by the data.
