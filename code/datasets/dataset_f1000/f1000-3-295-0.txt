I think this article is quite interesting and think the authors have answered prior critiques reasonable well. I do not have much in the way of further critiques. My specific critiques are as follows: 1. The results presented in Table 3 do not show any statistics (e.g. p values or standard error). 2. The best negative control for such studies is use of a scrambled version of peptide.
