 Title and Abstract : The Title of the article, "The PDB database is a rich source of alpha-helical anti-microbial peptides to combat disease causing pathogens", is appropriate for the content of the article. However because the detected peptides were solely tested toward plant pathogens the term of "plant" in the title could be considered. The abstract represent rather well the work presented in the article except the two last sentences which are expectations of the authors but were not studied in this work. Particularly the sentence : "The use of native" assert that peptide structure extracted from native proteins will be without adverse effect to the host but it has to be proved in my opinion. Article content : The paper describes the use of a software and an in silico method developed by the authors to screen the protein database (PDB) to find new antimicrobial peptides on the basis of the secondary structures of these peptides. The method is innovative and very interesting. Moreover the authors proved the efficacy of their method as they synthesized peptides from portions of protein sequences presenting secondary structures resembling cecropin B and demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of these new peptides. However I did not understand why they used an anionic peptide as the negative control. Indeed it is well known that the global positive charge of the peptides is required for their initial stacking on the membrane of target cells. Thus it is predictable that any anionic peptide will be inactive. Conclusions : The main problem concerns the conclusions of the article. Indeed there are not sufficient experimental evidences in the article to assert that the alpha-helical peptides with antimicrobial activity have a strong potency to act toward cancer cells. In my experience I tested several alpha-helical peptides which were solely antimicrobial. Thus I strongly suggest to moderate this conclusions part of the manuscript.
