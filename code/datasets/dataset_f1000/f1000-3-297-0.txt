This manuscript delivers a comprehensive, well-structured and interesting case study on Moya-Moya. The paper is nicely focused and compact, also providing a well-balanced discussion. Apart from agreeing on Dr. Campells comment, the only recommendation I have is to avoid repetitive text elements. Particularly, the first few sentences in the second paragraph of the case description are almost identical to the legend of Figure 2 and may therefore require rephrasing.
