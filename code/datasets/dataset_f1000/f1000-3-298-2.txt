The effect of the pH in the culture medium is a very important factor that often is not taken into account. This papers reports on the changes in the medium pH at several times during the tissue culture process and their effect on the explants growth. From this point of view the article is very interesting and deserves to be accepted for publication. Changes in the pH of the culture medium after and before autoclaving and during culture time have been studied in depth (see any of the editions of the book series Plant Propagation by Tissue Culture, George and Sherrington, Exegetics, London). The paper is well written and data well analyzed. I have found very interesting results as the effect of light on the medium pH during storage that can be of interest for plant tissue colleagues. Also, I have some questions to address to the authors. Why to use pH below 5?. Most of the culture media are adjusted to a pH from 5,7- to 6,0 before autoclaving. Did authors find any problems with low pH and agar gelification?. In our experience low pH affect media solidification. The effect of MES on medium pH stability is expected. From your data on Figures 3 and 5, I should not agree with your statement 21-day subculture practice may facilitate to sustain medium freshness, medium pH and desirable explant growth (Abstract). It is true that pH of the medium increased after 21 of explant culture initiation, but it is also true that irrespective of the medium pH, explants sharply increased weight after 21 days in culture. These results should be emphasized and conclusions rewritten.
