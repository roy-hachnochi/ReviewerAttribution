The article is well-written and I agree with many of Dr. Desai's points. The topic is highly relevant to the field of nephrology. A few comments/suggestions: For idea #1, it should be recognized that the critical care field will need to accept renal/critical care trainees into practice. If these combined-program trainees fail to find jobs, the combined program will eventual fail to attract trainees. #2 - Exiting the Match could be voluntary; also programs should be able to have some spots off-Match . #3 - Many programs already have NIH-sponsored T32 grants that allow for the support of a 3rd year of research. It is also common for programs to provide institutional support (non-NIH) for a 3rd year for interested candidates. Unfortunately, there is very little interest from prospective renal fellows even with these options available. Indeed, historically 3-year programs are now offering 2-year spots because of a lack of interest. Is there any data from NRMP to compare the success of 3-year vs. 2-year programs in terms of filling spots? The supply/demand imbalance may be inherent to nephrology itself, which I think Dr. Desai correctly identifies as a core issue in ideas #2/#4 and the Introduction.
