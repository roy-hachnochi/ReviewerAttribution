This paper describes an evaluation of the use of a selective enrichment method to detect Burkholderia pseudomallei in sputum samples in a provincial hospital in Cambodia. The additional yield compared with conventional cultures was relatively low (only one of 241 samples tested). The paper is well written and presents the results clearly. It would have been improved by the inclusion of an assessment of the additional costs of using selective culture. Clearly the benefits in this hospital are relatively small (although potentially life-saving for the one additional patient with melioidosis who was detected), but cannot be extrapolated to other areas because the distribution of melioidosis may be remarkably focal (for example in Thailand the incidence is very low in the central region but high in the northeast). It is also unclear why a selective enrichment technique was used as opposed to direct culture onto solid media, since enrichment culture was not shown significantly to increase the B. pseudomallei isolation rate from sputum compared with plating directly onto Ashdowns medium in a previous study ( Wuthiekanun et al. ,1990 ). It might also have been possible to have been more selective about the samples that were cultured and to have analysed patient characteristics in greater detail, although the majority of samples were thought to have been from patients suspected of having TB, a group in whom it has previously been suggested that testing for melioidosis (using a similar enrichment technique) might be warranted ( Suntornsut et al ., 2013 ). Although this is a relatively small scale study with relatively unremarkable results, it warrants being in the public domain. Laboratories in melioidosis-endemic areas should still be encouraged to consider looking for B. pseudomallei in appropriate samples and should conduct their own assessment of the costs and benefits of doing so based on local epidemiology.
