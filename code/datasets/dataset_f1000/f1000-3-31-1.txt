This case report serves to remind us of a rare but potentially devastating complication of chronic pancreatitis, and one that unfortunately does not respond well to endoscopic management. Given the comorbities, this patient was not appropriate for surgical management. The authors also discuss the role of octreotide in the management of pancreatic fistulae. It would be interesting to know whether octreotide was used in conjunction with pancreatic duct stenting in this case. Given the drainage volume, I suspect it would have been of little benefit if used.
