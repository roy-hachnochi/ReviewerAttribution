Article was very good and provided the needed technical and biological information to describe the problem and solutions. However, it was unclear to me why GPS could not be used, since it does not require the need for cellular service with most devices. Also why was the data not stored on the smartphone and then uploaded to a web server when internet access was available? This would allow for data from multiple users to be combined and could be outputted to Excel without the creation of another desktop application. There may be good reasons for why both of these solutions were not considered but I didnt feel they were addressed as part of the article.
