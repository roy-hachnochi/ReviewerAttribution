This is an interesting and relevant study on a topic that is, increasingly, recognized as important. The authors restrict their discussion to Life Sciences, in particular marine ecology whilst this study is potentially of wider interest to the scientific community. The authors may find some of the included references helpful in expanding their argument. Assuming this paper is interesting to a wider community rather than restricted to specialist marine ecologists; it would be helpful to give a brief definition of Bayesian belief networks. Methods Please give the HE qualification/s participants were working towards to facilitate comparison with other studies. Predictive model/Belief network This text would benefit from clarification as it is rather difficult to follow for non-specialists. Might a diagram or flow chart help? Sentence 3: should be Survey It would be conventional to insert the rubric once at the top of the questionnaire rather than repeating it in every question. Respondents might be discouraged by this additional burden. Results Developing new approaches to teaching are always difficult as teaching is constrained by practicalities such as timetabling. It would be interesting if it were practically possible to compare outcomes after switching the field-work element with the simulation. It would be easier for the reader if the responses to the survey were summarized and presented graphically. Remove the link to Supplementary file 4 0c718f4f-6cb7-4030-823c-94f3687abe47.docx from the legend Dataset 2 to avoid confusion. Discussion Again, the discussion might usefully be expanded to include a wider range of subject fields, perhaps including evidence supporting the role of simulations in generating understanding. The authors might wish to comment on the difference between the ability to carry out a calculation and the skills needed to interpret data. References 1.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions A useful contribution to strategies aimed at helping life sciences undergraduates appreciate the importance of quantitative skills, develop their own quantitative skills and (hopefully) become less anxious about mathematics and statistics within the first few weeks of their transition onto a higher education programme. Introduction 2 nd paragraph: Suggest changing to in ecology can be better learned/developed if they are taught in a subject context Also .. and few have the confidence to apply 3 rd paragraph: A simple diagram might help readers understand Bayesian belief networks in an ecological context. 4 th paragraph: .. the aim of this study was to determine .. seen as an extra, and unnecessary complexity .. we combined a field visit to a rocky shore with an afternoon using . Methods 1 st paragraph: The students were based in a college normally specialising in further education (pre-18 years old), but offering some higher education courses. Predictive model/Belief network: requires more clarification for non-specialists. It might also help if the three individual worksheets in Supplementary File 2 were numbered (and referred to by these numbers in the text) and each worksheet contained more explanation so that the reader wasnt trying to move back and forth between the manuscript and the Excel worksheets. Also in sentence 3 should be . Marine management scenario: 4 th sentence Students were asked to complete should be . Student evaluation of learning: the rubric in the questionnaire should have been presented only once at the beginning its repetition before each question is tedious (to say the least) to students and readers of this article alike. Results Figure 1: the horizontal axis needs to be labelled as The two references in the text to tropic cascade should be trophic cascade The authors state that Student evaluations showed that students felt they had learned significant amounts about each topic , students (working in pairs) all produced sensible interaction links in the model, and [they produced] working belief network simulations which accurately predicted real results from previously conducted experiments, but did the authors use any other means to assess each individual students quantitative skills (e.g. their understanding of probability) and knowledge of rocky shore ecology (e.g. species interactions, marine management)? the students, particularly when working in pairs, may have over-estimated the extent of their learning, in which case their self-evaluation of their knowledge and competence may not have matched their actual knowledge and competence? The authors may have needed to do more than [quantify] the success of the technique . through examining the solutions [the pairs of students] provided to problems requiring the use of predictive networks. (final sentence of the Introduction). Discussion 2 nd paragraph, final sentence: However, embedding more quantitative elements regularly in courses to enhance The discussion would benefit from the authors addressing the points raised by Vivien Sieber.
