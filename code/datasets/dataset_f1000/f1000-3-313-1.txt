I wholeheartedly support novel approaches to publishing, especially those run by scientists for scientists and free of commercial interests. Even though I believe a news article would be a better place for PRN to advertise itself, I am happy to review this paper as a "Software Tool Article". I believe addressing the following issues will make the manuscript better: Discussion of "peer review" is very confusing. Putting the term in inverted quotes does not improve readers understanding. In one paragraph you write "As a preprint service, PRN has no peer review process and no editing service." just to follow by "Articles at PRN will be peer viewed by interested readers and also by consultants." There is a lot of future tense used in the paper. This combined with no signs or examples of the platform being used gives the impression that you are describing features you plan to implement rather than existing and mature software solution. It would be good to show how does this service compare to using other existing preprint servers combined with peer review platforms such as Publons or PubPeer. Could anyone review a preprint using your platform? Will the review be public and signed or anonymous? Are the preprints indexed by Google Scholar (in contrast to just Google Web)? I could not find a link to the code of your platform (this is a formal F1000Research requirement).
