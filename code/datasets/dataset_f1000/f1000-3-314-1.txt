This is a timely report on large nested variant of urothelial carcinoma. It may pose a diagnostic confusion since histological appearance may resemble more indolent forms of the disease although it certainly has a high invasive potential and may be associated with metastatic disease. Therefore, the pathologists must be aware of this variant when they evaluate surgical specimens and urologists must discuss with their pathologists the possibility of the presence of such a variant when they receive a report indicating low grade disease yet the clinical presentation is not compatible.
