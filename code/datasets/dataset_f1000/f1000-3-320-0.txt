It is interesting to read the article Parallel DNA polymerse chain reaction: Synthesis of two different PCR products from a DNA template by Bhardwaj and Sharma. The authors for the first time have demonstrated that primers can anneal in parallel orientation and can be extended in a PCR reaction. They have used state of the art technique real time PCR to demonstrate this along with the conventional agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing reaction. Definitely, this opens up many possibilities in the field of molecular biology. The research is well designed and presented in a clear and comprehensible way. The introduction section gives a very nice insight. However, I suggest following minor changes to improve the manuscript. Figure 3- Numbering should be done on the loading wells. Figure 5- Sequencing results should be presented in such a way that one can easily compare the APS and PS sequences easily. For example they can put a arrow mark from where to compare. Figure 6- It is difficult to read the abscissa and ordinate scale and naming. Increasing the font will help. Line 11- d(A)6d.(T)6 should be explained or is it dA 6 dT 6 ? In the RT PCR section the term Ct value should be explained so that a non-expert reader can benefit. There are some typos errors scattered in the manuscript. Such as 50l should be 50 L.
