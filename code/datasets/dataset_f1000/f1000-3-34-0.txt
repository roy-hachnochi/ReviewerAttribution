This is an interesting study on the role of tree genotypes on herbivorous insect attack of willow trees, Betula pendula, using a common garden approach in Finland. Twenty-two trees were randomly selected and cloned, although no details are given as to how the trees were cloned. Each tree is considered to be a different genotype. Six blocks with 4 saplings of each genotype were used from which one sapling was randomly selected to give 6 replicates per genotype for the study of insect attack. Insect sampling was done largely based on the damage done over the summer. I am surprised that it is possible to distinguish insects based on their damage as I would have guessed that the damage from leaf miners would have been similar, and damage from sucking insects difficult to find at all. I have the following questions and comments: What is meant by structure of the insect community? This term is used in the abstract and throughout the paper but it is not defined. The term local environmental variation is mentioned, and it would be clearer if this was referred to as variation among blocks. Insects were removed from some saplings but details are lacking on how this was done, how frequently it was done, and how effective it was. “Additional Kuikanniitty 2003 data combined with Kuikanniitty 2003 raw data was used” I don’t understand what this means. How would these results be interpreted by one who wanted to select for herbivore resistance among tree genotypes? Is the amount and consistency of the among genotype resistance sufficient to evolve over time? How are the results influenced by variation in insect abundance from year to year?
