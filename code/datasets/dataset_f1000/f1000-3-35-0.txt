This is a very well-written and informative case report that highlights a potential complication that can occur in an apparently benign disorder. Functional abdominal pain is one of the most common disorders evaluated by gastroenterologists. To my knowledge, this is the first report to suggest that vitamin deficiencies should be checked in patients with functional abdominal pain that present with malnutrition and diarrhea along with unexplained clinical findings, such as a rash.
