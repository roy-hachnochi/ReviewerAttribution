This is an interesting case report that demonstrated the appearance of undetectable vitamin A and C levels in the setting of dermatologic evidence of niacin deficiency (pellagra) and vitamin C (scurvy) that developed in an individual with severe gastrointestinal symptoms but without weight loss presumed secondary to a functional disorder. That severe dietary deficiencies could develop over the period of years from a disturbed diet is likely, and the laboratory evidence for deficiency is not refutable for vitamins A and C. However it would be interesting to know whether there was biochemical evidence for niacin deficiency and whether the presumed pellagrous skin lesions responded to vitamin supplementation, since the routine B vitamin fortification of grain products in developed countries would make this somewhat less likely. Although the authors state that red meat was tolerated to some extent, it is not likely that it would be a substantial component of the diet, since meat is a good source of essential nutrients. The publication of this report is important to remind us that nutritional deficiencies can develop under such conditions.
