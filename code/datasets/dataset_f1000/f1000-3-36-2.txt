This paper provides a review of the Bajorath group's recent work on matched molecular pairs (MMP), a technique for exploring structure activity relationships, and identifying chemical transformations that can readily modulate biological activity. The authors focus on recent applications of MMP to large datasets from the publicly accessible ChEMBL database. The paper provides an excellent introduction to those unfamiliar with the MMP technique and with concepts such as activity cliffs. In addition to providing an overview of the recent literature, the authors also provide links to publicly available software and datasets that will provide tutorial materials for those interested in learning more about these powerful techniques. Datasets and software like those described in this paper are valuable resources. A logical next step from this work would be to create interactive tutorials using tools like the iPython Notebook Viewer or knitr . The presentation is clear, but a few changes may help readers unfamiliar with some of the concepts. On p2 the authors refer to " second generation MMPs ". It would be useful to add a sentence explaining the differences between first and second generation MMPs. MMP Cliffs which differ in activity by 10-fold may also be interesting. It would be informative to see the number of examples available with a 1 log vs 2 log difference. In the section (3) on page 3, it would be interesting to provide a specific example of how the results of RECAP generated MMPS differ from those generated using a more "traditional" approach. This paper provides an excellent gateway to a topic that is becoming increasingly more important in drug discovery. The paper should be of interest to computational and medicinal chemists as well as biologists.
