The matched molecule pairs approach provides a “chemistry friendly” and intuitive way of expressing relationships among molecules and therefore this manuscript is of importance to all cheminformatics scientists interested in the study of activity cliffs, SAR analysis and in the design of bioactive molecules in general. The authors extracted several datasets of matched molecule pairs from public databases that could be used as benchmarks in further analysis of this phenomenon. Care has been taken to assure a high quality of data. The manuscript is well written and the procedure and all results are sufficiently documented and, in addition, all datasets are available for download; therefore I am suggesting only a few minor modifications to the text: Introduction: replace " the latest release of the ChEMBL " with the version number. Provide a bit more technical information about the in-house implementation of a molecule fragmentation procedure used to generated matched pairs. Was the procedure implemented entirely in-house, or is it based on a publicly available cheminformatics toolkit? (If this is the case, please cite the respective toolkit). The authors mention that structures in the download file are available as canonical SMILES. The form of canonical SMILES however will depend on the particular program used to generate it. Please specify whether the original ChEMBL SMILES is included or the canonical SMILES was created by another toolkit
