This opinion piece by Ley is interesting and well-timed. Thus, the topic of peripheral T cell activation and differentiation is well-trodden ground at this point, but discussions of these events often stop at the border of the lymph node, where priming occurs. Here, Ley discusses the accumulating evidence that activated T cells require additional signals after their arrival in peripheral non-lymphoid tissues, in order to become fully differentiated. This is a topic that has received much less attention, and warrants further attention from T cell biologists. I have three major suggestions for revision of the piece as it stands now: The author dedicates approximately one-third of the article at the beginning to reviewing various aspects of T cell priming in lymph nodes. In my opinion, this runs the risk of losing the readers interest, before reaching the more interesting discussion of the second touch hypothesis. I would suggest significantly trimming this part of the article, since it has been so thoroughly reviewed elsewhere. In addition, the author could circle back to this after the more novel discussions of peripheral differentiation. It would also be helpful to hear more about previous studies on TNF/TNFr family members and T cell differentiation, in the last section of the article (there should be more space if the first part is shortened, as suggested above). Finally, I found the Table listing TNF/TNFr family members somewhat confusing. Does the heading T cell at the top refer to constitutive expression on T cells ? The headings should be clarified or perhaps additional columns could be used for listing expression patterns. Other, more minor, comments: Page 6, second column CD28 is misspelled as . A few sentences could use additional editing to make them easier to read (e.g. page 6, first column has two such sentences).
