This opinion articles provides a hypothesis that T cells are only weakly activated in lymphoid organs but required a "second touch" in inflamed tissues to stabilize their differentiation program into different T effector cell subsets. The article is well written but would benefit from removing redundant information regarding the different T cell subsets and M1/M2 macrophages which are given at several places in the manuscript. Further, most published data indicate that M1/M2 macrophages are induced by Th1/Th2 cells rather than M1/M2 polarization being regulated by Th1/Th2 cells. The notion that basophils induce Th2 cells should be removed as recent reports do not support this finding.
