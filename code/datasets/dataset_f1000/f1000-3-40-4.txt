This commentary describes a general approach for using CNS-active drugs as leads for non-CNS targets. As physicochemical properties for CNS-active drugs are more restrictive than for non-CNS drugs, it would appear that the CNS-active drugs could serve as a good leads. It is a well-written commentary discussing general approaches to modify properties of these lead molecules. The approach is also exemplified by use of fluoxetine as a lead and some suggested modifications of it. One main problem with this approach is the challenge of removing or minimizing CNS activity of these leads for non-CNS targets since the activity on CNS will lead to side effects. It would be useful to include a table comparing desired value ranges for different physicochemical properties (molecular weight, log D, polar surface area, hydrogen bond donor) for CNS and non-CNS drugs. I am not aware if this approach has been used in the medicinal chemistry literature. But if such reports exist, it would be good to include those references in the commentary.
