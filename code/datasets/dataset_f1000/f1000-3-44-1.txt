This short article describes a component (PsicquicGraph) within the larger javascript library (BioJS) that assists the visualisation of molecular interactions on web pages. The component effectively provides the glue to stick the following pieces of technology together: - Cytoscape.js (a powerful tool for viewing networks on web pages) - MILQ (a language for querying molecular interactions) - BioJS (an event-driven javascript library which facilitates interaction between javascript widgets) The component described in this article is already useful - mainly in that it provides a standard way of interacting with these existing modules and provides a single point of focus for future development. However there are some obvious developments the authors should make in a following version of the article that would make the component more useful: Registering events (such as when a user selects a "node" or "edge"). Providing access to the underlying "cytoscape" javascript instance (to allow manipulation of the network after it has been created).
