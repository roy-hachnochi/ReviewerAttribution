There are currently only a few approaches available for visualising protein features on the web. The BioJS FeatureViewer is a welcome addition to the set of tools available to web developers. The fact that it is available as a BioJS component should make it interesting as a re-usable web site element. However, I find that some of the already existing approaches provide a representation of features that I (subjectively) find graphically more refined and that go beyond simple boxes, circles, and triangles to represent sequence annotations. Minor modifications: I feel that the current version of this manuscript does not adequately summarise the already available approaches for visualising protein features. To list a few already available protein feature viewers: - Pfam (is already being mentioned in the manuscript), shows the location of Pfam domains on protein sequences. It has currently one of the graphically most appealing views and can show more than one sequence per page (e.g. http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family/Piwi#tabview=tab1 ) - PDBsum provides a graphical summary of secondary structure and pfam domains for protein sequences (e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbsum/1cdg and in large: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=1cdgnres=150 ) - DASty has been developed for several years at the EBI (in fact there seems to be some shared co-authorship) and provides a feature view that is based on DAS and can also map annotations to 3D (e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/dasty/client/index.html?q=P05067 ) - RCSB Protein Feature View : shows an SVG image for a full-length protein sequence from UniProt and how it corresponds to PDB entries. It loads annotations from external databases (e.g. http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/protein/P43379 ) and is available as open source from https://github.com/rcsb/proteinfeatureview - RCSB Sequence Page : can show the relationship between UniProt and PDB coordinates on a per-residue level. Also can map annotations to 3D ( e.g. http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/remediatedSequence.do?structureId=1CDG ).
