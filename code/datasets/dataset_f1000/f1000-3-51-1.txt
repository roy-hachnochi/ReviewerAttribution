The work is an interesting and well written article and reports a resource that should be of interest to numerous developers. The comments below are intended to help make the work more accessible to others: It would be useful to define what some of the graph terms mean such as acyclic/cycles for those who are not familiar with the terminology. Similarly, some background information about the InterMine web services would be useful. How does one reproduce the examples in Figures 2 and 3? Where do the graph size numbers 200-500 nodes for modern browsers come from? Maybe the authors could qualify which with browser, system RAM and which JavaScript API the numbers are for (presumably D3). I would also disagree with statement that ‘ networks of greater information densities are very difficult for humans to interpret when rendered ’. See our tool BioLayout Express3D . How do I run the examples at http://zenodo.org/record/8303 ? It might be useful to host the examples somewhere that we can just click and run the demo? ( jsFiddle is a great place to host JavaScript examples). There are a few typos - paragraph 7 of the 'Current methods and implementations' section "Scaled Vector Graphics (SVG)" should read Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). In paragraph 3 of the 'Features' section should "mousehover" read mouseover? In the same paragraph the phrase "the graph can been zoomed" should read the graph can be zoomed.
