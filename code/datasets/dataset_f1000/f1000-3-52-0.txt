Here, the authors present Sequence , a web-based visualization component for biological sequence data implemented in JavaScript. Investigators can use Sequence to visualize both DNA and protein sequences, either as a standalone visualization or together with other visualizations. Strengths of Sequence include (a) the ability to customize sequence using options and (b) integration of sequence via events. These features ensure that Sequence can be used in a wide variety of applications. What is missing from this manuscript is a description of how well Sequence scales to large sequences and whether a Sequence visualization can be updated dynamically in response to events from other components. Overall , Sequence is a solid contribution to web-based visualization that is useful as it is and forms the foundation for more complex web-based sequence visualization in the future.
