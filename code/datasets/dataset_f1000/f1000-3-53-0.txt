This manuscript decribed a useful BioJS component for visualizing genomic tracks from a wig-formatted file. There are some major concerns raised by the reviewer: Demo code show “Unknown format detected” error. When clicking the demo code from the provided links to JSBin, Codepen and Plunker, all three have the same errors. This is also confirmed the same by running the demo code locally. But it can be fixed by changing the dataSet to: dataSet: "./wigExplorerDataSet5.txt" (was dataSet: "https://cdn.rawgit.com/anilthanki/biojs-vis-wigexplorer/master/snippets/data/wigExplorerDataSet5.txt") Even thought, there still are some javascript errors displayed on the browser console (using Google Chrome 54) as described below. The website http://biojs.io/d/biojs-vis-wigexplorer shows two javascript errors, even though the rendering of the widget looks fine. I confirmed that these errors are from the wigexplorer itself, as I can see the same errors in the console by running the demo code locally. This is the screenshot of the javascript errors: http://imgur.com/a/sfWkK After several previous reviewers requested the actual code example for integrating WigExplorer into third-party applications like TGAC browser, you still did not provide much details of it. The styling of the tracks in TGAC Browser screenshot does not look similar to the demo example, which does raise the concerns about how the integration was actually done in a real application, and how flexible a developer can control the look and feel of the application. A real code example should address those concerns. I also tried the demo code locally with two example wig files downloaded from NCI website : WashU (74MB) and Baylor (79MB). The WashU example file does load, but the track rendering is very slow, and the track control buttons (like zoom and move) are pretty much unusable. The Baylor example file does not load, also without any error message. These two files could be out of the file size range for reasonable rendering in this widget, a proper error msg should be displayed ideally. A minor suggestion, although the project website is provided under "Software availability" section, it would be helpful to provide the direct links to the demo code at the relevant text.
