I am no JavaScript developer myself and I have not tested the described functionality, but I already can think of applications in my own work if the package is able to not only show predefined chromosomes in a wig file, but subsets in a chromosome too. I will state all my issues like this first major one: The link to your real example page (http://biojs.io/d/biojs-vis-wigexplorer) can only be found by reading your article, following to the rather unspecific GitHub link to the http://biojs.io web page. There one need to search for your wigexplorer - that is not acceptable! Make this link more prominent in the article and refer to the GitHub page as the main biojs.io GitHub page. I can not approve this article, if your package can not display any user defined region in a wig file. After having checked the functionality on the hidden demo page I get the impression that this javascript package does ONLY visualize whole chromosomes from a wig file. The user can not change the visualized region by e.g. interactively zooming in or at least stating a displayed area in the javascript function call? But if your package can visualize a user defined area in a wig file this functionality needs to be highlighted in the article. In addition I have several minor 'complains': Can the package be used stand alone? If yes, please extend your code example to a minimal, working html page. It would be perfect to have the javascript library loaded from your own web server together with the example data. Much like on the hidden demo page, but as plain html plainly stated in the article. You claim that your tool easily integrats into the third party TGAC Browser. Can you provide the example html there, too? I hope I could add some additional points of view to your work and give a kind of positive feedback.
