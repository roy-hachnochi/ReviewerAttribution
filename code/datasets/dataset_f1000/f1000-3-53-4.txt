The manuscript is well written, but it does not accurately describe the software in question. I installed the software on my machine, and evaluated its behavior under several scenarios that I think would be commonly encountered by people using it. The major issues I found with the software are: wigExplorer does not provide any useful error messages when it fails to fetch, or fails to parse, the file specified in its `dataSet` option. This can be a major issue for prospective users (i.e. installers) of the software. Also, when I installed it and ran it via the included TestwigExplorer2.html, the "top controls ... designed to scroll sideways" described in the manuscript were not shown. To rule out any problems with the way I installed it (caused by missing stylesheets or the like), I inspected the browser's (Google Chrome 32) document object model (DOM) using its built-in development tools, and verified that the controls were not even being placed in the DOM by the code itself. I didn't debug any further. Most importantly, and I think this is a show stopper: wigExplorer does not actually support the Wiggle format as set forth by UCSC at http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html . It supports a limited tab-separated value format, which bears some resemblance to BedGraph format, but is not BedGraph either. So: it is named for a standard data format that it does not support, and the data format that it actually supports is not a standard format. Unfortunately, I cannot approve this manuscript as it is currently written. It does not accurately describe the wigExplorer software.
