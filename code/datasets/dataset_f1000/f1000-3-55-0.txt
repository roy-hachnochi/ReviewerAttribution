Visualization is one of the bottlenecks we are facing in modern biology. With bigger and bigger data sets originating from various heterogeneous sources that span several concepts, dimensions and timelines, it is becoming an art to condense the wealth of information into good and easy ways to capture visual pictures. For non-expert users it can be quite a challenge to come up with a "publication ready" visualization of complex relationships. The BioJS community tries to tackle this challenge by employing an open modular architecture, which allows a broad audience to use and further develop the components in the registry. The community already provides a wide spectrum of available components and it will be very interesting to see the future development of this open source community.
