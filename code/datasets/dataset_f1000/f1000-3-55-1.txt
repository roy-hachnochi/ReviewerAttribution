I am supportive of the BioJS registry with regards to the technology used and its principles. To give you a flavour of what I will be looking for, from an NIH perspective, is really how much the components are used and why. What findings have resulted in their use? If there is non-use of components and why etc. In short, I will be looking more at the degree of software projects that are making a difference to the scientific community. That said, I very much look forward to seeing how the BioJS community develops.
