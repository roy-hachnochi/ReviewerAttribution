This is an interesting retrospective study where the authors review the effectiveness of ceftriaxone dosing for patients with SBP. I like the article and the principles behind the analysis. Major points: The aim of the study should be better explained - what did the authors set out to study? Cure, outcomes, prognosis? The title should reflect the retrospective nature of the analysis. Were any patients on antibiotic prophylaxis (i.e norfloxacion or cipro) prior to the dx of SBP or other bacterial infections? There is a trend of differences in mortality. Why is this so - do the authors have the causes of death in both groups? The authors message should be that there seems to be a difference and that this analysis paves the way for future randomized studies that take local microbiological data from each institution into account.
