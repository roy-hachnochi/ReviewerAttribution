This is an interesting retrospective study but I have the following comments: The title is appropriate. I think that the abstract provides an adequate summary but the conclusions may need to be changed. The first sentence is a recommendation and the differences in one-year survival are difficult to explain purely on the basis of 7 days of antibiotic therapy. In the method section the clinical endpoints that the authors are going to study should be explained and the following should be added: in-hospital mortality, infection cure rate, bacterial resistance and super-infections. Ascitic culture method should also be detailed. What are the reasons for different mortality rates at one-year in both groups? This point is crucial and must be discussed in the discussion. Lastly, I think that the study shows no differences in hospital mortality rate, infection control rate, renal failure, or hepatorenal syndrome between both groups and this should be pointed out in the conclusions.
