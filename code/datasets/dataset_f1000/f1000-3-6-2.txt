The paper describes the DataUp Excel-based metadata and data capturing tool developed as part of the DataONE project. I like the paper and I like the tool. The paper is well written. The need for spreadsheet-based data management tools is critical, and DataUp makes a valuable contribution. The tool works, the software is available, is being used, and is useful. The survey results and the requirements are a very useful guide for other workers using spreadsheets as a prime mechanism for data upload. The survey is well conducted given the constraints of such things, and it is refreshing to see that the people who do the data management (postdocs, postgrads) were targeted. This is a very useful contribution to the field. There are, however, some improvements that I would like to see in the final article: The metadata model seems to be very high level (Table 3). Is there a richer metadata model for specific data types? Is it possible to upload and index/search on more domain specific metadata captured in the DataUp model? To what extent does the metadata model work for all the data types you mention? As your user base is wide one would expect heterogeneity to be a big problem. How are controlled vocabularies and or specific domain metadata models incorporated? The architecture figure 7 is a very general figure and can be replaced by something that showed the protocol of how DataUp is used in practice. Are Excel templates prepared by the DataUp team or through the Plug-in? There is sparse information on uptake or the impact of uptake. The number of downloads are listed but not how many datasets were uploaded to the repository using DataUp. Despite the excellent requirements survey and user engagement, there is no evaluation of DataUps use. What is the difference in uptake between the Excel and web-based version? There is no related work section. The only related work is RightField (reference17) but what RightField does and how it relates to DataUp is not mentioned. Similar tools to DataUp such as ISAtool Suite and Ontomaton are not mentioned. The survey appears USA-centric. EZID is only available in the USA. DataUp currently works with DataONEShare. Can and how DataUp be adapted for use in other repositories? Can it reuse infrastructure that is not US based? Very minor comments: There are two typos: sheet,s - sheets highprofile - high profile
