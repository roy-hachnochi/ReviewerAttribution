The paper confirms the very recent work of Deng et al. (2014) reporting a fluorometabolite biosynthetic gene cluster in the genome of Nocardia brasiliensis, the expression of a codon-optimised fluorinase gene (nobA) in E. coli, and the in vitro assay of fluorination/chlorination activity with SAM and fluoride/chloride. Overall the paper is well written, the experimental approach is appropriate, with the exception of the kinetic assays as described by Changsheng Zhang , and the conclusions justified. The kinetics of both the enzymes investigated differ somewhat from those reported by Deng et al., and the authors should account for these differences, particularly in the K m values for SAM.
