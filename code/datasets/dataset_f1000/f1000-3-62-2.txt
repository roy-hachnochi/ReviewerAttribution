This is an insightful and well-written commentary on a timely topic. The article documents the past and present practices of Software Carpentry - a project for teaching scientists about computing - and reflects on the project's successes and failures. In doing so, it provides concrete examples of the teaching practices used as well as those discarded. Moreover, the article helps the reader to understand how teaching scientists to about computing is different from teaching computer science majors - a matter that is central to the efforts of Software Carpentry and to the interests of the growing numbers of scientists who need computing skill to work efficiently. The commentary is well grounded in evidence from the research literature as well as the author's lengthy experience with the project. The achievements and challenges of Software Carpentry are discussed realistically and critically. Additional comment : There is only so much you can learn in two days (the length of Software Carpentry's current workshops), and whatever you learn in that time is unlikely by itself to change your research practices dramatically. What would be interesting to know in the future is whether and how the workshop participants go about building their computing skills after attending a workshop.
