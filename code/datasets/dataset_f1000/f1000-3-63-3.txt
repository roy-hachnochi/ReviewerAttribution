The title and abstract are appropriate. Overall, the methods, results, and conclusions appear to be sound. The study contributes to our evolving understanding of the central nervous system consequences of hearing loss. The results also temper the general hypothesis that loss of peripheral hearing sensitivity leads to a loss of inhibition. Unfortunately, the actual story may be more complex than that. Specific Comments: There is a typographical error in the methods paragraph describing gene expression analysis (missing parenthesis). Hearing threshold data are displayed as dB loss. This is okay, but I prefer to see hearing threshold levels simply plotted as dB SPL. Elevations (loss) can then be interpreted by the reader. It is surprising that GABA indictors were elevated in the trauma animals, while glutamatergic indicators were not. But that is why research is done. It would have been informative to look at longer-term consequences of the trauma as well, and perhaps those experiments are in progress.
