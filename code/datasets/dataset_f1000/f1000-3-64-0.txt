 Strain is a novel method for objective quantification of systolic function using 2-D echocardiography 1 , 2 , 3D-Echocardiography 3 - 5 or MRI 6 - 9 . Cardiac MRI (cMRI) is usually considered the reference standard for measurement of myocardial strain 9 , 10 . The most common cMRI method, termed tagged cMRI, allows full 3D assessment of regional strain. However, due to its complexity and lengthy times for analysis, tagged cMRI is not usually used outside of academic centers. Tagged cMRI is also primarily used only in research studies 9 . Strain echocardiography (StE) promises to be a new tool for quantitative assessment of cardiac function. Clinical application in daily routine has begun at the moment 2 . Analysis of intra- and interobserver reliability is an important aspect in the process of developing these novel techniques from theory to the implementation into daily routine diagnostics 11 , 12 . This is also true for MRI. A reproducibility study should be done in this study/report. I miss the definition of a concrete aim of the study and clinical conclusions. I think in the application to the ethics committee the aim of the study and the number of patients have to be mentioned. I miss a statistical analysis. Does the study have a descriptive character? All findings can be open discussed, but they should be discussed and so I am missing an open, positive-negative, hypothetical and critical discussion about MRI-strain. This study is in principle well conducted and promising, but can be only after some changes. It is an interesting idea that the segmental split/deviation of the strain values discredit this method for clinical use. Otherwise medicine works with (e.g. colour doppler findings). Is this what the author wants to tell us? Generally there is a need for critical discussion regarding the decision-making process in individual patient and specific diagnosis or the diagnostic consequences. I believe that it is important issue to discuss controversial findings and to analyze the clinical relevance of novel methods. I am sure, regarding the strain measurements, that there are a lot of open questions. We have to be aware of all possible pitfalls and ambiguities concerning strain-technology with the knowledge of asynchronicity, poor echo-window pitfalls (echocardiography), and reproducibility problems. The author has to increase the number of patients (a minimum of 30 participants with DCM and 20 healthy participants) and there is a need for statistical comparison. 20 Patients with preserved function and without left bundle branch block would be very important too. The author should compare the research tool MRI with 2D Strain- or 3D Strain-echocardiography. We have to learn more about the comparability of MRI-Strain values and echocardiography values. In the results section the times of the investigation of the single patients and the time for the analysis must be specified (for MRI and for Echocardiography). The number of-non-examined segments in both techniques should be examined/counted. There is a need for a comparison of strain values measured by MRI and echocardiography. Author have to improve the discussion of the clinical importance of strain measured by MRI, in comparison to echocardiography (when MRI and when echocardiography?) and should discuss advantages and disadvantages. The error/problems of MRI and the applicability in daily routine and the costs have to be discussed. An inter-observer reproducibility of the analysis should be carried out (if possible, in comparison to echocardiography). The impact of left bundle brunch block on the results of strain values in comparison to normal synchronisation should be discussed (for example Sonne et al ., 2009 13 ). The final message should be emphasized. Is MRI-Strain not ready for use in clinical routine? Is the error/deviation of the values so big, that a diagnosis is not possible? The or width range of segmental strain-values are known (the relevance of these mechanism for human health is still unclear), otherwise the clinical use of global strain and averaged values is accepted.
