This is a very well-written, interesting article on utilizing highly-polymorphic SNPs to identify cryptic substructure in a population of eastern coyotes. The analyses are comprehensive (including Bayesian cluster analysis, principal components analysis, and Fst calculations) and the data do seem to support fine-scale population substructure. If it werent for the extensive analyses I would find it very difficult to believe that 16 SNPs (even highly polymorphic ones) could find such fine-scale structure because it has been estimated that it take at least 15x more SNPs than microsatellites to identify structure in populations ( Haasl Payseur 2011, Heredity ). Presumably the same clustering patterns would remain if the samples were analyzed at thousands of genome-wide SNPs that have not been selected for their polymorphism - i.e. presumably more, less polymorphic loci should show the same substructure. The biological/ecological reason for the clustering remains unclear (but that is clearly beyond the scope of the paper and is really quite difficult to tease apart). The author provides plausible explanations for the structure (e.g. " merging of the two colonization fronts "; possible deer or human density patters), but I wonder if social structure (i.e. family/pack groups) may contribute to the genetic patterns found. Overall, the manuscript reads very well and provides a rigorous analysis of a novel dataset that complements the authors other work.
