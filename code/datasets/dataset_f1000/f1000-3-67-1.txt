The authors set out to use molecular dynamics simulations to the binding of a required magnesium ion on Ribonuclease H1, utilizing a number of distinct structures including those crystallized in different conditions or forms (Apo or different types of Holo forms) and orthologs. The main result found by the authors is that the binding site is very rigid and pre-organized in the presence of a single magnesium ion. The authors show that this observation holds for all orthologs studied. Based on this, the authors suggest that the active site dynamics are only subtly modulated by amino acid sequence and are primarily imposed by the characteristic protein fold. It is indeed interesting that most RNases not only conserve the structure of the binding site but also dynamic properties in the ns-ps range. However, I feel that showing a multiple sequence alignment of the RNase H family highlighting the members used in this study as well as the positions that constitute the substrate and metal binding sites would considerably help understand that indeed this pre-organization comes about despite divergent binding-site sequences. Without seeing such an alignment is hard to accept that the rigidity of the binding-site is not affected by changes in binding-site sequence. If the binding-site sequences turn out to be highly conserved upon analysis of the multiple sequence alignment, it may be necessary to perform mutations in silico in the binding-site to support the conclusion above.
