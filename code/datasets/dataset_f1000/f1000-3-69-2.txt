Hu and Bajorath offer an update to their resource for computational chemistry. The curated data, and its engineered availability, will be of great interest, especially to methods developers. Even those researchers that are interested in exploring larger data sets that illuminate issues such as activity cliffs and small-molecule structural motifs will find the resource of interest.
