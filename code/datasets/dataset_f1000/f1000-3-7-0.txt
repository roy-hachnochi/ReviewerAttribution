 The article Epiphyte response to drought and experimental warming in an Andean cloud forest has been strongly improved in both form and content since the previous version. I still have some minor suggestions for improvements. Introduction : Paragraph 1: To be simpler and clearer, I think biodiversity hotspots is better than hotspots of biological diversity. Paragraph 4: In your abstract, you mentioned Effects differed among species, but effects were generally stronger and more negative for epiphytes in mats transplanted downslope from the highest elevation, into warmer and drier conditions, than for epiphyte mats transplanted from other elevations. In contrast, epiphytes from lower elevations showed greater resistance to drought in all treatments . as one of your main results. So, I think Do epiphytes growing at lower elevations (drier, warmer condition) have greater drought tolerance than epiphytes growing at higher elevations is among the most important question addressed in your study, which should be highlighted in your aims. Discussion: Paragraph 2: I do not totally agree that Stronger effects would be expected for an experiment carried out over multiple years, since plants often react to stressful conditions through physiological responses such as closing stomata, which lowers carbon acquisition. because plants may also acclimate to new habitat over multiple years.
