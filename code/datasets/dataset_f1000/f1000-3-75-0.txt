The twin concepts of molecular matched pair (MMP) analysis and activity cliffs have been widely embraced by medicinal chemists in recent years as a means to explore and understand complex SAR landscapes. The contributions of the Bajorath group have been pivotal to the acceptance of these approaches. Activity cliffs are large changes in a biological activity arising from modest structural differences. In this study size restrictions are imposed on the activity cliff/MMP partners to ensure that structural changes are relatively small. Therefore it might be expected that the activity cliff trends based upon ligand efficiency would mirror those from activity alone. Still it is reassuring that this paper confirms that activity cliffs are indeed associated with large benefits in terms of ligand efficiency. The more interesting observation is that activity cliffs are also associated with significant improvements in lipophilic ligand efficiency (LLE or LipE) since this is less intuitive based on the selection criteria used for the MMP analysis. Therefore this latest study adds real weight to the argument that MMPs and activity cliffs can be very useful concepts within hit and lead optimisation projects.
