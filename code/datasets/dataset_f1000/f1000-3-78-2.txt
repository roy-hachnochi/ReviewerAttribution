This short publication presents clear results and is well written. I have one comment. The conclusive sentence seems redundant, and may need rephrasing or some additional explanation if the authors want to maintain it. In addition, these data add to a growing body of evidence indicating that multi-specific spawning synchrony is a feature of all speciose coral assemblages. The present results concern a selection of Acropora species. I wonder whether this would be sufficiently representative for a speciose coral assemblage. In theory any assemblage of two coral species can be considered multi-specific. With many Acropora species in a speciose coral assemblage, some degree of spawning synchrony is not surprising. So, in the present context I wonder if there is a minimum number of species for what counts as speciose and if the authors have a minimum number or percentage in mind for what exactly counts as multi-species spawning. If the authors cannot clarify their remark or cannot give more supportive information to this statement, I suggest that this sentence should be removed.
