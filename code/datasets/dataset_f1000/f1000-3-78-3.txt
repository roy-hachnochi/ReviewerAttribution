Background information, purpose of study, data, and interpretation are all clearly and concisely presented. Documentation of coral sexual reproductive status at Socotra, Yemen in 14 species of Acropora provides a useful first contribution to improved understanding of global patterns of this reef maintenance and renewal process. Given that more than 250 species of scleractinian corals are supported at the island, it would be interesting and useful to extend these initial studies to additional species at other times of the year, and to confirm inferred spawning period and synchrony with field observations. That said, I would suggest that the article title, The reproductive season of scleractinian corals in Socotra, Yemen is too broad, given that only ~5% of the scleractinian fauna was sampled. A more focused title should indicate that the observations are confined to the genus Acropora . Within the article, it would also be informative to provide the number of species of Acropora reported among the scleractinian fauna, so as to give some perspective on the proportion of Acropora species sampled.
