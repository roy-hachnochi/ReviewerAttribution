This is a case report documenting the response to treatment with best supportive care including dialysis as well as plasmapheresis in a four year old child with "typical" haemolytic uraemic syndrome. As the authors point out, trial evidence is not supportive of plasmapheresis for this condition however there may be situations where it may be of benefit - especially in a patient not responding to best supportive care. I have no issues with the case report and believe it is worth indexing to remind us that plasma exchange should still be considered in selected patients with this disease. With the potential availabilty of eculizumab however, the role of plasmapheresis may become even more limited.
