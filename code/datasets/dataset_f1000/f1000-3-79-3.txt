The authors report a very interesting but extremely difficult case report that many will find quite helpful. I have few minor suggestions: Abstract (case presentation): rewrite the second sentence. Figures 1 and 2: Could easily be combined into one figure, with single labeling on the top, and placing descriptions of the parameters on top of each tracing. Also the units of diuresis should be changed to per day instead. For plasma creatinine, include the micro symbol. Figures 3-5: Perhaps white arrows would be a better choice.
