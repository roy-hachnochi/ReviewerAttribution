This article raises a very important issue: the difficulty of providing privacy for genetic information in the light of inheritance. I cannot stress enough how important this aspect is, since it requires data protection measures, such as the mentioned cryptographic or obfuscation-based approaches, to be utterly restrictive. The article gives clear examples where -- intentionally or unintentionally -- leaked information allowed harmful inferences. The authors combine information from public genomes and social networks to infer information about people who have not released any information about their genes. These examples should be taken very, very seriously, since they are raised only at the very beginning of the scientific development. As the paper argues we can expect the use of genomics to significantly grow. Genetic information can prove at least as harmful as location information provided by cell phones, but it is impossible (for now) to change it. It is therefore a scientific and societal challenge to protect genomic information much better than we protect our information in current telecommunication networks. The article references excellent works from the computer security community that can certainly provide a guiding direction, but even these mechanisms need to necessarily leak some information about the genomes. I hope that medical and computer science researchers will take the challenge described by the article seriously and look for mechanisms that control the entire information in all medical or non-medical information system based on direct or indirect genomic data.
