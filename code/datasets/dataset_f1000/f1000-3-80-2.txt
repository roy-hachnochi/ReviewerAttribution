This paper discusses the challenge of protecting human genome data, particularly its unique feature in that ones DNA data can be used to infer the private health information of those genetically related to them. The authors talk about the conflict between the perception that the decision on releasing ones DNA materials is personal, and how it can actually impact on the privacy of their kin. They further sketch a technique for quantifying such an information leak, and demonstrate that the threat is realistic, given the de-anonymization attack that can happen through the booming online social networks. I feel that this article provides useful information for raising the awareness of the uniqueness and significance of genome privacy. This, hopefully, will lead to a broad, in-depth conversation among genomics researchers, security and privacy researchers, bioethics experts, genomics industry, policy makers and the public on how to effectively regulate the dissemination of human DNA data to facilitate scientific research, without undermining DNA donors privacy and well-being.
