This work shows the immediate and long-term effects of working memory training on cognitive performance of children (age 10-16). It is an interesting finding that 30 min of daily visuo-spatial working memory training can have sustained improvement in an auditory n-back task. Although the results seem to be sound despite the relative low group sizes and the lack of an active control group, some issues need further attention: It is not made clear enough what the passive control group is doing (or was instructed NOT to do) and particularly how this was controlled for. Although Table 1 is of help, the memory training compliance was said to be evaluated by a research assistant. Can more information on this evaluation be provided to convince the reader that it is likely that the compliance of the children was indeed as planned? Can more be said about the cause of the individual differences in training performance (the steady and unsteady performer groups)? Is it anticipated that individuals of the unsteady performer group, if their performance would have been steady (for example by more strict control or guidance), would gain as much as individuals of the steady performer group? In the end of the abstract, spatial working memory should be visuo-spatial working memory. Given the age range of the kids and the low number of children over 14 (n=2?) in this study it seems not fully justified to speak about adolescents if it comes to the effects of working memory training.
