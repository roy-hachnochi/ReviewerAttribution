In the present article the authors review the literature on inherited neuropathies - especially Charcot-Marie-Tooth and Giant Axonal Neuropathy - based on recent clinical evidence. The authors then offer several suggestions to overcome gaps in this area of knowledge, with criticism and argumentation. I approve this article for indexation. My only suggestion is that the authors remove figures 1 and 2 from the main body of the article and include them in the Supplementary materials instead.
