In this study the authors report the identification of new antagonists for the Orco protein, a co-receptor for the ligand binding Olfactory receptor (Or) family in insects. This is of interest as they suggest Orco antagonists might be a useful approach to modifying insect behaviour. The authors screened a panel of biogenic amines and found several that functioned as Orco antagonists, of which tryptamine, naturally produced in plants, was the most effective. They further showed that this activity was conserved against Orco from a number of insect species. The paper is well written, the data is solid and well presented, and is appropriately analysed and interpreted. The caveat to the use of currently identified Orco antagonists in biocontrol, namely that they appear to affect Orco in all insects and are not species-specific, is appropriately acknowledged. My one feedback comment is that the justification for screening just amines was not really clear, and I wondered if the authors had also in fact screened other types of compounds? If so it would be valuable to other researchers to also mention any screened compounds that did not have any effect on Orco function.
