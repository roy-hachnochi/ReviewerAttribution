This is a well-written paper that documents the discovery of modulatory effects of biogenic amines on the responses of odorant receptor assemblages (OR = odorant receptor + Orco = odorant receptor co-receptor) in insects. Both plant- and insect-produced amines are shown to antagonize responses of OR/Orco complexes to known agonists through interactions suggested to be with Orco. The potential role of the amines in regulating insect chemosensory behavior is suggested, and Orco is proposed as an important target for development of novel insect repellents.
