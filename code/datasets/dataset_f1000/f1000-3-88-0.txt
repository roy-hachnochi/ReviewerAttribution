This is an interesting case report that emphasizes the need to consider the diagnosis of PTLD in post-transplant recipients who present with GI bleeding. It is a well-written report but could be improved by additional details. Readers could benefit from a focused discussion on the treatment of PTLD in the post-transplant setting, including reduction in immune suppression, modulation of immune suppression (e.g. transition from a calcineurin inhibitor to sirolimus), single agent therapy with rituximab, or multi-agent therapy with prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. In this case based on the pathology, multi-agent chemotherapy was the appropriate treatment, but in other instances less aggressive measures are sometimes used. Additional details including imaging of his extra-abdominal compartment by CT or PET-CT, EBV viral load, and LDH would be helpful. Also, more details on the length and response to treatment would be of interest (was he reimaged or re-scoped?).
