This is an interesting case that highlights the importance of considering PTLD in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding occurring after transplantation. The case report is well written, but requires a few minor revisions. Article content A few clinical details, important for the diagnosis of PTLD, such as EBV status at transplantation, EBV DNA at diagnosis and at treatment re-evaluation, and LDH at diagnosis, should be inserted. Was a PET scan performed to complete PTLD assessment? In order to increase the clinical value of this report, I believe it is important to add data on patient imaging assessment at diagnosis (small bowel MRI and, if performed, total body PET scan, as figure 2 a and b). If PET scan or CT scan were not performed, add a comment on the reasons for not performing imaging assessment. References The reference for 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification (cited in the legend to Figure 1) ought to be reported. Reference 3 relates to stem cell rather than solid organ transplantation. The authors need to replace this reference with a more appropriate one, possibly published within the last 10 years. Reference 8 is very outdated. The same author has published a review on the same topic in 2003 ( Opelz Dohler, 2003 ), thus the authors should replace the 1993 article with the 2003 review.
