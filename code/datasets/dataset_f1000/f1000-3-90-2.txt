This short commentary points out that both sense and antisense transcripts with miRNA target sites could serve to titrate the miRNAs and, thus, release other target RNAs from repression. Recently, there has been much interest in these so called competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) as a form of regulating miRNA activity. While ceRNA activity has been attributed to pseudogenes and transcripts that circularize (circRNAs), theoretically any RNA, including protein coding mRNAs, could serve this function. The correspondence proposes that the linear Sry sense, as well as the previously reported antisense, transcript could function as sponges for miR-138. A major criticism of the proposal that ceRNA activity plays a function in regulating miRNA availability for target regulation is the consideration of cellular RNA concentrations. In many cases, the ceRNAs, even the circRNAs which can be more stable, are expressed at levels far below the miRNA or even its target mRNA. In fact, after this correspondence by Granados-Riveron Aquino-Jarquin was originally published in April 2014, the hypothesis that ceRNAs can alter miRNA function in vivo was rigorously tested and the conclusion was published in May that most ceRNAs simply are not abundant enough to act as competitive inhibitors of miRNA binding to target mRNAs ( Denzler et al. , 2014 ). Thus, the authors need to include discussion of this concern over how generally miRNA activity might actually be affected by the presence of any kind of ceRNA, sense, antisense or circular.
