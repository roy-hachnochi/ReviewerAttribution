This is an interesting and thought provoking study which simulates NAADP-dependent Ca 2+ transients; these are produced by release of Ca 2+ from lysosome stores that induce Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release from SR stores via stimulation of RyR3. It is increasingly apparent that answers to many issues concerning cellular Ca 2+ signalling will be found by recording local Ca 2+ events for instance the recently identified Ca 2+ sparklets representing Ca 2+ influx through opening of plasma membrane ion channels. Simulation studies are always difficult to review and evaluate as they must make many assumptions. However, this work is considered and may be a useful model for how other local Ca 2+ events might be modeled between discrete organelles. Moreover, unlike many simulation manuscripts, I find this one clear and well-written. Do the authors think that the use of proximity ligation assay techniques might be appropriate to measure local interactions between TPC2 and RyR3? Also, how are lysosomes refilled with Ca 2+ following NAADP/TPC2 activation a role for a lysosome store-operated Ca 2+ influx?
