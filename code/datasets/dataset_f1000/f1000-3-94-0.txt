A nice rewrite and a very much improved paper, especially since it is now properly classified as a review article. Just a few small corrections listed below. Page 4, Para 5: "Writing a request to the creator should [very rarely] be part of the process" As noted before creator permission is sometimes legitimate. Page 5, para 2: "The most familiar kind of data publication is a traditional journal article accompanied by underlying data. " [citation needed] or change the sentence. Page 5, para 7 "Data papers are predated by an approach that Lawrence et al. (2011) call data publication by proxy..." This is not true. As Hans Pfeiffenberger notes, ESSD dates back to 2008. Indeed I wouldnt be surprised if Lawrence chatted a bit with ESSD editors, Pfeiffenberger and Carlson, in preparing his paper. Page 6, para 1 NSIDC does do external scientific reviews but they only go outside when they dont have expertise in house. So its sort of a combined approach. A quibble, but they pride themselves on in-house scientific expertise and engagement. Page 6 para 2: This paragraph is a little confused. Domain repositories dont usually serve interdisciplinary use very well, but I dont see how its necessarily bad to be distributed. What do you mean by publishing the whole research story? No one entity can do that.
