Having made some similar comments myself I must agree with this review. But a few points may merit amendment: Abstract: Note that what means is the same as in print as in digital form. It does not imply peer-review or editorial oversight in either format. Citability: Yes, data citations are important but some datasets and web-based resources do not show how they should be cited, some journals do not allow citations to web resources in the Reference list, and even were both possible, too many authors neglect to cite actual datasets and instead cite a web site (which may have many datasets) or a related print paper. I agree that a DOI is not enough and only permanent if it is updated when documents are moved. A full author-tile-publisher citation as you suggest is more informative and human readable. I do not think it is problematic to cite parts of datasets. Pages and chapters in books are already cited for example. In most datasets it is also possible to identify individual dat records. Also, the actual data used could be provided in an Appendix so the reader is left in no doubt. Neither do I think is a problem. Where new data are added (e.g. to a time-series) then they comprise a new dataset, as they would if published in print. Where many corrections are made they a dataset can be treated like a paper; i.e. the original can be and replaced, or the new version be published with the metadata stating that it is more accurate. You mention venues for peer-reviewed data papers. For this article to advance previous articles, perhaps it could expand on these venues and how they manage the details of the peer-review process?
