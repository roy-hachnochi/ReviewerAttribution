This is a useful manuscript, detailing the authors extensions of existing functionality within the Bioconductor edgeR package to include shRNA screen data. The manuscript itself provides an overview of shRNA screens, competing analysis pipelines, and the methods available in edgeR. In addition, the authors provide a link to a vignette that gives example analyses of four different shRNA experiments that vary in depth of sequencing and complexity, along with the data so potential users can recapitulate the analyses provided, before making an attempt to analyze their own data.
