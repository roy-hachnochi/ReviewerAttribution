This data set will be a valuable resource for investigators who wish to test hypotheses about hippocampal function and interaction with entorhinal cortex at the level of single unit and LFP physiology. I have not investigated the data base carefully to ensure its utility, as I assume the authors have done so. My comments are limited to a few questions about their F1000Research article describing the data base. Animal surgery - second paragraph: Do the authors mean "in the coronal plane?" It is not clear whether the tetrodes were angled medially or laterally in that plane, or whether the authors mean that the tetrodes were angled anteriorly or posteriorly to the coronal plane. Please clarify here and in other locations in the text how the tetrodes were angled. Animal surgery - final paragraph: Does the data base contain histological figures? If not, are they easily identifiable and accessible from published reports? It would be very useful to ensure that the precise location of tetrodes could be made available to investigators. Table 1, elevated linear track : Shouldnt the fixed angles be 74 degrees (i.e. +/- 37 degrees)? Behavioural testing item (5): Were the rats motivated to run the corridors in any particular order? Was there any working memory component to the trials?
