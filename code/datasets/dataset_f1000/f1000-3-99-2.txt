The case reported in this paper is an extremely rare presentation of urethral duplication which led me to read it three times. Urethral duplication is a rare congenital finding in pediatric urology. Most patients with this anomaly are asymptomatic. When they are symptomatic, they present with a double urinary stream (the most common presentation), urinary tract infection, incontinence, epididymitis, and bladder outflow obstruction. The authors have not described the type of duplication very well and the reader will be confused whether it is a complete, Y-type or some other type of duplication. Most pediatric urologists and surgeons agree upon identifying the functional urethra prior to any surgical correction of this anomaly. The functional urethra can be determined by urodynamic studies of both urethrae but it was not done in this study. I humbly appreciate the authors performance of cauterization of the ventral urethra; however, the remnant of the ventral urethra is observable on post-operative MCUG. This remnant is concerning for its potential to cause urinary tract infection or incontinence in the future.
