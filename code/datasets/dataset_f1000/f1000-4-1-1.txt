The manuscript entitled "Quantification of polysaccharides fixed to Gram stained slides using lactophenol cotton blue and digital image processing" is a potentially interesting story that may have promise in identifying persister organisms, but the work is far too premature for acceptance. The author states in the abstract that "the presence of cell clumping provides a possible explanation of the presence of persisters and paradoxical points observed in Virtual Colony Count antimicrobial assays and suggests a phenotypic resistance mechanism to antimicrobial peptides involving capsular polysaccharides." This statement suggests that the author is observing the presence of persister cells that were first described by Gladys L. Hobby when she treated Streptococci with penicillin in which a subpopulation of a cells that were phenotypically resistant to penicillin action. Kim Lewis and others have shown that penicillin will reveal the presence of such persisters in E. coli as well. The author could get persistent mutants of E. coli from Kim Lewis that would allow them to explore their stain in a much more quantitative and rigorous way. It would be of interest to demonstrate if the microbial peptides reveal the presence of persisters in a fashion similar to penicillin. None of these experiments are included. Moreover, the conclusion in the discussion quotes that "clump formation suggest that glycosylate activity is essential for efficacy against persisters" which is clearly not substantiated by any of the data provided. Again, the author would benefit greatly by including mutants defective in capsule formation or defective in entering into the persister state to test if their blue stain is detecting persisters.
