I read with interest this investigation and I wish to thank the Authors for the request of my review. With this retrospective study they aimed to identify a simple, objective list of predictive factors for difficult laryngeal mask airway placement. As they underlined, at present such a list is not available. The topic is up-to-date, remarkable and well represents a growing body of research on EGA. Because LMA placement was performed by residents, some well known factors contributing to difficult placement of a LMA (type of anesthesia induction, dose of hypnotic agents, proper waiting time before LMA insertion, NMBA usage or not, etc.), could have been considered. But some limitations of the study are correctly stated by authors. The conclusions that large neck circumference and female gender were independently associated with difficult LMA placement definitely provide data potentially useful to clinicians.
