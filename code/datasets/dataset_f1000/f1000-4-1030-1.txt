This paper describes DREAMTools, which is a package that enables scoring of submissions for DREAM challenges. The paper is well written and this is certainly a useful tool. Benchmarking is essential in all aspects of tool or algorithm development, and the package described here will be helpful for evaluating the challenges. I did find the paper a bit too long. While it is interesting reading about the different examples DREAM challenges, these have been available on the DREAM challenges website, so perhaps a few representative examples could be selected from all those presented in the paper to illustrate the point. Like the other reviewer, my only reservation is the difficulty in getting the package installed, and though work has been done to make it compatible with Python 3, perhaps some troubleshooting tips would help users to overcome dependency issues.
