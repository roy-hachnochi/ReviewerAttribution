The authors provide an extension to AnalogExplorer incorporating stereochemistry, and important extension of the method. This method of analysing complicated compound data sets is sophisticated and easy to use. The approach to communicating results is intuitive both from the perspective of the trends in the experimental data with respect to the compounds that have been made, but also, in complete graph view, provide insight into important regions of the dataset that have not yet been investigated. This tool will be very useful in the exploration of medicinal chemistry datasets in both industry and academia. I have downloaded and run the software on a windows workstation using both the provided datasets and internally generated ones the software works as described with two minor issues cropped up. First, the software depends not only on the OEChem Toolkit, but also requires OEDepict (both licenses are available from Openeye Scientific). Second, the software depends specifically on the precise OEChem Toolkit java jar file (oejava-2014.Oct.2-Windows-x64.jar) it will fail without the correct jar file. On balance AnalogExplorer2 is a very useful tool for exploring compound data sets. It could be made more widely useful if it were to be adapted to run on an open source chemical toolkit such as RDKit. Nonetheless, I commend the authors for making their software available to the research community.
