Analysis of diverse molecular datasets is one of the most common tasks a computational chemist in pharmaceutical industry, but also in academia is facing daily. The tool presented in this manuscript the AnalogExplorer2 supports this process and makes it easier. Enhancement to previously published AnalogExplorer presented here, namely support for handling of stereoisomers is indeed important, since in large number of complex SAR datasets molecules with the same constitution but different stereochemistry are present. And in some cases differences in bioactivity for different stereoisomers are significant. Several examples shown in the manuscript illustrate nicely the powerful visualization capabilities of this tool, including maximum common substructure visualization, substituent tree visualization and selectivity analysis. These visualizations allow to understand the SAR even for the quite complex datasets. The authors made the executable version of the tool freely available for download. This is a good news. But since the tool is based on the OEChem library only users with a valid OEChem license would be able to use it. My recommendation for the future versions of AnalogExplorer would be to make the interface to its cheminformatics processing modular, so it would be possible to plug the tool also to open source cheminformatics toolkits like RDKit or CDK and make in this way the AnalogExplorer a truly free tool for graphical analysis of complex molecular datasets.
