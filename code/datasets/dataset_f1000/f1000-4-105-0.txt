The authors have gone far beyond my expectations in addressing the lack of visual aids and examples in the original manuscript; the (new?) DiffBind example, as well as the excerpted figures from the BrainScan, clearly show strengths that derFinder and regionReport bring to bear when compared to existing tools. All of my previous reservations (and then some) have been thoroughly addressed and I believe the resulting manuscript is a strong argument for the authors' toolchain.
