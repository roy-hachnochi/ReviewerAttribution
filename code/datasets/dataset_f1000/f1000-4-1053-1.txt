The work by lvarez-Salgado and Arredondo-Peter (2015) was carefully evaluated. Broadly, this research is worthy of achieving an approval in F1000Research. However, before it achieves this status, is necessary to carry out some minor modifications. Thus, the first paragraph of the Introduction, referred to the different affinity of nsHbs1 and nsHb2 for O 2 , needs to include some recent references (eg. Hoy and Hargrove, 2008; Smagghe et al, 2009; Thiel et al., 2011; among others). Likewise, in the second paragraph of the Introduction (ie. Based on the available informationâ€¦. NO scavenging and redox-signaling) the following latest references must also be added (ie. Siddiqui et al., 2010; Vigeolas et al., 2010, among others). With respect to Res Discuss, (i) the first paragraph should include some reference to show that the bands referred by the authors (Fig. 1A) specifically belong to rice (Hb1, Hb2), soybean (LBA), cowpea (LbII) and Vitreoscilla (Hb) cDNAs. This fact is key in this work. Likewise, bands corresponding to VHb and Lba (Fig. 1B) are confusing to the reader; (ii) I would eliminate from Fig. 2 the results of LBA, LbII and HBv growth (include as data not shown) because the main importance of this work are the results concerning nb1 and nbII; (iii) "... these proteins would promote cell growth due to their O 2 -transport activity"; this conclusion is based in old results and is very risky; this growth promotion should also be referred to higher plants?; please discuss; and (iv) I repeat, some actual references must be also included into discussion.
