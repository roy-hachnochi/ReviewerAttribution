This data note is reporting massive amount of genetic data for two landsnail species, with the aim that this resource will serve as a platform to develop phylogenetic and phylogeographic makers. The goal of this note is well justified given that for one of the genera, Dolicheulota , there are no NCBI entries, whereas for the other the diversity of them is low. Samples were sequenced using standard protocols in a facility that has experience in sequencing protocols. I am convinced that this data will be useful to the scientific community, especially to those interested in the evolutionary history of gastropods.
