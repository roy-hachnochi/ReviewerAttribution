I like the paper: “Caveat Emptor NICE: biased use of cost-effectiveness is inefficient and inequitable” by Jack Dowie et al and I have followed it on the way to this version. I think they have a logical point and they argue their case well. I cannot judge whether they miss some arguments against the SW case. I have two queries that the authors and/or editors might consider to be relevant for some thought. The kinkiness issue is discussed at some length on page 5, but to me it is unclear whether it is an ethical and logical issue, as the authors conclude (referring to an earlier Dowie paper that I have not read) or whether it is an empirical issue i.e. whether kinkiness should reflect the WTP/WTA ratio “in society”, i.e. take loss aversion into account. In the analysis they state “We maintain that the principle of cost-effectiveness requires that they be the same and that no logical or ethical case can be made for any kinked ICER in a public system” and in the Discussion it seems that the authors accept the MAD principle which could imply kinked ICERs in the plane quadrants. The other point is more practical – how would you administer SW cases. In the NE quadrant you document clinical efficacy and have some cost estimates to estimate ICERs, with cost data from typically secondary endpoints supplemented with observational cost data. In the SW quadrant, should you document cost savings, i.e. have costs as the primary end points for strong cost saving evidence? Should we/authorities encourage pharmaceutical and other industries to develop cost saving drugs and devices with inferior health effects? For example accept inferior generics – if cost savings are large enough? Or is the SW quadrant more relevant with the health providers cost saving ‘innovations’ when third party payers demand cost controls and budget cuts? What would the SW quadrant cases be? Besides these two queries I think the paper is ready to be indexed.
