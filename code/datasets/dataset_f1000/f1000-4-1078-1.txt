There are times when health economics articles are dense and jargon laden. There are other times when health economics articles seem to say what common sense suggests anyway. This article is neither of these. It speaks with logic, authority and a great deal of wisdom about the importance of potential bias in the UKs National Institute for Care and Health Excellence (NICE) and its approach to cost-effectiveness. The authors make the case that at the end of the day, while NICE has a remit to support the adoption of innovative new technologies, in practice the support is confined to those that will cost more. The authors want NICE and by extension anyone involved in this sort of appraisal not to omit to consider innovations and technologies that are simply cost-effective (as compared to those that are firstly determined to be clinically effective, and then assessed for cost-effectiveness). Without going into the detailed economic and conceptual arguments, which is of less interest to general readers, it is surely incumbent on policymakers to review this argument and take notice of it, or refute it. Either way, we should hear more about the potential of NICE to refine how it enables cost-effectiveness and innovation. Given the role NICE plays nationally and internationally, this is by no means a trivial request.
