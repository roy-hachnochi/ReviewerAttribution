This is very detailed description of an interesting study attempting to bring together behaviour, anatomy and neurochemical responses. The methods are very clearly described. I have only a few minor points for the authors to consider. Introduction The case is made for the amygdala in relation to pathways involved in pain relay but not made for combining with open field. The open field arguably elicits thygmotaxis through a neophobic and spatial effects which might relate more closely to the hippocampus. A little more in the introduction discussing the known relationship between the amygdala and open field behaviour would be helpful to the reader and place the choice of test in greater context. Results Can the reduction in frequency of entries into the centre be explained by a general reduction in motor activity? If this is accounted for in an ANCOVA does the reduced time in the centre become more or less pronounced? Was velocity altered between the groups? Might also reflect wariness? Discussion Is it possible that the variation of responses in the open field is due to the lack of clear salient stimuli for causing the thygmotaxis? A more discrete training stimulus as evident in conditioned fear-based paradigms may give less variability. Have the authors considered using other such tests, especially in light of the strong body of evidence relating conditioned fear to amygdala function?
