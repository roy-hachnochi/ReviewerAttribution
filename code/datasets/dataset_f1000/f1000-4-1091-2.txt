Ekins and his colleagues by using machine learning models and molecular modeling have successfully identified from collection of 2320 compounds 3 promising anti Ebola compounds with in vitro nanomolar activity. It is a perfect example which confirms suitability of in silico approaches in selection of molecules against Ebola virus. This result will be strengthened with suggestion of possible therapeutic target(s) of selected candidate drugs by using resources of curated chemistry-to-protein relationships. Such information could help in further improvement of proposed therapeutic molecules, as well as for selection of some other candidates for Ebola drugs.
