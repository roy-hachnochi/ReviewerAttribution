Sure it is of interest to evaluate the actinomycete populations of unique sites. However, the data should be sufficient and the goal has to be clearly defined and of interest. The isolation procedure of the strains do not allow to cover all the actinomycetes population. One has to apply pre-treatment(s) 1 of the samples, use more media such as Humic Acid Vitamins Agar 2 and the agar-plates have to be incubated at least 3 weeks. With the procedure used one can isolate only the fast growing strains. The identification of the strains to the genus level cannot be achieved only with the methods used. It could be tentatively possible for some genera but not in any case for all. Actinomycetes taxonomy was previously based on morphology, which is inadequate in differentiating between various genera 3 , 4 . Present approaches to the classification of prokaryotes are based on the combined use of genotypic and phenotypic data, that is, on polyphasic taxonomy 5 , 6 . This approach is being driven increasingly by molecular biology, especially the impact of 16S rRNA gene sequence and DNA:DNA relatedness values on the delineation of taxa 7 . The differences observed among the genera of actinobacteria identified in both sites studied, may be due to the different human activities, including construction in such area. The authors should not forget that they isolated only a very small part of the actinomycetale populations, so the comparison is difficult. The only way would be to use culture-independent methods. In addition according to Rule 37a, bacteriologists adhering to this proposal must change the name Elytrosporangium to Streptomyces. The fact that the isolated strains showed various enzymatic activities is not surprising and such an observation can be made with all samples. However the description of the activities is well done, even if basic. There are many publications in this area. So the goal should be the detection of a rare enzymatic activity or the comparison of the enzymatic potential of the actinomycetes from this site to other ones or to characterize the enzymes somehow.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This manuscript describes the isolation and preliminary characterization of actinobacteria strains producing enzymes with potential biotechnological applications. However, the experimental design chosen by the authors, and the conclusions drawn from some results rise some concerns. The major weakness of this work is that the assays used to investigate the enzymatic potential of the isolated actinobacteria are not fully convincing. Especially for what concerns cellulase activity, none of the strains isolated by the authors was positive to this test. The authors discuss that this unexpected result could be due to unsuitable culture conditions, such as pH. This is also the case for protease and catalase activities, that were found just in few isolates, and for which negative results could be biased by the experimental method. Authors should demonstrate that each enzymatic assay works in their hands, by using bacterial strains previously characterized for their ability and inability to produce the tested enzymes as positive and negative controls, respectively. Moreover, other experimental settings ( e.g. , cultures with different pH) should be considered to verify enzymatic activities in the isolates. The authors state that enzymatic activity (EA) was evaluated as follow: diameter of zone of tested substrate hydrolysis - diameter of colony in cm. Based on this calculation, the EA was estimated as excellent (EA2), good (EA2), or poor (EA1). Besides noticing that EA2 is not correct (it should be 12), this values are not mentioned anymore along the manuscript, where the detected activity is usually defined as strong activity, moderate activity or low activity. In addition, in Table 1 the enzymatic activity is represented with + or symbols. Authors should choose one adjective/word to define a certain interval of activity and use always the same along the whole text. The measurement of a diameter (see above) can be acceptable as a semi-quantitative method allowing the comparison of a certain enzymatic activity among different strains. However, since catalase activity was detected by visualizing oxygen bubbles formation, it is not clear how the authors measured and compared this enzymatic activity. Taxonomic allocation of the isolated strains should be confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Since the main aim of this article is to explore the enzymatic potential of newly isolated actinobacteria, the authors were expected to use protocols allowing maximal diversity of the isolated species. The authors discuss that in previous studies sample pre-treatment with specific agents has been successfully used to promote spore germination and to allow isolation of most actinobacteria inhabiting the soil, so it is not clear why they did not consider this possibility for the experimental plan. Authors state that the differences observed among the genera of actinobacteria identified in both sites studied, may be due to the different human activities, including construction in such area. These differences may also indicate that the methods proposed and employed for actinobacteria isolation may not the suitable for site 1,... . In order to support this piece of discussion, authors should provide more information about the characteristics of the two isolation sites ( e.g. , anthropic impact, type of soil, type of vegetation). Were these sites similar or different with respect to one or more features? How these similarities/differences could be correlated to the results?
