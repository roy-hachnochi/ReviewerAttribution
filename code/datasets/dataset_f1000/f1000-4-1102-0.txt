Kuntz and Eisen have analysed the effect that variations of oxygen concentrations and temperature exert on Drosophila embryonic development. A previous study from the same group had shown that temperature variations affect embryogenesis preserving the order and relative duration of a list of morphological events during this developmental process. The question addressed in this work is as whether variations of oxygen levels also preserve the order and relative duration of events during embryogenesis. They have designed and built a special device to monitor embryogenesis while controlling oxygen levels and temperature simultaneously. The work is technically sound and the results are truly unexpected: The different morphological events of the embryogenesis are not affected by oxygen levels to a similar extent, but rather, each morphological event responds to such variations in an unequal manner. Strikingly, the order in which some of the morphological events occur is altered when oxygen levels are modified. These effects are modulated by the temperature, so that the order and relative duration of each of the events of the embryogenesis is independently modulated by oxygen and temperature simultaneously. The approach and the whole concept is highly original and adds a new dimension to our understanding of metazoan development that paves the road for further studies aimed to the definition of the molecular and genetic mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon.
