Xiao Li et al present a well written report on a retrospective series of nine patient with active lupus and the effect of ACTH gel. Although the study is limited by the small number of subjects they include a diverse patient population the majority of which had very active disease with an average baseline SLE Disease Activity Index 2K of 6 and on combination immunosuppressive therapy. Moreover, the patients represent our usually more challenging patients with inability to taper steroids and multiple organ involvement. The authors were careful to select patients who had been initiated in ACTH gel and had not had any recent adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy, which is a common confounder of disease response/activity. The results in terms of tapering down/off steroids is compatible with our understanding of the steroidogenic effect of Acthar gel. The improvement of SLEDAI 2K was seen for half of patients. It would have been reassuring if data on individual dosing of Acthar gel had been given for all patients and confirmation of drug administration . Overall this study offers strong observational data to support further studies into the effectiveness of ACTH analogues in the treatment of lupus.
