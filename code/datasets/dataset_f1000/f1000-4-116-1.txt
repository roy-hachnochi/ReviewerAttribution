The research is clearly and accurately presented and the current literature is appropriately cited. The study design is appropriate and the work is technically sound. It has sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others. The statistical analysis and its interpretation used in the study is appropriate. The rationale for developing the products of rice usually consumed in Ethiopia is clearly explained and description of the method is clearly presented by the author. The conclusions drawn adequately support the results. The research is good and the paper is very elaborate. The results are confined to Ethiopia and the products developed are commonly consumed there. Hence this paper can be accepted for indexing, provided the content is modified a little and tables can be made into a single format as too much content cannot be read by any researcher. The length of paper can also be reduced. All the mineral content and analysis can be explained under one sub head. The acceptance of product developed can be mentioned in the methodology as it was replaced with rice ( oryza sativa ). The statistical analysis is appropriate and the content is very interesting too. Overall, a positive feedback from my side.
