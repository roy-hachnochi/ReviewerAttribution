I find this paper by Gesto-Borroto et al. to be well written and analyzed. This paper fills a gap in the knowledge base for what is known about bacterial or more specifically rhizobial globins. The authors seem to have taken great care to analyze all available globins from various rhizobial species and biovars. I have no major revisions for this work. It is comprehensive and demonstrates some interesting points about globins in rhizobia. The coexistence of various globins in the bacteria begs questions about their control and functions that undoubtedly other researchers will address. The work with the promoter analysis was particularly interesting to me indicating more than once that the globin expression is likely tied to nitrate/nitrogen metabolism. The absence of the -10 promoter area was also unexpected. The amino acid sequence alignment data also shows interesting information about the conserved positions in the sequence. The phenetic relationships are also interesting and appropriately analyzed. The structural modeling is also well done and reveals interesting points about the structure and function of the various globins. Lastly, the authors back up some of their proposals with spectroscopic data from globing extracts. Again, overall I thought that the work was well done and needs no major revisions.
