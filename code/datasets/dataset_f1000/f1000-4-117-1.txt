This is a well-written paper on a subject of great interest. There is very little information of rhizobial globins and the authors have done a good job by systematically analyzing the composition of globin genes of 62 genomes in various genera, species and biovars of rhizobia. The authors are experts in the phylogeny and evolution of plant hemoglobins, and I have no major comments to improve this work. It will nevertheless be of interest for future work to address the issue of why several types of hemoglobins coexist in rhizobia. For example, both truncated hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins seem to be present within the same species and strain, although this would have to be verified by identifying the proteins themselves rather than by only gene sequencing or by analyzing differential spectra (reduced + CO vs reduced) in bacterial extracts. Both classes of hemoglobins have been proposed to act as modulators of NO concentration, but they are unlikely to have redundant functions. An interesting, additional aspect of the work is the mapping analysis, including the report of flanking sequences. This hints to a role of at least some rhizobial globins in nitrogen metabolism. This observation is very timing because of the recent discovery that truncated hemoglobins of Chlamydomonas regulate nitrate reductase.
