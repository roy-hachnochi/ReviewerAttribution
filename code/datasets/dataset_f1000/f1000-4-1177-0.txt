This review is an overview of the hematopoietic stem cells in hematopoiesis, and it is my opinion that there are still some issues with the review. For instance, I think that the abstract is not fully aligned with the body of the review and instead I feel that it should summarise the major statements made in the text. Moreover, in the main body of the review, there are a number of factual inaccuracies and the authors present the evolution of our knowledge as a series of mistakes which, in my view, is incorrect and they have not provided sufficient information on the methods and tools that they describe. I miss a more critical expert review of the evolution of our tools to study hematopoietic stem cells. As a result of these issues, I have given this review an Approved with Reservations rating.
