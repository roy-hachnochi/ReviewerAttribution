The authors investigate the potential growth of off-target activity over time as new assays become available. They control for multiple potential confounds, and possibly the most important is data quality enabling confidence in the results. They note that prior data indicated screening compounds typically bind to at least two targets, while drugs may bind up to seven, but this result might be skewed by insufficient data quality. Their study reported here uses very large datasets and controls for the growth of compound number as well as new data over time. They also deliberately analyze high- and low-quality (or confidence) data separately. This careful analysis gives them a much clearer picture of the changes in compound promiscuity over time, and reveals a low level of off-target activity and only a slight increase with time. Despite new assays becoming available at an increasing rate, compound promiscuity has not increased significantly, a result that will surprise many readers, but which the authors have documented admirably. I highly recommend this manuscript for indexing.
