I believe this paper should be indexed as I have not seen such a methodical and quantified examination of promiscuity before. The article is well written and easy to read. Figures are compelling. Although there is compelling data included suggesting that over time, promiscuity generally doesnt increase for a given compound, Im a bit skeptical on concluding that promiscuity may not have markedly increased over the past few decades based on merely ChEMBL. I, however, recognize that those in academia (or in a biotech company where large receptor screening may not be part of the business model) may not have access to an orthogonal data set. Frankly, other than ChEMBL, Im not sure where else one would go to look for off target data. There are purchasable databases (e.g. Integrity). However, more public data is relatively sparse. Even a (young) small-ish biotechnology company would not have enough data to utilize. One topic that has been raised in the literature the past few years is the concept of phenotypic versus target based drug discovery approaches to developing new medicines. I would have liked to see some differentiation between promiscuity of target based versus phenotypic based projects. Is that something the reviewers can go back to and annotate their data set? Additionally, discussion around the differences between promiscuity and polypharmacology should be elaborated upon. I realize this is raised in the "introduction", but I would have liked to see more attention paid to this topic. Finally, will the data sets be publicly available with annotations?
