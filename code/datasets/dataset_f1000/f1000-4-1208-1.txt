Nice article. In general format it looks very good. The presentation style is clear – good and informative figures. The critical points that the article and the researchers have realized is the limitations of a sample size 24 to divided two groups – so 12 per group. The other critical issue will be the follow up time up to 3 months. So on that background I prefer to talk with these results as preliminary findings – which were very promising and will stimulate to work more with this and plan next trial with bigger population and longer follow up - up to one or two years (taking count that the patients were chronic LBP patients). Or one possibility will be add the phrase 'a pilot study' to the title? We have to be careful when making conclusions based on preliminary and pilot studies – the results seem to be promising – and I like to say that this way. As a conclusion I would prefer the indexation of this article with my suggested minor revisions.
