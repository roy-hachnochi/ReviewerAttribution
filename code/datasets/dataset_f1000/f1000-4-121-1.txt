The study is carried out well and the results support the conclusion. The paper would benefit from including some of the discussion points made in the comments made to v1 of the paper. Lin et al. have re-sequenced the samples and removed the sequence lane batch effect, and reproduced the same result; however, the samples themselves are confounded, in that they were treated differently prior to sequencing. This discussion should be added to the paper. I would also like to see a discussion of artifacts which are discoverable within the data, for example: the human samples have significant numbers of rRNA reads compared to the mouse samples. This should not happen with mRNA-Seq which includes a polyA selection. the human samples have a hugely varied number of reads per sample, compared to the mouse samples one of the mouse samples has over 1.8M reads that map to a single rRNA transcript. This is an outlier for mouse, as the other mouse samples have low numbers of rRNA reads The mitochondrial genes are turned on in one species but not the other These points are all indicators of different sample extraction techniques, which also confound with species. The authors may also wish to discuss use of FPKM, which may not be the most useful measure of gene expression in this study, as the human and mouse orthologues have different lengths.
