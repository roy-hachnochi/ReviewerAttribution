The authors report an integrated genetic, epigenetic, and expression analysis from 50 oral tongue SCC. The findings were confirmed using a data set from TCGA. The manuscript presents surprising data which is interesting and has potential clinical implications. It is surprising that 23 of 50 patients with oral tongue SCC are HPV/p16 positive. This is not entirely consistent with previously published literature. Although the authors comment on this, this finding is rather “unique.” It is very possible that the improved survival is due to HPV status and not mutation status as these results maybe confounded. Although 50 patients is a relatively large sample size for such a study, a much larger study is necessary to really have immediate clinical impact.
