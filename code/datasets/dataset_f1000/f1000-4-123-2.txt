The authors have performed a cross sectional observational study examining the relationship between NLR, preoperative systemic illnesses and peri-operative risk markers in a large cohort of surgical patients. This makes a contribution to the existing literature by including patients from a variety of surgical specialties rather than focussing on specific surgical pathologies. They found that increased NLR at two cut-offs was independently associated with pre-existing cardiac failure and malignancy (confirming similar findings in other studies) but not ischaemic heart disease - in a multivariable model. Overall the design, methods and analysis are appropriate and the authors conclusions are balanced and justified. The study authors may consider the following points which may strengthen this work: The abstract and results text state that diabetes was one of the pre-existing co-morbidities associated with increased NLR in the multivariate model, however this is not consistent with the results tables. The regression models examining ASA / RCRI and NLR could be described more clearly. Were they separate univariate models or part of the wider multivariate models including co-morbidities? If the latter, the extent of co-linearity between these risk scores and the presence of co-morbidities would be useful to know. As the authors point out, this study has not included clinical outcomes and did not aim to examine NLR as a prognostic marker. With this in mind, could NLR have been examined as a continuous variable in the regression model rather than being dichotomised? Dichotomising continuous data may have led to a loss of statistical power ( Altman and Royston, 2006 ). Also, although the NLR cut-offs examined have been justified based on prior related literature, giving these cut-offs (3.3 and 4.5) might imply to the casual reader that these are prognostically important values, whereas this needs further exploration as the authors acknowledge.
