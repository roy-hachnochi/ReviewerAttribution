Starting from a systematic overview of the reviewing process, the current paper summarizes the true values and the possible pitfalls in scientific and academic refereeing. It can also be seen as a (very) useful guide for anyone involved in reviewing, including those who are making policy for the assessment of individual scientists, faculties, research schools and institutes, which is increasingly putting additional pressure to academic staff. The striking examples given by the author illustrate the strong need to keep (or even start?) discussing the mode of reviewing within scientific communities. In line with the previous referee report, I can also exemplify this need by personal experiences with peer reviewers judging the quality of grant applicants based on the number of papers in journals with impact factor 10, or with universities bringing out press releases about their top researchers defined as grant awardees. Therefore the current paper is in my opinion not only a very good but clearly also a highly timely overview of pitfalls in peer reviewing.
