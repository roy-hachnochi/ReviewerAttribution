In this article, the authors report the results of studies in which they attempt to validate the specificity of a commercially available antibody to TAP-Like (TAP-L), which is an endosomal peptide transporter from the same family at the prototypical ER TAP proteins. They report that, unexpectedly, the anti-TAP-L antibody exhibits immunoreactivity on samples prepared from TAP-L knock mice. Suggestions for improvement: It would be helpful to know the number of cell equivalents loaded on each lane of the gels. The gels were loaded for equal protein, so the number of cell equivalents is likely similar, but this point should be addressed. Figure 1 Since the purpose of the experiment is to test the specificity of the primary western blot antibody (i.e., anti-TAP-L), it would be appropriate to include a control blot that was probed with secondary antibody only. It is possible that the unexpected reactivity on the western blot is due to the secondary antibody (and that the primary antibody is generating no signal). A blot probed with secondary antibody only would address this possibility. The company makes specific note of the peptide used to generate the reagent under analysis. Therefore, it would be interesting of the authors compared this sequence to the protein sequence in the available databases to see if they could identify candidates for the non-TAP-L protein being recognized by the antibody under analysis.
