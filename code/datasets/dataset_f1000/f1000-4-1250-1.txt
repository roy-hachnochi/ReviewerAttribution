This is an interesting, nicely illustrated, article describing a surgical technique that can be applied for the management of Blount's disease. Although most surgeons use external fixation for the correction of such deformities, the current article addresses another possibility, namely acute correction and internal fixation. Some patients (especially small children) might not tolerate external fixation, thus this technique offers another tool in the surgeon's armamnetarium. Therefore it is a contribution to the literature if alternative techniques are presented. The postoperative result is also nicely illustrated.
