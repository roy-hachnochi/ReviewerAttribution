This is a thought provoking opinion piece on the advantages, indeed the need, for practical teaching for developmental biology. In general, it is a well written piece that makes a strong case, and one that I whole-heartedly endorse. In the background section, I am a little wary of the approach to thinking about practicals whereby such activities have specific independent purposes that can be expressed in a meaningful way. Are Kirschners three motives mutually exclusive? I would suggest not, and would avoid discussing them as such. The article describes a practical developmental biology course designed and run by the author that sounds very interesting indeed. If anything, a more thorough description of the course (including its assessment components) and its philosophical underpinnings would be useful and interesting. Also useful would be speculation on how such a course could be scaled up, if indeed this is envisaged. Overall, this is a interesting piece that outlines an interesting course that would benefit from more thorough elucidation.
