The authors have not adequately explained the results presented in Fig. 1. If A represents patients with scores greater than 6 why are they generally more negative than samples in C collected from healthy donors? Are the samples shown vertically repeats of 1 patient or from individual patients? If so there are in total only 20 samples instead of 26.
