This manuscript covers an important area of novel diagnostic tests for paediatric TB. They highlight the well known challenge of obtaining appropriate specimens for identifying mycobacterium tuberculosis in children with PTB. The authors report on the use of an in-house sIgA assay for diagnosis of pulmonary TB in children. It is not clear if the sIgA assay has been standardized or validated, so I asked a microbiologist to also review the manuscript. The authors found no difference in the sIgA assay between the children with PTB and those without TB. If the sIg A assay was clearly described and validated, the findings may have provided useful information for future studies. However, the methodology of the assay has major limitations. Co-reviewer: a microbiologist comments The results are still not well presented to trust the conclusions. The details on how the optimal concentrations of Ag38-rec, PPD and volume of saliva was determined are missing yet the are needed to yield confidence in the author's procedures. Whether the second purification step of protein Ag38-rek was optimized after the failure of the purification kit remains unclear. The use of PPD as a positive control and a comparator is not clear. Results of the dot blot are very subjectively interpreted yet even the criteria is not clear to ensure reliability. Generally, I find the methods and results are not well presented to enable critical understanding of the findings and relate them to the conclusion.
