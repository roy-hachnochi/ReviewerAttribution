In general I find the article very interesting and its tackling a very interesting topic sharing open scientific data.The article is well organized and provides sufficient information on the goals and outcomes of the agInfra project. I would expect to see more on related work and other background information related to the sharing of agricultural information among scientist. For example what other practices exist and how the agINFRA project outcomes complement or differ from other sharing tools for scientific research (not necessarily only in agriculture).
