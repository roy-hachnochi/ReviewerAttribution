There is a tremendous demand for a reproducible and representative model of the human blood brain barrier and many versions have been tried. This paper represents an interesting variation, especially in the dispensing of transwells, which impose an unacceptable separation between the endothelial cells and the astrocytes. There are a few issues I would like to see addressed, either by experimentation or additional discussion: Pericytes are also an important component of the microvasculature and their addition here would likely strengthen the relevance of the model. Given the importance of astrocytes in promoting development of the BBB it would be interesting to know whether they modulate additional markers of the BBB, such as ABC transporters, other than ZO-1 and Claudin 5 (both of which are only weakly induced). The failure to induce pgp and the relatively high leakiness of the monolayer are concerns as pgp expression and a tight barrier are both key features of the BBB in vivo . Was a non-binding antibody used for the negative control in IF experiments? If so, this should be stated. AQP4 is reduced in overall expression in 3D culture, but is it relocalized to the contact points between the astrocytes and the EC. This could be checked by confocal microscopy. In Fig. 6, the arrows are missing. In Fig. 7, “J” and “E” are missing from the figures.
