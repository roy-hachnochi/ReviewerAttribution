The manuscript sounds technically good and the results were innovative. However, I have some recommendation or comments that would make bring this study to its highest potential. Figure 2: A Claudin-5 immunostaining would be appreciated, especially to observe how the presence of astrocytes may improve claudin-5 immunoreactivity in hCMEC/D3 cells. What happens to adherent junctions such as VE-cadherin, beta-catenin or PECAM-1? Having such immunocytochemistry data in addition would greatly help. A GFAP staining would be appreciated. Figure 4: I have some concerns about the absence of error bars in P-gp control group, although CLDN5 and ZO1 control groups display one. Please keep it consistent. Figure 7: A true negative control such as TE7 fibroblasts is needed.
