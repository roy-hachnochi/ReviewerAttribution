A group of experts met at Accademia dei Lincei to discuss new concepts emerging from experimental data on the dynamic process of living organisms particularly as they relate to differentiation, adaptation, plasticity and memory. The report provides snapshots from selected fields of biology illustrating the paradigm shift that has occurred over the last two decades concerning the dynamics of a variety of molecular and cellular processes. The view that emerges is one of permanent instability that allows for dynamic adaptations to environmental cues. The set of process underlying this instability most likely provides the key to species survival and adaptation, but also, and just as importantly, the emergence of individuality. The paragraphs reporting on the various presentations are sharp and informative and the introductory and concluding ones provide a faithful synthesis of the questions at stake and their elaboration. The only aspect that could have been treated more directly would have been that of synaptic plasticity in the adult which represents undoubtedly an important element of the dynamic architecture of life. This review article represents a remarkable scholarly effort to provide novel insights on a paradigm shift about our understanding of the dynamics of life.
