This report summarises the key points of a recent meeting bringing together scientists working on diverse biological systems linked mainly by their approach to understanding the dynamic aspects of biological states. The report highlights the importance of reversibility of differentiation states and cellular responses to external stimuli as well as the importance of this in the context of adaptive evolution. Clearly there are many unanswered questions and the historianâ€™s perspective pointed out that there is much more experimental work required to formulate general principles linking the described systems. Meetings such as these are of great value in allow abstraction of such principles and are to be encouraged. The inclusion of an historian in such meetings is an innovative approach which could be developed further to allow a real in-depth analysis of how ideas evolve over time.
