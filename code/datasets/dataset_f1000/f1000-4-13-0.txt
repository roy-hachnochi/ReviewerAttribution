The authors have composed an excellent case report highlighting the fact that multiple mechanisms can impair erectile function. In addition, hormone replacement is not typically sufficient to resolve this issue. The pathophysiology behind the inhibitory effect of prolactin appears to extend beyond hypogonadism and is intriguing. 1. Do the authors have any IIEF/SHIM data at baseline and follow-up? 2. Perhaps the authors can comment on the use of TST as opposed to alternative agents (HCG) which would not impact fertility. 3. I would add some additional comments regarding the physical exam characteristics (i.e. secondary sex characteristics, etc.) 4. Do the authors have any conjecture as to the mechanisms underlying the impact of hyperprolactinemia on this patients ED despite TST?
