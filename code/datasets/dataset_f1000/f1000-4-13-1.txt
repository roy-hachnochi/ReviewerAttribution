This is an excellent case report that raises the idea that prolactin may have other mechanisms of action for suppression of erectile function besides the most commonly cited reason of low testosterone. This case highlights the idea that there are certainly multiple mechanisms by which any biological alteration (high prolactin) can affect normal physiology (erectile function). I would hope that the authors will comment on whether there are any plans to further intervene in this young mans prolactin beyond the already mentioned therapies. Also, for the evaluation of erectile function, more information could be given on the specific hemodynamic parameters obtained as well as any mention of what kind of baseline sexual function he has (either an IIEF score or other standardized questionaire). However, overall, a great report to highlight that we dont understand all perturbation that go one when hormones are abnormal, and the "traditional" thinking of single pathways is probably folly and more a representation of reading about a disease in a textbook rather than critically thinking about the pathophysiology and the limitations of our current medical knowledge.
