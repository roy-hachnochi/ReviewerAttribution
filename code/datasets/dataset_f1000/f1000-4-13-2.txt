This is an interesting case report involving a young man with persistent erectile dysfunction in the setting of a prolactinoma. Introduction: What are some of the actions of prolactin in normal male physiology? Case Report: The word "worst" is used inappropriately. Why was a 15 year old male started on testosterone cypionate instead of HCG or other medications that would not compromise his fertility? Are there plans for continued treatment of the prolactinoma? Clinical Findings: Please greatly expand this section. What are his vital signs, visual acuity, body habitus, body hair distribution, tanner stage, penile size, etc? Diagnostic Assesment: Aside from the prolactin, LH, FSH, and Testosterone levels, what is his TSH level and hematocrit level? Therapeutic Intervention: Was the duplex penile U/S completed in a multidosing regimen? What were the actual duplex parameters..i.e. the PSV, EDV, and RI? Discussion: No issues, however, the integrity of the manuscript would be enhanced if the authors would offer suggestions on how to assess and treat these complex patients.
