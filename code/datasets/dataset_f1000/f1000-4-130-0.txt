The authors examined the possible protective effect of SIRT1 against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity using Prp-SIRT1 transgenic (Tg) mice, which enabled pan-neural over-expression of the SIRT1 gene. Although the other Tg mice expressing SIRT1 under the promoter of neuron-specific enolase gene had failed to protect MPTP-neurotoxicity previously, this study was worthwhile doing because the Prp-SIRT1 Tg mice had exhibited partial tolerance to some animal models of stroke and neurodegeneration. In this paper, the authors found no significant difference in MPTP-induced neurotoxicity between the Prp-SIRT1 Tg mice and wild-type by immunohistochemical analyses. Whereas the experimental methods used in this study are sound, immunohistochemical analyses are in general semi-quantitative compared with biochemical ones. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it would be interesting to test the milder insults on the Prp-SIRT1 mice. Further studies are expected.
