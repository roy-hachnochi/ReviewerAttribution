In this study Kitao and colleagues have performed comprehensive in vivo analysis of the effect of high levels of SIRT1 on dopamine (DA) neuron survival and gliosis following MPTP insult. The authors test the effect of acute MPTP injury in their previously characterized transgenic mouse line Prp-SIRT1 over-expressing the longevity-related gene Sirt1 in both neurons and glia. The study reports no alleviation in MPTP-induced neurodegeneration or astrogliosis in Prp-SIRT1 animals compared to wild-type controls. This data is consistent with previously reported inability of SIRT1 gain-of-function to mitigate the effects of MPTP-induced neural damage in a neuron-specific Sirt1 transgenic line (NSE-SIRT1). Despite the negative connotation of the results, Kitao et. al.s study is very informative and provides scientifically sound qualitative and quantitative analysis. An important point, also noted by the authors in the discussion, is the possibility that SIRT1 contributes only minimally to DA neuron survival - this effect could be unmasked by using a lower dose of MPTP or alternatively model parkinsonism using the neurotoxin 6-Hydroxydopamine. In either case, further analysis is required to completely negate the neuroprotective effects of SIRT1 in Parkinsons in vivo models.
