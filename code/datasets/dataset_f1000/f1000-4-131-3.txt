Drs Walley and Russell, two internationally renowned sepsis clinical investigators and translational scientists, concisely review the rapidly changing sepsis landscape. Recently published studies on transfusion practices, immune modulation, and pharmacotherapy are reviewed as well as groundbreaking large comparative effectiveness studies of early resuscitation strategies. Exciting insights from lipid biology and clever strategies for enhancing the clearance of bacterial products are reviewed, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for early intervention. Given the legacy of failed sepsis trials, the authors suggest new approaches to clinical trials, predictive enrichment strategies and adaptive designs that may, along with improved understanding of sepsis pathogenesis, lead the way to effective therapies.
