This m/s by Niema et al . presents some useful information for researchers who routinely struggle with reliable protocols to extract high quality DNA, esp. of great quality needed for sequencing. Library construction for next-generation sequencing commonly requires at least 30 ng of DNA. This can present a challenge for researchers that work with small insects and/or who are very limited based on the tissues they use for library construction. DNA yield is particularly important when studying genetic variation among individuals. The authors assessed several common methods for the extraction of DNA from single Anopheles mosquitoes. The manuscript is well written and the methods are appropriate. Comments: No “non-commercial” methods were included in the analyses, nor were they discussed. For example, a standard CTAB protocol gets excellent yields of good quality DNA. Perhaps CTAB does not produce DNA that is appropriate for library prep or does not work well in an automated system. It would be really helpful if authors can address and elaborate on this issue Were the sizes of the individuals used in the study the same? For example, the mass of males is often much less than females, and rearing conditions can influence size to a great extent. Please correct a few spelling errors.
