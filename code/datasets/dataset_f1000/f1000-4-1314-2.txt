The article is an interesting update on extraction protocols and highlights the importance of testing different methods when extracting DNA for a wide range of downstream applications. The articleâ€™s title is sound and describes well the observations made, the same is true for the abstract which provides an adequate summary of the article. Also the aim of the article and the study design are well described and allow to reproduce the different methods tested. Results and discussions appear to be sound and coherent with the offered data. There are only few minor corrections to make: In Methods: please correct TissuLyser in TissueLyser specify the number of specimens analyzed In Results and Discussion: in the second paragraph it might be noteworthy that genotype call errors do not appear only when considering the mitochondrial DNA, but, at least in A.gambiae 1 listed in Table 2, many errors , such as opposed genotype calls can be observed also for autosomal sequences Table 1: it could be useful to add some information in the caption such as the meaning of ChrM ( I suppose it stands for mitochondrial DNA?) and units of measurements for the given data please correct A.gambia in A.gambiae (1st column)
