Overall, this version is definitely an improvement over V1. The major weakness I see remaining is the lack of specific suggestions for improving the technology transfer process. The most ubiquitous complaints seemed to be regarding the infrastructure, and the lack of appreciation of the importance and support for commercialization. First, it would be nice to define what is meant by the infrastructure. This term is fairly vague and could reasonably be viewed as fairly all-encompassing. A narrowing definition would be useful. For example, is the infrastructure referring specifically to the Tech Transfer Office, which would suggest the office is perhaps understaffed? Without more clearly defining the complaint, positing possible mitigating improvements becomes more difficult. In short, I am going to recommend approval of the article, but I think it would be improved by including specific suggestions for overcoming perceived barriers to tech transfer.
