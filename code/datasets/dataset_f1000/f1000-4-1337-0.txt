The authors provide a much needed perspective on penile masses in the setting of Peyronie's disease after surgical repair. The manuscript is well written and appropriately identifies an overall paucity of studies examining this complication, summarizing the extent of our knowledge in these specific situations in a total of 2 other available case reports. As such, this work is a very useful and important contribution to the literature. There are two points on which additional information would be useful, however. First, with regards to the patient case, it would be useful to include any serum studies that were performed, which may be salient particularly in the setting of a mass that is not benign. Second, a short discussion of the rarity (i.e. incidence / prevalence) of malignant penile masses in this type of setting would be helpful.
