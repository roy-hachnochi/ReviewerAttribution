This is an interesting article. The authors computed five complexity measures which were broadly representative, aiming to determine the correlations and differences between measures of complexity used in EEG signals study. Just as the findings of this study, more information can be revealed by multiplying measures instead of single complexity measures. Furthermore, the methods of combinations of complexity measures can be applied in future studies such as Alzheimers disease. With the coming of big data era, we need to adopt effective means to mine information hidden in many diseases. Perhaps, this paper gives us some reference.
