This is a very well written manuscript. I do not have much to comment, except that this is a well thought out experimental study. It is very interesting to note that a larger number of OTUs were obtained from FPOM, whereas, the OTUs from CPOM (leaf litter) were fewer in number. Finding members of Cryptomycota in streams for the first time was interesting. I would have liked to see the ITS region sequenced, so we could get a better understanding of the species-level identification.
