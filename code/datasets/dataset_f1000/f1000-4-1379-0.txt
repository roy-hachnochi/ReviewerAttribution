The authors have addressed the suggestions made by the reviewers well. The methods are clearly laid out. In addition, the section describing how each analysis addresses a particular aim in the study is nicely written. I believe the protocol as outlined will provide interesting data that will contribute significantly to current literature regarding vision and cognition during gait in individuals with Parkinson's disease.
