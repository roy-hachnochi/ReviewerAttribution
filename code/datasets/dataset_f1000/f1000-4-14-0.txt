The article provides detailed information about an in vivo based assay system of protein prenylation using stably transformed tobacco BY-2 cells. Notably, the authors show that the method is also useful in finding potential inhibitors against enzymes catalyzing upstream reactions in the MEP pathway of IPP/DMAPP biosynthesis. On this basis, the assay is a welcome addition to existing high-throughput screening assays using photometry. The paper is well written and nicely illustrated. I congratulate the authors on their findings.
