The authors made some superficial changes to version 1, but version 2 still have problems with the supplemental data table. There are columns with no values! And they still list proteins identified with "0" peptides. If no peptides were confidently identified, how can the protein be identified? Before drawing conclusions from the manuscript, readers should consult the supplementary data files and make their own conclusions.
