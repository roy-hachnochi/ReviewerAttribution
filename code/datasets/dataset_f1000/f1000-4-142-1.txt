In general terms, this article contributes to unraveling the complex genetic architecture of NSCL/P. This type of systematic reviews are always relevant due to the fact that they pooled several singles trials, and therefore, the sample sizes have an important increase. However, this article needs some modifications that avoid to be published in its current version: All of the gene acronyms may be written italics. The title says "Is MTHFD1 polymorphisms..." but it refers to only one SNP. The Materials and Method section includes the quality analysis of each paper included in this meta-analysis, but Results section did not mentioned anything about this analysis. The publication bias analysis when 10 articles is not statistically resolved (see Egerss paper), so for this meta-analysis it is necessary at least a comment about this issue. The first two paragraph of the Discussion section are almost the same as the Introduction. I think that the Discussion could include a comment about maternal genotype effects in order to explain the negative results of this analysis.
