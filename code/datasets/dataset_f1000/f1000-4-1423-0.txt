Please provide more details of airway management i.e. difficulty level. Was it predicted and preparation done before inducing anaesthesia? Please provide detail (positive or negative ) for any other additional comorbidities - structural or functional. Please mention duration of surgery, need of any NMB drugs, other analgesia, hemodynamic status intraoperatively. Since the title says anaesthetic management as well, It would be good if authors could add an table for various perioperative concerns in such child and their suggestions for the management.
