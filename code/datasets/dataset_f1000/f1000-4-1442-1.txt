In our opinion, this is a very useful output. The mapping of student and teacher responses against the representation of research within the English national curriculum provides a robust comparison, and the description of the perceptions of students as to the meaning of research is really interesting. The title might better describe the study if it specifically says ‘scientific’ research instead of research. Whilst the authors discuss the other uses of the word research, the questions and answers are specifically in relation to scientific research. We do not particularly like ‘it’s’ in the first line of the abstract. We would also like to see a more clear concluding sentence in the abstract. The study is thorough and the number of participants impressive. It would be interesting to note if all students were taking science, particularly at KS5. We assume they were. Were all the teachers Science teachers? Perhaps a little information within the introduction, as to what other sections of society think of research, might be useful. What do non-scientist adults think for example? There are some interesting reports on this that may help the reader understand the results within the context of society. The mapped curriculum using the Brew descriptors is very interesting. However, the results need more discussion: currently there is very little to describe what they mean, their context, and what, if any, conclusions can be drawn from that analysis. Can the authors evidence their assumption that students have a greater understanding of meta-analysis of data by KS5 than earlier on in their school journey? Or is it a speculative comment. This could be made clearer. How do the findings about the practice of ‘research’ in schools relate to the ‘nature of science’ debate? We also wonder how findings from this study would compare to findings using undergraduates at different stages in their degrees?
