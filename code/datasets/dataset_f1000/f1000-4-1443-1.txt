The article by Moreews et al. describes a registry of bioinformatic tools images that are portable using Docker technology. The manuscript is well written and describes well the aims of the BioShaDock registry and it's possible interactions with the ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry as the means to find Docker containers in the wild. As pointed out in the abstract, other Docker registries exists, such as Docket HUB, but lack of curation and user engagement hampers their progress. Furthermore,BioShaDock provides user management at a level required for ensuring that the interoperability between the registries, images and local environments is secure, auditable and effective. The article describes well the overheads associated with typical software installations and maintenance and presents a balanced view on the advantages of using Docker to manage this processes. Although not perhaps within the scope of this article, this reviewer feels it would be useful to inform the readership of other alternatives to Docker; e.g. Rocket, DrawBridge and LXD from Canonical and FlockPort, as it is clear that Docker is still maturing and it is certainly not the only container available today.
