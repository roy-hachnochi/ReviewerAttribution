The current article is a very thorough review of the complement system and is nicely put in the context of lupus. Besides the known functions of complement factors in opsonization and immune complex clearance, it would be nice to add a short paragraph on less conventional mechanisms of action of some complement factors such as lipid binding, a topic of high relevance when one discusses apoptotic cell clearance and the relationship between the complement and coagulation systems. The intracellular functions of C3 would also be worth discussing.
