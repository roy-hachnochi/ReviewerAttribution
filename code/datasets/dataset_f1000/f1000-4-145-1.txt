Bao et al . review the complement system in Lupus Nephritis and provided updated literature survey on the field. The review is well written over all. Some things which needs to be addressed are as follows: Title of the review is very generic, which does not elicit interest in the reader. A large part of the introduction was dedicated to explaining complement system. Description of the main steps would do a better job. Individual lupus models should be grouped under three animal models to provide a clearer view to the readers about these three models. The review ends abruptly with description on efforts and interests of authors regarding conducting a failed clinical trial. Lack of a take home message and valid conclusions.
