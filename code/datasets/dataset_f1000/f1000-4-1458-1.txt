The authors examine the effect of pre transplant TREC levels and outcome of hematopoietic transplantation. TRECs are new thymic emigrants and are related to thymic function. Critique The authors confirm the findings reported by Clave et al ten years ago (their reference 24), that higher pre transplant TREC levels are associated with less GVHD, fewer infections and better survival.

Blood. 2005; 105(6): 2608â€“2613. These findings are not surprising in that improved thymic function would enhance immune reconstitution, which would be expected to be protective against infection. Thymic dysregulation occurs with GVHD.
