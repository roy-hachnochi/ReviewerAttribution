I think after the previous corrections the article is much more readable. It would be extremely helpful if the authors could update the manuscript with hyperlinks to concrete databases/examples and to provide a concrete example to illustrate their point about 'The amount of actual code a user needs to write is reduced, especially for more complicated models'. I strongly believe one of the roadblocks to a more widespread use of markup languages and the reusability of code is the perceived challenge by modellers/users of the task(s) involved into make their models 'shareable' and 'reusable'. A contrast between 2 examples or simply a better description of the effort it would concretely entail, would make their case much clearer. This isn't absolutely necessary for the article but since the authors are trying to make a point and for other researchers to use the tools they have developed and use for their own research, I believe this would be useful.
