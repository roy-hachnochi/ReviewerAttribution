Thank you for revising the manuscript. It was nice reading it. I only have a few minor things to note Last sentence of first paragraph in the introduction: I suggest to generalise the sentence and cut "for multi-scale modeling". Also, I think it should be "uses" instead of "use". Last sentence of first paragraph in Methods: "MPC currently is executed as command line utility" - I would write "as a command line utility". in Methods, in the listing of the three components, I suggest to remove "not procedural like Fortran or Matlab", as it is hard to follow the sentence structure and the information not essential. Also, is MML really designed to solve equations? Or rather to provide the information to solve them? in Methods, second point in the above listing: You mention several models ("For example, there have been a variety of models...") - would it be possible to link to these specific works, e.g., using citations? Last sentence on page 3: "A "library" with a few..." - I think it should read "in our next step" (instead of "in out next step") End of first paragraph on page 4: "Species A enters, with flow F, a compartment... I had problems following the sentence, specifically because of "passive exchange between"... Can simplify the sentence structure or use two sentences instead? First sentence in Discussion: Should it be "Though an MPC-generated..." (instead of "a")? same paragraph: "These are key steps towards reproducibility and the VVUQ process." I would have found it helpful to get a reference to the VVUQ process. Can you add one? Grant information, last sentence: Please use a capital letter to start the sentence, and add two "the" - "The grants supported the whole group."
