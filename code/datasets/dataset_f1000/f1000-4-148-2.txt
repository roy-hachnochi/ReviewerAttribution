Kristina and Cavnar present data to validate two commercial antibodies for HSA-associated protein X-1 in a human neutrophil cell line. The authors describe the conditions for the experiments as well as provide sufficient information/protocols for reader about the conditions used in that assays. In addition, the authors present the entire blots and describe the secondary bands that were detected. Only minor changes in the text should be made (below). The commercial source of the antibody should be listed in the abstract. It currently gives the impression that the antibodies used in the study were generated by the authors. The electrophoretic transfer conditions should be listed. Transfer buffer contents (%MeOH) as well as the model of transfer equipment (dry, semi-dry) will cause variability in protein transfer/antibody detection. Did the authors attempt to vary blocking conditions (milk, commercial blocking agents)? Is purified HAX1 available to use as a positive control or to build a standard curve for quantifying total HAX1 in the samples? Not necessary for this publication but would be extremely useful. Figure 3B suggests that detection is close to linear (especially with LiCor technology). Authors should denote the size of bands on an SDS-PAGE as "relative mobility." For example, a band with a relative mobility of 32 kDa was detected... In Figure 3, change "After transfer, the membrane was cut.." To "the membrane was divided" Are the authors certain that the band detected by the secondary antibody is the lower of the two bands in the experiments? A single lane could be divided and one side probed with primary and the other with only secondary to confirm.
