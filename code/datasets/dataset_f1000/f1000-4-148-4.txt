The work presented by Kristina and Cavnar presents data validating two commercial antibodies raised against Hax1. Their experimental approach is well explained and there is a good description of the methods and reagents used. The data is also convincing and well presented, I particularly liked the fact that complete blots are shown and knockdown used to show specificity. Overall, it is a very strong example of an antibody validation paper. I believe the manuscript is suitable for indexing subject to a few fairly minor changes, which are detailed below: I would make it clear that the antibodies are commercially available in the abstract. It would be worth double checking that details are provided for all of the western blotting reagents and methods. There is plenty of evidence that small changes can alter antibody behaviour and it really helps those trying to reproduce the work. One thing I noticed is that I dont think the contents of Laemmli loading buffer are spelt out, does it have reducing agent in it? Another example is how long were secondaries incubated for? Figure 3- Is the quantification based on one or more experiments- this should be clear in the legend. Dataset 1- should be and not . I was interested in the background which appears to be caused by the secondary antibodies. The authors state it is due to the anti-rabbit antibody, but it seems there is at least some with the anti-mouse staining? I would be interested if this is common with this cell line or is it this set of secondaries- I think this would be worth briefly mentioning in the discussion. The authors should present the quantification of the knockdown (figure 4). If both antibodies are specific then you would predict that they will show roughly similar levels of reduction in signal. This would suggest that the remaining signal is caused by a lack of knockdown rather than low levels of non-specific staining.
