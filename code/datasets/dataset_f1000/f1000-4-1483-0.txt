 General This is an unusual topic, and the literature available on the topic is sparse. There is a large review by Basurko et al. (2009) on over 50 women from 2009 that has not been referenced. Specific There are unclear sentences that require more detail e.g.: “hospital where she was confirmed to have Dengue with warning signs.” – what specific warning signs did she present with? “The mother and newborn were transferred to the waiting room for observation.” – this is likely a translation confusion, do the authors mean that she was moved to a monitored bed? “A uterine atony and a first-degree vaginal tear were recorded, leading to the loss of about 200 ml of blood.” How were they managed? In the discussion – please provide more detail about Dengue fever and how PPH may be related, identified, managed.
