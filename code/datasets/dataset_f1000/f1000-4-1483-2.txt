This was an interesting case report for those not familiar with clinical cases of Dengue fever, although postpartum hemorrhage is not unexpected in a woman with multiple risk factors including multiparity, polyhydramnios, absent antenatal care and Dengue-induced thrombocytopenia. The report is well written apart from a few English phrases that are not quite correct (check first couple of sentences of the Discussion for example). I think it would be helpful to mention other diagnostic features (neutropenia, bradycardia, positive tourniquet test and full laboratory assessment). Perhaps also some more detail about the time course / natural history of Dengue with respect to pathologies. The decision to use a precious resource such as platelets after postpartum hemorrhage had resolved with oxytocic therapy may not have been appropriate and a caveat should be included.
