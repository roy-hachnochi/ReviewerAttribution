The Drosophila eye gene regulatory network ranks among the best textbook examples of organogenetic GRNs. FlyODE, by Koestler and colleagues is a welcomed attempt at integrating the many bits of expression, regulation, molecular interactions and functional analyses obtained to date, by providing a cytoscape-like tool in the form of a curated, directed graph network. FlyODE’s also allows the expansion of this network through community-based contributions –which is a great philosophy. Therefore FlyODE is a valuable tool for those working on gene networks in general and on fly eyes in particular, and will help in expanding the network (and our knowledge of the system) further. FlyODE includes references to spatial gene expression patterns. It would be good if the authors tried to unify the somehow ambiguous terms used by different labs, such as “preproneural/precursors/anterior to the MF” or “proneural/immediately anterior to the MF”, or perhaps provide some “equivalence” terms. When sorting genes according to their expression along third instar, I found that the network includes more genes at early L3 than at mid-L3, which shouldn’t be the case –as the process unfolds more genes are called into action.
