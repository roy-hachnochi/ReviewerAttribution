This is a very nice and useful tool to quickly and efficiently access information about fly retina development. The fact that it can be extended to any tissue and is an open platform for community-based annotation makes it all the more useful. I applaud the authors for their efforts and thank them for making such a cool and intuitive tool available. The video tutorial is very nice and helpful as well.
