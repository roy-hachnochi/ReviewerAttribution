FlyOde is a very nice resource for labs, which are interested in visualizing developmental dynamics of gene regulatory networks required for the development for many neuronal types in the Drosophila eye, in addition to finding lineage specific markers. It will be valuable in the future to expand this to other sensory systems such as the olfactory system. The title and the abstract are appropriate. The video presentation is very useful.
