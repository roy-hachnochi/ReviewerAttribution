This is an interesting reflection on the evolution of a programme of study through the introduction of emerging digital technologies. Although in themselves adoption of none of the technologies discussed would today be considered innovative this paper presents a useful commentary on the pros and cons of adopting each through the experiences of a teaching team who have themselves clearly been innovators in their adoption. My only concern is that in reading the paper I was left wanting more details about the technologies involved and about the evaluation of their effectiveness. I acknowledge however that this paper is an opinion piece/commentary rather than an empirical study and that the reader can access the information required if they follow the citations that are included. Should the authors feel it necessary to provide more information in a second version of the paper there are a few minor typographical errors that could be corrected (but these do not currently impact negatively upon the paper).
