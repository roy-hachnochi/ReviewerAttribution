Echocardiography is an informative method for examination of cardiac structures and not dispensable in examination of athletes. Dr Grazioli focused his paper on analysis of left and right ventricle and did it well. Right and left atrial dimensions 1 - 3 (and function 3 , 4 ), aortic dimension 5 , 6 (and stiffness 5 , 7 ) or pulmonary dimensions and function 8 were not focused in this initial article of the sports cardiology channel because it is problematic to start with and to write a complete update with the burden of complete echocardiographic potential/possibilities. In one of his own papers he described alterations of aortic valve/pulmonary valve/mitral valve in athletes and aortic root dilatation or severe pulmonary stenosis 9 . Echocardiography was recommended for screening of athletes under different circumstances 10 , 13 and particularly for follow up 14 , 15 examinations. The possibilities of strain echocardiography were discussed in the past 16 , 17 and we look forward to new. The global longitudinal strain has better reproducibility 18 , the potential of radial strain seems to be limited in examination of training effects 19 . I recommend indexing of this article with the option to write an update with further possibilities and importance of echocardiography in the examinations of atrial function/valve and aortic function including 3D echocardiography and the further analysis of recreational athletes 20 and importance of follow-up examinations 21 , 22 . The advantage of this sports cardiology channel is the possibility for updating papers with new literature and information and to actualize the growing knowledge in sports cardiology. References 1.
