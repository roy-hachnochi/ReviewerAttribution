This review summarizes some important aspects of echocardiography as a screening tool for the screening of athletes and should therefore be of interest for sports physicians and cardiologists. The potential advantages of this method and the technical aspects are well described. I would nevertheless recommend to mention potential problems too, mainly overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis with important consequences for the career of athletes and additional costs. In order to prevent overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis, intensive training of sports cardiologists seems to be of utmost importance. Furthermore, as research in this area often focuses on young, competitive athletes, I would recommend to discuss the potential value of echocardiography for older, non-competitive, recreational athletes. I recommend indexing after minor revision.
