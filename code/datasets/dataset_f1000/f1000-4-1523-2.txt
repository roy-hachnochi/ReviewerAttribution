The article by Sharma and group, is one of the first reports on mosquito-microbe-plant interaction, defining the molecular relations of how mosquitoes might have evolved from herbivores to blood feeders. In fact this is a long standing question in the insect communities, where this report supports the idea that mosquitoes may have acquired the plant genes for specific functions. Although the functions of the genes are yet to be established, observation of photosynthetic genes and microbes, appears to facilitate the photo-light meditated responses, probably in feeding and/or mating. To the best of my knowledge and experience the behavior of this mosquito species ( Anopheles culicifacies ) is quite complex compared to other malarial vector species. The most interesting part is that the homology search analysis of PLTs reveals the name of many local plant species which commonly grown in plain areas of rural India. I believe these observations will serve as a basis for new leads for authors to understand how mosquito-plant interactions facilitated this mosquito species to evolve to feed and adapt in plain agricultural areas.
