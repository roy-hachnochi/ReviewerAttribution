This review article by Thurman and Serkova is a well-written, thorough, interesting review of the potential of newer, noninvasive imaging techniques to follow disease activity in lupus. The preliminary experiments of the authors (references 8 and 80) showing the utility of this technology in mouse models is the most interesting part. The article would benefit from much more detail of these experiments, perhaps with images if that would be illustrative. However, is there any preliminary data to suggest this approach would work in the brain, as well as kidneys? Similarly, more detail of the predictive power of blood tests in patients with SLE to predict outcomes would be illustrative I suspect these biomarkers do relatively poorly. Would the techniques of labeling complement, Abs, cells, etc. have applicability to other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases? It is not entirely clear at first that the paramagnetic nanoparticles described on page 6 are the same as listed under MRI for figure 1. The paramagnetic nature of the technology should be described better in the section that correlates with Figure 1.
