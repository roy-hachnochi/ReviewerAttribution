This well-written review article by Thurman and Serkova focuses on the utility and the potential of non-invasive imaging techniques to monitor two common yet severe manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lupus nephritis (LN) and neuro-psychiatric SLE (NPSLE). The authors summarize the clinical challenges posed by the unpredictable course of SLE, explain the need for better biomarkers of disease activity in LN and NPSLE, critically review both the utility and limitations of conventional radiologic imaging, and discuss the promise of molecular imaging for monitoring LN and NPSLE. Minor points to consider: When introducing lupus nephritis (page 3), the WHO classification is mentioned only in passing. More detail will help orient the reader and provide context when discussing "proliferative LN" in the next paragraph. Page 4, when discussing particular autoAbs associated with LN, the authors may consider referencing very recent studies identifying IgG2 autoAbs to alpha-enolase or annexin AI are a major component of immune deposits in kidney biopsies from LN patients ( Bruschi et al , 2014 ). Page 5, C3b and C3d are introduced without providing much background information how this fragments arise. On page 3, paragraph 7: NPLSE should be NPSLE.
