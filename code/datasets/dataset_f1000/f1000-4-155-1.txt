I do not have expertise in transcript assembly, but I can comment on the general readability and usability of the article and tool suite. As with the report from Dr. Charoensawan, I was expecting that the tool suite would be more integrated and documented than the collection of Perl scripts on the Github page . Nevertheless, the set of examples shown in the article I think are useful at showing the kinds of errors which arise from transcript assembly and presumably it is easy to use the scripts to identify such examples. The README is currently very minimal for a tool suite / integrated workflow, looking more like a set of comments above code rather than proper documentation of a tool suite. I would recommend changing from README to README.md, using Github markdown e.g. enclosing the commands in backticks , re-writing the comments as full sentences/paragraphs, separating the different steps by sub-headings, etc. A little effort here will make the landing page much more appealing. Also the documentation on the Github page should provide detailed information on the expected inputs and outputs. The colors in Figure 1 make the text a bit hard to read. As Figure 1 is often where many readers will go to understand what you are doing, you would benefit from making the colors lighter so the text is easier to read, and removing unnecessary shading, 3D effects, etc.
