The authors have addressed most of my previous comments. However, I still have one reservation on the use of Arabidopsis "proteome" (instead of of publicly available transcriptomes) as a benchmark for walnut transcripts found, in the section "Identifying highly transcribed genes that are not present in the Arabidopsis proteome". It would be useful if the authors could clarify this.
