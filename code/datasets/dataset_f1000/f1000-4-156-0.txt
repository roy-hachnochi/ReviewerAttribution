This is a first report that connects olfactory receptors to 1-octen-3-ol in a Culex mosquito to behavioral response. In addition, both enantiomers were shown to be repellents. Interestingly the response in the Culex quinquefasciatus contrasts with that seen in Anopholes and Aedes mosquitoes. The adaptive explanation for the contrast between species remains to be explained. This paper reports many important steps towards understanding the mechanisms underlying the behavioral response.
