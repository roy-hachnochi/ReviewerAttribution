I would like to accept this short review after the author makes improvements described below. For better contrast to the following sentence, the word should be inserted between the elimination of and germinal stem cells in the sentence Heat-induced bam expression caused elimination of germinal stem cells while somatic stem cell numbers were not changed in the third section. The author should reconfirm that the references 12 and 13 are appropriately cited. The author stated that Phosphorylated Mad (pMad) is an indirect indicator of BMP signaling. However, unlike the case of various reporter genes, I think that pMad is a indicator because it is directly phosphorylated by BMP type I receptors. At the position of citation of reference #21, the author should also cite two original papers that first described Drosophila intestinal stem cells, i.e. Ohlstein Spradling (2006) and Micchelli and Perrimon (2006) . It would be nice if the author concretely indicate some representative factors that are commonly used in all stem cells at the position of reference #22. I think that most of readers in this field have great interest in this recent discovery.
