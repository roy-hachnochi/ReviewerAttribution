CPIRD: A successful Thai programme to produce clinically competent medical graduates This research describes differences in GPA and MLE scores of medical students that enter the program through three different mechanisms. These mechanisms seem to have an impact on initial scores, but become comparable at the end of the program. Comments: This paper is integral in future implementation of intervention programs designed to retain health forces in rural areas. Through this analyses, the authors have shown that clinical experience is as valuable as the curriculum. Minor revisions are suggested below. Page 1 Is there a rationale as to why step one MLE scores of the CPIRD group was significantly lower for only cohorts 2003 and 2006 but not 2004 and 2005? Figure 1 This figure shows that national track students have the best GPAs overall. It seems to contradict the statements in the introduction and discussion that mention direct track students do better than national track. It would be useful to address this discrepancy in the discussion. Page 3: Is there information on how many students in CPIRD first try to attend medical school through the national or direct tracks? For the study site, please include the university where the study took place Page 4: Is there any particular reason why the CPIRD group contains more females? Did this change over time? If so, it might be useful to include gender as a covariate in the model as this might influence the trajectory of the scores. Table 3: Please indicate the test used to obtain p-values in the table legend. It might also be useful to bold the Cohort 2003..etc to make the table a bit easier to read Level of Interest: An article of importance in its field
