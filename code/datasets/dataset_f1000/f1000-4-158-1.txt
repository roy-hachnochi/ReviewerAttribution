This manuscript generates concrete evidence to support the WHO 2010 recommendation focusing on the graduates competencies. To disseminate this academic proof is important and useful for both national and global audiences. However, there are some minor points could be improved for paper quality, as follows Table 1, please check of the national track column. The total percent must be 100.0%. As for the MLE pass rate, the was students who did not pass the exam on only the first attempt of that test, correct? Please describe more. Discussion: Authors introductory mentioned the WHO global policy recommendations on increasing access to health workers in remote and rural areas through improved retention and want to prove the competencies or performance of that implementation. In order to link this evidence to policy recommendation, authors may consider to add some sentences using this key finding to support the global recommendation implementation, esp. Students from rural backgrounds and Clinical rotations in rural areas during studies which are the key characteristic of CPIRD. Further more, authors could also consider to mention the WHO recommendations on transforming and scaling up health professionals education and training, 2013 which has recommended for targeted admissions policies to increase the socio-economic, ethnic and geographical diversity of students and the expansion of faculty through recruitment of community-based clinicians and health workers as educators, as well.
