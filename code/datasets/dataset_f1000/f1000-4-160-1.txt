In the age of precision medicine with an expanding number of oncogenic drivers in lung cancers that may be treated with targeted agents, multiplexed genomic testing is increasingly important in clinical practice. The study by Ramteke et al. describes a rapid and relatively inexpensive multiplexed test for EGFR and KRAS mutations. The methods are well described and the test is of clinical relevance, particularly in settings with limited resources and without access to tumor next generation sequencing. I recommend making the following minor revisions: In the introduction, it is incorrect to suggest that the reason for KRAS testing in lung cancers is to preclude patients from EGFR inhibitors. The rationale for EGFR inhibitors in lung cancers is very different to that of colorectal cancers, as activating EGFR mutations in lung cancers predict response to EGFR TKIs. However, it is still important to test all lung cancers for KRAS mutations as it is a common oncogenic driver occuring in over 25% of lung adenocarcinomas. Being a driver KRAS is highly unlikely to co-exist with other actionable drivers, therefore once KRAS is found one could justify that further genomic testing for other drivers is not necessary, especially in a resource limited setting. It should be acknowledged that the authors' CRE method will not capture all KRAS mutations, especially KRAS mutations in exon 3 codon 61. However, the ability to capture the majority of KRAS and EGFR mutations in one single inexpensive test is still of value for patients with lung cancers.
