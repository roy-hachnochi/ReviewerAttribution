This is an interesting paper which addresses an important issue in joint replacement. My comments /questions are as follows: With several confounding variables it is not possible to draw robust generalizable conclusions without a much larger dataset (ie 100+ cases). This casts doubt on some of the comparisons that are deemed not statistically significant. The authors state that a difference of at least 20% must be present between group averages for the comparison to be valid (ie adequately powered). Such a large value makes many of the comparisons impossible to generalize to other populations and reports. The challenge with using clinical radiographs is guaranteeing the rotation of the femur projected on each AP exposure. As canal dimensions are sensitive to rotation, how was this achieved in this study? Gender, age, and to some extent, race, have been widely documented as fundamentally affecting the shape of the femur. Therefore these variables must be treated separately as nominal variables and cannot be simply assumed to be in the analysis. This is particularly challenging due to the differential interactions of age and gender that occur because of the effect of menopause on female cortical morphology. Please describe how this challenge was handled in the statistical analysis which seems to lump all cases together.
