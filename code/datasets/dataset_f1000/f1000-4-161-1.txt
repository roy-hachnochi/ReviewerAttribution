The only suggestion I have is to either call the cortical thickness measurement exactly what it is, or explain its limitations correctly. It is a measure of the average thickness of the medial and lateral cortices from the radiographic view in the coronal plane. Or, it is an estimate of the average thickness under the assumptions that the bone is circular in cross-section at this location and the thickness of the cortex is uniform throughout the cross-section. I think #1 is the best choice because neither of the assumptions given in #2 are true, and it can be misleading to label that measurement an average of the total cortical thickness.
