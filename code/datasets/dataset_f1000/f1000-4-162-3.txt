Sarbu et al. review the utility of MRI imaging in neuropsychiatric lupus (NPL) both what is available today in routine care and for research purposes and what might become useful in clinical care in the future. In NPL clinicians are interested in three major questions. First, is there evidence of NPL at any time in the past; secondly, is there evidence of active NPL currently; and thirdly can you demonstrate change over time with or without treatment in NPL. In terms of the first question Sarbu et al. review the conventional MRI findings in the cortical, subcortical and spinal cord regions. However the nature of the morphologic changes is non specific and many could be compatible with hypertension, amyloid, Alzheimers etc. and thus may not be helpful to the clinician. Even the advanced techniques (not universally available) measuring brain volume and composition are not specific for SLE. In terms of the second question Sarbu et al. review Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) which allows the analysis of brain metabolites. The demonstration of the uptake of specific metabolites might in the future be associated with neuron excitation but no studies are available in NPL. Perfusion imaging such as also done with SPECT and PET scanning can reveal areas of hyper or hypoperfusion but thus far no studies demonstrating active NPL which could change over time exists. In conclusion, this article is a good review of what currently exists and what may be developed over time with MRI imaging. The authors conclude that further clinical association studies with conventional and advanced techniques are required before MRI imaging will become the standard to understand the mechanism, diagnosis and monitoring of NPL.
