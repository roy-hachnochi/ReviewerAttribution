This is a well-powered and inclusive study, providing evidence that treatment with cyclophosphamide and prednisolone effectively limits signs of CNS lupus in a well-known spontaneous mouse model of lupus; the NZBxNZWF1 model. Despite a few missing words and misspellings, the manuscript is well-written and the conclusions are supported by the data. Minor comments: In discussion it is claimed that "the microarray technique.." was used for determining relevant gene transcript levels in brain tissue, however in the methods section a real-time RT-PCR analysis is described. Please comment and correct accordingly. Please read the manuscript, in particular the introduction, for complete sentences and rewrite as needed.
