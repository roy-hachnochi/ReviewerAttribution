This paper by Walekhwa and colleagues presents data on the immunogenicity of PCV10 among infants and their biological mothers attending the Mbagathi District Hospital in Kenya. This is an interesting study but I have several concerns as it is currently written: The authors should reconcile the sample size of 384 calculated with 318 actually recruited to determine whether the study is adequately powered for the primary outcomes of the study. The IgG data is presented in a confusing way – first the units mg/dl is different to how researchers in the field would report this (as g/ml or mg/L). The 0.35 mg/dl cut-off the authors state as protective equates to 3.5g/ml which is 10-fold above the actual protective threshold for PCVs (0.35g/ml). This also needs to be corrected in the Introduction section (paragraph 4, line 6). The data should be reflected in this format to improve clarity. Secondly, there is no serotype-specific IgG values reported which suggests this may be a total anti-pneumococcal IgG assay? This may explain the IgG values reported. However, the reference cited by the authors for the pneumococcal ELISA should be different as this does not include any ELISA data or method. The authors should provide information on what type of ELISA was performed on these samples. I also suggest reporting the data as GMC +/- 95% CI and the % responding ≥ 0.35 g/ml. In some instances in the results section, the p-values are reported as p0.05 or p0.01 when it should be p0.05 and p0.01. Please check throughout for consistency and in the abstract. Demographics of the infants and their mothers also need to be included. A Table or summary of the results for the statistical analyses, especially for the data on alcohol consumption and breastfeeding should be included in the Results section.
