Exploratory data analysis, visualization, and hypothesis generation in genomics are essential tools. Methods and software that are clear, robust, and easily accessible are rare and very important to biomedical researchers. I found the approach described in Constellation Map intuitive and visually appealing. The statistical methods were reasonable, I would have liked to also see the possibility of metrics based on likelihood models, the kernel density estimation does go a bit in that direction. I was able to use the software. I would have liked for there to be an R version to download from cran as well as some vignettes independent of GenePattern. That said this work is useful and in my opinion some thought went into the visualization.
