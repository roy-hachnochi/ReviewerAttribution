The software that Mesirov and colleagues developed is designed to help scientists interpret the results of their gene set enrichment analysis results. They have developed a useful tool for visualizing the different datasets that emerge and organizing them with relation to each other. The software organizes the gene sets so that those that are most relevant are close to the origin and those that have similar patterns are close to each other. Those with overlapping datasets are indicated with lines between the dots. The metrics used by the software were well-selected, and the visualization approach should make it intuitive for users to gather valuable information about their data. Use of this software will likely allow scientists to gain more biological insights from GSEA analyses of their datasets.
