This is a timely topic and the report is well organized however I have a number of major concerns. First, the tone of the report is not well balanced, and provides harsh criticism of naturopathy but with insufficient exploration of potential benefits. Secondly, there are numerous criticisms of naturopathy which are offered as statements of fact that in reality are unsubstantiated, or incorrect. For example, the author states: “With arthritis and depression, for example, there can be a specific dysfunction in a single body system. Conventional medicine has treatments of proven effectiveness that target the problem. In these cases treating the whole body will likely lead to poorer outcomes.” In reality, these two conditions are often recalcitrant to conventional therapies, and may be appropriate areas for including complementary therapies. As another example, the author states: “There is no credible evidence that detoxification treatments, such as dietary changes, consumption of herbs and supplements, fasting, or colonic irrigation, can remove toxins from the body or lead to improved health. These beliefs seem to be based on little more than speculation.” Yet there is evidence in the biomedical literature of reductions in inflammatory markers associated w/ fasting, and Ayurvedic medicine provides a long tradition, therapeutic rationale, and vast body of anecdotal evidence supporting the use of such detoxification procedures. Finally, it is unclear what the real purpose of the article might be. Is this an attempt to encourage dialogue between naturopaths and conventional clinicians? Is the purpose to educate conventional clinicians about the role, and limits, or naturopathy? Is the purpose to simply criticize naturopathy? What could be a constructive message, or contribution, for the essay? I think the project has excellent potential once this issue is clarified.
