This is an interesting and well-presented paper that uses transgenic (Podo-DTR) mice to demonstrate (1) that continuing podocyte dysfunction is a key abnormality in proteinuric disease and (2) following specific podocyte injury captopril protects against progressive long-term renal damage. However there are a number of issues with the manuscript. Three transgenic lines with positive PCR results for the transgene were established (Podo-DTR 47, 57 and 21) by the authors two of which (47 and 57) were susceptible to the DT. However instead of comparing the 2 lines with wild type mice, different lines are used for different experiments. The model characterization uses mainly Line 47 but experiments using captopril are done exclusively in Line 57. What happens to mice from Line 47 treated with captopril-does it have the same protective effect to that seen in Line 57? The authors should confirm that the DTR protein is indeed exclusively expressed in the podocyte. The authors do not explain why there is such a wide spread in the ages of the mice (3-12 months) used. Does not ageing introduce unneeded variability into the study that may confound some of the effects seen? There is variability in the doses of DT used in each experiment that makes the results difficult to compare. For example in figure 5 for tail cuff blood pressure and urine albumin:creatine ratio 1ng/g bw was used but for glomerulosclerosis and kidney histology studies animals were treated with 5ng/g bw. Furthermore kidney histology for Line 57 in figure 3 uses 1ng/g bw but in figure 7 it is 5ng/g bw. Why the lack of consistency? In figure 4 control mice for PodDTR line 47 are reported to have 10 podocytes/GCS whilst those for PodDTR line 47 in figure 8 have 8.2 podocytes/GCS. Why the discrepancy between the two lines? At what age were the samples taken for figure 6 and 7 and what dose of DT was used in figure 8?
