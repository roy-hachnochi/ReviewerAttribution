In this study, the authors established a new mouse model of inducible podocyte injury. They also showed that ACEi treatment effectively attenuated proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in this model. Similar to previous reported models, this model also reproducibly develops progressive glomerulosclerosis. The data are confirmative, but this model will be an alternative useful model for podocyte injury. Compared to hCD25 transgenic mouse model (NEP25), podocyte injury is relatively mild. The time course of ACR in line 47 (Figure 2a) appears to be similar to that of NEP25 injected with 0.625 ng/g BW of LMB2. Generally, the study is well done, and the data are properly presented. There are only some minor concerns. It would be better to present HB-EGF mRNA or protein expression data. Is the transgene actually expressed selectively in podocytes? Is the sensitivity of toxin parallel to transgene expression among three lines? Data among three or more groups should be analyzed by ANOVA or some other methods to reduce type 1 error. Generally, urinary ACR shows logarithmic normal distribution. These data should be properly transformed before analysis. Figure 5b data should be analyzed by mixed effect model or other appropriate methods. In wild-type C57BL/6 mice younger than 10 months of age, glomerulosclerosis is very rare. The wild-type control mice treated with ACEi, 7% of glomeruli showed segmental sclerosis. Is this senile change? If so, more detailed information of mouse age would be presented, or consider deleting aged mice from the experiment. Please indicate what the bottom and top of the box and whisker represent in Figure 8. The authors state that ACEi was not advantageous for podocyte preservation. I do not agree on this statement. It is just a matter of statistical power. The protective effect by ACEi is small relatively to the variance of podocyte number in each group.
