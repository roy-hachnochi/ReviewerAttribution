This article impressed me. I personally respect the thinking of the author on researches. Referring to mathematics, neuroscience, the systems science, biological systems, evolutionary biology, comparative physiology and artificial intelligence, the author has an open mind and provides us a possible direction and approach to study higher brain functions. Meanwhile I have some different ideas, and I hope the author could consider these: In the introduction section, you have introduced a lot for us, but could you tell us more clearly what’s ‘the necessity of studying higher brain functions from a first-person frame of reference’? About the clinical approach we use now, the limitation you described in this article does not only exist in this approach, it exists on every approach because researchers haven’t found out the mechanism of formation of internal sensations. I can’t understand these sentences you said in this article: ‘It is found that a) locations from which memories can be retrieved gradually shift from the hippocampus to the cortices over several years, and b) patients recover completely after suffering from small strokes at certain locations of the brain . These suggest that the basic structure-function units are spatially defiable and transferable, and that emergent functions can be integrated from multiple locations’, please tell us how you draw your conclusion from this. Could you tell us further information about the relationship between ‘structure-function units’ and ‘views of emergent properties and reductionism’, so we can get a clearer impression, even it’s just an assumption.
