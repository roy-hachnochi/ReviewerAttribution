The paper presents a very valuable functional MRI (fMRI) data set, investigating brain function on the perception of musical genres. It is a very interesting study with music perception of the human brain. The paper is well written and the data presentation is in an excellent fashion. This presentation will allow a further usage of the data even by other scientists. 1. Although its a data paper, I would suggest including at least a few sentences about the motivation of the study. Why is it interesting to study the presented type of stimuli? In which context would it fit into the current state of research? 2. MRI acquisition protocol and subject selection is referred to in a previous paper. As the other reviewer suggests, I would also prefer to read acquisition parameters and subject data in this paper because it plays a central role. 3. As the current manuscript is a data paper, I would suggest to include a characterization of the MRI data quality. I would be happy to see noise parameters of the BOLD images over time. Is the noise stable? It should be possible to present signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise values within a subject over time but also between subjects. This would be very helpful to characterize the data set. I assume that the numbers are excellent compared with 3T data. 4. Theres nothing written about normalization quality. Would it be possible to demonstrate that the normalization was successful for all subjects? It would be great to read some numbers reflecting a normalization quality assessment. 5. I further suggest to present the individual foreground voxel mask images. When they are normalized, the masks can be shown in a single image with different colors showing the number of subjects having foreground in a selected voxel. 6. Are the audio files available? It would be a good idea to offer the stimulus material.
