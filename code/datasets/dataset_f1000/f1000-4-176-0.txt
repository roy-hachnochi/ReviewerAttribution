The review titled “Mitochondrial damage and diseases” has attempted to give an overview of the current literature on the causes of mtDNA damage and its effect in disease and aging. Although the authors seem to have cited a lot of literature in this regard, they have not been able to present their views in a collected manner. The language used is extremely colloquial (e.g. Page 2 “Furthermore, the size of mtDNA is very small (16.6 kb in humans), and mitochondrial codon-usage is also different” and “Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are very reactive oxygen-containing molecules”) and disjointed. In the last paragraph, it is not clear why the authors are suddenly talking about nuclear DNA damage as the review concentrates on mtDNA damage. The authors move from one point to another without clarity of thought and without drawing relevant conclusions supported by multiple references. References are missing in multiple places. There also seem to be some cases of mis-referencing. The authors could discuss a little more in their introduction about the DNA repair pathways that do exist in the mitochondria. From their text, it seems that any damage induced in the mitochondria is never repaired. The authors should also discuss the current techniques that are available for rectifying mtDNA damage like genome editing. This is particularly important as they stress this in their conclusion. Also, they should speculate on the effect of DNA damage, NAD loss, and accelerated aging based on previous literature.
