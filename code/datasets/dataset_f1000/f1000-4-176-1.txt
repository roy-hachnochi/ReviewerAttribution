The article (Review) titled "Mitochondrial DNA damage and diseases" is a good work. However there are certain shortcomings that the authors need to address. In general there is much refinement needed for language The abstract lacks clarity and it doesnâ€™t actually represent the entire article. It needs to be re written The paper is unorganised .The consequences of mitochondrial damage could have been described under various appropriate subheadings, e.g.: Neurodegenrative diseases, Aging, Cardiovascular diseases etc. This could have increased the clarity and quality of this review There also could have been mentioned some details on amelioration of the effects using mitochondria targeted therapies Include recent references
