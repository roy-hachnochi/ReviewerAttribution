This paper provides a straightforward reanalysis of the metagenomic data presented in Greninger et. al . and does not contradict the basic interpretation of the results in that paper. As noted in the exchange of comments on this paper by Greninger et al. and Breitwieser et. al., while Greninger et al . noted the staph and h.flu sequences in the supplementary data, they did not note these in the paper itself or in the table in the supplementary data that provided additional details - despite the fact that these were present in very high proportions. They also didnt report the presence of human sequence. If all these data were presented explicitly and in the main body of Greninger et al ., a reader would be more aware of the challenges of these metagenomic approaches in infectious disease. I hope this paper will encourage this awareness and stimulate discussion so I note the comments on this paper from both sets of authors and I commend Breitwieser et al. for taking the time to respond as they have.
