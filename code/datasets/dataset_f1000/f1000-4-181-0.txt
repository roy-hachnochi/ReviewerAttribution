This article describes work to use ORCID iDs as the basis for synchronization of data between distributed components of a national CRIS system in Portugal. Portugal has very high ORCID coverage because of the mandated use of ORCID iDs for a 2013/2014 research assessment exercise, and thus provides a good test-bed for ORCID iD based synchronization. The background for this work and the architecture used are well described in the introductory sections. My principal criticism of the article is that it describes a formal modeling process, that was used to assess and refine the synchronization strategy, in insufficient detail for a reader assess the correctness of or repeat the analysis. Yet, the description of this modeling process nonetheless introduces a number of formalisms that distract from the flow of the article. Ideally, the description of the formal modeling process would be separated out and then expanded to a point where, along with the Alloy source files, the reader could repeat the analysis (plans to provide these details are mentioned in the conclusion, the article should be updated to link to them when available). Because this is a descriptive software tools article, I feel that this deficiency does not undermine the articles usefulness or conclusions. The later sections of the article describe the prototype implementation, a modest amount of additional work to be completed before a production release, and related work. A number of other issues would benefit from discussion, such as the handling of edits to works in ORCID and other sources; user testing, understanding and acceptance of the system; and limitations on the type of research output included beyond publications. Overall I feel this is a useful and timely description of new work in an evolving area and thus approve it as is. I hope the authors will follow-up with an article evaluating the system in production.
