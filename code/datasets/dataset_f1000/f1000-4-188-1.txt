The authors analysed dry tap during ventriculostomy in the presence of EVD inserted few days before. Their explanations are reasonable. But there might be additional explanations. The EVD was inserted to rule out ex vacuo hydrocephalus. CSF egressed under pressure. Here the authors could insert VP shunt on first occasion (without previous EDV). There is no report on patients condition between EVD and VP insertion. If it improved and remained stable, no significant tension hydrocephalus is expected to evolve. It is my theory that the air was sucked into the ventricles and trapped subdurally at the time of VP shunt insertion when EDV was probably not stopped enough long time before VP insertion. EDV produced some minor negative pressure. During attempts of inserting ventricular catheter of VP shunt produced sucking of the air into the ipsilateral ventricle and trapping it there. Similarly, during trephination of a burr hole for insertion of VP shunt and cutting the dura, some air was sucked subdurally on that side. As slowly evolving postraumatic hydrocephalus is mainly of malabsorptive communicative type, lumbar drainage is less invasive attempt to reveal ex vacuo hydrocephalus than EDV. EDV or LD is stopped cca. 4-6h before inserting VP catheter to reexpand the ventricles and ease targeting.
