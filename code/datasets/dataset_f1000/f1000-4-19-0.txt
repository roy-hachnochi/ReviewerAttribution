This paper is interesting for researcher, and I recommend its indexing with some possible modifications. I think, as a memory researcher, that this paper follows most of its own advice, and explains in a simple and concrete way how to improve manuscripts. Although using all those advice is not easy, as the author writes himself, I think this paper would improve with some concreteness. For example, an example could be added after With respect to scientific writing, if an amusing anecdote is used to help motivate the research question, the anecdoteas an emotional itemmay be remembered well, but if too unrelated to the actual topic of the paper, the reader may later have trouble recalling where they read the anecdote. or Evidence also shows that imageability enhances association learning (Madan et al., 2010), which may make it easier to remember the links between different ideas within the paper later on. Providing illustrations of concepts (e.g., hypothesized results; theoretical models) may also help in this regard. Likewise, less likely to be retained titles for this paper could help those who arent (yet) memory researchers to see the differences between and titles. The sentence In terms of scientific writing, a researcher likely reads many papers over the course of several months, and one that is distinctive and stands out from the rest is more likely to be subsequently remembered and later cited when the researcher is writing their own manuscript. might be speculative. If there is no doubt concerning distinctiveness, the correlation between this memory effect and citations would need more references or some discussion. More explicit explanations and examples concerning the repetition effect could also be interesting for the readers. Should authors write the same (main) message in the article? In the end, despite minors remarks, the paper is very interesting and will probably be useful for many researchers.
