This is an interesting and novel paper, with some very informative data! I have two general comments 1) sometimes scientists are not good at knowing what is interesting/clear due to the curse of knowledge, and that could be tied into this paper (perhaps outsiders are better at choosing interesting titles or summarizing research findings?) 2) there is a strong metacognitive component regarding knowing what other people may or may not remember, and there is a lot of work showing that sometimes rememberers are not good judges of what is memorable. The author talks about primary and recency effects but sometimes people even fail to incorporate serial position effects when making memorability judgments, albeit when studying lists of words (e.g., Castel, 2008), or fail to consider the effects that long retention interval have on memory (see much of Asher Koriats work), even when we might be explicitly aware of these issues in other contexts. Suffice to say that people arent always the best judges of what is memorable, and this might also extend to titles of articles or how to make article memorable. I think these two points could be considered, but overall I enjoyed reading this paper (and wont forget it)!
