The meta-analysis seems to be performed properly, I only have a few remarks concerning mostly the presentation of results. Methods section: 1) It would suggest mentioning explicitly here that: a) a random-effects model was used. b) the DerSimonian-Laird heterogeneity estimator was used. c) a logit- (or log-odds-) transformation was used for the effects. Results section: 2) The forest plot (Fig.2) is somewhat confusing: a) the x-axis should not extend beyond 0 and 1. b) the p-values (and z-values) shown apparently relate to a test of zero log-odds (i.e. a prevalence of 50%), which does not seem to make sense here; these should be dropped. c) it would be good to also show the numbers of events and totals (CAs and CADs) either here or in one of the tables. 3) I do not see why a selection effect would be plausible, and why one would perform Eggers' test here. Would it be plausible that certain results would not be accessible because they would exhibit either a very high or very low CAD prevalence? If not, then the test (and the funnel plot) should probably be omitted. General minor comments: 4) In order to put the results into context, I would suggest to also hint on the order of magnitude of CAD prevalence in non-myxoma populations, or on potential CAD prevalence thresholds that might warrant consequences. 5) The studies in tables I and II (last two rows) are in a different order than in Fig.2
