This article outlines the infrastructure in place at KAUST to support both research outputs, particularly those that are not formally published, and research metrics. While the tools themselves are not new or unique, the implementation at a very young university (established in 2009) and the integration of ORCID into multiple systems makes this article acceptable for the Software Tool section. The abstract is appropriate. The datasets for figures were provided.The article itself is descriptive rather than research, but provides the appropriate context and information for understanding how the systems and tools interact. I would suggest a small change to the title which concentrates on ORCID - the article itself is a bit more broad ranging than that and it might be more appropriate to have a broader title.
