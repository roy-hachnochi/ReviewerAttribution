This article presents information on the reproductive synchrony of 15 Acropora species in the southern Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea. This is a sound study that used well-established sampling techniques, and provides adequate details for the methods, results and findings. Their results showed a high proportion of Acropora colonies (78%) sampled prior to the full moon in June had mature oocytes and suggest that most colonies will spawn in June, with a high probability of multi-species spawning. Most interestingly, their data matched previously spawning records from Eilat, 125km north of their site, providing additional evidence that high levels of spawning synchrony are likely a feature of all speciose coral assemblages. NOTE: While I agree with the authors that it is likely that the colonies with mature (pigmented) oocytes are generally considered to spawn on, or shortly after, the subsequent full moon, conducting follow up surveys in the subsequent months (i.e., July and August) would confirm whether colonies are in fact releasing all of their gametes. In a similar reproductive study conducted in the neighboring Persian Gulf ( Bauman et al., 2011 ) mature colonies were found over four consecutive months suggesting that some colonies are either not releasing mature gametes or that some colonies are spawning twice.
