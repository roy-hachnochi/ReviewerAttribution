The research uses an accepted method of assessing reproductive condition in Acropora colonies. The article clearly and concisely reports the location, species, and number of colonies sampled and provides background context on other coral reproductive sampling in the Red Sea, which combine to bring the reader to the same conclusions as the authors regarding multi-species spawning synchrony in this region. One hopes the authors will find the resources to test their hypothesis that similar levels of Acropora reproductive synchrony would be detected at Eilat using a comparable sampling protocol. Overall, the writing (including title, abstract, and main body of text) is succinct and provides an appropriate level of detail.
