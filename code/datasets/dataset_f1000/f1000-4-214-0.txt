The revised manuscript published 12 Jan 2018, entitled “Temporal order of RNase IIIb and loss-of-function mutations during development determines phenotype in pleuropulmonary blastoma/ DICER1 syndrome: a unique variant of the two-hit tumor suppression model”, provides a significant insight into the correlation between genotype and phenotype in DICER1 syndrome patients. This work will contribute to the growing base of literature to inform the decisions being made as guidelines are being written regarding testing and tumor surveillance for these patients. Recent work from this group and others has demonstrated the occurrence of two distinct types of DICER1 mutations in human tumors: 1) nonsense or frameshift mutations predicted to create a null allele; and 2) “hotspot” mutations occurring on or adjacent to acidic metal-binding residues in the Ribonuclease IIIB domain of DICER1. Here, Brenneman et al. use the large sample size of the International PPB Registry to show that there are in fact three ways to develop a compound heterozygous (null plus hotspot) DICER1 tumor, in decreasing order of frequency: a germline null with a somatic hotspot; a germline mosaic hotspot with a somatic null; or two somatic mutations. However, they provide the significant insight that each of these categories corresponds to a unique clinical severity. In particular, patients with a germline mosaic hotspot appear to develop the most severe disease, presumably because inactivation of the wildtype allele via nonsense or frameshift is a more frequent event than a hotspot mutation.
