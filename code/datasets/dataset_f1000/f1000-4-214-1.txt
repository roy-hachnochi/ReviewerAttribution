We are delighted that the authors pursued additional genetic characterization of unsolved cases and confirmed the presence of mosaic RNASEIIIb domain mutations hotspot mutations, further demonstrating the somatic distribution of these variants and their distinct syndromic presentation. Furthermore, the revised discussion of alternate models of tumorigenesis is representative of the unique tumor suppresor and oncogenic roles of DICER1 mutations. This study is an invaluable resource that establishes the genotype-phneotype spectrum for DICER1 -related disorders and serves as the basis for additional studies into the mechanism of action of pathogenic mutations.
