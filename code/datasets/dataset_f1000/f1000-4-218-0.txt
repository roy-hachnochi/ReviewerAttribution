In this report, Bitam et al. investigated the putative correcting function of TNF in the targeting of DF508-CFTR protein to the plasma membrane. Experiments were performed on two different biological model systems: Hela stable cell lines expressing either wt or DF508-CFTR protein and a more physiologically relevant system, i.e. primary Human Bronchial Epithelial cells (HBE), isolated from bronchial explants of CF and non-CF patients after lung transplantation. In the first part of the study, they not only convincingly showed that TNF increases cell surface expression of F508del-CFTR in HeLa cells but also that it restores the chloride conductance function of CFTR. To prove the physiological relevance of these initial findings the authors performed the same acute treatment on HBE cells and showed that it increases the expression of F508del-CFTR at the plasma membrane in a functional state. More importantly, in this model, acute stimulation of cells with TNF had a long lasting effect, up to 24H, suggesting that TNF could be useful for the treatment of the disease. The second part of the paper is devoted to the search of TNF mechanism of action. Using inhibitors of various signaling pathways they showed that TNF acts at least at two different levels: vesicular trafficking and PKC dependent signaling pathway. Altogether these set of data revealed a very interesting and intriguing correcting function of TNF in the targeting of F508del-CFTR to the plasma membrane. Experimental evidences are statistically robust and well described. The paper is overall well written and discussed and deserves indexation.
