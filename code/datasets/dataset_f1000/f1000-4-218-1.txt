Cystic Fibrosis is one of the most common genetic diseases attributable to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( cftr ) gene which encodes a cAMP-dependent Cl - channel, the CFTR protein present in the apical membrane of numerous epithelia. Inflammation is a hallmark of the disease contributing to its severity and has been suggested to arise independently of bacterial infection. The study by Bitam et al . questions whether mediators of inflammation affect CFTR expression and ion transport function. The most frequent mutation DF508 leads to a functional protein that is prematurely degraded. The authors investigated the effect of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), a proinflammatory cytokine in DF508-CFTR-transfected HeLa cells as well as in human bronchial cells expressing DF508-CFTR in primary culture. In both cases, exposure to TNFa (0.5 50 ng/ml) for 10 min enhanced the maturation of DF508-CFTR with appearance of its glycosylated form at the plasma membrane and CFTR-mediated chloride current inhibitable by the specific CFTR inhibitor (CFTR inh 172). The effect was already observed within 10 min and lasted at least 24 h. It involves binding to TNFa receptor, activation of protein kinase C and vesicular trafficking to the plasma membrane. TNFa induced no change in expression of WT CFTR in control cells. In summary this study shows that TNFa behaves as a corrector molecule. If sustained treatment also lead to similar increased maturation at low dose of TNFa, it could even be considered as a possible additive in the therapeutic armamentarium. The study is very interesting, well done and well-illustrated by confocal microscopy and it certainly deserves indexing.
