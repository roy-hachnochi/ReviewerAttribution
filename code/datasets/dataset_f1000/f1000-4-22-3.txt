This manuscript describes CO association kinetic constant measurements, ‚óè NO decomposition, and molecular dynamics simulations on the wild type truncated Hb from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt-trHbN) and two mutants (VG8F and VG8W) which introduce modifications in the two-tunnel system of the protein. The data are then compared to those from Mt-trHbO, suggesting that ligand migration is regulated by the internal tunnel architecture as well as by water molecules stabilized in the active site. Although the topic of the structure and the dynamic behavior of protein matrix tunnels in truncated Hb, and in particular in Mt-trHbN, has been a lot during the past years, the data reported in this paper add some new information and might be of interest in the field. The paper is well written (with regards to the requirements of the journal) and describes a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Indexing is recommended, if the (few) minor comments below are addressed. Minor remarks: Abstract: line 4 The authors write that possesses tunnels that are partially blocked .. In fact normally trHbOs are associated with internal discrete cavities and not with tunnels. The authors should rephrase the sentence. Abstract: line 11 Mt-trHbN should not be in Italics. Abstract: line 12 The sentence mutations introduce modifications in both tunnel topologies is quite cryptic and it is not clear what the author mean with tunnel topologies. The authors should rephrase the sentence to clarify it. Introduction: page 3, first column, line 8 The authors might want to include a review on trHbs more recent than that indicated in reference (3). There are several of them published in the last few years. Introduction: page 3, first column, line 23 The paragraph starting from line 23 is a bit misleading because the authors try to generalize the description of the protein matrix tunnels in trHbs by mixing what happens in trHbNs and trHbOs. This is confusing since it might give the impression that three tunnels co-exist in trHbs, which is not true. In this respect, Figure 1 contributes a lot to make confusion, since it is not clear which trHb protein represents and it seems that it has three co-existing tunnels. It is probably better to keep separate trHbNs and trHbOs, both in the text description and in Figure 1. The authors should describe the tunnel features in trHbN (short and long tunnel) and trHbO (cavities, small E7 residues an possible E7 gating), and show two panels in Figure 1 with depicted the tunnel/cavity systems in Mt-trHbN (panel A) and Mt-trHbO (panel B), possibly using a similar protein orientation and highlighting the role of the G8 residue in the two cases. Introduction: page 3, second column, line 7 The sentence regarding the internal water molecules is too generic as it is written now, since it is not clear if the authors refer to globins, to trHbs or to Mt-trHbs. The authors should rephrase the sentence to clarify this issue. Introduction: page 3, second column, line 10 The authors should say that the experimental measurements and the MD simulations have been performed only on Mt-trHbN and mutants, and not, for instance, on Mt-trHbO. Materials and Methods: page 3, second column, line 40 The purification paragraph seems to refers only to trHbN. What about its mutants? The authors should add a sentence to clarify this issue. Materials and Methods: page 4, first column, line 44 The following sentence is not written fully correctly: Amino acids protonation states were assumed based on environment of the residue in the crystal structure. All solvent-exposed His were protonated at the N- delta atom, as well as HisF8, because of its coordination to the heme iron. One possibility is to rephrase it as follows: The protonation state of the amino acids was assumed based on the environment of the residues in the crystal structure. All solvent-exposed His residues were protonated at the N- atom, as well as the proximal HisF8, because of its coordination to the heme iron. page 5, second column, line 12 It is not clear what the authors mean when they write that the STG8 has only the distal site cavity, (trHb : CO) 1 , , especially if this sentence is coupled with Figure 4A, where (trHb : CO) 1 seems to be connected to STG8 through (trHb : CO) 2 . page 5, Title of Table 1 It is probably better to change ..for wild type and mutants Mt-trHbs O and N to ..for wild type and mutants of Mt-trHbN and Mt-trHbO page 6, Figure 4 legend In the legend of Panel C there is no mention of the (trHb : CO) 3 site.
