The most novel aspect of the study was the investigation of levodopa. This is very interesting. No significant levodopa effects were, however, observed. The authors offer some interesting thoughts on the reason for this null effect, most critically pointing to a need to have an active task PET design. This is a plausible argument that may stimulate further research on this topic. A potentially interesting methodological contribution is the observation of a difference between the 1 st and 2 nd scan on each day of scanning. The study is likely underpowered, in particular for any group comparison (5 TS, 5 ctrls), so the repeated-measures analysis was most likely not very sensitive. I would treat the observed differences between TS and control groups from the whole-brain analysis as preliminary. I may have missed it, but I could not find information about how the PET scans were reconstructed.
