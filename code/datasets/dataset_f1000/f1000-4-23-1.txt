This is a carefully performed study that presents a novel approach to measure presynaptic dopamine release using the administration of exogenous levodopa, coupled with raclopride PET scanning. Preliminary data are provided using this method in a small group of controls and subjects with Tourette syndrome. The authors describe a decline in dopamine release in striatum, thalamus and frontal lobe between the first and second scan of each day in response to placebo administration in normal subjects, possibly due to habituation to study procedures. Levodopa administration did not alter striatal dopamine release differently in Tourette syndrome vs. controls. However, dopamine release differed significantly in the midbrain and parahippocampal gyrus in the two conditions. Levodopa stimulated dopamine release in controls but reduced it in Tourette subjects. Although these are important observations, the number of subjects studied was small. Hence, these must be considered pilot data although they are consistent with a rather complex dopaminergic role in Tourette syndrome. Of interest for future studies would be the evaluation of task-evoked dopamine release in response to cognitive tasks. Lastly, the observation that habituation occurs in response to placebo infusions has important implications to the interpretation of placebo-controlled studies of dopamine release.
