This is a fascinating review by Ashdown and colleagues that examines the CR rate to various cytotoxic regimens for various cancers as part of meta-analysis focusing on the attainment of CR. The remarkable concordance of CR rate across cancer and therapy types is very intriguing. The authors explore possible explanations for this phenomenon and surmise it is most likely immune in nature. This is a remarkable finding that begs for some solution and to my knowledge is a novel observation.
