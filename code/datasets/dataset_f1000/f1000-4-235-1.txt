The review by Wardle and Tan provides a clear and accessible treatment of the issue of antibody validation for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The technical aspects of validating antibodes are covered effectively in the review. The authors also discuss the problems that can arise even with supposedly validated commercial antibodies for example the fact that companies often change batches of polyclonal antibodies without revalidating them. This is an important problem affecting molecular biology and epigenetic studies and the review is a timely contribution to the discussion about how to address it.
