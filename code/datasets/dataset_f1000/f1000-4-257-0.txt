In my eye, the manuscript is very good. I wonder if the Authors could provide the histological images of the cases in order to achieve a greater completeness in their report. In the background section, 3rd sentence, cytologcal infomation should be changed into histopathological information. I have no additional comment other than congratulating with the authors for their work.
