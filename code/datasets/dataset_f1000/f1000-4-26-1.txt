I have gone through the present manuscript entitled Capsaicin from chili ( Capsicum spp.) inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation by Liu et al . with interest where the investigators demonstrated the efficacy of natural capsaicin in overcoming restenosis by using a vascular muscle cell model (VSMC) in vitro . Besides macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are now also believed to play a significant role in generating foam cells that accumulate cytoplasmic droplets of cholesterol esters and triglycerides leading to atherosclerosis regarded as a prime cause of cardio- and cerebrovascular events. Proliferation of VSMCs thus is a common cause of restenosis among the patients who were previously undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery. Under this purview, the present work demonstrating promising in vitro anti-proliferative activity of natural capsaicin seems to be much interesting. The experiments are straightforward and sufficient in arriving at the conclusions. Representation of facts and organization of the manuscript are praise-worthy. The manuscript may be accepted and indexed in its present form. At the same time, I have a suggestion for the investigators as mentioned below, which may be addressed to make the revised manuscript more demanding. Suggestion Rapamycin and paclitaxel are commonly used standard drugs to resist restenosis in patients although they suffer from certain serious health issues as mentioned by the authors in their present manuscript. Hence, search for better alternative(s) is warranted as a part of which the present work has been developed. Hence, I do suggest comparing the present results with those of at least any one of these two drugs (in addition to or in place of digitonin) to validate superiority of capsaicin.
