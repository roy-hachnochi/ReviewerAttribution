SwissPalm represents an extremely valuable resource for the palmitoylation research community, and the authors have undertaken a large volume of work to produce this palmitoylation database. There are also some useful and interesting comparative analyses presented in the paper. As commented by the authors, up to 10% of the proteome might be subject to palmitoylation, emphasising both the importance of this lipid modification and the importance of this new resource. Information has been curated from a growing number of protein-palmitoylome studies and from papers focused on individual palmitoylated proteins, and the database will be continuously updated. I have only minor comments for improvement: Page 3, first paragraph: while thioesterases detach it and Acyl Protein Thioesterases (APTS) which remove the acyl chain. There appears to be some repetition here and while thioesterases detach it could be removed. Figure 1A: text states 19 palmitoyl-proteome screens were selected but first panel of Figure 1A suggests 18? Should there be 6 studies from human using chemical capture? Also text states 5199 proteins were incorporated but figure shows 5169? Figure 2A-C: some text is partially obscured. Page 8, section on Protein information page: the figure numbers given in text of this section do not match with the figures. Figure 5A: values of 1455, 2341 and 2651 are given in Figure, whereas corresponding text (pages 8 and 9) states 1453, 2339 and 2649. The text corresponding to Figure 7A indicates 27 human and 20 mouse protein complexes - the authors might provide some additional information as to how these values correspond with the bar graph in Figure 7A (which does not show 27/20 complexes). The legend of Figure 8 gives rather than for text corresponding to panel D.
