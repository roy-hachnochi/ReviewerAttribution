The author describes spinning cells or spheres in neurosphere cultures from the mouse hippocampus. Although an interesting phenomenon, presenting a time lapse film of these structures, without any phenotyping, cell and molecular analysis of them does not allow any understanding of the nature of these structures. Furthermore, these have been described before in neurosphere cultures from the subventricular zone (see Laywell et al , PNAS, 2000; Figure 1), originating from ciliated ependymal cells that can form spheres with other ciliated cells or astrocytes. The hippocampal periventricular ciliated ependymal cells and B cell astrocytes are probably the origin of these spinning structures described here, but only characterization of them would allow this confirmation. Finally, referring to the potential physical mechanisms underlying rotation really only needs to consider the study of Sawamoto et al ., Science, 2014.
