The paper is a current, high quality review of the novel echocardiographic approaches to quantification of myocardial function in the context of training-induced remodeling. The authors provide a fair overview of methods used for discriminating right and left ventricular pathology which is important for sudden death risk stratification in this subset. The review is of interest for the readership and I suggest to accept it on "as is" basis.
