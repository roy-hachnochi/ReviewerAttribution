This manuscript is well summarized with topics. However, I believe some more information needs to be added. As small molecules, such as FDA approved drugs, affect the tissue of the whole body, the information of the data from genetic findings, such as NaV1.5 knockout mice data, is desired to be included in the text The idea that selecting the voltage gated sodium channel blocker by repurposing of a drug seems attractive to fight invasion and metastasis of cancer. However, a concrete example for the medical use is not shown in the text. Please provide an idea when a patient could use such a drug. Oxidative stress contributes to the invasion process. Figures 3 4 show that proton exfusion also plays a role in the invadopodia complex. Do the author has an idea to connect oxidative stress and the voltage gated sodium channel? If not, please ignore this comment. Figure 7: “B1 subunit” should be replaced by “b(symbol)1 subunit”. The author describes in the text that the voltage gated sodium channel is overexpressed in cancer tissue, and its blockers could be used as cancer chemoprevention agents. It might be worth writing a review article regarding carcinogenesis and the voltage gated sodium channel blocker in the future.
