 It would have been interesting to learn why the authors believed the ACO patient population might be unique in terms of their barriers to CRC screening. Given the many other studies cited, were there any hypotheses driving the study other than this ACO is a relatively new healthcare organization? The first mention of sensitive analysis under Study Setting is unclear. Effect sizes and variability will not be generalizable to other populations, will they? It seems that the authors may have implied this, unless they are planning to address the same issues in a future larger study in rural Nebraska. If this latter is the case, then this is a pilot study? Given the size and statistical power, I would think this is not a pilot study. Hence, the scope of the present study was not totally clear. It is unlikely that this study alone will effectively address the mixed results from previous studies. At least the authors might try to justify this further and suggest other necessary components of reconciling the disparate findings. It is not entirely clear how the data will be used to increase CRC screening. What has been the experience of previous investigators who have attempted to use data about barriers to CRC screening to increase screening in their populations?
