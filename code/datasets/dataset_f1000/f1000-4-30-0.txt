This is an elegant study employing envelope pseudotypes of highly pathogenic viruses which demonstrates that certain inhibitors of low endosomal pH can inhibit viral entry. Because some of these molecules such as Chloroquine have been in clinical use for decades, and are inexpensive, they might tip the balance between survival and death during human infection. I have no criticism of the experimental work. However, I have been told by a reliable physician who has recently cared for patients with Ebola infection that treatment with Chloroquine offered no clinical benefit. Thus it is possible that an in vitro observation may not translate into a useful treatment in vivo . So one should be wary about the conclusions.
