The work was of particular interest especially in light of several viruses shown to be taken up in this rather non specific way. I would have perhaps also like some discussion of receptor and channel mediated virus uptake - there are several publications in this space. The interplay between such different mechanisms may point to multiple targets or need for combined approaches to block them. The authors describe amiodarone, but there are many molecules that have been found as ebola replication or pseudoviral entry inhibitors, had they looked at more molecules to see if the pH mechanism was common across them? I would likely suggest adding repurposing in the title of the article. The conclusion might benefit from comparison of the chloroquine data with that previously published (higher EC50), potential ocular toxicity etc. Some discussion as to whether the pH effect is an in vitro specific effect or something of in vivo relevance - would also be worth mention. This study confirms the previous work on chloroquine and suggestions by others as to its potential utility. This begs the question why it is not used clinically. What other data would be needed to show that chloroquine could be clinically useful? The study is well designed and reported and adds to the growing literature on chloroquine and its potential as an antiviral.
