The authors have presented a succinct, but detailed description of sequence data for several populations that will certainly be useful to the Drosophila community. I see no major flaws in the manuscript. However, as a minor suggestion, it may be useful for readers if the authors update their Introduction to not only place the populations in the context of migration history, but perhaps to also briefly list the geographical areas covered by other sequence resources to clearly illustrate how their dataset adds onto the currently available resources.
