This article primarily summaries the generation of a large set of resequenced Drosophila strains from three populations (Ghana, France and the US). Sequencing was done both individually for each isofemale strain, as well as in sequenced pools for each of three populations. While the primary goal of this research appears to be to provide the community with these additional genomic resources, the researchers were also particularly interested in examining Wolbachia infection status in the strains. Given that all raw data has been made available, it is likely that will provide an important useful resource for genomic analyses. A few minor comments: Some comparison of mapping quality for the pooled sequences (as compared to the individual isofemale strains) would have been useful. Some explanation as to why the number of individuals used for the three different sequencing pools differed would have also been helpful to understand the provenance of the data.
