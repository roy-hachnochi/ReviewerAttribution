I thank the authors for their excellent work in overhauling this manuscript. I find it much improved in terms of clarity and structure. The paper does a nice job of introducing the Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences, and describing an alternative model to providing ongoing support for modern data-oriented life sciences research.
