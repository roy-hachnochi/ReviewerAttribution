This article outlines the background, formation and to an extent the operation of the Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences (DTL) with a focus on the data programme, DTL-Data. Given this type of organisation is of relevance to data researchers in other nations, researchers in other fields, and set against a background of increasing data complexity and institutional networking in the wider community, this could provide a model for other inititatives. In common with the other reviewers, there are some issues with the presentation which would help readers new to DTL to understand the background, structure and operation of this entity. To encourage similar organisations in other nations, the historical background is relevant, but could be split to a separate section - as a text box/diagram or similar to aid the flow of the description of DTL operations as they are now. Whilst DTL-Data is discussed in some detail, the other sections are briefly mentioned and its challenging to gain a picture of the holistic DTL and the competencies necessary to establish a similar organisation in other nations. Again, as noted by the other reviewers, an outlook comparing other national efforts, their relation to DTL, what may have particularly aided development of DTL in the Netherlands from both a structural/funding and cultural/operational perspective would be useful. Similarly examples of FAIR data principles, information on some of the tools and databases mentioned but not named could help researchers in other nations contextualise the assertions made. This may be of more value to those less familiar with the operations of DTL than detailed description of the meetings which would be better summarised in less detail.
