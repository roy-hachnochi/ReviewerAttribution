I think this is a well-written and interesting case report. As a single case report, it cannot be used to guide treatment. The outcome could have been different even though the authors suggest a very reasonable approach to the situation. I would agree with Dr. Ratan's comments, although I may be less of an expert on the surgical management of hangman's fracture. I think there would be a small benefit to medical knowledge to indexing this paper, as the management of this condition would likely be guided by both exam, radiological findings, and patient medical condition.
