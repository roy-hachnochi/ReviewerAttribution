We have read with interest the case report "A case report of unstable Hangman fracture in a eighty year old male" by Munakomi et al .The authors need to be congratulated for highlighting their view in managing unstable Hangman fracture in the geriatric age group. The patient in your report was put on traction with six kilogram loading. It is an accepted fact that patients with type 3 Hangman fracture should not be subjected to traction due to risk of iatrogenic hanging. Secondly, the radiology images published do not point towards severe osteoporosis. A DEXA scan could have been more informative as the decision to do occipito-cervical fusion in Hangman fracture exposes the patient to severe motion restriction in an already spondylotic spine. Finally, I presume C2 -C3 anterior cervical discectomy and fixation with casper plates would have been preferable than to subjecting the patient with an ejection fraction of 33% to surgery in prone position.
