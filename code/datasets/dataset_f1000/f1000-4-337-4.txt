This report describes a case of a Hangmans fracture without associated neurological symptoms. There are several problems with this report that limit its usefulness and message, First, a Hangmans fracture, which is defined as fractures of both pedicles or pars interarticularis of the C2 vertebra (axis), is not defined in the abstract. There is a classification protocol that has been developed by Levine and Edwards that is based on etiology and guides treatment, this is also not mentioned. Second, neurological impairment is only seen in 25% of cases, so the absence of neurological symptoms is the rule not the exception as implied by this abstract. I am not convinced that this case report adds significantly to our understanding of how to diagnose and treat Hangmans fracture.
