This manuscript deals with the in silico analysis of molecules for their activity against Ebola Virus (EBV). They started from a reference library of compounds who have previously demonstrated in vitro and/or in vivo activity against EBV and analyzed these compounds by the determination of their EIIP and AQVN. With these data, they scanned a larger collection of compounds with unknown activity against EBV and selected possible candidates to test for their activity in vitro and/or in vivo . This is a straight forward manuscript however it may be better structured. The part of the MM dealing with the EIIP and AQVN is more appropriate to go into the introduction since this is background information of the calculation. For clarity of the manuscript is also better to separate the results section as it is difficult to follow now. Start with the analysis of the compounds with known activity, the two datasets, and then proceed with results from the unknown dataset. Then in the discussion, the different products of interest may be evaluated. This will largely increase the readability. Upon the antibiotics, it would be good to elaborate a bit on how they work on EBV, since common sense tells that antibiotics do not work on viruses. A better explanation on how these products may interact and inhibit/kill EBV would also be good.
