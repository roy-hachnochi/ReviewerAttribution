This Review by Chowdhury and Enenkel nicely summarizes the current knowledge on the trafficking of proteasomes between cyto- and nucleoplasm. Its a very well written manuscript that gives a balanced and comprehensive view on localization studies on both, yeast and mammalian, proteasomes. I only have a few minor comments: The figures should be more informative. I would suggest to summarize all four figures in one or two figures, and to include/highlight all potential importers mentioned in the text (Kap95/Blm10/Rpn2). It would be tremendously helpful to add a figure summarizing the proteasomal localization data from yeast and mammalian cells. This figure should include which proteasomal subunits have been found where in the cell during which growth phase. It should also indicate the location of JUNQ and PSGs. Although the 20S chaperones Pba1/2 are mentioned, I am missing a discussion of their role in proteasomal localization. Binding of Pba1/2 blocs the access to the NLS of the alpha ring, as shown by Stadtmueller et al. (2012) and Kock et al. (2015) . They thus seem to prevent nuclear import of proteasomal precursors. The authors incorrectly referred to "cryo-EM structure analysis of Ump1-associated CP precursor complexes" (Kock et al ., 2015). This should be changed to "EM structure analysis". Furthermore this point can be strengthened by also citing Wani et al. (2015) .
