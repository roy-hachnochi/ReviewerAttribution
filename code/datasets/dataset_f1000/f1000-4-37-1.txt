Thomas Cimato addresses a key article in identifying the continuum of myocardial infarction leading to heart failure. The odds of a risk factor leading to heart failure is still the highest for myocardial infarction and this is hence a very relevant topic. There are some really minor changes: The statement in introduction “,coronary artery disease has supplanted hypertension as the most prevalent cause for congestive heart failure, with a high rate of mortality and future hospitalization” need an appropriate reference for fact check. To my knowledge based on recent statistics of CHF, CAD and MI have a higher association but by prevalence, HTN is a bigger contributor. There are couple of places where the author states “ I will briefly summarize” (5th line, page 2, left column) and “Below I will discuss the emerging strategies……” (Last line of the paragraph under subheading Recurrent MI and heart failure”. If possible, a reference to self will sound best avoided and a rephrasing to “is summarized” will have a better flow. Otherwise, it’s a well elaborated article reflecting the need for attention in such perfectives post MI.
