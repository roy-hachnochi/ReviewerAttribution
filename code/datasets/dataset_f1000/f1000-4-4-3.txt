This submission uses freeze-fracture electron microscopy to observe fusion intermediates in glycerol-induced fusion of unilamellar liposomes. Though fusion in this system is asynchronous, several images are presented that presumably correspond to different sequential intermediates in membrane fusion. One particularly suggestive image is interpreted to indicate that the hemi-fusion to full-fusion transition proceeds through an intermediate containing a circular array of lipidic particles just beneath the junction between the fused outer leaflets. The lipid particle model is proposed to potentially reflect the mechanism of membrane fusion induced by biological fusion protein machinery. The lipid particle model is not a new idea, but has been controversial and lacked direct support. The paper is interesting and makes a unique contribution to understanding the lipidic intermediates in fusion. However, it was disappointing that only a single image of the key intermediate is shown and therefore the characteristics of the intermediate cannot be confirmed. If more examples were analyzed, it should be possible to estimate quantitative parameters such as the approximate number of lipid molecules in the particles, how uniform they are and how often they occur per unit of membrane, etc., that might allow future energetic understanding of the proposed process. Likewise I found it somewhat disappointing that only glycerol was used to induce fusion. If the proposed intermediate is generalizable to biological membrane fusion, it should be apparent using another fusogen.
