This is an intriguing observation of potential liposomal fusion intermediates. While the method of inducing protein-free lipid mixing and fusion is unconventional, the structures observed by freeze fracture are unique. I think it would be important to confirm these intermediates under conditions that have been studied by other means. The wealth of information on PEG-mediated liposome fusion could be brought to bear if similar conditions were used. Additionally, it would be beneficial to examine the lipid requirements of such intermediates. While the lifetime of these structures are likely short making their identification challenging, altered lipid compositions such as at the inclusion of hexagonal phase ii forming lipids like phosphatidylethanolamine may increase the propensity of observing the types of intermediated like the "fusion rim" or "fusion orifice" depicted in this work. Overall, the proposed intermediate are interesting, but require further experimental evidence to support their role as bona fide fusion intermediates.
