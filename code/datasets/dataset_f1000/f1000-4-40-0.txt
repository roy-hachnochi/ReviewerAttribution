The manuscript has substantially improved since its first version. The authors have addressed satisfactorily most of my previous concerns, while trying to find the balance with comments from the other referees that occasionally pointed in the opposite direction (e.g. local vs. general emphasis). I still find a few minor issues that could be improved, particularly the structure of the introduction (as suggested before, information on paragraph 4 could be merged with that of paragraph 1 to start from a broader view and then move to the more specific issues of the study). Nevertheless, I consider the manuscript acceptable as it is.
