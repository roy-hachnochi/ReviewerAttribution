The manuscript entitled A double blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study to examine reduction of CD34+/CD117+/CD133+ lymphoma progenitor cells and duration of remission induced by neoadjuvant valspodar in dogs with large B-cell lymphoma presents a prospective study evaluating the effects of valspodar in a single agent setting for effects on LPCs and as a secondary endpoint evaluates outcomes in dogs treated with valspodar and doxorubicin for B-cell lymphoma. The manuscript is well written and describes the study design and materials and methods well. My main concern with the manuscript is that the main outcome studied was a change in LPCs before and 4 days after starting valspodar. Given the mechanism of action of the drug in inhibiting the ABC transporter and not cytotoxcity of these cells specifically I am not surprised that the authors did not see a drop in their numbers. It is unfortunate that there were only a few samples with enough material to test if valspodar could inhibit the ABC transporters in vivo as this would have been a very useful component of the study. In my opinion these points should be in the discussion. While underpowered I think the length of remission and overall survival data are important as they show that there is not likely to be differences in these groups even in a larger study.
