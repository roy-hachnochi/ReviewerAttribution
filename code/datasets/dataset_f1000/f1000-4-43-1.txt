The authors present a good idea how toestablish a SMS-based approach to guide Ebola patients to health facilities. The idea is great and the strategy sound reasonable, but the following issues must be clarified in more detail: How do the authors guarantee that the patient will get the information of the most nearest facility? What is with the support of poor regions with low phone access? Which information is stored in the "knowledge base" you are talking about? What do the authors mean by the term "snd-to-end system"? I suggest the authors solution could be further influenced by existing emergency solutions. Thus, look on the drafts of the IETF working group ecrit. They are looking for standards in such research fields.
