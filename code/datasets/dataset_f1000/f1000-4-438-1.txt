The article written by Dr. Vikas Bharadwaj throws light on the issue of non reproducibility of research citing the example of DNA structure elucidated by Watson and Crick. Every year billions of dollars are being spent on this part of research. The article envisages the very valid point that there is a dire need to revise the concepts so that our research could be more fruitful and result oriented. I highly appreciate Dr. Bhardwaj for bringing this issue on forefront.
