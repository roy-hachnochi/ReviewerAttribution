This is well written article and an interesting observation although some of the literature cited is a little dated (e.g. Harrison Wallace 1990). To my knowledge this is first time that anyone has followed these embryonic chimeras through to settlement and that fact that they can settle and grow is an important observation. However, embryonic chimera formation is an artifact of the experimental conditions i.e. the very high densities of embryos in still water in the bowls. Indeed, embryonic chimera formation is quite common, particularly when working with larvae of merulinds at higher temperatures. It is very rare to see chimeras in spawn slicks or on settlement tiles, at least on soaks of short duration, although this has yet to be quantified. Therefore, embryonic chimera formation is highly unlikely to be of much ecological or evolutionary significance. Indeed, a phenonomen of much more ecological significance is the fact that many embryos break up during development under conditions likely to prevail in the wild (see Heyward and Negri, 2012 ).
