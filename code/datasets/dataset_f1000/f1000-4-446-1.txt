 The authors reported 2 siblings with lamellar ichthyosis (LI) and the family pedigree shows the autosomal pattern of inheritance. In addition, duplicate 22q12+ has been shown in the father and the 2 affected siblings. It seems, however, that this chromosomal abnormality is unrelated to the LI as the father is phenotypically normal and the 2 siblings do not show any of the manifestations of this chromosomal abnormality. The significance of this concurrence is not clear. The authors may amend the manuscript by naming the site of the TGM1 mutation at the nucleotide level and the name of the gene transcript. It is not clear whether the authors examined the father and the affected siblings for manifestations of the duplicate 22q12+ (apart from the cat eye syndrome), such as learning difficulties, growth retardation, minor genital abnormalities of the boy etc. There are few typo errors. For instance, the "transglutaminase gene" is better given as "transglutaminase gene1" and "Ichyn" is "Ichthyin" etc. Ref.13 is not cited in the text and there seems to be a problem with enumeration of the references in the text. â€‹
