This work combines crystallography, time-resolved spectroscopy and MD simulations to investigate structure and CO dynamics in a member of the NO transporter NP family, NP7. Whereas the found properties are similar to other NPs, in particular the well-studied NP4, this work is useful as substantial differences had been suggested from previous studies. A few suggestions for improvements: Intro, 2 nd par, 3 rd phrase suggests that NP1 and NP2 share more identity with NP4 than NP7, which appears not the case for NP2 (Table 2). Please specify sample conditions (path length, concentration) for both types of spectroscopic measurements. MD simulations of NP7 are based on homology modelling from NP4 structures. A comparison of the homology and X-ray models, other than the flipped heme, would be interesting. Admittedly it will not change the order of magnitude of the results, but the problematic gluing of the gap between 1 ns and 20 ns by extrapolating a non-finished double exponential (fit parameters?) can be avoided by determining the effective CO dissociation yield at ~20 ns in the linear excitation regime using an established procedure ( Brunori et al. , 1973 ). If I understand well the kinetics in Fig. 9 can be fitted by four exponentials (two 10 ns and two s-ms), and thus 7 independent free parameters. The model has as many as 11 rate parameters (Table 3, k on is strictly not a microscopic rate constant). This would suggest the model is underdetermined. Please discuss. Do the authors associate T1, T2 and T3 with specific modeled cavities? It is unclear why the rebinding rate is specifically or only compared with TrHbO. In a number of sensor proteins, including CooA, CO rebinding phases on the order of tens and hundreds of picoseconds have been observed.
