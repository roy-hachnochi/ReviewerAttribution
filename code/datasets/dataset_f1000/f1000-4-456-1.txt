Kripke presents a thorough analysis of the risks and possible benefits of suvorexant for the treatment of insomnia. Suvorexant is an antagonist for the two receptors for hypocretin (also called orexin), a peptide released by a small group of neurons in the hypothalamus. Soon after the peptide was identified, it was found that 90% of neurons containing this peptide are lost in human narcolepsy 1 , 2 . Since one of the main symptoms of narcolepsy is sleepiness, it seemed plausible that a drug blocking hypocretin receptors would cause sleepiness, an effect that might be useful in treating insomnia. Suvorexant is the first such drug to hit the market. Human insomnia is a complaint about inadequate sleep, but is not necessarily correlated with low sleep duration or with decreased lifespan 3 , 4 . Current insomnia treatments act on GABA receptors, particularly on the benzodiazepine type of GABA receptor. An obvious problem with manipulation of systemic GABA levels is the very large number of GABA neurons and GABA receptors in the brain. GABA receptors exist not only in regions such as the anterior hypothalamus and adjacent forebrain regions implicated in sleep induction, but throughout the brain. In some regions nearly 90% of neurons contain GABA 5 . Benzodiazepine receptors also exist in large numbers in bodily organs including the heart 6 , 7 , gall bladder, urinary bladder 8 , thyroid, liver 9 , lung, stomach 10 , 11 , testes 11 , pancreas 10 and kidneys 10 , 12 and are activated by many commonly used sleeping pills 13 , 14 . Benzodiazepine receptors are present on red blood cells, on tumors, as well as on cells of the immune system 15 - 19 . Increased rates of infection have been reported with the use of hypnotics 20 . In contrast to GABA, there only about 75,000 hypocretin neurons in the human brain 2 , 21 , 22 , a tiny fraction of the 75,000,000,000 neurons estimated to be in the human brain. They are distributed from the most medial portions of the hypothalamus adjacent to the 3 rd ventricle, to the far lateral hypothalamus. Although initial reports suggested that there were orexin neurons in the gut, these reports have not been replicated 23 . Hypocretin neurons have widespread projections, directly innervating and activating cortical, subcortical and brainstem neurons 24 . Some work has suggested potential problems with dual orexin receptor antagonists. Humans who have attempted suicide have reduced levels of hypocretin-1 in their cerebrospinal fluid 25 . In a study of human patients with electrodes implanted in the amygdala for diagnostic purposes, we found that hypocretin release was maximal during pleasure and was minimal when they reported feeling sad or when they were in pain, despite a high level of arousal 26 . Allowing for species differences, these human data bear considerable resemblance to data on hypocretin neuron activity in animals. In normal mice, we found that hypocretin neurons are maximally active during performance of rewarded behaviors 27 and that hypocretin knockout mice were strikingly deficient in staying awake to perform rewarded behaviors. Our studies of Fos expression in wild type mice also showed that hypocretin neurons were not activated beyond baseline levels during foot shock, or foot shock avoidance behavior, despite high levels of EEG arousal 27 . We have also reported that hypocretin neuronal activity in rats is suppressed in novel situations eliciting withdrawal, despite maximal levels of EEG activation. In contrast, hypocretin neuron activity is high during grooming and exploration 28 . The animal and human studies indicate that hypocretin cells are not simply related to arousal, but are strongly related to positive emotions. This is consistent with the evidence that human depression and reported difficulties with social interaction in narcolepsy may result from the loss of hypocretin function, as would occur with receptor antagonists 29 - 34 . These considerations suggest that depression and even suicide might be a risk from the use of orexin receptor antagonists. However, this need not be the case if the drug induces sleep rapidly, and does not persist in the brain. Kripke reviews evidence suggesting that chronic use produces longterm inactivation of hypocretin receptors, highlighting this risk. References 1.

Being an opinion article, it is made clear from the beginning including the abstract - that no new original data are presented; rather an experts summarization of available evidence regarding the use of suvorexant. Article content : Dr. Kripke provides a very thorough review of available literature, both published and unpublished reports, with regards to various aspects of suvorexant. Existing evidence (or lack thereof) of both efficacy, side-effects, risk/benefit ratio, comparisons studies etc., are clearly presented, and the conclusions drawn from these reports are well-balanced. Conclusions : The conclusions are very clearly stated, yet sensible, balanced as well as justified on the basis of the available data regarding suvorexant. I consider this an important contribution that will improve our understanding, and provide a solid scientific foundation useful for both clinicians and researchers alike.
