This is an interesting and timely piece, given the current drivers to enhance teaching quality across the UK Higher Education sector, and the growth in discipline specific pedagogic research over the last decade. This paper is based on a small qualitative study, which used semi-structure interviews with seven participants. Although a small cohort, it was purposefully recruited to include an appropriate range of experience, age and gender balance. The methodology was appropriate for the objective of the study which was to explore the motivations of academics, specifically those involved in research and teaching in the biosciences, to evaluate their teaching and share their practice. The limitations of the research were identified. The analysis was informed by Trigwells multi-dimensional model of scholarship of teaching and was situated within the authors extensive experience of publishing pedagogic research and scholarship in the life sciences. I would be interested to hear whether the author agrees with others (e.g. Stierer, 2007 ,and Tight, 2013 ) that there has been significant change in the quality of scholarship and pedagogic research conducted by discipline specialists (i.e. not educationalists) and whether discipline-specific researchers are conducting more robust studies which are informed by the relevant pedagogy- i.e. moving beyond Trigwells model. The author comments on his choice of title, and I wonder whether a change to why we bother may be more reflective of the article content?
