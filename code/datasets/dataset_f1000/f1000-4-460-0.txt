The manuscript by Harden et al. entitled Deep Sequencing of the T cell Receptor Repertoire Demonstrates Polyclonal T-cell Infiltrates in Psoriasis describes the results of high-throughput deep sequencing of the TCR beta and gamma chains in normal healthy skin and psoriatic lesional and nonlesional skin tissues. The authors found that although there is a significant increase in the abundance of unique beta and gamma TCR sequences in poriatic lesional skin, the entire T cell repertoire in psoriasis is polyclonal. More strikingly, they found three common sequences of gamma chain repertoire in psoriatic skin. These are really exciting findings and provide novel insights into understanding psoriasis immunopathogenesis. Minor comments: The rationale for using genomic DNA (gDNA) for TCR beta chain while cDNA for TCR gamma chain sequencing needs to be clearly delineated. This is particularly important given the fact that different target enrichment solutions have its own pros and cons. The authors conclude that the entire T cell repertoire in psoriasis is rather polyclonal with similar diversity in normal vs non-lesional skin, which is contradictory to previous reports. The authors may want to discuss this further, e.g. whether this discrepancy is due to different technology used or other factors. Were psoriatic lesional and non-lesional skin tissues paired?
