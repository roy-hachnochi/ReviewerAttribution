This report tries to show the importance of muscle atrophy of extensor hallusus (EHL) longus in diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis. I have following criticisms: They must place MRI images of the patient instead of intraoperative surgical views. They claim that atrophy of EHL on both sides shows the disease is spinal canal stenosis instead of disc herniation. However they do not have any evidence that it cannot be produced by a midline disc herniation. Nor can a case report make us reach a conclusion like that. Atrophy of the EHL muscles should be justified by muscle strength measurements and EMG.
