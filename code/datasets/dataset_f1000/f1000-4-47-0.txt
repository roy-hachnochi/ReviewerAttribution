The article addresses one important issue in the field but misses the following important aspects that should be discussed: Most of the available annotation database such as GO, MESH are biased toward specific terms. Thus, the accuracy of the method could biased toward specific concepts and terms. The author should analyze the distribution of the m scores and associate the statistical significance calculated with respect to a background distribution. For the definition of phenotypes the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) database is the reference. The author should cite this database in their paper and use it as benchmark set for the predictions. 3) A comparison with other methods should be provided. Minor: The description of similar methods previously developed is too long.
