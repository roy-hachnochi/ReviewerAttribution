Major concerns: The process of ranking individual genes by their relationships as depicted in Figure 2 and in the Use Case (page 9) was very confusing and it was not apparent how the process of associating functions with phenotype could be mapped to genes of interest to the researcher. Greater care needs to be taken to describe this process (which is a somewhat complicated one) since this seems to be the main application of the method described. The last five sentences in the Abstract provide detail that is not necessary here but should be included in the main text instead. It would be very helpful to have a comparison of the results given by the method described and another method (likely one of those described in the paper) in terms of functions identified for the use case and ranking of genes given. This would not be a performance evaluation (since it is difficult to tell what the answer would be in this case) but would provide a nice comparison with previous methods. Minor concerns: The word "cancer" is misspelled in the title for the Use Case section. In the use case it is unclear where the list of "Genes not previously observed in these tumors" comes from. I would assume that it was genes that were associated with cancer in the referenced work, but hadnt been previously associated? This needs to be made clear.
