The CENP-C protein is required for the assembly and proper function of kinetochores in most eukaryotes. In this paper the author has identified the putative CENP-C protein homologue of Teleostei using BLASTP searches. This protein does not contain a typical CENP-C motif, but a motif with a partial homology to CENP-C. However, presence of the Cupin domain at the C-terminus and two CENP-C-like motifs at the central and proximal regions, respectively, have allowed the author to conclude that the identified protein is a CENP-C ortholog. Additionally, the author has identified the CENP-C motif in M18BP1 proteins of fishes and some other vertebrates. It is interesting that the CENP-C motif cannot be identified in M18BP1 of mammals. From my point of view, this is very important finding of the current study. Therefore, I recommend to show in the paper the structure of the M18BP1 protein homologues of vertebrates with the SANTA, SANT and CENP-C domains. These domains are present in M18BP1 proteins of most vertebrates, but M18BP1 proteins of mammals have only SANTA and SANT domains and in Latimeria chalumnae only SANTA and CENP-C domains are present. I suggest to mention this in the paper and to discuss it. I think the study is a significant contribution in the field of centromere research and the information presented in the paper is applicable by experimental biologists. Minor comments: I suggest to change the title to: “Identification of the putative CENP-C protein homologue in fish and the CENP-C motif in M18BP1 of vertebrates.” Abstract: "[…]but evidence is presented that makes it likely[…]" Please write which evidence.
