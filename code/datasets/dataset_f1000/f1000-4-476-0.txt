In this research article entitled -" CySpanningTree : Minimal Spanning Tree computation in Cytoscape, the authors describe the app for Cytoscape version 3 that creates minimal/maximal spanning tree for a given network using network Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms.The CySpanningTree app appears to be useful in approximating the minimum-cost weighted perfect matching, maximum flow problems and other related issues (Supowit et al. 1980; Dahlhaus et al. 2006). The description of the proposed implementation of CySpanningTree app for Cytoscape version 3 is informative and detailed for audience. The article provides sufficient details with appropriate title and well-written abstract. Minor Concerns Some more details on usage on practical applications are strongly suggested to include in this research article as requested by Reviewer 1 in Point 2. The definition of gene expression and generalizing gene expression data in one context is not correct in section MST of gene expression data. It is highly recommended to correct it and cite appropriate research articles defining gene expression and Gene expression data. Gene-gene interaction network reconstruction from gene expression needs to be detailed in methodology sections e.g. how edge weights are calculated and then used for calculation of Euclidean distance between genes. The usage of Genetic distance seems to be inappropriate in this context as it is a measure of the genetic divergence between species or between populations within a species. Please elaborate, if it is used in this context in research article. I would suggest making comprehensive figures for better readability e.g. (figure 1 and figure 2 may be merged into figure 1, Similarly figure 4,5,6,7 into figure 3, figure 8, 9 into figure 4 and figure 10, 11, 12 into figure 5) and brief description of figures in text as well as in legend will make help in better understanding of the examples and usage of the cySpanning trees.

Different algorithms have been implemented to reduced a cluttered network to a more meaningful one. Such efforts are welcome and potentially useful especially for those working in network analysis ... Continue reading READ ALL
