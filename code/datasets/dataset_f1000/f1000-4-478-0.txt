The authors describe a Cytoscape app, CyREST, which exposes core Cytoscape functions as REST APIs for external software components to process network related data sets in automatic and reproducible workflows built using almost any programming languages. Users of workflows can visualize network data in Cytoscape via its powerful visualization features. The accompanied harmonization libraries for Python and R make the use of CyREST much easier and simpler. The manuscript is well organized, and the described app should be highly valuable for users working with big data related to networks for analysis and visualization. Minor comments: Figure 1: The difference between R/Bioconductor and Python is not clear to me. The double-arrowed line for Python is longer than R/Bioconductor, but I am not sure what extra is covered by Python. Python is a full-fledged programming language and capable for anything. Should some specific packages listed for Python? Further, probably the line for Cytoscape should be extended to cover two boxes for Curated Data Sets and Publications. Figure 2: Will it be better to call Network (REST protocol) just as REST Protocol to avoid confusing with other uses of "network" in the manuscript? What is the development status of RCy3? It will be nicer to indicate its status somewhere. From the manuscript, it seems that this is still in work-in-progress?
