Algorithmically, is a useful utility that has been implemented by the authors. Bringing out its multiple use-case scenarios in biological setting with interpretations for example will help novice users adapt this more widely. Biological explanations of network interpretations will strengthen understanding and usage. Also, there are 7 different algorithms implemented. In which kind of data or user-problem which algorithm is recommended, according to authors or empirical observations? Minor points: "Algorithms using such a technique include.." -- kindly mention here itself "the RI algorithm proposed for biological real networks which outperforms other existing algorithms.." -- please elaborate on this RI algorithm "Values of these metrics can suggest to the user which random model" - can the authors recommend some approximation of good/bad values?
