This Opinion Article provides an interesting and potentially important view that currently approved drugs may have activity against the Ebola virus that would allow rapid entry into clinical use due to the previous approved status. While this concept is consistent with previous scientific discussions of the potential for of drugs, the focus on the Ebola virus is very germane to the immediate medical crisis and the need for effective therapies related to Ebola infections. The presented opinion provides a high level overview of previously published data identifying agents with potential efficacy and the opinion appropriately expands the concept to using computational approaches to identify other drugs with potential activity. The concept of studying Ebola virus exposed individuals who did not contract the disease as an approach to identify drugs that may have a beneficial effect is very good although fraught with difficulties when such studies may be attempted under conditions. This point should be expanded. The authors are encouraged to give additional thought and provide additional opinion regarding the approach(s) that can or should be taken beyond the identification of drugs that may have potential efficacy in an Ebola outbreak. Since the opinion recommends additional screening of drugs for potential efficacy, how will (should) decisions be made to select specific agents for further evaluation or clinical use? What criteria should be deemed essential to make decisions in a selection process? These are critical issues since limited resources (and they will always be limited) will require decisions as to which molecules will be prioritized in the selection for the next level of evaluation or use.
