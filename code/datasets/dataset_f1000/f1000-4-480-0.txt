The authors present PSFC, a cytoscape app for the analysis of pathway signal flow to indicate pathway activity states. A user manual is presented with some example datasets. In the manual the various steps are very well described. My assessment for this paper is 'Approved', the app helps in visualization pathway flow and generates an easy interpretable network. Just some minor comments and recommendations: The flow visualization part and the Rules tab in the control panel is not completely visible. The bottom part falls outside the panel. And also the 'Min', 'Mid', 'Max' text boxes are very small, making it difficult to modify the numbers inside these boxes. When pathways are loaded from ReactomeFIPlugin, the edge annotation column contains often more than 1 entry. This causes problems in the flow calculation steps. An idea is to split this column into the separate entries and check which entry is described in the edgeType config file. When the pathway is loaded from a plugin inside Cytoscape, like Reactome, the network file is not saved yet. This caused problems with writing of the results output file. It would be better if the network file could be automatically saved at this step. Some interactions could represent a complex, instead of an 'inhibition' or 'activation' signal, in this case there is not really a rule that would describe this situation, besides maybe source == target, but unfortunately I get an error when I use the '=' sign to describe an edge rule.
