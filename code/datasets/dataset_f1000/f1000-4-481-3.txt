The article describes a software as an extension of the Cytoscape that can automatically query popular citation databases (PubMed only) and derive co-authorship networks based on the query results. Its a laudable goal, and will be a welcomed tool for researches on collaboration networks. Especially, the tool is disseminated as a open-source tool. However, there are a number of concerns. The software does not have any process for disambiguation. This is problematic. In general, citation databases do not provide disambiguation services. Google Scholar attempts to "learn" which publications belong to a specific author when creating the author profile. However, it is not very accurate either at the beginning for common names. For studying social networks, getting accurate information is important, especially for studying Ego networks that focus on a specific person. It is not very user friendly in terms of gathering data. Only for Pubmed, users can enter queries through the tool. With other citation databases (InCites and Scopus), users will need to query the databases directly and then export the results. It is understandable that this is due to InCites and Scopus only provide paid API services. However, it is unclear whether the authors have implemented such integration for users who have paid those API services. Further, even for Pubmed search, the software relies on the users to understand Pubmed query syntax. It would be useful if the authors could provide (in addition to text Pubmed query) guided search (see Pubmed Advanced search) for common use cases in studying collaboration networks. It would be very useful, if the authors could allow users to use the same guided search interface to three all citation databases.
