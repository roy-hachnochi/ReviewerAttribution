The CyAnimator app is a valuable addition to the Cytoscape network visualization tool. Cytoscape itself doesn't provide animation capabilities and the authors rightfully state that animation can provide additional insights for researchers. There is some flickering visible while animating (nodes appearing and disappearing behind other nodes) but this apparently has to do with the current rendering engine. In future implementations it is expected that these issues will be solved.
