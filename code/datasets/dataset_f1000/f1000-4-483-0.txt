The authors have significantly improved the article but I regret that I cannot approve an article that implies that analysts should learn Sweave when it is now completely obsolete. In addition, the article fails to take into account the Emacs key bindings were added as a simple option to RStudio in Feb. 2016. So most of the authors' point about Emacs being more efficient, while true in the past, is no longer true. The Emacs learning curve will not be acceptable to 9/10 of users, with RStudio around. RStudio now also has implemented outline mode for very simple navigation of long documents by LaTeX or markdown sections, subsections, chunk names, etc.
