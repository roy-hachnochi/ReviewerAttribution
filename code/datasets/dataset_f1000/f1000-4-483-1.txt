I cannot approve this article in its current form. The authors may be able to undertake a major revision that makes the paper acceptable. I realize that this is a subjective opinion, but I just cannot agree with the software implementation chosen by the authors, for the following reasons: Even though I've been using Emacs for more than 20 years and am an advocate of it for the user productivity it brings, I cannot agree that Emacs is the best choice of platform for this application. I say that primarily because RStudio provides the most elegant integrated development environment for R and it is elegantly tied to LaTeX and Markdown, two engines that the authors rightfully advocate. The idea of hiding various complexities from researchers is a noble one, but this can be accomplished in more flexible ways using LaTeX packages. For example, a new Github project at https://github.com/harrelfe/rlatex developed by the reviewer provides LaTeX packages spaper and knitrl that streamline reproducible LaTeX reports. Another way to accomplish this is to write R functions that output the needed LaTeX preamble. The authors refer to both Sweave and knitr but knitr has now completely replaced Sweave. In addition, knitr provides an elegant way to specify figure size and captions.
