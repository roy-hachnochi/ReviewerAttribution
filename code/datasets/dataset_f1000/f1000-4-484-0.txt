The authors describe a Cytoscape 3.x plugin, which, on the basis of the shortest path principle, allows researchers to infer and manipulate networks. Their software makes use of a version of the All Pair Shortest Paths of the Dijkstra algorithm in order to infer many characteristics of the network under examination. The application appears to be very useful, and the version 2 of their manuscript seems to be well written. In agreement with the point raised by the other reviewers, I would like to suggest few minor changes to the paper that might improve its readability. Briefly explain some applications of the shortest path principle in systems biology, describing more accurately the maximum parsimony principle and why it is important in biological networks. Put figure 7 before figures 4-5-6 since it is cited before. Add an image that illustrates the results of the "Connected Isolated Nodes" options like 3 or 7. Regarding the application, I would like to point out one minor change: When displaying the "Multi Shortest Path Tree" results on a non-oriented network, you might avoid showing twice the paths composed of the same nodes but in the opposite direction.
