The authors describe a Cytoscape application that performs shortest path calculation in networks. This application is certainly very useful, however a few improvements could be made. Changes to the application: Please, add an app description in Cytoscape App Manager. Adding tooltips explaining some of the buttons would be helpful. For instance, in the Multi Shortest Path Tree result panel, the functionality of the button 'pass through S-P' is not obvious for someone who has not read the article. Pressing on one of the found shortest paths selects the network nodes involved in it, but not the edges. Selecting the edges also would make the path easier to grasp. Please print less information to the console. E.g. 'pass through S-P' prints 'accendo node_name_1, accendo node_name_2, etc.'; human interactome network selection prints 'HUMAN_INTERACTOME.sif, Helloooooo, HUMAN_INTERACTOME.sif'... Changes to the article: In introduction: "in Systems Biology a common methodology implies that the informational flow follows a maximum parsimony principle (see Box 3 in 5)" The scope of the reference is limited to network medicine instead of systems biology in general. Please, either add another reference or adjust the scope. In methods: "All Pair Shortest Paths (APSP) version of the basic Dijkstra algorithm, single thread". Please, specify why single thread is used instead of multiple ones? In use cases: Creating a separate subsection/paragraph for each use case, in my opinion, would improve readability.
