The Authors present a useful Cytoscape app for calculating shortest paths in networks. This is useful with the following comments to be considered: I do not suggest to use the words "isolate" and "giant component" for the situation when the distance between a well-defined node a well-defined subnetworks is to calculated. In network science, there is enough confusion about certain concepts, it is better to avoid adding more. If you refer to a "selected node" and a "selected subgraph", everything is perfectly understandable and there is no confusion. In the second paragraph (4th line) of the Introduction, you speak about "reconstructing" networks. Why not simply "constructing"? The maximum parsimony principle may work well or may not work at all, depending on the actual problem. I do not suggest to use it as a general assumption. It would be more interesting (and a lot more useful) to dedicate a brief paragraph for this isssue: when does it make sense (network flows flow shortest paths) and when it does not (network flows do not prefer shortest paths). In the legend of Figure 2, you mention node 6 instead of node 1. In Figure 5, I suggest to keep nodes 8, 9 and 10 yellow but to use another colour for node 6. Please add a bit more explanation about how to manage information about link direction, link weight and link sign in the database. Can you convert (symmetrize, binarize) and if yes, how does it happen (e.g. how to determine weight if you symmetrize AB and BA with different weights?). What happens if a node is really isolated (degree equals zero in the original graph)? Can you perform a calculation based on the reciprocal distance matrix?
