This article deals with a novel approach to immune disorders via the macrophage gene therapy. I personally think that it has reached to the threshold level of a short review. It is relatively easy to gain the main points that the authors try to summarize here. Therefore, a brief comment attached for further modification. It is better to elaborate in-depth to support the current topic, or at least make your focal claims stand out. Another concern is that the authors are expected to point out some experimental directions or perspectives in this field to facilitate the next original works. Lastly, there are numerous abbreviations should be presented or listed throughout the text.
