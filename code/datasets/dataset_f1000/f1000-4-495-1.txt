The present article attempts to review a very important topic in the immunology and gene therapy fields regarding the available tools to target and modulate macrophages using gene therapy. The field of gene therapy has evolved tremendously in the last 10-15 years, but the attempt to target macrophage still remains challenging. However, this reviewer has some major concerns about the article: A review should conform a critical view of the classical information and the latest developments, carefully cited to acknowledge the original authors of the experiments, and importantly, provide with a deep analysis and sum-ups with the personal interpretation or insights of the authors. It should suggest the future directions in the field and possible experiments or models to be used for a significant further advance. This review does not fulfill these requirements. The presented text is not well organized in a focused vision, which makes it difficult to go through. Moreover, the text suffers from a lack of deep insights in the gene therapy field. Carefully designed figures and tables should be presented to contribute to the establishment of a central idea of the article. For instance, the reviewer feels that a table summarizing the viral and non-viral vectors that have been used for targeting macrophages and their corresponding references would help to a better understanding of the article. Moreover, the only figure present in this review does not involve gene therapy and has no figure legend. Authors should be careful with the bibliography. There seems to be a mismatch between the citations in the text and the list of references. Finally, and most importantly, the reviewer feels that authors do not have experience in this field to be able to write this type of review. In conclusion, the reviewer does not approve this article.
