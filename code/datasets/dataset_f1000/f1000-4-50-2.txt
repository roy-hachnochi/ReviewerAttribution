The authors describe ViennaNGS, a set of Perl modules and scripts to provide RNA-seq analysis and visualization via UCSC integration. The code is nicely written, open source and easy to install via CPAN with cpanminus. Additionally, the documentation is excellent and contains both high level material in the form of blog posts as well as detailed source code descriptions. In reading the paper I found a few areas that would help improve readers understanding of the toolbox: Please include additional information about what is unique about ViennaNGS in the introduction. Currently it reads generally and is more about pointing about flaws in other software without saying what ViennaNGS provides. The motivation provides much of this text but it seems out of order relative to the introductory material. Please provide benchmarks on your BAM manipulation tools relative other common tools. I dont think this needs to be extensive, but providing a summary of how they perform on a 100Gb 30x whole human genome sequence would be helpful. For filtering comparisons, I suggest comparing with samtools or sambamba (https://github.com/lomereiter/sambamba). For quality control, comparisons to QualiMap (http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es/) or bamtools (https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools) would be helpful. Similarly, it would be great to have benchamrking on annotation and BED manipulation tools in ViennaNGS. How does the functionality and timing compare with bedtools? You require and use bedtools for visualization, and it would be useful to clarify benefits and tradeoffs to using ViennaNGS versus interfacing directly with bedtools. How do you handle testing and validation of ViennaNGS tools and pipelines? I saw new tests for UCSC integration coming in during review, which is great. It would be nice to understand the process by which you ensure new development improves (or at least doesnt degrade) the biological results.
