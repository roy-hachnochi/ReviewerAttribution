The authors present a useful and relevant toolbox for the analysis of NGS data. Its modular design allows for flexibility in the analysis, and the utilization of track hubs for easy exchange of data as well as visualization with popular tools. A nice implementation is the ability to adapt genome annotations of various formats. Still, I feel the description of the software is rather too general and could be improved. Major Comments: The article lacks any benchmarking or presentation of an example analysis, making it difficult to put the softwares performance in perspective with any of the other numerous tools already available. Important for NGS data analysis are specifications for the usage of computational resources (RAM, number of CPUs, processing time, space requirements) and how those scale up with the size of the data set (=number and size of data sets) or type of NGS data (genomic, RNAseq, ChIPseq, Bisulfite-Seq) - all of which are not mentioned. Similarly, the authors do not make any statement on the possibility of parallelization or adaption to cluster infrastructures. Minor comments: Although, truly RPKM has been shown to be inappropriate for measuring the relative molar concentration of a RNA species due to normalization by the total number of reads, it is still widely used. Computing RPMK values as well (optionally) as TPM would allow for comparison with other pipelines.
