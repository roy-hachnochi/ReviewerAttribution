This paper presents an interesting theoretical studty on epigenetically modified DNA. Legend of Figure 1: Please include the numbering, so that non-experts can follow the rest of the text. Page 4: The presence of a hydroxymethyl slightly weakens the N4-H4...O6 Is there an internal hydrogen bond that is competing with the N4-H4O6 hydrogen bond? Please explain. Page 4 Formyl has a larger effect overall, lengthening N3...H1-N1 and O2...H2-N2 H-bonds and hence reducing binding by over 3 kcal/mol. This can easily be understood because N3 and O2 become less negative due to the electron withdrawing effect. See Chem. Eur. J. 2006 , 12 : 3032-3042 , Chem. Eur. J. 1999 , 5: 3581-3594 and Chem. Eur. J. 2011 , 17 : 8816-8818 and use these publications to explain these effects on the hydrogen bonds. The epigenetic modifications can be considered to be substituent effects and therefore the changes in the hydrogen bonds can be easily explained. Table 1: What are the hydrogen bonds lengths meant here? N4O6 or H4O6. The preference would be N4O6.
