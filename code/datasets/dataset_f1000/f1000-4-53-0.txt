The authors discuss the many issues that can complicate the discovery of new drugs. The authors summarize recent developments in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease which may be used as an example of what can or should be done to improve development of drugs in rare disease. The vast majority of CMT patients have copy number variations of PMP22. The authors propose a method destined to accelerate the identification of the different mutations associated with the CMT phenotype. The authors briefly review the treatment used in CMT1A rat models and consider their application to humans. Recently association of small doses of baclofen, naltrexone and sorbitol (PXT-3003) seemed promising and well tolerated. Phase 3 study is going to start in 2015, and it will take several years before a significant effect of the medication on CMT1A can be confirmed and the drug approved for treatment. The different methods of evaluation of the benefit of treatment are discussed. In addition, it must be kept in mind that CMT1A is a very slowly progressive disease, with phenotypic variations especially in presentation and course. A large number of patients carrying the same mutation thus need to be included in the studies and followed over many years. It will not be an easy task in a rare disease. This paper is useful in delineating the different steps that can lead to discovery of new drug in rare diseases, emphasizing the need for collaboration between geneticists, biochemists, drug companies and clinicians
