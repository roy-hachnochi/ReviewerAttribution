In this case report the authors describe two cases of patients highly suspicious for prostate cancer based on PSA levels, physical examination and MRI who underwent surgery and the final pathology coincided with the presumed diagnosis. It is not clear what is the benefit of undergoing major surgery without confirmed diagnosis, on the contrary, today we are moving forward and advocating for tissue diagnosis prior to oncological surgery. If the MRI is highly suspicious for tumor one can advocate for MRI/US fusion biopsy and reducing the number of cores taken to a minimum.
