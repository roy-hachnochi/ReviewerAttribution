This article provides a comprehensive and comprehensible summary of the research on potential anti-cancer activities of fenofibrate. The author thoroughly describes the available data on the possible mechanisms of fenofibrate effect on cancer cells, however he could have concentrated more on the compilation of these data to emphasize their scientific merit. For example, I would suggest an addition of a more in-depth conclusive summary of the direct/indirect effects of fenofibrate on cancer cells/normal (stromal) cells in vivo/in vitro. Moreover, due to the systemic tolerability of fenofibrate, a possibility of its application in palliative treatment/metastasis prevention of advanced cancers could be more thoroughly discussed. Please, also note that the reference 82 should be moved to Table 8, because it shows the augmentation of cell adhesion rather than the "anti-adhesion" effects. Reference 82 on page 11 and 13 contains a mistake in the name of the first author.
