This in an excellent comprehensive review of the literature related to Fenofibrate anticancer effects, which definitely deserves to be indexed after revision. I have three comments which should be implemented: It should be mentioned that fenofibrate is a prodrug, which is processed by blood esterases to fenofibric acid, and that fenofibric acid is potent agonist of PPARa. Therefore, there are two very different substances, fenofibrate and fenofibric acid, which could have very different anticancer properties. As far as I understand the system, mitochondrial and growth factor-mediated effects are rather associated with unprocessed fenofibrate, which in opposite to fenofibric acid is capably of interacting with biological membranes. Reference 89 in table 6 should be updated (see below); and the issue of Fenofibrate and mitochondrial respiration deserves a separate paragraph since it explains how unprocessed fenofibrate can target tumor cells, being at the same time much less harmful to normal cells. Other described mechanisms could be involved as a consequence of this primary mitochondrial action, which actually happens in minutes.
