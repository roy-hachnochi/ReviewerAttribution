The authors have developed a method for summarizing information Gene Ontology searches in a format that makes it easier to understand. They focus on the most relevant Gene Ontology terms and make a word picture with the size of the words indicating their strength in the Gene Ontology results. There is also a method to take principal components of a gene expression dataset and visualize the behavior of different components in each sample along with the word pictures describing the gene ontology categories. The formatting is easy to understand and I expect that this software will be valuable for scientists investigating gene expression analysis.
