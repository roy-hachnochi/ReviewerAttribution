The recent Ebola virus outbreak came as a surprise and the authors suggest possible steps to improve the situation in case of another Ebola epidemic outbreak. The main focus is on cost effective easy implementable steps that could be taken to accelerate drug development or other therapeutic approaches. I think the suggested strategies and cost effective approaches are relevant not only in case of Ebola but could also be useful in case of other infectious diseases. The paper is well and clearly written and of interest for a broad readership in the area of pharmaceutical research, medicine and other biomedical disciplines.
