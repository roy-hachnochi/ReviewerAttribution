In this correspondence Ramsbottom and colleagues refer to a publication by Rachel et al. (2015) in which phenotypes in mice strains with mutations in Cep290 (knock-out and a gen trap model) were studied, and a comparison with patients with Joubert syndrome (JBTS) with CEP290 mutations is made. In brief: mice develop a retinal degeneration, hydrocephalus, and a rather late onset progressive renal pathology, while JBTS patients develop kidney disease in childhood or early adulthood. In addition the majority of knock-out mice do not survive past weaning, thus the survivors are probably not really representative of the phenotype, Ramsbottom et al argue that differences between the outcomes in different mouse strains provide an opportunity to study how genetic variability affects the disease phenotype. This point is well taken. Looking at affected children (in my professional activity) even within the same sibship, with identical mutations, there is often marked intrafamilial variability of the phenotype, pointing to the relevance of genetic modifiers and probable interaction with other cilia-genes. Studies of mouse strains (and zebra fish) have greatly contributed to understanding Joubert related genes, however the animal phenotype may differ from humans - as illustrated by the lack of hydrocephalus in CEP290 mutated JBTS patients.
