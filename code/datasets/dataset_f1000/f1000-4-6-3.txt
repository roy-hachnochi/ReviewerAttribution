Thanks to the author for an interesting perspective article on open peer review. Following an invitation to review this article, I would like to request a couple of specific corrections and add a general comment and suggestion. Correction of Erroneous Statement: "Although ACP views its peer review process as completely transparent ( Pschl, 2004 ), it is not." Neither the cited reference nor the ACP journal web pages claim that the peer review process of ACP would be "completely transparent". There are good reasons to maintain an option for referees to remain anonymous, and this is also very clearly specified on the journal web pages as well as in the referenced article and in a more comprehensive review article (Pschl, 2012 as referenced and linked below). Thus, it would indeed be wrong to claim complete transparency for the open peer review process for ACP, but it is also wrong to insinuate that ACP or the cited article would have raised this claim. Please discard or correct the erroneous statement accordingly. Moreover, please complement or replace the reference to Pschl 2004 by a reference to Pschl 2012, because the latter is more comprehensive and up-to.date: Pschl U (2012) Multi-stage open peer review: scientific evaluation integrating the strengths of traditional peer review with the virtues of transparency and self-regulation. Front. Comput. Neurosci. 6 :33. doi: 10.3389/fncom.2012.00033 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2012.00033/abstract Correction of Erroneous Statement: It could be argued that synchronous review occurs, yet ACP does not consider papers posted at ACPD to be Because these papers are not considered published, their review is not synchronous. Neither the ACP journal web pages nor the articles providing an authoritative description of the ACP open peer review (Pschl, 2004 2012) have ever indicated that the papers posted in the ACP discussion forum, ACPD, would not be . Well on the contrary, all relevant journal web pages emphasize explicitly that the discussion papers posted and reviewed/discussed in ACPD are publications with permanent public accessibility, archiving and citability. Also my articles explaining the concepts of interactive open access publishing and multi-stage open peer review (Pschl, 2004 and 2014) specify and emphasize that the discussion papers published in ACPD - as well as in the fifteen interactive open access sister journals of the European Geosciences Union (EGU) - are indeed publications. Thus, it is inappropriate to insinuate the opposite. Please discard or correct the erroneous statement accordingly. http://www.egu.eu/about/statements/position-statement-on-the-status-of-discussion-papers-published-in-egu-interactive-open-access-journals/ http://www.atmospheric-chemistry-and-physics.net/general_information/publication_policy.html http://www.atmospheric-chemistry-and-physics.net/review/review_process_and_interactive_public_discussion.html http://www.atmospheric-chemistry-and-physics.net/general_information/faq.html http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/alpsp/lp/2004/00000017/00000002/art00005 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2012.00033/abstract General Comment and Suggestion: I understand and respect that the author prefers a fully transparent form of open peer review as implemented by F1000Research . However, F1000Research is a relatively recent follow-up on a series of earlier initiatives that have been pursuing open peer review and are reaching back into the last century. For example, see the British Medical Journal (BMJ), the Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (ETAI), the Journal of Interactive Media in Education (JIME) and other journals with open peer review as referenced in the recent research topic (special issue) on open evaluation (including open peer review) in the open access journal Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: http://journal.frontiersin.org/researchtopic/137 As detailed in my contribution to that collection of articles (Pschl 2012) and confirmed by independent studies referenced/linked below, ACP and its sister journals are by most standards of scientific publishing more successful and more efficient than comparable journals with traditional or alternative forms of peer review: http://www.atmospheric-chemistry-and-physics.net/pr_acp_is_interactive_open_access_publishing_able_to_identify_high_impact_submissions.pdf http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/13/74 Overall, I see no well-founded basis for the claim that the particular form open peer review practiced by F1000Research would deserve the attribute gold standard of open peer review, and I would suggest to substantiate or drop this postulate.
