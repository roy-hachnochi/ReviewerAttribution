The study applies the tools of content analysis to the stated editorial policies and procedures of a small number of journals in STEM disciplines adhering (to a greater or lesser degree) to the principles of open peer review. To promote replicability of the study and/or comparison between the set of journals included in the current study and other sets of journals, the study might be revised to include a table documenting the degree to which each journal under consideration did or did not meet the stated OPR principles. While the study is limited to review of relatively new publications and publication models in a defined field, it might also be revised to suggest future research opportunities, e.g., the degree to which OPR principles are employed in more established journals, the degree to which OPR experiments are being explored in other fields.
