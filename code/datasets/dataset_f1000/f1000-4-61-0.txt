I applaud the authors for their efforts on this paper. The topic is extremely important, and the information is accurate and well written. I only wish they had delved deeper into the related literature as there are many other studies on the supplements they reviewed as well as a vast array of nutritional supplements that have the potential to improve military readiness and/or performance. That said, both of these limitations have been acknowledged by the authors. I encourage them to publish several "follow up" papers to address them.
