This expertly constructed review article on hyaluronan (HA) provides an in-depth analysis of the relationship between its structural and physicochemical properties. The article also contains a well-informed update on the effects of modifications, such as protein binding, cross-linking and molecular weight on these properties. In particular, this is discussed in relation to its role in regulating the viscoelasticity of loose connective tissues (fascia) required for effective organ separation. For example, the authors point out that abnormally high HA-dependent viscosity in muscle fascia can lead to local and more generalized stiffness, and potentially mechanosensor-mediated pain. Indeed, this section could be expanded to underline the importance of future research on the effects of structural modifications on catabolic processing of HA, both within the extracellular matrix and in fluid compartments. On the general topic of hyaluronan-mediated effects at interfaces, readers will also find interesting the papers from Richter and colleagues who are examining the effects of end-grafted HA on the properties of glycoconjugate cell coats ( Richter, et al ., 2007 ), lipid membranes ( Attili, et al ., 2012 ), nanoparticles ( Bano, et al ., 2015 ) and pulmonary surfactants ( Lopez-Rodriguez, et al ., 2013 ). We have read this submission. We believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.
