This is an excellent review of the current biophysics and biology of hyaluronan. It presents an analysis of the complex non-ideal behaviour of hyaluronan characterised by different biophysical techniques and interprets this technical information in a way that enables the non-specialist to understand the consequences these properties have in biology. Its up to date and presents a very readable insight into the complex behaviour of this essentially simple biopolymer.
