This paper describes a method for the determination of iron in blood serum and plasma by a simple photometric procedure based on the cloud point extraction of a complex formed between ferrous ions and 1-nitroso-2-naphthol. Since spectrophotometric instrumentations own merits of simplicity, cheapness, portability and so on, this makes the paper interesting. The authors claim that this is a “rapid” assessment of iron; therefore, it is better that the total analysis time be specified. Also it’s better to have the complex formation reaction between Iron (II) ions and the ligand. Moreover, I prefer to see a table in which a comparison between the proposed method with other spectrophotometry methods for the determination of Fe(II) in blood samples is included.
