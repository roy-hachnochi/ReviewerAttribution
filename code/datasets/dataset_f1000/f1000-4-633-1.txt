This report addressed an important gap in the literature about the care-seeking delay of Vietnamese in the context of acute myocardial infarction. The major limitations of the study were small sample size and retrospective nature of the study. Nevertheless, this is a good start to provide quick preliminary findings to support a more formal and large scale study to examine the phenomenon. I have several additional comments: 69% of the sample suffered from STEMI, which is not consistent with the proportion of STEMI/NSTEMI in AMI population. This reflects that the sample is not representative and need to address in the discussion and limitation sections. Retrospective medical record review is not a reliable data collection method for collecting data on pre-hospital delay. The inconsistency for healthcare professionals to determine the symptom onset time creates a significant bias to the results. The very small number of NSTEMI patients made the subgroup analysis to be less appropriate.
