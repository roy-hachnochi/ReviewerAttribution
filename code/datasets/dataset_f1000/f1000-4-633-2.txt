I have read the Summary of revisions presented by the author of the paper "Pre-hospital delay in Vietnamese patients hospitalized with a first acute myocardial infarction: A short report". Generally, the author has improved the weak points indicated by reviewers by adding information, discussing the limitation issues, or re-structuring within each section of the paper. The main finding of this paper supplies evidence of pre-hospital delay among AMI patients in Vietnam that would probably result in further comprehensive study of this issue in the near future in Vietnam. I agree with the revisions of the author, and approve this paper.
