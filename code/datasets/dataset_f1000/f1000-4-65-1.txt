The mansucript by Trujillo et al. reports on the investigation of the escape pathway of oxygen in HbI from Scapharca inaequivalvis carried out exploiting computational tools. Wild type and selected mutants were investigated to evidence the effects of mutations on the escaping routes as well as on the relevance of cavities where ligands can transiently bind. The robustness of molecular simulation results is difficult to assess. One key element for this assessment is the agreement with experimental data whenever they are available. In this case, previous kinetic studies using CO as a ligand on wild type and mutants (quoted in the manuscript), as well as oxygen binding in solution (quoted in the manuscript) and in the crystalline state ( Mozzarelli et al. ,1996 ), are available. Authors should re-write the Discussion by comparing computational and experimental data, and pointing to agreements and disagrements. This approach was followed by Bisht et al. (2011) , Spyrakis et al. (2011) and Abbruzzetti et al. (2011) for escaping routes in AHbI from Arabidopsis thaliana. Further points: Authors should indicate i) how many times the simulations with the 14 oxygen molecules were carried out, ii) which is the statistics on the different escaping routes, offering a visual indication from the most probable to the less probable escaping route. As shown by Mozzarelli et al. (1996) the cooperativity is fully conserved in HbI crystal as in solution, contrary to human Hb where crystallization prevent tertiary and quatrenary transitions. This makes very interesting the computational analysis here reported because the structure used in the investigation is functionally active.
