 Summary In this manuscript Guillot and Cox test the claim made by Balaresque et al . (2015) that a subset of Y-chromosome haplotypes from Central Asian men occur at “unusually” high frequency, possibly indicating social selection for men carrying these lineages. Using simulations designed to match the data reported by Balaresque et al . the authors demonstrate that the reported distribution of Y chromosome haplotypes can be obtained under neutral conditions. This suggests that it is not necessary to invoke a model that includes cultural transmission of reproductive success to explain the observed distribution. Comment While the focus of this correspondence article is on the Balaresque data, can the authors briefly comment on other papers that have also investigated cultural transmission of reproductive success—specifically, have there been other studies that report high frequency Y haplotypes in other populations that are not consistent with neutrality?
