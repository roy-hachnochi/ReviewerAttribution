Guillot and Cox present a very interesting criticism of Balaresque et al .s work in press on high frequency haplotypes in Central Asian Y chromosomes, by showing that distributions like those observed by Balaresque and colleagues can be observed using neutral simulations. I have three comments I would like to see the authors address: The "Genghis Khan reproductive success" hypothesis emerged in Zerjal et al .s work in 2003 and I think it would be helpful for the authors to comment on what analyses in that work support Zerjal et al .s conclusions; can their simulations reproduce what Zerjal et al . observed under strictly neutral processes without a high number of mergers in the coalescent process? The phrase "historically unrecorded, culturally undistinguished, but biologically lucky Central Asian men." should be changed to "historically unrecorded but biologically lucky Central Asian men." The authors should provide sample output files for their simulation pipeline for users to analyze, and their code so that the number of simulations run is a user-provided argument. Given that the pipeline can take at least hours and perhaps days to generate the million simulations they studied, a toy example is worth looking at quickly and the authors could allow readers to generate examples more quickly without needing to fiddle with the bash/python/R pipeline on their own.
