Very interesting article. General comments: The appropriateness of the title: Ok. Whether the abstract provides an adequate summary of the article: I would include the total number of articles found in the abstract. If there is a comprehensive explanation of study design, methods and analysis, and their suitability to the investigation: Ok. Whether the conclusions are balanced and justified on the basis of the results: I suggest commenting more on the implications of the findings in regard the advance to obtain an available vaccine for Ebola. With regards to the data (if applicable), whether sufficient information has been provided for replication of the experiment, and/or if the data are in a usable format: Ok. I have only two recommendations: To further discuss why the authors only assessed the database PubMED/Medline, and why Science Citation Index and Scopus were not included. Even we can consider to include also some African database. V1 of this article appears online on March 13, 2015, however, 7 days before, on March 6, 2015, appeared online the following article: Cruz-Caldern S, Nasner-Posso KM, Alfaro-Toloza P, Paniz-Mondolfi AE, Rodrguez-Morales AJ. A bibliometric analysis of global Ebola research .

Then, I consider this should be cited, as a preliminary approach to this topic. Also comparing the findings between both. This analysis included PubMED/Medline, Science Citation Index and Scopus.
