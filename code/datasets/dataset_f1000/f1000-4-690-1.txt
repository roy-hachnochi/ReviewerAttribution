This is a well-written manuscript providing information on the use of socioeconomic status (SES) measures as covariates in 76 papers from 66 cohort studies. The study is interesting and original. I only have a few minor points which could improve the presentation of findings: The objectives of the study may be clarified in the background or methods sections of the abstract; In the conclusions of the abstract, I suggest to delete the term "therefore" (2 nd line of the Conclusions); In population-based cohort studies, income may represent a major problem, given the likely high nonresponse rate. For example, in a European cross-sectional study I conducted in 2010 on more than 18,000 European adults, 22% of participants did not provide information on income, and only a negligible proportion of subjects did not provide information on education. Also for this reason, education (or alternatively occupation) may be considered a more appropriate proxy of SES than income. This issue may be further addressed both in the abstract and in the main text.
