The report entitled "How to avoid pitfalls in antibody use" by Pauly and Hanack is a reasonable opinion piece with useful information and results from their survey. As such, it deserves indexing. I have already used the supplementary figure a couple of times as reference. However, in my opinion, the piece does require a thorough tightening up in writing style. The authors should improve the writing to make the piece more formal to align with standard journal practices, removing most uses of "I", "we" and "my", strewn throughout the article. For example: current text "What is the target protein I want to characterize?" may read better as "What is the target protein to be characterized?" current text "How is my target protein structured in these samples?" may read better as "What is the configuration (concentrated protein, within complex tissue, membrane bound) of the target protein in the samples?" current text "Of course we agree with James Trimmer that “antibodies are not magic reagents” 5 , but properly designed, characterized, validated and used, some can come close." may read better as "Indeed, James Trimmer the founder of NeuroMab states that “antibodies are not magic reagents” 5 , but properly designed, characterized, validated and used, some can come close." The informal style detracts from the message and should be updated to increase impact.
