The aim of this paper is to make a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between obesity and depression in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. The results of the study may allow development of prediction tools and better interventions in such condition. The rationale for the study is provided and the methods proposed seem correct. My only reservation is that, in psychiatric patients and in general population, obesity has been found to be mostly associated with a specific kind of depression, i.e. depression with atypical features or atypical depression ( Levitan et al , 2012, Glaus et al , 2013, Chou and Yu, 2013). Therefore, I would suggest that the authors may take this kind of depression into account in their analysis.
