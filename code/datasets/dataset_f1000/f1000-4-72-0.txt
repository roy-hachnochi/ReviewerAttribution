No changes have been made to the text of the report. We apologise for this error. This is an interesting report in which a 54bp homozygous insertion in exon-1 of LHCGR have been found that are associated with poor ovarian response. That should be helpful for understanding the effect of short sequence repeat in LHCGR on ovarian response. But there still are a number of concerns that need to be addressed. The sequence of 54bp insertion should be (CTGCTGAAGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCAG) 2 , but not (GCTGCTGAAGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCA) 2, which did not change the amino acid sequence but consist with the previous reported insertions of 6bp (CTGCAG), 33bp and 27bp (CTGCTGAAGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCAG). Moreover, it would be interesting to discuss why the 6bp to 54bp duplication in the same region adversely affect LHCGR response to hCG/LH. How about the LHCGR sequence of the patients parents and sibling? Whether the insertion is an autosomal recessive disorder or a kind of dynamic mutation? Insertions in exon-1 of LHCGR gene were first studied in male Leydig cell hypoplasia. In present study, the patient with 54bp insertion had ovaries with thick capsule. Is there some relationship? There are some typos and awkward phrasing in the manuscript. E.g. Later, a homozygous 33bp and a 27bp insertions (CTGCTGAAGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCAG, amino acids:) . There should be the sequence of amino acids, right? So please review carefully for those.
