I have now looked through the new version and can happily remove my reservations regarding the earlier version. My main biological concernthat dosages of secondary metabolites need to be considered in the light of honeypot dynamicsis now given an intelligent discussion. The problems with table entries and figure labels have also been corrected. I did not see a need to change the title, but I agree that the new title is good and appropriate.
