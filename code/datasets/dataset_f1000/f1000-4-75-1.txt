This is an interesting upgrade of the SARM methodology, now endeavored with a probability-driven activity prediction tool described in this paper. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend indexation as is, because the methodology is not comprehensively described: some formulae embedded in a Figure are never rigorously explained, except by means of some hand-waiving example. Therefore, I (hope I) got the principle of the method - looks very much like naive Bayes to me. If so - does it do better than standard naive Bayes, with some fragment count descriptors? Honestly, I could not write a piece of code implementing it on the basis of what is said in the paper. Dont understand cryptic annotations like 1(v(x)=v) - suppose its some Kronecker delta symbol sum only over lines with v(x)=v... but, by the way, what is ? Molecules? Matrix columns? Rows? This is the best-kept secret of the publication...
