Gupta-Ostermanns "follow-up" manuscript is well written and clearly laid out. I only have a few (minor) recommendations, which I believe would help readers more easily replicate their work. The added value of this manuscript lies in figure 3 where "conditional probabilities of activity" are explained. The authors have explained conditional probabilities with figures, text and associated mathematical equations and have even gone so far as to carry out the math for the weighted core class contributions. For interested readers who want to implement the conditional probabilities concept in their own research, I highly suggest that real (or toy) data be included, in the very least, as supplemental material with all the data completely worked out, not just the weighted core class contributions. This would allow one to implement the concept, carry out the math and compare the results to the published results more easily. Additionally, although text is included to explain conditional probabilities, I found myself having to read this section a few times to fully understand the clear impact this method could have. I think this section needs to be expanded with more text. Finally, although it is understandable that the work carried out herein with PRISM BioLab Corporation, is proprietary, it is unfortunate that more information regarding the "twenty synthesized candidates" can not be elaborated upon. Any information regarding the similarity of these compounds to the actives (or even the similarity range of the actives themselves) would be informative.
