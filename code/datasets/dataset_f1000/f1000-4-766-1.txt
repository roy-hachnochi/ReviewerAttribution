Barman et al . report data on the impact of “pre-surgery status” on post-operative surrogates of the inflammatory response to surgery. The overall concept to assess pre-existing health status as a confounder for post-operative inflammation is not completely new and the authors fail to discuss their concept in the light of current understanding of “trained immunity” as opposed to “tolerance”. Unfortunately, the report lacks critical information that is mandatory in clinical studies: For instance, the authors claim that patients undergoing elective surgery over a period of more than a year were enrolled, yet there are a total of 19 patients (a CONSORT flow diagram is missing). This low number limits interpretation with only 4 patients attributed to “HR” group. No information as to the type of surgery – except the elective nature – is provided. Statistics are sub-par and the normalization to presumably very low pre-surgery values with “1000%” increases post-op are obsolete.
