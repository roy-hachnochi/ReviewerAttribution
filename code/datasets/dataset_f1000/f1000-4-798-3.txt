The concept and successful execution of this "experiment" makes it worth publishing. The data collected supports the premise that sharing a poster through a dedicated # will attract participants. However, some of the other concerns raised about the limitations of more traditional research poster sessions do not seem to be addressed. It is not clear why this was conducted as a competition and whether there would have been the same level of participation without this element. So, the level of engagement might have been biased by a factor not usual in a poster session. It would have been very useful to have a "qualitative" content analysis of the tweets, or at least a sample of tweets to understand what was exchanged in the messages. This would add to understanding of the potential value of a Twitter-fest for scientific exchange. At least an analysis of the scope or "build" of discussion would be useful. How many exchanges were two, three or four exchanges? How many exchanges were builds on a core comment or additions to an initial exchange? It may also have been beneficial to have a discussion as to the implications of the countries participating. The conclusions of success based on "ease of knowledge exchange, lack of travel requirement, and reduction in carbon footprint" are somewhat questionable, given that these are the qualities of social media (especially Twitter) and so do not reflect on the success or value of this activity. It may have been useful to solicit some feedback from participants, including the presenters, as to how they felt about the experience, the quality of the exchange, and the interest in doing again.
