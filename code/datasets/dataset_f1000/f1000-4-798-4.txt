This is an interesting paper that describes and evaluates a Twitter poster conference. The authors have clearly highlighted the potential reach that Twitter provides scientists wishing to engage others with their work and the ways in which Twitter as a medium has distinct advantages over traditional face to face interaction. In doing so this paper provides a useful starting point for a discussion about the use of social media as a conference format. The authors acknowledge the limitations of twitter (e.g. limited ability to have an in depth discussion) but from the presented data they are unable to discuss this in any detail. In my opinion this is an area that should be investigated further. As an initial foray into the field this is a (very necessary) descriptive rather than investigative piece. In order that I might fully evaluate the value of the model I would have like to have more information about the broader themes of the tweets themselves what proportion of them asked/answered a relevant question? How many were simply an indication of approval or an acknowledgement of participation in the virtual meeting etc. I dont think that this information needs to be added to the current paper (it makes a valuable initial contribution) but I would encourage the authors to follow this work with such an analysis if that is possible. There is one minor change that I think would increase the initial readability of the paper. On first reading I found myself confused about the nature of the conference, perhaps revealing a prejudice based on prior experience and pre-conception I assumed that the Twitter poster conference was an adjunct to a physical meeting rather than a stand alone event. It may help readers to avoid this mistake if the authors explained that more clearly in the abstract?
