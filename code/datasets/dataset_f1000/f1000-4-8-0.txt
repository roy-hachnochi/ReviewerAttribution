This study is a review of the evidence concerning the nutrition transition in South Asia, and its relationship with the increasing burden of chronic illnesses. The revised version of the manuscript is vastly improved in terms of providing extra evidence, reduction of extraneous information and the overall coherence and quality of language, and we would like to commend the author in their efforts. The comments provided by us towards the original manuscript have been addressed either through revisions in the manuscript, or via the authorâ€™s responses. Additionally, the compilation of the literature evidence in Table 4 is very welcome. We recommend this manuscript to be indexed, since it compiles and reviews the current scientific understanding of the South Asian nutrition transition, along with addressing the various associated factors and the multifaceted policy implications.
