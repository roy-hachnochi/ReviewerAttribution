This is a widespread, well-balanced and comprehensive review of study over the last two decades on the nutrition transition. The manuscript reads well and has important findings. The introduction clearly defines the purpose of the manuscript and the relevance to the policy practice. However, the author does not clearly describe the literature search strategies in the methods section as he mentioned it in the objective of the study. He stated that he used several electronic databases including COCHRANE library. Has he fulfilled the COCHRANE checklist? He also did not clearly state the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Even he stated that there were no special exclusion criteria (why there are no special exclusion criteria?). My concerns are while the method of review paper is unclear, it will dilute the findings and the discussion later. I found that some of findings are diluted and unclear. In revising the manuscript, the author should: Divide the published studies between review studies and empirical studies, and bring to light emerging evidence from existing review studies and clarify what new evidence is learnt from their review. Divide evidence regarding different terms of transition that he focused on and explanatory factors contributing to the nutrition transition in South Asia. In the "Methods" section, clarify which are the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the agreement for selecting the published articles used for review, the indicator(s) are used to evaluate the nutrition transition or lack of it, and attempt in the presentation of the findings to interpret the sensitivity of the findings to alternative specification of indicator for measuring the timing and stage of transitions. Summarise in a table the evidences (and number of studies) for the nutrition transition by country coverage (rural, urban, sub-national, national); then address the extent to which the predictive article expected from the nutrition transition has varied across study countries.
