This Research Note is an extension of the authors 2014 article (reference 3). It has a very clearly defined question, whether changes made to the primary outcomes are associated with statistically significant primary outcomes. The present data therefore includes only completed interventional studies on clinicaltrials.gov. The second paragraph of the Methods section refers to the 2014 article. This is unhelpful, particularly as it is not clear from the 2014 article how changes in primary outcomes are defined. The final paragraph of the Results section states that registration year, funding source and primary outcome change after trial completion were associated with a significant primary outcome - yet these are in opposite directions; and registration year is complex (looking at the data and 2014 article). That is brevity has taken over from clarity. Some of the limitations are included in the Conclusions: what exactly the changes were ( versus actual change; whether the changed outcome was the statistically significant outcome reported). The authors have not gone on to analyse their results by phase of trial; if the trials are randomised controlled trials, or otherwise. Another important question is how many of the completed trials have reported their results within a set timeframe (one year/two years), that is what about the trials that have not reported their results? Has the number of industry funded trials increased over time compared with mixed and public funded trials? In plain language, what is the extent of the problem?
