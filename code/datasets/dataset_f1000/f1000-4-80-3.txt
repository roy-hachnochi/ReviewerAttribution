Ramagopalan and colleagues have expanded on their previous work to assess the relationship between changes in the primary endpoint on clinicaltrials.gov and both funding source and a trial result. The authors found that changes to the primary listed endpoint were associated with both industry funding and with a positive outcome. Their sample included completed interventional clinical trials listed on clinicaltrials.gov. They defined trials as having a positive result if they had a listed p-value 0.05. This may be problematic since it appears that their sample included non-inferiority trials (though it is not clear how many) and for these trials a non-significant p-value may indicate a (or at least non-inferior) result. Since there have been growing numbers of non-inferiority trials published in recent years, this may be a substantial issue. The authors may want to consider identifying non-inferiority trials and considering their results differently, or at least reporting the prevalence of non-inferiority trials if possible. Aside from this methodologic weakness the other methods are rather straightforward and clear. However, the authors found that 95.4% of trials had changed the primary outcome at some point during the registration period. In contrast, in their previous work the same authors found that 32% of trials registered with clinicaltrials.gov had changed the primary endpoint. The reason for this dramatic difference is not clear, and the authors do acknowledge that the vast majority of studies changed their primary endpoint and that many of the changes may have been trivial. Further, in spite of this surprising finding the authors still found significant associations. However, the near-total prevalence of changes to the primary endpoint certainly suggests that changing a primary endpoint in the registry is highly routine and likely does not reflect fundamental change to the study. This weakens the relevance of the findings.
