Authors report an extremely uncommon entity of postraumatic aneurysm in a child, who developed hydrocephalus and showed rapid neurological worsening, managed with the placement of an external ventricular drain, followed by successful surgical management of surgery of aneurysm. The index case, a four-year-old girl, presented with a history of sudden onset severe headache in association with generalized tonic clonic seizures with antecedent history of a minor fall. On examination, the Glasgow coma score was 14, right sided hemiparesis, a CT scan of the head revealed presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the inter-hemispheric fissure and left sylvian fissure and associated intracerebral hemorrhage in the basifrontal region, however, a vascular aetiology was not suspected and managed conservatively. Ideally digital substraction angiography ( DSA) should have been carried out and managed accordingly to the findings. She again presented after one month with re-bleed, required external ventricular drain placement for hydrocephalus. DSA revealed an aneurysm in the region of left anterior cerebral artery, although both distal anterior cerebral arteries were filling with right internal carotid artery injection, and underwent craniotomy and trapping of the aneurysm. Hydrocephalus development is a common and devastating complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with incidence of 20% to 30% cases. Onset of hydrocephalus can be acute as early as within 48 hours or delayed by up to weeks following ictus. Early recognition of symptoms and signs and computed tomography findings are important for planning of management. As cases showing rapid deterioration need external ventricular drain, to tide the crisis, which may be converted to ventriculo-peritoneal shunt as it aids in management of raised intracranial pressure, helps in clearance of intraventricular blood. 1 , 2 Intracranial traumatic aneurysm is a relatively rare clinical entity caused by blunt, penetrating, or iatrogenic head trauma 3 , 4 . It can be classified histologically as false or true aneurysm. In false aneurysms or pseudoaneurysm disruption involves all layers of the arterial wall associated with the presence of hematoma in the surrounding soft tissue that prevents extravasations of blood and is considered the most common form of traumatic intracranial aneurysms 5 . In true aneurysms, the intimal layer, internal elastic lamina and media layers are disrupted but with an intact tunica adventitia. The intracranial space into which the hemorrhage occurs depends on the vessel and the segment of the vessel involved. Once an extracranial artery becomes intradural, the external elastic lamina disappears transforming the arterial wall into a relative weak vessel. 4 , 5 The reported risk of hemorrhage in posttraumatic pseudoaneurysm is 19%, with a peak incidence of rupture at 2–3 weeks after the injury, resulting in 32–54% mortality. 5 Treatment options include surgical repair and endovascular interventions. The treatment approach is often needed to be a tailor made approach for individual cases, and depends on factors such as atypical locations, irregular shape, relation with parent vessel and branches, age of patient, and shapes are a factor 1 , 3 , 6 . Miley et al. analysed DSA of 74 patients with the diagnosis of closed head injury, vascular injury detected in 24 cases and out of which four cases had total of 4 traumatic intracranial pseudoaneurysm, were located in the supraclinoid segment of the internal carotid artery in two case, one in the cavernous segment and rest one in the paraophthalmic segment 6 .
