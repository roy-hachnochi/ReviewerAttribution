This is a case report of a 4-year-old child with a delayed intracerebral hematoma resulting from the traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the left A1 segment. As authors emphasized, this is a very rare case occurring in childhood and the management of the patient, including the surgical treatment, was excellent. In the discussion, the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment option of the traumatic intracranial aneurysms were briefly but well documented. Finally, this article can be considered as acceptable, although the following points should be addressed: They should discuss the possibility that the pseudoaneurysm had already developed when the child first complained of a headache 2 days after head injury. They should describe the details about the surgical method focusing how they trapped the aneurysm with one clip. Did they clip only the neck or A1 segment itself? I cannot understand what H complex was redefined means in the operation.
