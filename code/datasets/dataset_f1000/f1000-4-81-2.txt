The manuscript presents Kvik as an open-source system for explorative analysis of functional genomics data from large epidemiological studies. The authors seem have excellent ideas, but the implementation of the tool is far behind these ideas. I would like to approve the manuscript if the following points can be addressed: The target of the tools. There are in general two type of tools: data provider and tool provider. The two of course can be combined. The prior in general provides knowledge, and the later provides functions to analyze users own data. Kvik however seems lack the data to be a knowledge provider, and also does not provide enough functionality to be the later. To be the former, I will recommend authors to add more epidemiological data, to be the later, the author need to give clear instruction how users own data can be analyzed using Kvik. For an example, the idea to connect to the cloud service is excellent, but how can Kvik to achieve this? The implementation of Kvik seems to be improved, especially the performance. When I tried the Kvik, the browser tells me several time that the page is not responding. Yet I know the page is responding, but just take too much time. In addition, from data security point of view, it is not good to use RPCs from the browser layer to data engine directly, it shall be avoid in general in the three-tier architecture. The manuscript need to focus more on the functionality of the tool. The current manuscript has too many technical details.
