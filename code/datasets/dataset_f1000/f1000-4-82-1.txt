While many people on twitter sing its praises for use in class, I think there is a real lack of worked examples of how exactly one would use the medium. Moreover, cases that have demonstrated impacts are precious few. This piece addresses both of these shortcomings with a convincing and even handed approach to how one could use technology to augment an undergraduate field based class. They show that it works well for a given period of time, but that like all tools, there are appropriate and inappropriate uses for twitter. Having used the tool in several of my cases, I can wholeheartedly agree with the lack of engagement post-class - the medium simply isnt for everyone. However I think the authors here clearly show how using Twitter can help a class expand beyond the traditional boundaries and help students learn to engage in informal science discourse.
