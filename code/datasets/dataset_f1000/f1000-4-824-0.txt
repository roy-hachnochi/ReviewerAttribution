I am in total favour of publishing reports of negative results, if the study is well conducted, as this one is. Malaria during pregnancy is an outstanding health issue that needs significant investigation. Biomarkers able to predict adverse outcomes are needed, and inflammation-related factors are a logical choice. This study on the correlation between MIF (either in the maternal or in the cord blood), placental infection and pregnancy outcomes (maternal hemoglobin and birth weight) goes in this direction, and quite clearly shows that there is no correlation. The number of cases is possibly low, and no cases with blood malaria were found in the cohort. Although possibly preliminary, the study is nevertheless very clear and straight forward in its design, conduction and logical conclusions.
