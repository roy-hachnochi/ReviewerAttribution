This is an interesting Case Report, particularly relative from the aspect of implications of fungi, their mycotoxins and a possible role in malignancy, e.g., See: Kaufmann et al. Oncology News, 9, 164-66, 2014, and references therein . Given the implications, it is surprising the authors did not do more of a thorough infectious disease workup, whereby the patients compromised physiological status may have made her vulnerable to kidney and bladder infections. It is reasonable that whereby, their use of catheters, the fungus may have arisen from a contaminated catheter. The latter begs the question as to why the authors did not identify the fungus?
