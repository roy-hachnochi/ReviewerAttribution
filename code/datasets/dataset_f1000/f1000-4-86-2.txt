I appreciate that there have been noticeable improvements, hence I am now able to accept this article with reservations. I hope authors find my suggestions useful. I would have preferred if the response letter was more specific, quoting the suggestions offered by the reviewers and directly underneath the author responses showing how they have addressed them. Currently I have no easy way to check how you have addressed my previous comments. The response letter has some grammatical errors. I paste below the bits that are grammatically incorrect. I would recommend that authors have proof read their submitted materials before sending them. "according to reviewers remarks” “this application is more design” “Description of the software is also a more precise" I am unable to run the image http://webext.pasteur.fr/metagensense/metagensense.ova as I do not have the ability to create virtual machines. Perhaps having a set of images that describe exactly the point authors want to make regarding this virtual machine could help the review process. This seems to be done in Figure 2, although the resolution is not sufficient. I am unable to read the font inside of Figure 2’s window screenshots. I would like to be able to see what each of them shows. This way I would be able to see how the interface works for each of the stages (e.g., Connection, Project creation, etc.). I went to GitHub and I went to "http://metagensense.test.fr:8000” but the answer I got from the server was "metagensense.test.fr refused to connect”. In the installation notes of the README.md, the first step points to virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper. I would have appreciated if authors could provide in there how I can install virtualenv. It is just need to take a few instructions from https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/.
