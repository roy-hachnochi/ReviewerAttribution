 General comments The authors have developed MetaGenSense, a web-based application for analysing metagenomics data. MetaGenSense also acts as a laboratory information management system, managing the metagenomics data and the results of their analysis by Galaxy workflows. The work done by the authors sounds promising since I am a fan of Galaxy and of the Django framework. However, I believe the paper can be much improved by providing additional details in a number of places. For example, it would be interesting to learn more about the two prototyped workflows for analysing metagenomics data which are alluded to in the "Pre-designed Galaxy workflow" section on page 5. The "Case study - use example" section could also be improved by providing screenshots of the MetaGenSense GUI which are relevant to each or some of the steps. At the moment, I have no idea what the GUI for MetaGenSense looks like since there is also no example instance of MetaGenSense available on the Web which would have been useful for reviewing this paper. In the final paragraph, it is stated that MetaGenSense can be easily deployed but looking at the source code in https://github.com/F1000Research/MetaGenSense , there appears to be a lack of documentation to enable me to do this. For example, which version of Django should I use with MetaGenSense? How do I get the MetaGenSense source code integrated with the Django framework? The LIMS for MetaGenSense uses PostgreSQL; how do I set up this database and get it linked to MetaGenSense? How do I provide MetaGenSense with access to a Galaxy server? I think the authors need to provide this type of information to help readers install MetaGenSense for the authors source code to be more useful. Minor corrections Page 3: Paragraph 4 Pacific Bioscience should be Pacific Biosciences. Paragraph 7 BiobBlend should be BioBlend. Page 4 worflow_remote should be workflow_remote like BWA through galaxy - should be, "like BWA through Galaxy..." Page 5 Case study - use example: Need to be consistent by starting bullet points with capital letters.
