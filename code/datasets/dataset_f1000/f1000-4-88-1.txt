In general this is an interesting and important study again showing that brain size (or ICV) is quite important for morphometric analyses and especially when comparing the sexes. In this context I would like to draw the attention of the authors to a recent paper paper of our group ( Jncke et al ., 2015 ) in which actually the same has been done (with a few exceptions) as in this study. However, in that paper the authors have used a much larger sample (n=856) and identified small or even non-existing sex influences on several brain compartments when ICV and/or FBV has been used as control variable. This finding and the finding report by the authors is in line with several studies of our group ( Jncke et al ., 1997 ; Lders et al ., 2002 ) but also with studies from other groups ( Leonard et al ., 2008 , Lematre et al ., 2005 ). Thus, sex differences are small or non-existing when one use brain size corrections. However, what is unknown so far (in my opinion) is whether there are indeed some sex differences, which are still there but which we do not "see" using the more or less cars methods we are all using. Thus, we have to be carefully in making to firm conclusion in terms of using potential anatomical sex differences as the basis of possible sex-gender-differences in behavior. Thus, the authors should add some comments on that, too.
