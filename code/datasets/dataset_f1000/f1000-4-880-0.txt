Overall we feel that the authors fully addressed our concerns and those of the other reviewer and significantly improved their manuscript. The fact that they were able to conduct a short experiment adds to the paper and to their conclusions, and we appreciate their willingness and ability to do this. We just have two minor comments, that likely do not require a revision of the paper, but the authors can decide. Perhaps, due to the openness of the reviews and subsequent replies, this discussion is sufficient. However, if the authors choose to, it would be nice if they make their 'a priori' approach for model selection explicit in the manuscript, and we do not think they should be quite so dismissive of the possible interaction between weight and their treatments. For example, in the authors' response to our earlier comments regarding the possible interaction, they state that other papers either don’t report the interaction or it’s non-significant in the Barrachi paper, which is not an entirely satisfying reason to ignore it here. Additionally, the Barrachi paper did find a significant weight x treatment effect for at least one portion of their experiment. It seems as though this test could at least be attempted, but again we do not think that this necessarily requires a revision of the manuscript. References 1.
