The authors responded appropriately to my concerns and other important points raised by Dr.’s Simone-Finstrom and Lopez-Uribe. I appreciated that authors conducted an additional ‘Consumption experiment’ as required. Despite the new results are puzzling and did not provide a clear and definitive picture of the ‘story’ they are well discussed. Overall, I found the manuscript improved and I think that it represents an important starting point for further investigations. Accordingly, I recommend indexing the submitted revised article.
