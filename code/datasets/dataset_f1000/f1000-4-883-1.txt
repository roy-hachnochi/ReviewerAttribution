The authors describe ICR1000, a UK-based reference data set for variation. Using 1000 consented samples from the 1958 UK birth cohort, they performed deep exome sequencing to a median depth of 15X. The samples were chosen from those who self-reported as having white British ancestry though does not comprise samples from individuals of other ancestry in the general British population. All data have been deposited in the EGA, and so are available as a resource to other bona fide researchers. This is a thorough and well performed study that includes detailed methods and results. In particular the authors have developed a pipeline with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting indels. This results in findings of nearly 11,000 indels, over half of which are novel and in total over 159,000 rare variants were found (with frequency of 0.1%). It would be helpful if the authors could include a comparison to the UK10K project. This was a major UK-based initiative that sequenced 4000 genomes of individuals with deep phenotype data and these data are also available in the EGA. In conclusion, this is valuable work that found new rare variants that will improve exome analysis. In particular, identification of novel indels, which have not been well characterised in many other studies, is of importance to the field and will be of benefit to clinical genomics where correct interpretation of rare variants is key. --- Here is a citation for the database mentioned in the paper.
