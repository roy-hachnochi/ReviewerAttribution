This paper proposes a novel index based on the number of citations, normalized by the number of authors and the date of publication, which is then scaled from 0.0 to 9.9 using the natural logarithm. The index proposed is intuitively designed in a simple way for readers to understand, with a fractional counting scheme adopted to normalize the number of citations, which appears reasonable. However, it will be necessary to adjust the index according to the relationship between the number of citations and the date of publication, since they are not precisely inversely proportional in every time window. Finally and fundamentally, whether the number of authors and the date of publication are truly indicative of publication quality remains open to speculation.
