The paper by Wojick and Michaels has interesting potential. As it stands, however, I suggest "not approved" for the reasons that follow. The underlying logic is flawed. On one hand, the authors write, “We make no distinctions regarding the source of funding.” On the other hand, they are aware of Krimsky’s findings about the biasing effect of commercial funding. Given the differences in funding goals by commercial and non-commercial funders and different types of non-commercial funders, failure to consider funder mission as a variable undermines the analysis. Second, the paper makes factual errors. For instance, the statement, “The selection of proposals is ultimately up to the funding program officers,” is somewhat correct at NSF but mostly false at NIH. Some fact checking with organizational representatives would be useful. The suggestion of a link between bias and Kuhnian paradigms is unconvincing given the differences in organizational missions and oversight mechanisms. Finally, the organization of the paper makes it hard to follow. The discussion of cascading effects would make much more sense at the end of the manuscript rather than at the beginning once the discussion of individual effects has been completed. I would find this paper more valuable if it developed the taxonomy in terms of funder-dependent differences in biases and their potential functions within the funding organizations. For instance, NIH intentionally is known to be biased towards new investigators but recently discovered to be unintentionally biased towards minority investigators. Once the funder-dependent biases have been documented, a discussion of how they might arise and how they might influence investigator behavior also would be interesting to develop further.
