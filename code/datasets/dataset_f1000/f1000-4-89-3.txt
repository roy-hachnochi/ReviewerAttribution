 The title and abstract of the manuscript: Both are appropriate. The design, methods and analysis of the results from the study: The methods and design have been explained, and the analyses are appropriate for the topic being studied. The results show impressive increases in ADAM9 gene expression in blood leukocytes in some disease states. However there are issues regarding the design/content of the study: It is not clear from reading only the manuscript whether the controls and disease groups are matched with respect to age, sex, and/or race/ethnicity, and/or whether the disease groups studied have co-morbidities that might contributed to the differences in ADAM9 gene expression observed between the groups. It would be necessary to read many of the cited papers in order to obtain this information. The microarray results do not appear to have been validated by performing real-time qPCR studies (for example) on any of the samples. In the in vitro studies, details on the concentrations and incubation times for the agonists have not been provided in the methods, text or legends. It is possible that the concentrations and time points studied were not optimal for detecting increases in ADAM9 gene expression. Data presentation: All of the results have been presented in the manuscript However, in general more details about the experimental conditions in the figure legends would have been helpful to the reader. Discussion and conclusions: The discussion section could be expanded to include a discussion of the limitations of the study. The discussion could have included a section on how the changes in ADAM9 gene expression detected in blood leukocytes might influence the pathogenesis of progression of the diseases that were studied based upon the known activities of this proteinase.
