This is an excellent pioneering piece of work which presents an authoritative overview of a representative mutation analysis (300 pathogenic variants in over 150 monogenic disorders) in a large cohort of Omani patients. Methodology is state of the art, collaboration with colleagues at Charite Berlin commendable and results which are important for DNA diagnostics in the Omani population, and beyond. The conclusions, are relevant and directly applicable. I fully approve this article without any comments to the Authors. Importantly, data are also freely accessible online.
