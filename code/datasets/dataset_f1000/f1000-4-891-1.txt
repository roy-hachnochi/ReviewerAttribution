Its useful to have region/country specific databases that present a better representation of the prevalence and incidence of region specific diseases and health issues. Putting such data in context of whats known globally shall help in better interpreting whats peculiar to local population and possibly raise some interesting questions on why so? For example, is it the genetic structure or something in the environment? Some specific comments follow: Authors mention existence of tribal structures, consanguineous marriages etc in Omani society. Is it possible to delineate the effects of these factors on the reported mutations? For example, is this reported in the papers that the authors have collated data from and have the authors noted this aspect in their database? How does the mutation data reported here compare with mutation patterns or frequency seen in other populations? Do the authors provide information on this or link out to other similar resources from other countries? If a physician in Oman is looking up some mutation from this database and wants to know if this is something specific to Oman or is a more general mutation found in other populations too, would this information appear automatically in the database; or could they perform a manual search of the database? Do the authors want to comment about any data privacy issues that maybe associated with such a database, if any and to what extent? Are there any attributes on quality of data in the database? perhaps based on the technique used in the original paper or some other measure some quality metric can be assigned to the mutation information recorded in the database? It would be helpful if authors were able to illustrate out a case or two on how they expect a doctor in Oman to be able to use this database in a real clinical setting; to illustrate the usefulness of the database from a simple collection of data to something that can be used on a more regular basis by doctors in clinical setting.
