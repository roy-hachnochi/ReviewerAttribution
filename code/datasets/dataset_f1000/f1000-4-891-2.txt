 The paper is well-written and though it does not present any new findings, it can be used as a reference database for Omani mutations. There are a few suggestions for the authors: a. Standard HGVS nomenclature should be followed for all the mutations and the authors should preferably stick to one format i.e. either DNA or protein notation. There is no uniformity in the present nomenclature followed in Table 2. b. Number of patients in whom each mutation was found, should be indicated this would give an idea about any preponderance of specific mutations in this population. c. Functional validation studies, if available, or at least the mutation prediction scores should be mentioned for the novel sequence variants identified, which will help create a comprehensive database of new likely-pathogenic variants. Again, if the number of patients in whom each of these novel variants were identified is mentioned, we will get an idea as to whether these novel variants were present in more than one case and we can get further proof of the pathogenicity of these mutations. d. It would also be interesting to see if there is any ethnic group-wise preponderance of genetic diseases or mutations in the various subsets/ tribes/ regional groups that constitute the Omani population.
