In many institutions, the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) subject examinations are used as a performance metric for medical students and this study was conducted to see if a structured review session might improve scores on the exam. The authors used a mandatory 1.5-hour structured review session in the last week of each 4-week psychiatry clerkship (September 2014 and July 2015) and the primary outcome measure was a comparison of scores on the NBME psychiatry subject exam before and after the interventional period. The sample size was reasonable for a study of this type with 83 students in the experimental period and 176 in the historical control period. As might be expected, there were statistically significant improvements in mean score (p=0.03), mean for the two lowest scores in each group (p0.0007), and percentage of students scoring 70 or less (p=0.03) in the experimental, interventional arm. Interestingly, the percentage of students achieving the maximum possible score (99) was higher in the experimental group, but did not reach significance (p=0.06). The authors concluded that "an end-of-clerkship review session led to increased mean scores on the NBME psychiatry subject examination, particularly for students at the lower end of the score range." These results suggest what is intuitively known but deserves emphasis: 1) structured, scheduled, mandatory, review is helpful in improving performance on standardized testing of the same or similar core content; 2) timeliness and proximity of the review to the testing may improve performance in the short term but this study (and many similar study designs) do not speak to long term retention and sustainability; and 3) multiple barriers exist in the status quo that might limit implementation or generalizability including the usual suspects (time, money, resources).
