This article reports on a study of the impact of a structured review session at the end of a 4-week clerkship for third year medical students on psychiatry examination performance, over a 10-month period. Examination scores are compared with historical controls over the same period of time in the previous 2 years. Significant improvements were reported for overall scores and the lowest scoring students. The intervention appeared to be of value. The authors recommend further research for other medical specialties and in other institutions. This appears justified. The differences in scores were small but significant. No ethical approval was required for the present small study but may be needed if more intricate study designs are used, including randomisation of larger numbers possibly through the use of cluster randomisation. The authors could provide some suggestions. They address the limitations in the present study well.
