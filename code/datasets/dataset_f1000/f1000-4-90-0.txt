The article by Gilbert-Kawai and co-workers presents the design of Xtreme Everest 2 expedition, which looks like a continuation of the first Caudwell Xtreme Everest expedition led in 2007. They present a complete description of protocols and groups of subjects. Part of the experiments concern classical domains already explored by many scientific expeditions (exercise capacity, hemglobin, ventilation, heart rate variability, etc..). Some aspects are more interesting and original, such as epigenetics, microcirculation, study of twins and Sherpas, although some important information are lacking concerning, for example the tissue studied for epigenetics, if Sherpas are involved in the epigenetic study, etc. Altogether, we can hope that a lot of new data will be available for a better understanding of physiological responses to hypoxia, and a greater number of publications than for the first Xtreme Everest expedition is expected. The argument that was often put forward to justify this extremely complex and costly type of experimental design is that it might be of great value for patients suffering from critical illnesses associated with hypoxia. I think this argument is unnecessary. The study of normal persons exposed to hypoxia is, by itself, very interesting and worthwhile, and does not need any justification. Applications to patients of what will be found is probable but impossible to predict.
