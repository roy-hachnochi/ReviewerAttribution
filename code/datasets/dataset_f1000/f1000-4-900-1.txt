Regarding the paper, it is a fairly straightforward description of a software package, containing all the things that such a paper should have - a description of the goals, the implemented methods, the hardware and software dependencies (systems on which the software has been tested), some guidance on usage, pointers to the software and documentation, and references. Regarding the software, I did download and build the software, which seemed to work, other than a fair number of warnings. I was not able to successfully test the software, however, due to issues in https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/v2.0/user/install.html#run-the-tests Does this mean I should not approve the article? Or should I ask the authors for help in understanding the error and hold off on submitting this report? I would have liked to have chosen "Approved with reservations" for the status of this review, but my reservations are with the F1000 system for this type of paper, not with this specific paper, so in fairness to the authors, given the lack of clarity of what I should be doing as a reviewer for a software paper, I approve this paper based on its quality as a good description of the software, and not on the quality of software (and related documentation) itself.
