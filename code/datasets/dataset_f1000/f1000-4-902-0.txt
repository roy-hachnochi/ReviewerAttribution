This article describes the use of a commercial vertebrate-specific antibody available from Cell Signaling Technologies to detect the site-specific (Thr56) phosphorylated form of the C. elegans ortholog of elongation factor 2 in lysates generated from the worms by western blotting. The specificity of the antibody is demonstrated using efk-1 knock out worms. Importantly, it is also established that no other kinase in C. elegans phosphorylates eEF2 on Thr56, thus, its phosphorylation can be used as a proxy for elk-1 (the eEF2K ortholog) activity. It should be noted that this is a proxy however and does not directly measure elfk-1 activity. Changes in phospho-eEF2 can come about because of changes in phosphatase levels. The technical aspects are well described. This appears to be a very useful tool for analyzing phospho-eEF2 levels in C. elegans .
