This paper describes two siblings with microcephaly and developmental delay, who were found to have compound heterozygous variants in the TRMT10A gene. Biallelic mutations of TRMT10A have recently been reported in individuals with microcephaly and abnormalities in glucose homeostasis. Seeing that only a small number of individuals reported with this condition to date, this paper adds additional insights into this condition. The technique used in this paper is standard whole-exome sequencing. Though the manuscript does not include functional studies of the identified TRMT10A variants, these variants are predicted to lead to a premature truncation of the protein and are therefore likely to be pathogenic. I have following comments and suggestions: It would be helpful to include the actual physical measurements (not just standard deviations) for the affected individuals. It is not explicitly stated which individuals in the family had exome sequencing done and if the TRMT10A variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Even though there seems to be only one protein isoform for TRMT10A in the public databases, the ID of the reference sequence used for annotation of the mutations should be included. There are several differences in clinical manifestation between the affected individuals described in this manuscript and those previously reported. Specifically, the individuals described herein do not have obvious alteration of glucose homeostasis. Also, the cerebral white matter signal abnormalities on brain MRI have not been reported previously. These features are clinically important, and it would be helpful to discuss these points more in depth.
