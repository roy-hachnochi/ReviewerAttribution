This is an excellent review covering recent findings on beneficial effects of coffee on liver cirrhosis. The authors reviewed the relevant clinical and epidemiological data and suggested an inhibitory role of caffeine on adenosinergic signaling in hepatic stellate cells. Caffeine inhibits adenosine receptors. Contrary to this notion, the authors mentioned that antagonists for the receptors inhibit the protective effect of caffeine on portal hypertension-related complications on page 6. Please check whether antagonists for adenosine receptors inhibit the beneficial effects of caffeine in the liver. Are there papers showing adenosine receptor signaling in hepatic stellate cells? Does the inhibition the receptor suppress activation of hepatic stellate cells or induce their cell death? Caffeine has been shown to induce autophagy in hepatocytes. Is it possible that activation of autophagy in hepatocytes indirectly mediates the activation state of hepatic stellate cells in the liver? Please indicate Table 1 in the text.
