This very interesting opinion article provides a proposal from the Authors of an algorithm to help guide the anesthetic management of patients with unsatisfactory labor epidural analgesia that require cesarean delivery. It is a clear, concise, substantiated suggestion on how to approach a difficult clinical scenario. I feel it would be useful for the reader to receive more specific information/authors opinion on the definition of analgesic window and its clinical implications, and on the doses of anesthetics chosen in the various situations described. There might be a typo in the title for Figure 3, which may be changed to "Category 3 and 4 Cesarean Delivery".
