The article describes the development and validation of the screening cascade for selective RET kinase inhibitors used to identify selective inhibitors described in Ref 1. The rationale for pursuing selective RET inhibitors is clearly explained, and the clinical limitations of current pan-kinase inhibitors that inhibit RET laid out. The methods section has a well described rationale and is sufficiently detailed. The analysis of the data is sound and appropriate conclusions drawn. In particular, the method has accounted for the kinetics of binding, through time course experiments, and the possible impact of RET mutations in cell line studies. The cascade developed adequately demonstrates selective cellular RET inhibition (POM). A good correlation is demonstrated between RET potency in vitro and growth inhibition in cell line models and this is taken as evidence of proof of mechanism. References 1.
