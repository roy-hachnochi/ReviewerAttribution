This article presents a screening cascade for the identification of potent RET inhibitors with selectivity against VEGFR2 (KDR) that will be of general interest in the field. The background to the research is well described, and the methods sufficiently detailed to allow others to replicate the experimental procedures and the conclusions are balanced. Points EGFR is wrongly defined as ‘endothelial growth factor’ ..toxicity …resulting from off-target kinases . Should be on-target inhibition of non-RET kinases? … non-pharmacological toxicities…. Should be pharmacological toxicities associated with inhibition of non-RET targets? VEGF treatment does not affect levels of pRET Hek293 is more commonly HEK293 ‘marvel’ is non-standard Figure 1. Error bars not defined, n=??. Should state this is RET enzyme assay Figures 2, 3, Suppl 2. Not stated what points represent [individual compounds??] Table 1. Confidence Interval values would be helpful as a surrogate of reproducibility, and support the claim of robustness, as reproducibility not specifically reported Table 1. Suggest including IC 50 values for MZCRC1 cell proliferation above line for toxicity margin Figure 4. Not clear why some arrows in figure are there. Eg Arrow from in vivo PK to MZCRC1 POM/POP assay, or double-headed arrow from in vivo PK to in vitro DMPK Suppl Figure 1. No error bars (n=??)
