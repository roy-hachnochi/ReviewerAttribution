As described by the authors, they have reconsidered their statistical analysis but the main message of the article remained the same. These changes do not address my concerns expressed regarding the first version of the article. "The authors have raised an interesting question. However, they need to define a more specific study hypothesis and calculate the sample size needed for analyzing that hypothesis. The current study design and sample size does not allow for drawing any reliable conclusions." Therefore, I am sorry to renew my concerns. I consider this study as valuable hypothesis-generating work. However, there are several reasons that should keep the authors from drawing the conclusions stated in the article: The current work was not hypothesis-driven research Consequently, no sample size / power calculation was made Making multiple statistical analyses based on 21 patients with anemia will result in some positive findings/correlations (maybe just by chance) and many negative findings (maybe just because the sample size is dramatically inadequate). At its current state, I cannot recommend to publish the revised version of the article. I could support publication if the findings were presented as hypothesis-generating but with the clear statement that the study lacks power for drawing valid conclusions.
