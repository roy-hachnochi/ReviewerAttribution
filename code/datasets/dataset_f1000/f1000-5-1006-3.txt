 Title and Abstract : More or less acceptable. I would suggest adding some details about the general life quality of the patients. Article content : Please give details about the general conditions of the patients including: i) data about other diseases (cardiac and not cardiac as well); ii) status when they arrived at the hospital and how was their status when leaving the hospital; was there post hospitalization care or not, and if yes what were the results. Conclusions : Insufficiently short. Please supplement with information and comments about some comparative details of other studies in this field.
