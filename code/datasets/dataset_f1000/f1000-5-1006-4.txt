The authors have assessed the prevalence of anemia in a cohort of 50 patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (AHF), and also assessed the existence of a correlation between anemia and the severity of the clinical picture. They found anemia in 21/50 patients but no correlation of anemia with other factors related to severity and prognosis of AHF. They conclude that this finding is suggestive of an independent role of anemia in influencing the clinical picture and prognosis of AHF. The study by Frigy et al may serve as an interesting pilot study for a larger prospective study. However, the current sample size is insufficient for drawing any reliable conclusion on the prevalence of anemia in patients with AHF, and on the influence of anemia on course and outcome of AHF. Given the small sample size, it is not meaningful to perform multiple statistical analyses. And the small sample size should keep the authors from rejecting a possible correlation between anemia and other factors related to severity and prognosis of AHF. And the final conclusion remains unclear to me: why does the lack of statistical correlation between anemia and other factors related to severity and prognosis of AHF suggest an independent role of anemia in influencing prognosis of the disease? The authors have not studied prognosis and outcome at all. The authors need to define the study question more specifically: what is (are) the outcome(s) they are looking for in the population of patients with acute heart failure? Based on a specific study question and hypothesis, the authors need to perform a sample size calculation. It will be interesting to read the results of that adequately sized study. The authors have raised an interesting question. However, they need to define a more specific study hypothesis and calculate the sample size needed for analyzing that hypothesis. The current study design and sample size does not allow for drawing any reliable conclusions.
