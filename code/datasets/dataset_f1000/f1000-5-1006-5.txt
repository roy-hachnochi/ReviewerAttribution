This article addresses the prevalence of anemia amongst patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (AHF) and the existence of a correlation between anemia and the severity of the clinical picture. The manuscript is well written, but I have some concerns on certain points. Below are more specific comments by section: Introduction: More information about the purpose of the topic addressed would provide welcome context, i.e. the relevance of the study conducted. A bit more detail about anemia and acute heart failure would also be helpful in order to understand better the relevance of the potential correlation addressed; Methods: They may be some reservations concerning the data size: a small sample of data was used in order to conduct this study. On the other hand, more information regarding the methods used and how the study was specifically conducted would also be insightful; Discussion and conclusions: A poor discussion and conclusions are presented. Thereby, the results should be discussed in more detail, i.e. the results presented in Table 1. For instance, a more specific discussion could be done regarding the most relevant parameters presented in Table 1, i.e. parameters in patients with and without anemia. Overall, I consider this study interesting but more information regarding certain topics seems undoubtedly needed in order to complete and clarify some crucial points addressed throughout this paper.
