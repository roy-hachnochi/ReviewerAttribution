This article discusses a re-analysis and subsequent re-interpretation of a previously published study on the important topic of PTSD in adolescence. The authors argue the imputation method used in the original article is flawed and I agree with their objections. The scientific method is supposed to to be self-correcting; the lucid problem analysis and subsequent solutions presented in this article and decision to disseminate it through a platform like F1000Research are examples of "open science" practices that will enable us to achieve this goal for our discipline.
