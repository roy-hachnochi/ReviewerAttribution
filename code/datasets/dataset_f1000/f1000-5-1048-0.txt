Forensic science needs a multidisciplinary approach and requires knowledge from different areas such as sciences of life and death, natural sciences, technology and law from students. In fact, its complexity demands new pedagogical methodologies, in view that conventional classes based on datashow presentations and complementary studies in multiple bibliography sources do not seem to be effective in the learning process. Based on this context, the discussion raised by the authors is completely valid and their arguments seem to be logical. Certainly this teaching strategy is much more laborious, however, it can generate contemporary knowledge for both professors and students, providing the opportunity to receive other experts opinions on the covered topic. We believe that the authors could enrich the discussion if more results about the teaching methodology were presented, including the studentâ€™s opinion, which would enhance the manuscript and strengthen this practice. In addition, the process of teaching and learning could also be improved with the presence of professionals in the area, as forensic experts. Their experience acquired in cases resolution could be taken to the classroom, which would be an opportunity for students to apply the acquired theoretical knowledge in real forensic cases. Students could discuss about the proposed problem, presenting their hypothesis and revealing their understanding. In the end, the case resolution could also be presented in the form of a forensic case report and submitted to the peer review process. By doing so, the subject would present theoretical and practical strenght.
