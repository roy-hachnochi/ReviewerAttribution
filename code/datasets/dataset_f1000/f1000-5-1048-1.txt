The reflection provided in this article is scientifically solid and sound. The abstract summarizes well the contents of the published work and, although the title is appropriate, it carries some ambiguity about what exactly the review process refers to. This would probably require a rather long and inconvenient title and, therefore, the current one seems appropriate. The paper is of a reflective nature, but outlines clearly the problem, the particular solution that was undertaken in an attempt to solve it, and some of the results. It would have been interesting to read more details about the results of the peer-review process itself and the actual impact in the classroom, but this is perhaps a first attempt at materializing some of the authors’ thoughts and experience that will be developed further in other publications or reports. The conclusion consolidates the authors’ opinion that peer-review as a pedagogical tool enhances the connection between scientifically generated knowledge and forensic practice in a higher education setting. As an article that focuses on the teachers’ wishes to improve on lecture delivery quality and teachers’ pedagogic accountability, it successfully outlines a classroom approach that has much to offer. I am certain that many teachers will be looking forward to knowing more about the learning outcomes of this approach and will give it strong consideration as a pedagogical tool.
