The report of using click chemistry to label the protein of LH2 and core complex is interesting, however I have not been convinced by the data from spectroscopy nor biochemistry that can show the existence or the formation of a dimeric form of the LH2 or core complex polypeptides. The absorption spectra in Figure 4 resemble very much with the spectra of the native LH2 or core complex polypeptides. The B820 dimeric form was not there. CD spectrum might be a useful method to know.
