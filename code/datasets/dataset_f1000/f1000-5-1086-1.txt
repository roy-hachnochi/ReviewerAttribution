In this manuscript, Gabele et al . reported the structure of YejL and preliminary X-ray crystallographic characterization of the periplasmic domain (Residues 241-586) of YejM, an inner membrane protein potentially responsible for transport of glycerophospholipid cardiolipin. The authors also tested interaction between YejL and YejM using blue native gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography. In general, it is an interesting study, yet the following issues need to be addressed before accepted for indexation: It is not proper to claim that YejL is a ligand of YejM. “Ligand” is dedicated for “receptors” only. Also, there is no strong genetic evidence to show that YejL is involved in cardiolipin transport. The authors claimed that YejM is a dimer based on its periplasmic domain, and probably, also because of YejL forming a dimer. This is not clear as the authors did not study the oligomerization state of the full-length YejM . Other than this, when running SEC on superpose 6, the authors did not include a standard marker for reference. It ishard to judge if the periplasmic domain of YejM forms a dimer in solution. The author believed that the negative charge surfaces of YejL might bind with the arginine-rich loop of YejM. Why the fragment of YejM (241-586) that seems to not include the arginine-rich loop still binds YejL ? Please explain.
