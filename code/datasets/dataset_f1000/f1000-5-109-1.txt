Identifying and validating biomarkers from easily accessible body fluids such as peripheral blood for early (pre-radiographic) detection of osteoarthritis (OA), or at least OA susceptibility, are of key importance in the field. The authors of this manuscript aimed to analyse gene expression levels associated with joint effusion in two cohorts of patients either in the Genetics, Arthrosis and Progression study (GARP) or in the Rotterdam study (RS). This is a very well presented and conducted study, with results that may hopefully advance the field. In my opinion, the major limitation of this study (which is actually stated and recognised by the authors as well) is that the two cohorts on which the study was performed are very different in nature; GARP is a cohort of clinical OA cases, whilst RS is a population-based study. This might be the reason as to why the top 5 genes in the two cohorts were different. Perhaps it would be useful to check whether the top genes in the GARP study (in which more than 50% of the subjects had OA) have any predictive value for pre-radiographic OA in the RS study. This question could of course only be answered over time. Following on the comment of the first referee regarding the inflammatory/non-inflammatory OA phenotypes, it would also be interesting to see whether the same GO pathways would be identified if patients with inflammatory/non-inflammatory OA were separately analysed.
