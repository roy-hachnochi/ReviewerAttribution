This short report provides a simple and concise illustration of some of the issues surrounding multiple comparisons in statistical testing. I see nothing wrong with the logic or the mathematics, and can see that this would make a valuable contribution as an assigned text on an introductory statistics course. The only suggestion I have for material that could be added would be to include a citation to additional material on the topic of multiple-comparisons correction for the interested reader. This would make the piece more valuable as a teaching aid. I'd suggest adding a couple of sentences to the discussion along those lines and citing a review paper on the topic, such as Curran-Everett, 2000 1 Couple of minor points: The paragraph after table 1 starts 'For intuition,'. This seems an odd phrase to me. Maybe replace with 'Intuitively' or 'For the purposes of familiarity...' or something like that. Just before the general equation the phrase 'across n die' appears on its own, as a separate paragraph. An error? Or is this supposed to be a subtitle? References 1.
