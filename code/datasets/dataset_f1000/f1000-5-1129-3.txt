The author provides a novel demonstration of the increasing probability of spurious research results when performing multiple tests: noticing the equivalence of a p = .05 statistical threshold and a d20 die (as used in popular games), the author goes on to describe changes in probabilities when using multiple dice, or when allowing multiple sides of the die to count as a correct result. The aim of this article, as I understand it, is to demonstrate that these changes have a surprisingly large influence on statistical hypothesis testing, and at the same time to provide a hands-on example that many readers might be able to relate to (in the form of the d20 die). The article is well-written and in my opinion fulfills both of these goals. Its rationale and the mathematical derivations seem to be sound and correct. I can easily see this article being used by educators to teach the topic of spurious statistical results and to make the topic more accessible. I have some minor edits/recommendations to increase the overall clarity and readability of the article: When the game name "Dungeons Dragons" is first mentioned in the introduction, it should be followed by a citation of the game's publisher, year of publication, and, if necessary/appropriate, copyright information. A d6 die is described as "regular" in the text. This term seems ambiguous to me and I recommend replacing it with a term such as "cube-shaped," "classical," or "conventional." The current version of the manuscript appears to contain a printing error: before the last paragraph of the "mathematical derivations" section, the sentence fragment "across n die." is printed without context. I recommend the indexing of this article after these minor issues have been addressed, and I hope the author will continue to produce research notes that highlight statistical issues in an approachable manner.
