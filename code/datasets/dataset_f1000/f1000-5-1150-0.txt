In the manuscript entitled " MEPPitope: spatial, electrostatic and secondary structure perturbations in the post-fusion Dengue virus envelope protein highlights known epitopes and conserved residues in the Zika virus", Sandeep Chakraborty analyzed the pre- and post-fusion DENV type 2 envelope (E) protein, and identified several known epitopes, which are conserved in ZIKV and all DENV serotypes. Perturbations of spatial and electrostatic or secondary structure identified by a combination of different computational methods help to detect critical residues that can be made target of therapies. Overall, the paper provides interesting data. The paper could be improved by addressing the following points: The title is too long and needs to be shortened. There are some new antibodies against ZIKV or DENV reported recently, the paper would benefit by adding new information. α 5 and 6 are not labeled in Figure 1. In the section of “conflicting data in comparison to previous studies” line 9, the statement “… from another E-protein of the same subunit” is inaccurate as subunit refers to a single polypeptide chain.
