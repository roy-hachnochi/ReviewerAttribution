The author performed an essential structural analysis of ZIKV and DENV envelope proteins and reported the identification of unreported epitope residues with conservation details. The quality of writing and analysis is acceptable with some minor corrections. The text is not much visible in Figure 6 and has to be revised. In the caption of figure 5, it should be "192-195" instead of "192-95". Title should be shortened. The first sentence in the "Analysis of secondary structures" has to be revised to ensure that the analysis only performed for envelope proteins.
