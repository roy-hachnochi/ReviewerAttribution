In general manuscript is very well written, language is good, citations are up to date, writing is to the point, in scope of the journal, justified Introduction , very well described Materials and methods , very well presented and discussed Results , Quality of figure is good and legends are well described, Good points raised in Discussion , Data is provided. I am personally satisfied with the paper and I would like to congratulate authors of good work. I wanted to mention some points but most of those have been already addressed by the other reviewer (Otto Geiger). I agree with Dr Geiger's publicly available comments, especially: Addressing "why Escherichia coli is used at all in this study as a reference strain?". Minor comments. I would like to request authors to please address these before final submission. Thanks.
