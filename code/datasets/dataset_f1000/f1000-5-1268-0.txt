The current MS is a good case study showing the efficiency of the DNA barcoding in study the diversity of different groups of organisms. I have some comments to improve the MS: The sample size is very small to conduct any diversity measure. All gene names should be italic. How many mg was the starting material for DNA extraction? I was expecting to see more taxonomic identification in this work. Also it will be great if the authors can add some information about the habitation of these tested species. I suggest to the author to do some phylogenetic comparisons between CO1 and 16S not only with the species tested in this work but also other species of the same genus or other species of the same family to enrich the study more.
