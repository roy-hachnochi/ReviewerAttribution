The authors contribute to the knowledge of species of freshwater fish of interest in Nigeria, whose diversity is poorly known, to using molecular tools that complement the difficult morphological studies by the shortage of taxonomists and lack of reliable morphological characters for discriminating species. Confirm the usefulness of COI, especially, to discriminate phylogenetically close taxa, although there is some overlap between the intraspecific and interspecific variation, which partially obscures the delimitation of species. The number of samples involves a remarkable effort, aimed at improving the accuracy of the results. Minor suggestions are given: In the expression " Tilapia (Coptodon) " Coptodon seems a subgenre of Tilapia . One could say “ Coptodon , previously included in Tilapia” In the third paragraph of the introduction, second line, should write the name of the genus Clarias and not its abbreviation, C., because it could be confused with the name of the other gender that also begins with C, Coptodon . In the second paragraph, second line of PCR and DNA sequencing item, add a space between 10 and μL after point. In the body of Table 1 labels the fifth row are not necessary. You should delete the row. Table 4 does not include data for H: number of different types sequences; K: average number of nucleotide differences within the population. Add the data in the table. In the paragraphs where the authors compare the sequences of COI and 16S rRNA with those published in GenBank, the term species use instead of specimens. Then replace species by specimens in all cases. Figure 1 and 2: numbers are unclear and are above the lines.
