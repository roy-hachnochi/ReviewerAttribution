This paper constitutes a valuable contribution to the literature. The title appropriately represents the article and the abstract nicely summarises the content of the paper. All components of the article have been explained to a high standard and are appropriate to the authors' assessment of the mind mapping tool as an appropriate digital methodology for the ECOUTER engagement process. The conclusions drawn are balanced and justified given the assessments made. I would encourage the authors to consider elaborating on the following minor points for clarity: The paper states that the participants' remain anonymous to both the other participants and also the researchers. However, when implementing ECOUTER online using Mind42, an account is generated for the participants using their email address (which often includes participants' names). Can the administrator see who has registered? Can they see which participants are saying what and if they are part of the research team do they think this has any impact on the study? How can it be assured that the seeded ECOUTER mind map is unbiased and representative of the current state of the literature/debate on the topic? On page 3 (column 2, paragraph 3) the authors state that the facilitator moderates contributions. Could they very briefly clarify what this involves? In the discussion and conclusions, they list 5 successfully implemented pilot studies, the last of which is stated to be running from May to November 2016. Is this year correct? If so, I would exercise caution in calling something that was only set up one month ago and is set to run for another five months "successful". Well done to the authors on a very interesting initiative and a good assessment of the strengths and limitations of their current approach.
