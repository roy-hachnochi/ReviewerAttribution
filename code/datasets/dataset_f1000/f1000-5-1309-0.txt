I started my review by trying to reproduce the vignette example. I also made sure that all documentation was present in the reference package PDF, which was the case. As stated in the paper, the Riboprofiling package has to be installed under R version 3.3 minimum. I installed the latest version at the date of review, which was 3.3.1+ BioC 3.3. I started by the installation of the Riboprofiling package, which posed no problem. I am not proficient with existing pipelines, and did not verify if Riboprofiling is more complete than them. However, I found that an R implementation is nice since most users will be familiar with its installation, organisation and mode of use and won’t have to find other tools elsewhere. I have a few remarks on the installation and on the vignette example: I had to install the Bioconductor Rsamtools which was not installed alongside Riboprofiling, while other dependencies were installed. After running the covData - riboSeqFromBAM(listInputBam, genomeName="hg19 ), I obtained the following warnings. Not sure if they impact the final result, but I nevertheless report them. Warning messages: 1: In riboSeqFromBAM(listInputBam, genomeName = "hg19") : paramScanBAM parameter is not a ScanBamParam object. Set to default NULL value! 2: In doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler) : [knet_seek] SEEK_END is not supported for HTTP. Offset is unchanged. 3: In doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler) : [bam_header_read] EOF marker is absent. The input is probably truncated. 4: In countShiftReads(exonGRanges[names(cdsPosTransc)], cdsPosTransc, : Param motifSize should be an integer! Accepted values 3, 6 or 9. Default value is 3. 5: In doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler) : [knet_seek] SEEK_END is not supported for HTTP. Offset is unchanged. 6: In doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler) : [bam_header_read] EOF marker is absent. The input is probably truncated. 7: In countShiftReads(exonGRanges[names(cdsPosTransc)], cdsPosTransc, : Param motifSize should be an integer! Accepted values 3, 6 or 9. Default value is 3. In the vignette page 5, I would add the statement library(GenomicAlignments) before the readGAlignments call in order to make the code easier to work.. Vignete page 6. The instruction txdb - TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene does not work. I do not have a TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene object in my session. I couldn’t go further in running the provided tutorial. Could you clarify on how to obtain that object ? Apart from the vignette, the paper itself is well written and can be followed simply through. An analysis case of ribosome stalling study is presented through a complete example and R code (analysis of Woolstenhulme et al dataset). The code works without problem until the invocation of library(BSgenome.Ecoli.NCBI.K12.MG1655). I couldn’t get this package on the Bioconductor Web Site, and some clarification might be helpful for this step. Minor remark: The authors missed a couple of references in the last paragraph: (...) either using more specialisez riboseq tools such as (XXX, YYY) or directly within R.
