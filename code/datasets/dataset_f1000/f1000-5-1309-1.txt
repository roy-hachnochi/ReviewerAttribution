RiboProfiling allows a number of ribo-seq specific analyses to be carried out using a single Bioconductor package in R and is supported by instructions in the corresponding reference and 'package' manuals. The automatic assignment of the P-site from either the 5' or 3' end of the ribosome footprint read is a useful feature. In addition the tool allows the quantification of the distribution of footprints across coding regions (CDS), 5' leader and 3' trailer regions at the metagene and individual gene transcript level. The authors use the reported stalling events in the Woolstenhulme et al., 2015 1 ribo-seq data to illustrate how RiboProfiling can be used to determine the ribosome occupancy on multiple codon motifs. Overall, the RiboProfiling package allows some ribo-seq specific analyses to be automatically carried out using the RiboProfiling 'quick command' or by using the step-by-step commands. However I would argue that RiboProfiling is not more complete than existing tools. There is no assessment of triplet periodicity for example. The quality assessment carried out by RiboProfilig is the distribution of footprint read lengths (Figure 1). While determining the read lengths in a ribo-seq dataset is a useful assessment, it is only one determinant of the quality of ribo-seq data. The RUST tool (O'Connor et al. 2015 2 ) as mentioned by the authors carries out normalisation of the data, but also allows for the quality of the ribo-seq and mRNA-seq data to be determined in terms of sequencing biases. Nevertheless, RiboProfiling adds to the repertoire of publicly available ribo-seq tools which is useful to the community. Questions: In the manuscript the abbreviation TSS is used for Translation Start Site. However, on page 6 of the RiboProfiling manual “aroundPromoter: returns the genomic positions flanking the transcript start site (TSS) for the x% (3% default value) best expressed CDSs”. Should this be Translation start site? It is not clear what the authors mean by tools such as (XXX, YYY) ' in the following sentence in the Summary section 'Following the overview of Ribo-seq experiments with ‘RiboProfiling, the output tables can then be easily integrated into more specialized dowstream analyses, either using more specialisez riboseq tools such as (XXX, YYY) or directly within R.' (There are also some typo errors in this sentence (dowstream; specialisez). While following the instructions in the RiboProfiling manual, there were several operations for which I was missing the required library (e.g. library(Rsamtools), library(GenomicAlignments), library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene), etc). While it might be obvious which additional libraries are required after running the command, it may help users if they were specified in the manual along with library(RiboProfiling). I ran the 'quick start' riboSeqFromBAM function on one of our own datasets and four plots were generated fine. However, the 'list of per ORF per codon coverage' was not output. Should this have been generated as stated in the manual? What read lengths are considered in the RiboProfiling 'quick command' approach for the offset determination? On our own dataset the sumUp offset plot was generated showing an offset of -13 (which corresponds to our own estimation). However, this plot did not show the individual read lengths. Are read lengths sharing the same offset value used? All of the step-by-step commands in the user manual ran fine on our own dataset and the corresponding plots were generated. However, there was an error when I tried to run the accompanying scriptWoolstenhulme_Defp2.R to generate the barplot in Figure 4B of the average ribosome occupancy on PP(X) motifs in the E.coli dataset (see further). So unfortunately I was unable to verify this part of the manuscript. According to the manual, “consecutive motifs of 9 nucleotides (3 consecutive codons) overlap on 6 nucleotides. The Ribo-seq coverage is reported as the coverage on the 2nd codon in the motif considered as being in the P-site.” Is the average pause score in Figure 4B for ribosome occupancy of the second codon (P) or the last codon (X) or across the three codons? The scriptWoolstenhulme_Defp2.R is hard-coded for the PPX motif and E.coli. I did not get to check if it can be easily adapted for other codon motifs in other datasets. Below I provide a sub-set output of the scriptWoolstenhulme_Defp2.R with the error. If the sessionInfo() details can help troubleshoot the error, I can send it to the authors separately so as not clog up this report. ….
