Thank you for asking me to review this manuscript. While the topic is interesting, the methods are limited, especially when considering the manuscript tried to make causal assertions. The methods were not very sophisticated and rather vague. Information on the sample was not included. There are many covariates (age, gender, year in school, length of time on Facebook, mental health history, etc.) that needed to be included in the analysis. The findings don't make a significant enough of an impact on the knowledge base.
