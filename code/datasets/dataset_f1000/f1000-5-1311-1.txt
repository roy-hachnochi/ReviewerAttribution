The study is well designed and the author addressed the limitations and future research direction of the study very well. However, the manuscript lacks significantly in summarising previous research in align to this research.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Thank you for asking me to review this manuscript. While the topic is interesting, the methods are limited, especially when considering the manuscript tried to make causal assertions. The methods were not very sophisticated and rather vague. Information on the sample was not included. There are many covariates (age, gender, year in school, length of time on Facebook, mental health history, etc.) that needed to be included in the analysis. The findings don't make a significant enough of an impact on the knowledge base. Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed. I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to state that I do not consider it to be of an acceptable scientific standard, for reasons outlined above. reply Respond to this report Responses (0)

 Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article: Approved - the paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested Approved with reservations - A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit. Not approved - fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Click here to access the data. The problem Spreadsheet data files may not format correctly if your computer is using different default delimiters (symbols used to separate values into separate cells) - a spreadsheet created in one region is sometimes misinterpreted by computers in other regions. You can change the regional settings on your computer so that the spreadsheet can be interpreted correctly. How to fix it Save downloaded CSV file Open spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel) Click the tab at the top Click the From text icon (top left) Browse for downloaded CSV file, click Ensure radio button is selected, click Check one of the appropriate delimiter checkboxes (you can visualize the formatting by looking at the data preview below these options) Click Downloaded data do not display as expected?
