This is an interesting report of a clinical audit conducted to assess the implementation of UK BASHH guidelines on Post Exposure Prophylaxis following sexual exposure. The paper provides a clear summary of the methods and results compared to national guidelines. The recommendations and subsequent actions taken following the results are of interest to the audience. Further clarification in some sections could enhance the key message of the paper. In places the grammar and language could be improved. Comments and considerations for the authors: Method Please provide further geographical detail (region, country) to allow the audience to understand the context of the setting. Consider rewording the sentence regarding permission. As secondary data has been used no patient consent was needed but how was confidentiality maintained, was the data anonymised? Did you seek any ethical approval or institutional approval? Note Excel is not a classic database, please revise to spreadsheet, unless alternative database was used for analysis. Results Consider using 'performed' or 'conducted' in place of 'done'. Table 2. The article focuses on prophylaxis from sexual exposure, it is not clear why needle stick injury is included in this data set. If this is the case, please specify why included. Please review the data presented in the table for accuracy. Do you have any detail on the ARVs prescribed and how adherent the individuals were?
