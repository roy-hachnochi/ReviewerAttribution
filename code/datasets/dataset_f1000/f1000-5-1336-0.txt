In this study Contino present their WGS analysis of 9 (verified) oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines. This is an adequate platform to present these data and the fact that the authors make all raw BAM files easily accessible to the community means that this study is particularly valuable to colleagues looking to contrast cell lines with particular genomic aberrations or different neo-antigenic burdens. Such studies always come with the known caveats of in vitro selection and the authors rightfully acknowledge this. As expected, the study in large part confirms earlier large scale sequencing studies of primary material. The lack of a patient-specific reference control means that the impact of more subtle genomic abnormalities in for example regulatory regions remain difficult to study. Nonetheless this work represents a valuable addition to previously published datasets and the authors are to be commended for publishing this analysis. The paper is terse and I enjoyed reading this study.
