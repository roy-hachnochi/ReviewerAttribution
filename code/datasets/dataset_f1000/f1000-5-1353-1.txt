The paper by Pereira and co-workers addresses an relevant issue: to bring to public some data about the hospitalization rates of MS patients in Portugal. There are no methodological errors but, in my opinion, some changes should be introduced: About Introduction when the authors say that the epidemiological data in Portugal are limited I cant agree. Portugal is a small country of about 10 million people and 3 prevalence studies and 1 incidence study published bring data enough for a knowledge of the basic epidemiological picture of MS in the country. There is of course other missing data (for instance mortality data/ burden of the disease for the society) but these are often missing in other countries. I considered changing saying for instance that though prevalence and incidence in MS in Portugal are now known, other epidemiological data about the disease are still lacking. The author stay that they have found a "decrease in MS related hospitalizations..... from 2008 to 2013". In fact they have only these two dates for comparison. They have no data among these two years so that some variability can not be excluded. In Portugal there are a great diversity of neurological care. Central Hospitals in Lisbon, Oporto and Coimbra treat MS in ambulatory but in other Towns: vora,Beja, Leiria, Covilh, Santarem, for example patients are admitted for treating relapses with Methyl, and for Natalizumab infusion because Day-Hospital units are not available. This should be taken in consideration in discussion and could certainly explain why there are so many short-time admissions
