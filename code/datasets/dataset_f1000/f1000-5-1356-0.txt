I appreciate that the authors have made an effort to address my comments and I'm particularly happy to see that my suggestion to check the overlap of tuQTLs with splice site binding sites reveals an improved enrichment by DRIMSeq. I also understand now the decision you took about not using the 'SummarizedExperiment' class. For the future development of DRIMSeq you may want to consider using the MultiAssayExperiment class ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/MultiAssayExperiment ) that allows multiple assay types over multiple sample sets. The authors say that it is not worth made a comparison with Cufdiff because in the study by Soneson 1 et al. (2016), where both authors of DRIMSeq were involved, Cudiff was very conservative in detecting differential isoform/transcript usage (DTU). In that paper the authors assess DTU by switching the two most abundant isoforms and show that Cufdiff has a low true positive rate (TPR) at small magnitudes of the difference in relative abundance between the two most abundant isoforms per gene. However, in Supplementary Figure 10 of that paper, the authors show that at larger magnitudes of that difference, the TPR of Cufdiff improves substantially while correctly controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). In this paper the authors assess DTU following the same strategy of switching the two most abundant isoforms and I think it would be again very interesting to see how Cufdiff and DRIMSeq compare at different magnitudes of the change in isoform usage. The authors also argue that Frazee 2 et al. (2014) find that Cuffdiff is very conservative. However, as far as I understand that paper, Frazee and co-workers are not evaluating DTU but differential transcript expression (DTE), and therefore, in my view, the experiments conducted on that paper do not warrant the conclusion that Cufdiff is overly conservative for DTU. The authors decided not to perform an enrichment analysis of tuQTLs on ESEs and ESSs because Lalonde 3 et al. (2011) concluded that ESE predictions themselves are a poor indicator of the effect of SNPs on splicing patterns. However, Lalonde and co-workers scored ESE motifs with ESEfinder 3.0 (Cartegni 4 et al. 2003), a method based on SELEX experiments conducted about 10 years ago and I would expect some advance in this field in the last decade. A recent study that seems to successfully use more recent ESE and ESS data to assess their enrichment with respect to polymorphisms is Supek 4 et al. (2014). While these two aspects remain, in my opinion, open, I think the statistical model of DRIMSeq proposed for DTU makes a lot sense and people interested in addressing biological questions that involve DTU should give it try, and I'm happy to approve the paper.
