In this first revision of the manuscript, “GPR21 KO mice demonstrate no resistance to high fat diet induced obesity or improved glucose tolerance”, the authors have addressed many of the concerns related to the addition of detail to the Materials and Methods section. However, the authors have not addressed the potential impact of differences in methodology between their physiological assessments and those of Gardner, et al and Osborne, et al . For example, they did not verify GPR21 KO in hypothalamic or brain tissue and they did not attempt to replicate the gender, diet or even OGTT methods from either study. Instead their methods were somewhat of a hybrid of the Gardner and Osborne studies and did not conduct any form of in-depth metabolic analysis. Therefore, although their data certainly does suggest that the Deltagen KO strategy did involve changes in Rabgap1 expression, it is difficult to claim that Rabgap1 reduction explained the phenotype of the Deltagen GPR21 KO mice if the physiological measures were not obtained in the same way as the two studies in question. For these reasons, it would seem that the authors should discuss the caveats to their own study in the Next Steps section along with the suggestion to other investigators that GPR21 KO may not have been responsible for the metabolic phenotype observed by Gardner et al and Osborne, et al .
