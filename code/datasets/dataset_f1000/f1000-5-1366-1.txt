The paper describes Kinase Knowledgebase (KKB), i.e., a database containing structure-activity data on kinases. The current data note briefly presents the KKB Q1 2016 Release and the appended eight kinase data sets, which are made hereby publicly available. Kinases are valuable targets for many diseases, especially cancers. The subject is of real scientific. In general, the amount of bioactivity data, coming from various sources (scientific literature, high-throughput screening results, patents etc), is heterogeneous and a proper curation and standardization of the data can provide reliable activity points. These data may be employed in many ways as described by the authors. In my opinion, the main applications for a database such as KKB would be to build predictors to search the chemical space for new kinase inhibitors, and further to optimize the selectivity of kinase inhibitors. Currently, ChEMBL’s 1 publicly available Kinase SARfari ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/sarfari/kinasesarfari ), provides a standard source for these tasks, covering about 532155 bioactivity data points i.e., version: 6.00- accessed June 20, 2016. This is less than one third of the 1.8 million KKB activity data point reported by the authors. In these circumstances, KKB might add valuable information for kinase research. Finally, the future analysis and employment of the eight data sets made freely available in the current note will provide a clearer view of the potential and versatility of KKB. There would be two minor observations: The methodology used to generate the data is described in the first paragraph in the section entitled “Kinase Knowledgebase (KKB)”. In order to be more accessible for the reader, this paragraph should be encompassed in a separate section named “Materials and methods”. In Table 2 there are three columns with repeated headers. In order to remove any doubts, I would recommend the authors to clarify this issue. Otherwise, the data note is well written, kinases are indexed using the widely adopted Uniprot IDs and the references are updated. I recommend this data note for indexation and would like the authors to address the minor observations. References 1.
