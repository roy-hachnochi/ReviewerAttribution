This communication revealed that treatment of rats with the LXR/RXR agonists bexarotene and T0901317 increased the brain levels of apoE but had no effect on the levels of Ab40. A key issue which is not yet resolved in this paper, and which I believe is important, is whether the present treatments with the LXR/RXR agonists in the rat result in partial/weak activation of the LXR/RXR system which affects the levels of apoE but not of the other related readout parameter ( i.e. Ab40 in this case) or that the LXR/RXR system is robustly activated by the presently employed paradigm but that this does not affect the levels of Ab40. Assessment of the "on target" effects of such pharmacological manipulations is important for determination of the significance and meaning of the Ab40 related negative finding and for addressing and reconciling difference between this study and previous reports (eg ref 12 of Suon et al 2010). Accordingly, we suggest that the expression of additional LXR\RXR driven genes be monitored ( eg ABCA1 by either western blots or PCR) and if possible also Ab42. The Suon study was performed utilizing a forebrain + hippocampus brain extract of 1 month old rat. The possible role of differences in these parameters in mediating the differences between the effects of the RXR\RXR treatment in the Suon study and the present manuscript should be discussed.
