In this manuscript, Wang and colleagues report that treatment for 3 and 7 d bexarotene (Bex, an RXR agonist) or T0901317 (TO, an LXR agonist) induce an increase in apoE levels and but have no effect on Aβ40 in the CSF and brain of rats. While the subject matter is timely, the conclusions must be taken with reservations because of three major concerns: Limited readouts and regions analyzed. It has been previously demonstrated that changes in the levels of Aβ40 and apoE in CSF and brain do not always correlate with efficacy in FAD-Tg mice 1 , 2 . Furthermore, it has been shown that an increase of apoE levels by Bex can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the isoform of apoE 3 or the brain region analyzed 3 . The exclusion of Aβ42. It has been reported that CSF Aβ42 levels, and not Aβ40, are increased in AD patients compared to controls 4 . Comparison to previous reports. Suon and colleagues (2010) 5 treated rats with LXR agonists TO (at the same dose) or GW3965 and reported an increase in apoE that correlated with an increase in Ab40/42 levels in CSF and a reduction of Aβ40 in brain 5 . Wang and colleagues should reconcile their results with this work specifically and interpret their work in the context of the filed in general. A minor observation is that in Figure 1A the vehicle is mislabeled as Vehicle 3 (should be Vehicle 4 for TO901317) Within the AD field, there is an ongoing discussion of the effects of Bex on soluble and deposited Aβ levels in the brain and cognition, with contradictory findings. This is likely due to several confounding factors, including: variance within and across models and inconsistencies in the methods used to characterize and quantify the proteins of interest, particularly soluble Aβ. It is imperative to take these parameters into account when considering the efficacy of RXR or LXR agonists for AD therapeutics. As well, a phase I trial of Bex in AD patients recently concluded 6 . While these results may be of limited significance and were not available for the submission of this manuscript, inclusion of their results in a revision of the Discussion would be helpful.
