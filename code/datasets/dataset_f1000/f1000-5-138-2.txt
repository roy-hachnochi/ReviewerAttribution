Some controversy has surrounded the report in Science from Landreth and colleagues showing that bexarotene reduces the brain amyloid plaque burden from APP transgenic mice by 50% or more in a matter of days. Several groups of experts attempted to replicate the dramatic Landreth results but the dramatic results were not replicatable. The current F1000Research paper extends that replication attempt story by treating rats with bexarotene and then measuring APP metabolites and apoE in CSF. In agreement with the "second wave" of bexarotene studies, there was no effect of bexarotene on CSF levels of Aβ40 or Aβ42. The one point of agreement of all studies was that bexarotene does indeed modulation CSF levels of apoE. This argues against the development of bexarotene mimetics as Aβ lowering agents for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease. However, inasmuch as elevating apoE may be beneficial in clinical situations via a non-Aβ-dependent pathway (see http://www.alzforum.org/news/research-news/bexarotene-revisited-improves-mouse-memory-no-effect-plaques ), bexarotene does reproducibly modulate CSF levels of apoE. The discovery of the entity of SNAP (for review, see Jack et al., 2016 1 ) indicates that about one-third of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's patients undergo cognitive decline via some as yet unknown non-Aβ-dependent pathway.

Continue reading Wang et al . have reported that they have failed to replicate the ability of bexarotene to clear soluble amyloid from the brain. The reason they failed is straightforward. This experiment has been repeated 6 times. This specific issue has been nicely summarized in a paper published by Tesseur and De Strooper (2013) , who were authors of one of the ‘Comments’ on our Science paper. I draw your attention to the summary table in that paper. The reason Amgen was unable to reproduce our results was that they used the wrong drug formulation. We used the clinically approved formulation of bexarotene (Targretin TM ), which is a microcrystaline form of the drug. Those laboratories who used this formulation found drug-induced ApoE expression and lowered Abeta levels. Those studies that solubilized the drug prior to administration failed to replicate the published results. The micronization of bexarotene results in very different pharmacokinetic compared to solubilized drug, which was clearly documented by Chen et al. (2014; Fig 8a) and in the FDA filings. The micronized form of the drug is slowly absorbed in the gut and results in sustained plasma (and brain) levels of the drug, whereas the solubilized drug is rapidly absorbed and cleared. The reason this is important is based on the well known mechanisms of nuclear receptor action. Nuclear receptors, like RXR, are ligand-activated transcription factors. Ligand binding to the receptor results in assembly of chromatin remodeling machinery on the enhancers and promoters of its target genes, resulting in epigenetic modifications that open chromatin structure, allowing induction of gene expression. This process takes time, thus there must be sufficiently high drug levels over an extended interval in order for this to be achieved. The formulation issue was explicitly discussed in the literature and the FDA filing for bexarotene and was detailed on our ‘Response’ to the ‘ Comments’ in Science ( Landreth et al., 2013 ). The Amgen scientists (and others) clearly did not make an effort to understand and replicate the original study design, nor appreciate the importance of the formulation of the drug as it relates to nuclear receptor action. Although the Amgen study was narrowly focused on ApoE and soluble Abeta 40 and did not examine other aspects of our work, the same considerations apply to other contested outcomes of our study. The Amgen study employed wild type Sprague-Dawley rats, whereas all other studies with bexarotene used murine models of AD. A study of the LXR agonist TO9001317 in rats that was similar to that of Amgen was published by Merck ( Suon et al. , 2010 ) and was only partially replicated in the Amgen study and was not cited. Our work on bexarotene has led to clinical examination of its effects in Alzheimer’s disease. Cummings and colleagues published the outcome of a phase II study of bexarotene in mild to moderate AD patients last week ( Cummings et al. , 2016 ). While bexarotene treatment did not have a demonstrable effect in individuals possessing an ApoE4 allele, individuals that did not have an ApoE4 gene (representing about 80% of the population) exhibited a robust reduction in brain amyloid with a parallel appearance of Abeta42 in plasma. Thus, a brief 30 day treatment altered two canonical biomarkers of AD in patients with diagnosed disease. These findings are consonant with a recent case report reporting cognitive improvement with bexarotene treatment ( Pierrot et al. 2015 ). I hasten to add that the small study size precludes making any hard conclusions from this trial and they should be interpreted cautiously. However, these preliminary clinical findings support and validate our original report using mouse models of the disease. I don't think the Amgen study adds anything to what was previously known. The work has a logical flaw that undermines the conclusion that they were unable to repeat our study outcomes, including the use of a different model. I think this study is emblematic of the problems associated with reporting ‘failure to replicate’ findings in studies that do not genuinely reproduce the published work.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This communication revealed that treatment of rats with the LXR/RXR agonists bexarotene and T0901317 increased the brain levels of apoE but had no effect on the levels of Ab40. A key issue which is not yet resolved in this paper, and which I believe is important, is whether the present treatments with the LXR/RXR agonists in the rat result in partial/weak activation of the LXR/RXR system which affects the levels of apoE but not of the other related readout parameter ( i.e. Ab40 in this case) or that the LXR/RXR system is robustly activated by the presently employed paradigm but that this does not affect the levels of Ab40. Assessment of the "on target" effects of such pharmacological manipulations is important for determination of the significance and meaning of the Ab40 related negative finding and for addressing and reconciling difference between this study and previous reports (eg ref 12 of Suon et al 2010). Accordingly, we suggest that the expression of additional LXR\RXR driven genes be monitored ( eg ABCA1 by either western blots or PCR) and if possible also Ab42. The Suon study was performed utilizing a forebrain + hippocampus brain extract of 1 month old rat. The possible role of differences in these parameters in mediating the differences between the effects of the RXR\RXR treatment in the Suon study and the present manuscript should be discussed.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions In this manuscript, Wang and colleagues report that treatment for 3 and 7 d bexarotene (Bex, an RXR agonist) or T0901317 (TO, an LXR agonist) induce an increase in apoE levels and but have no effect on Aβ40 in the CSF and brain of rats. While the subject matter is timely, the conclusions must be taken with reservations because of three major concerns: Limited readouts and regions analyzed. It has been previously demonstrated that changes in the levels of Aβ40 and apoE in CSF and brain do not always correlate with efficacy in FAD-Tg mice 1 , 2 . Furthermore, it has been shown that an increase of apoE levels by Bex can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the isoform of apoE 3 or the brain region analyzed 3 . The exclusion of Aβ42. It has been reported that CSF Aβ42 levels, and not Aβ40, are increased in AD patients compared to controls 4 . Comparison to previous reports. Suon and colleagues (2010) 5 treated rats with LXR agonists TO (at the same dose) or GW3965 and reported an increase in apoE that correlated with an increase in Ab40/42 levels in CSF and a reduction of Aβ40 in brain 5 . Wang and colleagues should reconcile their results with this work specifically and interpret their work in the context of the filed in general. A minor observation is that in Figure 1A the vehicle is mislabeled as Vehicle 3 (should be Vehicle 4 for TO901317) Within the AD field, there is an ongoing discussion of the effects of Bex on soluble and deposited Aβ levels in the brain and cognition, with contradictory findings. This is likely due to several confounding factors, including: variance within and across models and inconsistencies in the methods used to characterize and quantify the proteins of interest, particularly soluble Aβ. It is imperative to take these parameters into account when considering the efficacy of RXR or LXR agonists for AD therapeutics. As well, a phase I trial of Bex in AD patients recently concluded 6 . While these results may be of limited significance and were not available for the submission of this manuscript, inclusion of their results in a revision of the Discussion would be helpful.
