The authors have adequately addressed my comments. It is interesting to note that a Google Scholar search for "[search term] preprint" does not restrict results exclusively to preprints. While an advanced search in Google Scholar for articles published in only preprint servers would likely circumvent this, it is far more cumbersome to list all preprint servers in a Google Scholar advanced search (along with any new preprint servers that are developed) than to use search.Biopreprint (which will do this automatically). With the addition of a sort by date feature, this tool and associated bookmarklet will be an essential addition to the workflow of researchers.
