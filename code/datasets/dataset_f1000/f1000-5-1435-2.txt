The opinion paper by Tuk provides an overview of the inhibitory system involved in neural signal transduction. Based on an extensive review of the literature the author provides a number of challenging but well-reasoned hypotheses about the impact of this system on both neuromuscular and neurological diseases. This potential connection may have important implications for the understanding and future treatment of these so far (almost) untreatable diseases. Only few minor points should be addressed. The use of the term ‘inhibitory system’ is somewhat confusing – the context is often not specified (inhibitory system of what…) although the author means neural signal transduction – however, this should be mentioned where relevant and certainly in the title. The link between GABA production by intestinal bacteria and gut GABA receptor stimulation could be further addressed as it provides a way how other factors such as food or the gut microbiome may modulate GABA response (see also reference 47 and later work of these authors like Bravo et al. (2011). The literature is well reviewed and the paper is supported by 5 useful Tables, 2 clear Figures and 70 references of peer reviewed papers – the one Washington Post article may be better mentioned in the text.
