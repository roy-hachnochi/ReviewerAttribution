RNAseq is easily one of the most prevalent NGS experiment types and edgeR one of the most heavily used tools for analyzing the results of these experiments. Given that, I'm quite pleased to see this article from Chen and colleagues that provides a very convenient walk-through of how to perform a typical analysis, including pathway and GO enrichment. I have no real reservations regarding this article. Below I'd like to point to a few parts of the paper that could use caveats or further explanation. The example experiment has only two samples per group. That suffices in some circumstances, but at least in my experience the lay reader has the unfortunate habit of reading too much into the the number of samples used in papers like this and then trying to use that as justification for similar sample numbers for their much lower effect size experiments. A caveat or note of warning to those new to RNAseq would have been nice. There's typically filtering done, such as the "rowSums(cpm(y) 0.5) = 2" in this paper. It would have been nice to include some recommendations regarding how to choose a filtering threshold. The p-values produced by goana() and topKEGG() are presumably unadjusted for multiple testing. It would have been nice if there had been a note to not then use the typical 0.05 cut off. While playing around with the code presented in the paper, I noticed that the choice of 0.01 for the "inter.gene.cor" parameter in camera() has a drastic affect on the resulting p-values. It would be incredibly useful to know when one should override the default value and how one should then derive an appropriate value. My concern is primarily that many will see these commands as "the one true method" for performing such an analysis and blindly apply the option in cases where it might not be appropriate.
