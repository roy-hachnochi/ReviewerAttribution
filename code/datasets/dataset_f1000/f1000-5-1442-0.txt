The authors present a clear description of how to use Docker to add tools to the CyVerse Discovery Environment. As a relatively recent development, Docker is having a major impact on the way many businesses deploy and update software for exactly the reasons described in the article. Clearly, the scientific use case is just as compelling in providing a way to deploy different tools on the same machine where they may have incompatible dependencies. The steps for Dockerizing a tool and the various sample Dockerfiles provide a helpful guide to the whole process in the context of the CyVerse infrastructure.
