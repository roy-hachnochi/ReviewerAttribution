In this Software Tool Article, how the CyVerse Discovery Environment has been extended to integrate custom/user-provided (bioinformatics) applications using Docker. The article is clean and concise, contains several examples and downloadable data/code to recapitulate the described use cases. As an application note, the article provides an informative entry point for professional users and tool developers to get acquainted with CyVerse DE. In general, reproducibility is a very topical issue in various fields of life science research, and the use of approaches such as Docker-based environments present one way of tackling this. In this sense, the present article and the tool(s) it describes are timely and of use for the community. My only (minor) criticism is that in some parts the authors use jargon and overly technical language which might make the text less accessible to non-expert readers ("Dependency Hell", "BWA program", etc.). However, given that the main target audience are arguably bioinformatics tool developers, this is only a very minor point. Overall, I believe that the article and the work presented therein are a useful and constructive contribution to the field, and I am confident that the tools provided may greatly facilitate everyday research work for a wide range of potential users.
