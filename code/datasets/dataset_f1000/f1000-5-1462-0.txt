Interesting case of an "axonal GBS" syndrome occurring shortly after epidural anesthesia, in a patient with a number of health problems. I assume that the patient could also have developed a nutritional axonal polyneuropathy due to her poor health condition. The authors claim that light chain amyloidosis was excluded after negative Congo red staining. Which tissue was studied ? Amyloid neuropathy unlikely because of the rate of onset, and stability of deficit afterwards.
