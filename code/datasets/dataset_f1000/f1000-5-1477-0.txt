We thank the authors for their clarification of all the points that we have queried and for their revisions of the text. We are content to approve the paper fully now and congratulate the authors on an interesting contribution to the scientific literature. We note that the authors have used and interpreted the Kappa statistic as 'moderate to good' in the abstract and results, but called it 'high' consistency in the discussion. We think this apparent discrepancy is acceptable as for some elements, e.g. temperature the kappa statistic was very good. We provide below a reference for the interpretation of the Kappa statistic for those who might require it. 1 References 1.
